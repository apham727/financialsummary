Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations



Business Overview



Activision Blizzard, Inc. is a leading global developer and publisher of interactive entertainment content and services.
We develop and distribute content and services on video game consoles, personal computers (“PC”s), and mobile devices.
The terms “Activision Blizzard,” the “Company,” “we,” “us,” and “our” are used to refer collectively to Activision Blizzard, Inc. and its subsidiaries.
The Company was originally incorporated in California in 1979 and was reincorporated in Delaware in December 1992.
In connection with the 2008 business combination by and among the Company (then known as Activision, Inc.), Vivendi S.A, and Vivendi Games, Inc., then an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of Vivendi S.A., we were renamed Activision Blizzard, Inc.



Our Segments



Based on our organizational structure, we conduct our business through three reportable segments, as follows:



(i) Activision Publishing, Inc.



Activision Publishing, Inc. (“Activision”), is a leading global developer and publisher of interactive software products and entertainment content, particularly for the console platform.
Activision primarily delivers content through retail and digital channels, including full-game and in-game sales, as well as by licensing software to third-party or related-party companies that distribute Activision products.
Activision’s key product franchise is Call of Duty®, a first-person shooter for the console and PC platforms.
Also, on October 1, 2019, in collaboration with Tencent, Activision released Call of Duty: Mobile for the mobile platform, including for Google Inc.’s (“Google”) Android and Apple Inc.’s (“Apple”) iOS.
In 2010, Activision entered into an exclusive relationship with Bungie, Inc. (“Bungie”) to publish games in the Destiny franchise.
Effective December 31, 2018, Activision and Bungie mutually agreed to terminate their publishing relationship related to the Destiny franchise.
As part of this termination, Activision agreed to transfer its publishing rights for the Destiny franchise to Bungie in exchange for cash and Bungie’s assumption of on-going customer obligations of Activision.
Activision no longer has any material rights or obligations related to the Destiny franchise.
(ii) Blizzard Entertainment, Inc.



Blizzard Entertainment, Inc. (“Blizzard”) is a leading global developer and publisher of interactive software products and entertainment content, particularly for the PC platform.
Blizzard primarily delivers content through retail and digital channels, including subscriptions, full-game, and in-game sales, as well as by licensing software to third-party or related-party companies that distribute Blizzard products.
Blizzard also maintains a proprietary online gaming service, Blizzard Battle.net®, which facilitates digital distribution of Blizzard content and selected Activision content, online social connectivity, and the creation of user-generated content.
Blizzard also includes the activities of the Overwatch LeagueTM, the first major global professional esports league with city-based teams, and our Major League Gaming (“MLG”) business, which is responsible for various esports events and serves as a multi-platform network for Activision Blizzard esports content.
Blizzard’s key product franchises include: World of Warcraft®, a subscription-based massive multi-player online role-playing game for the PC platform; StarCraft®, a real-time strategy franchise for the PC platform; Diablo®, an action role-playing franchise for the PC and console platforms; Hearthstone®, an online collectible card franchise for the PC and mobile platforms; and Overwatch®, a team-based first-person shooter for the PC and console platforms.
(iii) King Digital Entertainment



King Digital Entertainment (“King”) is a leading global developer and publisher of interactive entertainment content and services, particularly for the mobile platform, including for Google’s Android and Apple’s iOS.
King also distributes its content and services on the PC platform, primarily via Facebook.
King’s games are free to play; however, players can acquire in-game items, either with virtual currency or real currency, and we continue to focus on in-game advertising as a growing source of additional revenue.
39

King’s key product franchises, all of which are for the mobile and PC platforms, include: Candy Crush™, which features “match three” games; Farm Heroes™, which also features “match three” games; and Bubble Witch™, which features “bubble shooter” games.
Other



We also engage in other businesses that do not represent reportable segments, including:



•the Activision Blizzard Studios (“Studios”) business, which is devoted to creating original film and television content based on our library of globally recognized intellectual properties, and which, in September 2018, released the third season of the animated TV series Skylanders™ Academy on Netflix; and



•the Activision Blizzard Distribution (“Distribution”) business, which consists of operations in Europe that provide warehousing, logistics, and sales distribution services to third-party publishers of interactive entertainment software, our own publishing operations, and manufacturers of interactive entertainment hardware.

Since certain of our games are hosted online or include significant online functionality that represents a separate performance obligation, we defer the transaction price allocable to the online functionality from the sale of these games and then recognize the attributable revenues over the relevant estimated service periods, which are generally less than a year.
Net revenues and operating income for the three months ended September 30, 2019, include a net effect of $68 million and $53 million, respectively, from the recognition of deferred net revenues and related cost of revenues.
Content Release and Event Highlights



During the three months ended September 30, 2019, Activision released SpyroTM Reignited Trilogy on Nintendo Switch and PC, and Blizzard released World of Warcraft® Classic, a re-creation of the pre-expansion version of the game, and the latest expansions to Hearthstone—Saviors of UldumTM and Tombs of TerrorTM .

Operating Metrics



The following operating metrics are key performance indicators that we use to evaluate our business.
Net bookings and In-game net bookings



We monitor net bookings as a key operating metric in evaluating the performance of our business.
Net bookings is the net amount of products and services sold digitally or sold-in physically in the period, and includes license fees, merchandise, and publisher incentives, among others.
Net bookings is equal to net revenues excluding the impact from deferrals.
In-game net bookings primarily includes the net amount of downloadable content and microtransactions sold during the period, and is equal to in-game net revenues excluding the impact from deferrals.
Net bookings and in-game net bookings were as follows (amounts in millions):

Net bookings



Q3 2019 vs. Q3 2018



The decrease in net bookings for the three months ended September 30, 2019, as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2018, was primarily due to:



[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]



•a decrease in Activision net bookings of $188 million driven by (1) lower net bookings from the Destiny franchise (reflecting our sale of the publishing rights for Destiny to Bungie in December 2018), and (2) lower net bookings from the Call of Duty franchise catalog titles.
YTD Q3 2019 vs. YTD Q3 2018



The decrease in net bookings for the nine months ended September 30, 2019, as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2018, was primarily due to:

In-game net bookings



Q3 2019 vs. Q3 2018



The decrease in in-game net bookings for the three months ended September 30, 2019, as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2018, was primarily due to a decrease in Blizzard and Activision in-game net bookings of $183 million and $113 million, respectively, due to the same drivers discussed for net bookings above.
YTD Q3 2019 vs. YTD Q3 2018



The decrease in in-game net bookings for the nine months ended September 30, 2019, as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2018, was primarily due to:



[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]



•a decrease in Activision in-game net bookings of $254 million driven by (1) lower in-game net bookings from the Destiny franchise and (2) lower in-game net bookings from the Call of Duty franchise, primarily driven by catalog titles.
Monthly Active Users



We monitor monthly active users (“MAUs”) as a key measure of the overall size of our user base.
MAUs are the number of individuals who accessed a particular game in a given month.
We calculate average MAUs in a period by adding the total number of MAUs in each of the months in a given period and dividing that total by the number of months in the period.
An individual who accesses two of our games would be counted as two users.
For Blizzard, an individual who accesses the same game on two platforms or devices in the relevant period would generally be counted as a single user.
The number of MAUs for a given period can be significantly impacted by the timing of new content releases, since new releases may cause a temporary surge in MAUs.
The following table details our average MAUs on a sequential quarterly basis for each of our reportable segments (amounts in millions):



[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]



Average MAUs decreased by 11 million, or 3%, for the three months ended September 30, 2019, as compared to the three months ended June 30, 2019, primarily driven by a decrease in average MAUs for King.
The decrease in King’s average MAUs is primarily due to decreases from the Candy Crush franchise.
The slight increase in Blizzard’s average MAUs is due to an increase in average MAUs for World of Warcraft, largely offset by lower average MAUs for Hearthstone.
Average MAUs decreased by 29 million, or 8%, for the three months ended September 30, 2019, as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2018.
The year-over-year decrease in average MAUs is due to:



•decreases across King’s various franchises, other than Candy Crush, primarily from less engaged users leaving the network, partially offset by an increase in average MAUs for the Candy Crush franchise, primarily driven by the launch of Candy Crush Friends SagaTM in the fourth quarter of 2018;



43

•lower average MAUs for Activision, primarily due to the absence of Destiny MAUs in our operating metric and lower average MAUs from the Call of Duty franchise; and

Management’s Overview of Business Trends



Interactive Entertainment and Mobile Gaming Growth



Our business participates in the global interactive entertainment industry.
Games have become an increasingly popular form of entertainment, and we estimate the total industry has grown, on average, 18% annually from 2015 to 2018.
The industry continues to benefit from additional players entering the market as interactive entertainment becomes more commonplace across age groups and as more developing regions gain access to this form of entertainment.
The wide adoption of smart phones globally and the free-to-play business model on those platforms has increased the total addressable audience for gaming significantly by introducing gaming to new age groups and new regions and allowing gaming to occur more widely outside the home.
Mobile gaming is estimated to be larger than console and PC gaming, and continues to grow at a significant rate.
King is a leading developer of mobile and free-to-play games, and our other business units have mobile efforts underway that present the opportunity for us to expand the reach of, and drive additional player investment from our franchises, such as the October 2019 launch of Call of Duty: Mobile.
Additionally, we have sold the first 12 teams for the Call of Duty League.
Concentration of Sales Among the Most Popular Franchises



The concentration of retail revenues among key titles has continued as a trend in the overall interactive entertainment industry.
According to The NPD Group, the top 10 titles accounted for 38% of the retail sales in the U.S. interactive entertainment industry in 2018.
For example, the Call of Duty, Candy Crush, and World of Warcraft franchises, collectively, accounted for 58% of our consolidated net revenues—and a significantly higher percentage of our operating income—for 2018.
For example, in 2014, we released Hearthstone, and in 2016, we released Overwatch.
Additionally, to diversify our portfolio of key franchises and increase our presence on the mobile platform, in 2016, we acquired King.
We also have mobile titles in development based on Activision’s and Blizzard’s intellectual property, such as the recently released Call of Duty: Mobile and previously announced Diablo ImmortalTM.
44

Recurring Revenue Business Models



Increased consumer online connectivity has allowed us to offer players new investment opportunities and to shift our business further towards a more consistently recurring and year-round model.
Offering downloadable content and microtransactions, in addition to full games, allows our players to access and invest in new content throughout the year.
This incremental content not only provides additional high-margin revenues, it can also increase player engagement.
Also, mobile games, and free-to-play games more broadly, are generally less seasonal than games developed primarily for the console or PC platforms.
The loss on extinguishment is comprised of a $25 million premium payment and a $15 million write-off of unamortized discount and deferred financing costs.

Consolidated Net Revenues



The following table summarizes our consolidated net revenues, in-game net revenues, and increase (decrease) in deferred net revenues recognized (amounts in millions):

•a decrease in Activision in-game revenues recognized of $219 million, primarily due to lower in-game revenues recognized from the Destiny franchise.
Change in Deferred Revenues Recognized



Q3 2019 vs. Q3 2018



The increase in net deferred revenues recognized for the three months ended September 30, 2019, as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2018, was primarily due to (1) an increase of $120 million in net deferred revenues recognized from Blizzard, primarily due to the prior year period including a net deferral of revenues from World of Warcraft, driven by World of Warcraft: Battle for Azeroth, which was released in August 2018, with no comparable release in 2019 and (2) an increase of $88 million in net deferred revenues recognized from Activision, primarily due to lower net deferral of revenues from the Destiny franchise (reflecting our sale of the publishing rights for Destiny to Bungie in December 2018).
YTD Q3 2019 vs. YTD Q3 2018



The increase in net deferred revenues recognized for the nine months ended September 30, 2019, as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2018, was primarily due to an increase of $237 million in net deferred revenues recognized from Blizzard, primarily due to higher net deferred revenues recognized for World of Warcraft, driven by World of Warcraft: Battle for Azeroth, which was released in August 2018, with no comparable release in 2017.
The increase from Blizzard was partially offset by a decrease of $122 million in net deferred revenues recognized from Activision, primarily due to lower net deferred revenues recognized from the Destiny franchise.
Foreign Exchange Impact



Changes in foreign exchange rates had a negative impact of $27 million and $133 million on our consolidated net revenues for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2019, respectively, as compared to the same period in the previous year.
The changes are primarily due to changes in the value of the U.S. dollar relative to the euro and the British pound.

The decrease in software royalties, amortization, and intellectual property licenses related to subscription, licensing, and other revenues for the three months ended September 30, 2019, as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2018, was primarily due to:



•a decrease of $34 million in amortization of internally-developed franchise intangible assets acquired as part of our acquisition of King; 



•lower software amortization and royalties from Activision of $14 million, driven by the Destiny franchise; and



•lower amortization of capitalized film costs of $12 million given the release of the third season of the animated TV series, Skylanders Academy, in September 2018, with no comparable release in 2019.

Q3 2019 vs. Q3 2018



The decrease in interest and other expense (income), net, for the three months ended September 30, 2019, as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2018, was primarily due to an $11 million decrease in interest expense and amortization of deferred financing costs associated with our debt obligations, due to a decrease in our total debt outstanding as a result of our debt redemptions and repayment activities during 2018.
YTD Q3 2019 vs. YTD Q3 2018



The decrease in interest and other expense (income), net, for the nine months ended September 30, 2019, as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2018, was primarily due to:



•a $49 million decrease in interest expense and amortization of deferred financing costs associated with our debt obligations, reflecting a decrease in our total debt outstanding as a result of our debt redemptions and repayment activities during 2018; 



•a $38 million gain recognized as a result of adjusting a cost-method equity investment to fair value, with no comparable activity in the prior period (refer to Note 8 of the notes to the condensed consolidated financial statements included in Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q); and



•an $11 million increase in interest income due to our cash and cash equivalent balances earning interest at higher rates, along with an overall higher cash balance, in 2019 as compared to 2018.
The income tax expense of $208 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2019, reflects an effective tax rate of 18%, which is higher than the effective tax rate of 2% for the nine months ended September 30, 2018.
This increase was partially offset by a valuation allowance recorded in the prior year with regard to California research and development credit carryforwards (“CA R&D Credits”).
Changes in judgment from the evaluation of new information resulting in the recognition, derecognition, or remeasurement of a tax position taken in a prior annual period are recognized separately in the quarter of the change.

Liquidity and Capital Resources



We believe our ability to generate cash flows from operating activities is one of our fundamental financial strengths.
Our primary sources of liquidity, which are available to us to fund cash outflows such as potential dividend payments or share repurchases, and scheduled debt maturities, include our cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments, and cash flows provided by operating activities.
These cash balances are generally available for use in the U.S., subject in some cases to certain restrictions.
Our cash provided from operating activities is somewhat impacted by seasonality.

Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities



The primary driver of net cash flows associated with our operating activities is the collection of customer receivables generated from the sale of our products and services.
These collections are typically partially offset by: payments to vendors for the manufacturing, distribution, and marketing of our products; payments for customer service support for our consumers; payments to third-party developers and intellectual property holders; payments for interest on our debt; payments for software development; payments for tax liabilities; and payments to our workforce.
Net cash provided by operating activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2019, was $913 million, as compared to $791 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2018.
The increase was primarily due to changes in our working capital resulting from the timing of collections and payments and lower cash spent to support the Destiny franchise (reflecting our sale of the publishing rights for Destiny to Bungie in December 2018).
This increase was partially offset by lower net income and a decrease in non-cash adjustments to net income, primarily due to lower amortization on intangible assets related to King and lower amortization of capitalized software development costs and intellectual property licenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2019, as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2018.

Net Cash Provided by (Used in) Investing Activities 



The primary drivers of net cash flows associated with investing activities typically include capital expenditures, purchases and sales of investments, changes in restricted cash balances, and cash used for acquisitions.
Net cash provided by investing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2019, was $79 million, as compared to net cash used in investing activities of $160 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2018.
The increase was primarily due to $153 million of cash proceeds from the maturities of available-for-sale investments, as compared to purchases of available-for-sale investments of $59 million in the prior-year period.
Additionally, capital expenditures of $79 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2019, were lower than the capital expenditures of $97 million for the prior-year period.
Net Cash Used in Financing Activities 



The primary drivers of net cash flows associated with financing activities typically include the proceeds from, and repayments of, our long-term debt and transactions involving our common stock, including the issuance of shares of common stock to employees upon the exercise of stock options, as well as the payment of dividends.
Net cash used in financing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2019, was $251 million, as compared to $2.0 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2018.
The decrease was primarily due to debt repayments, inclusive of premium payments, of $1.8 billion during the nine months ended September 30, 2018, with no comparable repayment activity in the nine months ended September 30, 2019.
The Company paid dividends of $283 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2019, as compared to $259 million during the prior-year period.
Effect of Foreign Exchange Rate Changes



Changes in foreign exchange rates had a negative impact of $24 million on our cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash for the nine months ended September 30, 2019, as compared to a negative impact of $15 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2018.
The change was primarily due to changes in the value of the U.S. dollar relative to the euro and the British pound.
Debt



At both September 30, 2019 and December 31, 2018, our total outstanding debt was $2.7 billion, bearing interest at a weighted average rate of 3.18%.
Dividends



On February 12, 2019, our Board of Directors declared a cash dividend of $0.37 per common share.
On May 9, 2019, we made an aggregate cash dividend payment of $283 million to shareholders of record at the close of business on March 28, 2019.
Capital Expenditures



For the year ending December 31, 2019, we anticipate total capital expenditures of approximately $130 million, primarily for leasehold improvements, computer hardware, and software purchases.
During the nine months ended September 30, 2019, capital expenditures were $79 million.

Leases



As noted in Note 2 of the notes to the condensed consolidated financial statements included in Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, we adopted the new lease accounting standard effective January 1, 2019.
We elected to apply an optional adoption method, which uses the effective date as the initial date of application on transition with no retrospective adjustments to prior periods.
Additionally, we elected to apply the package of transition practical expedients which permitted us to, among other things, (1) not reassess if existing contracts contained leases under the new lease accounting standard, and (2) carry forward our historical lease classifications.
For additional discussion regarding the impact of our adoption of the new lease accounting standard to our condensed consolidated balance sheet, see Note 3 of the notes to the condensed consolidated financial statements included in Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.
