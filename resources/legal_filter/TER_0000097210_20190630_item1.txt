Leases  



In February 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) 



2016-02, 



“Leases (Topic 842)” (“Topic 842”), which requires a lessee to record a 



right-of-use (“ROU”) asset and a lease liability on the balance sheet for operating leases with terms longer than twelve months.
Teradyne adopted this standard and the related amendments (collectively “ASC 842”) on January 1, 2019 and utilized the modified retrospective approach provided by ASU 



2018-11, 



“Leases (Topic 842): Targeted 



Improvements,” that allowed for a cumulative effect adjustment in the period of adoption.
Under this method of adoption, the comparative information in the consolidated financial statements has not been revised and continues to be reported under the previously applicable lease accounting guidance (ASC 840).
Teradyne also utilized the package of practical expedients permitted 



under the transition guidance which included the carry-forward of historical lease classification.
Adoption of ASC 842



 resulted in recording ROU assets and lease liabilities of approximately $50.1



 million and $54.3



 million, respectively.
Operating lease liabilities were calculated using the discount rate on January 1



, 2019



.
The adoption of ASC 842



 did not have a material impact on beginning retained earnings, the consolidated statement of operations, cash flows, or earnings per share.
Under ASC 842, a contract is or contains a lease when Teradyne has the right to control the use of an identified asset.
Teradyne determines if an arrangement is a lease at inception of the contract, which is the date on which the terms of the contract are agreed to and the agreement creates enforceable rights and obligations.
The commencement date of the lease is the date that the lessor makes an underlying asset available for use by Teradyne.
As of June 30, 2019, Teradyne does not have material leases that have not yet commenced.
Teradyne determines if the lease is operating or finance at the lease commencement date based upon the terms of the lease and the nature of the asset.
The lease term used to calculate the lease liability includes options to extend or terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain that the option will be exercised.
For leases commencing after January 1, 2019, the lease liability is measured at the present value of future lease payments, discounted using the discount rate for the lease at the commencement date.
As Teradyne is typically unable to determine the implicit rate, Teradyne uses an incremental borrowing rate based on the lease term and economic environment at commencement date.
Teradyne initially measures payments based on an index by using the applicable rate at lease commencement.
Variable payments that do not depend on an index are not included in the lease liability and are recognized as they are incurred.
The ROU asset is initially measured as the amount of lease liability, adjusted for any initial lease costs, prepaid lease payments, and reduced by any lease incentives.
Teradyne’s contracts often include 



non-lease components such as common area maintenance.
Teradyne elected the practical expedient to account for the lease and 



non-lease components as a single lease component.
For leases with a term of one year or less Teradyne has elected not to record the lease asset or liability.
The lease payments are recognized in the consolidated statement of earnings on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
See Note H: “Leases.”  



C. RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS  



On January 26, 2017, the FASB issued ASU 



2017-04, 



“Intangibles—Goodwill and Other (Topic



 350): Simplifying the Accounting for Goodwill Impairment.” The new guidance removes Step 2 of the goodwill impairment test, which requires a hypothetical purchase price allocation.
Goodwill impairment will be the amount by which a reporting unit’s carrying value exceeds its fair value, not to exceed the carrying amount of goodwill.
All other goodwill impairment guidance will remain largely unchanged.
Entities will continue to have the option to perform a qualitative assessment to determine if a quantitative impairment test is necessary.
Entities will be required to disclose the amount of goodwill at reporting units with zero or negative carrying amounts.
The revised guidance will be applied prospectively, and is effective in 2020.
Early adoption is permitted for any impairment tests performed after January 1, 2017.

See Note I: “Debt” regarding derivatives related to the convertible senior notes.
H. LEASES  



On January 1, 2019, Teradyne adopted ASC 842 using the modified retrospective approach.
Under this method of adoption, the comparative information in the consolidated financial statements has not been revised and continues to be reported under the previously applicable lease accounting guidance (ASC 840).
Adoption of ASC 842 resulted in recording ROU assets and lease liabilities of approximately $50.1 million and $54.3 million, respectively.
The adoption of ASC 842 did not have a material impact on beginning retained earnings, the consolidated statement of operations, cash flows, or earnings per share.
Teradyne has facility and auto leases, which are accounted for as operating leases.
Teradyne’s facility leases are primarily used for administrative functions, research and development, manufacturing, and storage and distribution.
Remaining lease terms range from less than one year to ten years.

I.
DEBT 



Convertible Senior Notes 



On December 12



, 2016



, Teradyne completed a private offering of $460.0



 million aggregate principal amount of 1.25



% convertible senior unsecured notes (the “Notes”) due 



December 15, 2023



 and received net proceeds, after issuance costs, of approximately $450.8



 million, $33.0



 million of which was used to pay the net cost of the convertible note hedge transactions and $50.1



 million of which was used to repurchase 2.0



 million shares of Teradyne’s common stock under its existing stock repurchase program from purchasers of the Notes in privately negotiated transactions effected through one of the initial purchasers or its affiliates conducted concurrently with the pricing of the Note offering.
The Notes will mature on December 15



, 2023



, unless earlier repurchased or converted.
The Notes bear interest from December 12



, 2016



 at a rate of 1.25



% per year payable semiannually in arrears on June 15 and December 15 of each year



, beginning on 



June 15, 2017



.
The Notes will be convertible at the option of the noteholders at any time 



prior to the close of business on the business day immediately preceding 



September 15, 2023



, only under the following circumstances: (1)



 during any calendar quarter beginning after March 31



, 2017



 (and only during such calendar quarter), if the closing sale price of Teradyne’s common stock, for at least 20



 trading days (whether or not consecutive) during a period of 30



 consecutive trading days ending on the last trading day of the immediately preceding calendar quarter is greater than 130



% of the conversion price on each applicable trading day; (2)



 during the five



 business day period after any five



 consecutive trading day period (the “measurement period”) in which the trading price (as defined in the Indenture) per $1,000



 principal amount of Notes for each trading day of the measurement period was less than 98



% of the product of the closing sale price of the Teradyne’s common stock and the conversion rate on each such trading day; and (3)



 upon the occurrence of specified corporate events.
On or after September 15



, 2023



 until the close of business on the second scheduled trading day immediately preceding the maturity date, holders



20

may convert their Notes at any time, regardless of the foregoing circumstances.
The conversion rate is subject to adjustment under certain circumstances.
Concurrent with the offering of the Notes, Teradyne entered into convertible note hedge transactions (the “Note Hedge Transactions”) with the initial purchasers or their affiliates (the “Option Counterparties”).
The Note Hedge Transactions cover, subject to customary anti-dilution adjustments, the number of shares of the common stock that underlie the Notes, with a strike price equal to the conversion price of the Notes of $31.70.
The Note Hedge Transactions cover, subject to customary anti-dilution adjustments, approximately 14.5 million shares of Teradyne’s common stock.
Separately and concurrent with the pricing of the Notes, Teradyne entered into warrant transactions with the Option Counterparties (the “Warrant Transactions”) in which it sold 



net-share-settled (or, at its election subject to certain conditions, cash-settled) warrants to the Option Counterparties.
The Warrant Transactions cover, subject to customary anti-dilution adjustments, approximately 14.5 million shares of common stock.
As of June 30, 2019, the strike price of the warrants was approximately $39.78 per share.
The strike price is subject to adjustment under certain circumstances.
The net cost of the Note Hedge Transactions, after being partially offset by the proceeds from the sale of the warrants, was approximately $33.0



 million.
In connection with establishing their initial hedge of these convertible note hedge and warrant transactions, the Option Counterparties have entered into various derivative transactions with respect to Teradyne’s common stock and/or purchased shares of Teradyne’s common stock or other securities, including the Notes, concurrent with, or shortly after, the pricing of the Notes.
In addition, the Option Counterparties may modify their hedge positions by entering into or unwinding various derivative transactions with respect to Teradyne’s common stock or by selling Teradyne’s common stock or other securities, including the Notes, in secondary market transactions (and may do so during any observation period related to the conversion of the Notes).
The convertible note hedge is considered indexed to Teradyne’s common stock as the terms of the Note Hedge Transactions do not contain an exercise contingency and the settlement amount equals the difference between the fair value of a fixed number of Teradyne’s shares and a fixed strike price.
Because the only variable that can affect the settlement amount is Teradyne’s stock price, which is an input to the fair value of a 



fixed-for-fixed



 option contract, the convertible note hedge is considered indexed to Teradyne’s common stock.
Teradyne assessed whether the convertible note hedge should be classified as equity under ASC 



815-40.
In the Note Hedge Transactions contract the settlement terms permit net cash settlement or net share settlement, at the option of Teradyne.
Therefore, the criteria as set forth in ASC 



815-40



 were evaluated by Teradyne.
In reviewing the criteria, Teradyne noted the following: (1)



 the convertible note hedge does not require Teradyne to issue shares; (2)



 there is no requirement to net cash settle the convertible note hedge for failure to make timely filings with the SEC; (3)



 in the case of termination, the convertible note hedge is settled in the same 



21



Table of Contents 



consideration as the holders of the underlying stock; (4) the counterparty does not have rights that rank higher than those of a shareholder of the stock underlying the convertible note hedge; and (5) there is no requirement to post collateral.
Based on its analysis of those criteria, Teradyne concluded that the convertible note hedge should be recorded in equity and no further adjustment should be made in future periods to adjust the value of the convertible note hedge.
Teradyne analyzed the Warrant Transactions under ASC 815-40, 



“Derivatives and Hedging—Contracts in Entity’s Own Equity,” and other relevant literature, and determined that it met the criteria for classification as an equity transaction and is considered indexed to Teradyne’s common stock.
As a result, Teradyne recorded the proceeds from the warrants as an increase to additional paid-in capital.
Teradyne does not recognize subsequent changes in fair value of the warrants in its financial statements.
The provisions of ASC 470-20, “



Debt with Conversion and Other Options,



” are applicable to the Notes.
ASC 470-20 requires Teradyne to separately account for the liability (debt) and equity (conversion feature) components of the Notes in a manner that reflects Teradyne’s nonconvertible debt borrowing rate at the date of issuance when interest cost is recognized in subsequent periods.
Teradyne allocated $100.8 million of the $460.0 million principal amount of the Notes to the equity component, which represents a discount to the debt and will be amortized to interest expense using the effective interest method through December 2023.
Accordingly, Teradyne’s effective annual interest rate on the Notes will be approximately 5.0%.
The Notes are classified as long-term 



debt in the balance sheet based on their 



December 15, 2023



 maturity date.
Debt issuance costs of approximately $7.2



 million are being amortized to interest expense using the effective interest method over the seven year



 term of the Notes.
As of June 30, 2019, debt issuance costs were approximately $4.8



 million.
The below tables represent the key components of Teradyne’s convertible senior notes: [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 



 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 



As of June 30, 2019, the remaining unamortized discount was $72.8 million, which will be amortized over 4.5 years using the effective interest rate method.
The carrying amount of the equity component was $100.8 million.
As of June 30, 2019, the 



if-converted  value of the Notes was $695.2 million.
Revolving Credit Facility  



On June 27, 2019



, Teradyne terminated its credit agreement



, which Teradyne entered into with Barclays Bank PLC, on April 27, 2015.
The terminated credit agreement



 provided for a five-year, senior secured revolving credit facility of up to 



$350



million.

 warranty on its products, commencing upon installation, acceptance, delivery or shipment.
A provision is recorded upon revenue recognition to cost of revenues for estimated warranty expense based on historical experience.
[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 



23 



Table of Contents 



When Teradyne receives revenue for extended warranties, beyond one year, it is deferred and recognized on a straight-line basis over the contract period.
The balance below is included in short and long-term deferred revenue and customer advances on the balance sheet.
Time-based restricted stock unit awards granted to employees vest in equal annual installments over four years



.
Restricted stock unit awards granted to 



non-employee



 directors vest after a one year



 period, with 100



% of the award vesting on the earlier of (a) the first anniversary of the grant date or (b) the date of the following year’s Annual Meeting of Shareholders.
Teradyne expenses the cost of the restricted stock unit awards subject to time-based vesting, which is determined to be the fair market value of the shares at the date of grant, ratably over the period during which the restrictions lapse.
Performance-based restricted stock units (“PRSUs”) granted to Teradyne’s executive officers have a performance metric based on relative total shareholder return (“TSR”).
Teradyne’s three-year



 TSR performance is measured against the New York Stock Exchange (“NYSE”) Composite Index.
The final number of TSR PRSUs that vest will vary based upon the level of performance achieved from 200



% to 0
