Note 2.Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements



In August 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) No.
2016-15, “Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230), Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments” (“ASU 2016-15”).
ASU 2016-15 provides amendments that address eight specific cash flow classification issues for which there exists diversity in practice: Debt prepayment or debt extinguishment costs; settlement of zero-coupon debt instruments or other debt instruments with coupon interest rates that are insignificant in relation to the effective interest rate of the borrowing; contingent consideration payments made after a business combination; proceeds from the settlement of insurance claims; proceeds from the settlement of corporate-owned life insurance policies, including bank-owned life insurance policies; distributions received from equity method investees; beneficial interests in securitization transactions; and separately identifiable cash flows and application of the predominance principle.
The Company adopted ASU 2016-15 in the second quarter of 2018 on a modified retrospective basis as required by the standard.
The Company’s adoption of ASU 2016-15 did not have a material effect on the Company’s historical Consolidated Financial Statements.
In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU No.
2016-09, “Compensation - Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting” (“ASU 2016-09”).
The Company adopted this standard in the first quarter of 2018 using the modified retrospective approach.
This adoption resulted in a one-time net increase to beginning retained earnings of $70 million, consisting of a $58 million cumulative adjustment for the previously unrecognized windfall tax benefits related to previous vesting and exercises of stock-based awards, and a $19 million cumulative adjustment related to the change in accounting policy for estimated forfeitures and share cancellations, partially offset by a decrease of $7 million for the related tax impacts of change in forfeiture policy.
In addition, upon adoption of the new standard in the Company’s first quarter of 2018, the Company began prospectively reflecting the tax deficiencies and benefits as an operating activity, rather than as a financing activity under the previous standard, in the Company’s Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.
For the three and nine months ended March 30, 2018, the Company recognized excess tax benefits of $46 million and $73 million, respectively, as a component of its income tax expense (benefit).
In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU No.
2016-07, “Investments - Equity Method and Joint Ventures (Topic 323): Simplifying the Transition to the Equity Method of Accounting” (“ASU 2016-07”).
ASU 2016-07 eliminates the requirement to apply the equity method of accounting retrospectively when a reporting entity obtains significant influence over a previously held investment.
The Company adopted this standard in the second quarter of 2018.
The Company’s adoption of ASU 2016-07 did not have a material impact on its Consolidated Financial Statements.
In July 2015, the FASB issued ASU No.
2015‑11, “Inventory (Topic 330) - Simplifying the Measurement of Inventory” (“ASU 2015‑11”), which dictates that an entity should measure inventory within the scope of this update at the lower of cost and net realizable value.
The Company adopted this standard in the first quarter of 2018.
The Company’s adoption of ASU 2015‑11 did not have a material impact on its Consolidated Financial Statements.

 (Unaudited) 



The aggregate purchase price of acquisitions during the nine months ended March 30, 2018 was $99 million in cash, with net assets acquired primarily consisting of developed technology and other intangible assets, of which $61 million was allocated to goodwill.
Goodwill is primarily attributable to the benefits the Company expects to derive from diversifying product offerings to its Data Center Devices and Solutions and Client Solutions end markets as well as the acquired workforce.
Goodwill is expected to be deductible for tax purposes because the acquisitions were structured as asset acquisitions but accounted for as business combinations.
Concurrent with these acquisitions, the Company received $36 million in proceeds on previously outstanding notes receivable due from these acquired entities.
Revenues and earnings related to these acquisitions was not material.
IPR&D is initially accounted for as an indefinite-lived intangible asset.
During the nine months ended March 30, 2018, two IPR&D projects reached technological feasibility totaling $616 million and commenced amortization over an estimated useful life of 4 years.

Financial Instruments Not Carried at Fair Value 



The carrying value of the Company’s revolving credit facility approximates its fair value given the revolving nature of the balance and the variable market interest rate.
For financial instruments where the carrying value (which includes principal adjusted for any unamortized issuance costs, and discounts or premiums) differs from fair value (which is based on quoted market prices), the following table represents the related carrying value and fair value for each of the Company’s outstanding financial instruments.
Each of the financial instruments presented below was categorized as Level 2 for all periods presented, based on the frequency of trading immediately prior to the end of the third quarter of 2018 and the fourth quarter of 2017, respectively.
[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]



(1) Euro Term Loan B-2 outstanding principal amount as of June 30, 2017 was based upon the Euro to U.S. dollar exchange rate as of that respective date.
Cost Method Investments



From time to time, the Company enters into certain strategic investments for the promotion of business and strategic objectives.

Note 5.Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities



As of March 30, 2018, the Company had outstanding foreign exchange forward contracts that were designated as either cash flow hedges or non-designated hedges.
The contract maturity dates of these foreign exchange forward contracts do not exceed 12 months.
In addition, the Company had outstanding interest rate swaps that were designated as cash flow hedges.
The Company determined the ineffective portion and the amount excluded for effectiveness testing associated with its cash flow hedges to be immaterial to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for the three and nine months ended March 30, 2018 and March 31, 2017.
As of March 30, 2018, the amount of existing net gains related to cash flow hedges recorded in AOCI was $28 million.
Over the next twelve months, the Company expects to reclassify the majority of this amount into earnings.
In addition, as of March 30, 2018, the Company did not have any foreign exchange forward contracts with credit-risk-related contingent features.
A change in the fair value of non-designated hedges is recognized in earnings in the period incurred and is reported as a component of Other expense, net.
The changes in fair value on these contracts were immaterial to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for the three and nine months ended March 30, 2018 and March 31, 2017.
The Company accounts for its interest rate swap as a designated cash flow hedge to mitigate variations in interest payments under a portion of its LIBOR-based term loans due to variations in the LIBOR index.
The Company pays interest monthly at a fixed rate and receives interest monthly at the LIBOR rate on the notional amount of the contract.
The effective portion of the change in fair value of this designated cash flow hedge is deferred in Other comprehensive income (loss), net of tax, with any ineffective portion recognized in Other income (expense), net.

Term Loan B-3”).
Loans under the Revolving Facility bear interest, at the Company’s option, at either LIBOR plus an applicable margin varying from 1.125% to 2.000% or a base rate plus an applicable margin varying from 0.125% to 1.000%, in each case depending on the Company’s corporate credit ratings.

The Company will also pay an unused commitment fee on the Revolving Facility ranging from 0.120% to 0.350% based on the Company’s corporate credit ratings as described in the indenture, with an initial fee of 0.250%.

Flash Ventures



The Company’s business ventures with Toshiba Memory Corporation (“TMC”) consist of three separate legal entities: Flash Partners Ltd. (“Flash Partners”), Flash Alliance Ltd. (“Flash Alliance”), and Flash Forward Ltd. (“Flash Forward”), collectively referred to as “Flash Ventures”.
In connection with a settlement agreement with Toshiba in December 2017, the Company entered into a facility agreement (“Y6 Facility Agreement”) with TMC related to the construction and operation of a new 300-millimeter wafer fabrication facility in Yokkaichi, Japan, referred to as “Fab 6”, which is primarily intended to provide cleanroom space to continue the transition of the parties’ existing 2D NAND manufacturing capacity to BiCS 3D NAND manufacturing capacity.
The following table presents the notes receivable from, and equity investments in, Flash Ventures as of March 30, 2018 and June 30, 2017:



[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]



During the three and nine months ended March 30, 2018, the Company made net payments to Flash Ventures of $1.00 billion and $3.0 billion, respectively, for purchased flash-based memory wafers and net loans.
The Company aggregates its Flash Ventures’ notes receivable into one class of financing receivables due to the similar ownership interest and common structure in each Flash Venture entity.
For all reporting periods presented, no loans were past due and no loan impairments were recorded.
The Company’s notes receivable from each Flash Ventures entity, denominated in Japanese yen, are secured by equipment owned by that Flash Ventures entity.
The Company assesses financing receivable credit quality through financial and operational reviews of the borrower and creditworthiness, including credit rating agency ratings, of significant investors of the borrower, where material or known.
There were no impairments for credit worthiness in the three and nine months ended March 30, 2018 and March 31, 2017.

The Company’s maximum reasonably estimable loss exposure (excluding lost profits) as a result of its involvement with Flash Ventures, based upon the Japanese yen to U.S. dollar exchange rate at March 30, 2018, is presented below.
Investments in Flash Ventures are denominated in Japanese yen, and the maximum possible loss exposure excludes any cumulative translation adjustment due to revaluation from the Japanese yen to the U.S. dollar.
[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 



The Company is committed to purchase its provided three-month forecast of Flash Ventures’ NAND wafer supply, which generally equals 50% of Flash Ventures’ output.
The Company is not able to estimate its total wafer purchase commitment obligation beyond its rolling three-month purchase commitment because the price is determined by reference to the future cost of producing the semiconductor wafers.
In addition, the Company is committed to fund 49.9% to 50.0% of each Flash Ventures entity’s investments to the extent that each Flash Ventures entity’s operating cash flow is insufficient to fund these investments.
Off-Balance Sheet Liabilities



Flash Ventures sells and leases back from a consortium of financial institutions a portion of its tools and has entered into equipment lease agreements of which the Company guarantees half or all of the outstanding obligations under each lease agreement.
The lease agreements contain customary covenants for Japanese lease facilities.

The stock repurchase program is effective until February 3, 2020.
The Company had made repurchases aggregating $2.88 billion prior to fiscal 2018.
The Company repurchased 1.78 million shares for a total cost of $155 million during the three and nine months ended March 30, 2018.
The remaining amount available to be purchased under the Company’s stock repurchase program as of March 30, 2018 was $1.97 billion.
Dividends to Shareholders



Since the first quarter of 2013, the Company has issued a quarterly cash dividend.
During the nine months ended March 30, 2018, the Company declared aggregate cash dividends of $1.50 per share on its outstanding common stock totaling $446 million, of which $296 million was paid during the period and $150 million was paid on April 16, 2018.

The Company may modify, suspend or cancel its cash dividend policy in any manner and at any time.
For the three and nine months ended March 30, 2018, the Company has not finalized the accounting for the tax effects of the enactment of the 2017 Act.
As such, the provisional amount may change during the one-year measurement period when the Company finalizes the calculation of post-1986 foreign earnings and profits and the amount of foreign earnings held in cash or other specified assets.
The Company made no adjustment to this provisional amount in the three months ended March 30, 2018.
While the provisional tax expense for the three and nine months ended March 30, 2018 is based upon an assumption that foreign undistributed earnings are indefinitely reinvested, the Company’s plan may change upon the completion of long-term capital allocation plans in light of the 2017 Act and completion of the calculation of the incremental tax effects on the repatriation of foreign undistributed earnings.
This provision is effective for tax years beginning on or after January 1, 2018, which for the Company would be the fiscal year beginning on June 30, 2018 (fiscal year 2019).

The primary drivers for the difference between the effective tax rate for the three months ended March 30, 2018 and the U.S. Federal statutory rate of 28% include discrete effects consisting of an income tax benefit of $211 million from deductible make-whole premiums and the write-off of unamortized issuance costs from the debt financing transactions.
The windfall tax benefits are a result of the adoption of ASU 2016-09, which requires the Company to now recognize $46 million and $73 million of windfall tax benefits related to vesting and exercises of stock-based awards as a component of its income tax expense for the three and nine months ended March 30, 2018, respectively.
The windfall tax benefits for the three and nine months ended March 31, 2017 were recorded within shareholders’ equity.
The primary drivers for the remaining difference between the effective tax rate for the three and nine months ended March 31, 2017 and the U.S. Federal statutory rate of 35% are these discrete items, the current year generation of tax credits and tax holidays in Malaysia, Philippines, Singapore and Thailand that expire at various dates during fiscal years 2018 through 2030.
During the nine months ended March 30, 2018, the Company recorded a net decrease of $17 million in its liability for unrecognized tax benefits (excluding accrued interest and penalties).
As of March 30, 2018, the Company’s liability for unrecognized tax benefits (excluding accrued interest and penalties) was approximately $505 million.
Accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as of March 30, 2018 was approximately $105 million.
Meetings with the IRS Appeals Office began in March 2017.
The Company computes basic income (loss) per common share using net income (loss) and the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period.
Diluted income (loss) per common share is computed using net income (loss) and the weighted average number of common shares and potentially dilutive common shares outstanding during the period.
Potentially dilutive common shares include dilutive outstanding employee stock options, RSUs and PSUs, and rights to purchase shares of common stock under the Company’s ESPP.

Antitrust



In July 2010, Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd. (“Samsung”) filed an action against Panasonic Corporation (“Panasonic”) and SD-3C LLC (“SD-3C”) with the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California, alleging that the defendants violated federal antitrust laws and California antitrust and unfair competition laws relating to the licensing practices and operations of SD-3C.
The complaint seeks damages, restitution, injunctive and declaratory relief, and fees and costs.
SanDisk is not a defendant in this case, but it established SD-3C along with Panasonic and Toshiba Corporation (“Toshiba”), and the complaint includes various factual allegations concerning SanDisk.
As a member of SD-3C, SanDisk could be responsible for a portion of any monetary award.
Other requested relief, if granted, could result in a loss of revenue to SanDisk.
In November 2015, the defendants filed a motion to dismiss.
In September 2016, the District Court stayed the litigation pending the outcome of an ongoing arbitration between Samsung and Toshiba.
The District Court denied the motion to dismiss without prejudice to refiling after the stay is lifted.
The arbitration between Samsung and Toshiba was concluded in May 2017.
In October 2017, the District Court issued an order directing Samsung and Toshiba to seek clarification from the arbitration panel regarding certain aspects of its decision.
In April 2018, Samsung voluntarily dismissed its case against Panasonic and SD-3C with prejudice.
In March 2011, a complaint was filed against SanDisk, SD-3C, Panasonic, Panasonic Corporation of North America, Toshiba and Toshiba America Electronic Components, Inc. with the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California.
The lawsuit purports to be on behalf of a nationwide class of indirect purchasers of SD cards.
The complaint asserts claims under federal antitrust laws and California antitrust and unfair competition laws, as well as common law claims.
The complaint seeks damages, restitution, injunctive relief, and fees and costs.
The plaintiffs allege that the defendants conspired to artificially inflate the royalty costs associated with manufacturing SD cards, which in turn allegedly caused the plaintiffs to pay higher prices for SD cards.
The allegations are similar to and incorporate allegations in Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd. v. Panasonic Corp., et al., described above.
In November 2015, the defendants filed a motion to dismiss the plaintiffs’ federal law claims.
In October 2016, the District Court granted the defendants’ motion with leave to amend and the defendants filed a motion to dismiss the plaintiffs’ remaining claims.
Discovery is presently stayed until after completion of the pleading stage.
The Company intends to defend itself vigorously in this matter.

The complaints seek, among other things, damages and fees and costs.

Copyright



In December 2011, the German Central Organization for Private Copying Rights (Zentralstelle für private Überspielungsrechte) (“ZPÜ”), an organization consisting of several copyright collecting societies, instituted arbitration proceedings against WD’s German subsidiary (“WD Germany”) before the Copyright Arbitration Board (“CAB”) claiming copyright levies for multimedia hard drives, external hard drives and network hard drives sold or introduced into commerce in Germany by WD Germany from January 2008 through December 2010.
In February 2013, WD Germany filed a declaratory relief action against ZPÜ in the Higher Regional Court of Munich (the “Higher Court”), seeking an order from the Higher Court to determine the copyright levy issue.
In May 2013, ZPÜ filed a counter-claim against WD Germany with the Higher Court, seeking copyright levies for multimedia hard drives, external hard drives and network hard drives sold or introduced into commerce from January 2008 through December 2010 based on tariffs published by ZPÜ in November 2011.
In January 2015, the Higher Court ruled in favor of ZPÜ.
In its ruling, the Higher Court declared that WD Germany must pay certain levies on certain products that it sold in Germany between January 2008 and December 2010.
The judgment specified levy amounts on certain products sold from January 2008 through December 2010 and directed WD Germany to disclose applicable sales data to ZPÜ.
The exact amount of the judgment had not been determined.
ZPÜ and WD Germany filed appeals with the German Federal Court of Justice in February 2015.
In March 2017, the German Federal Court of Justice rendered a judgment affirming ZPÜ’s claim concerning the disclosure of WD Germany’s sales data regarding HDDs sold between January 2008 and December 2010.
The German Federal Court of Justice also set aside the Higher Court’s decision on the levy amounts and referred the case back to the Higher Court for further fact finding and decision on the levy amounts.
The Company intends to defend itself vigorously in this matter.
In December 2014, ZPÜ submitted a pleading to the CAB seeking copyright levies for multimedia hard drives, external hard drives and network hard drives sold or introduced into commerce in Germany by WD Germany between January 2012 and December 2013.
The Company intends to defend itself vigorously in this matter.
Other Matters



In the normal course of business, the Company is subject to other legal proceedings, lawsuits and other claims.
