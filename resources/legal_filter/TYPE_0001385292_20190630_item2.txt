Sources of Revenue  



We derive revenue from two principal sources: licensing our design assets and technology to brands and creative professionals, which we refer to as Creative Professional revenue, and licensing our text imaging solutions to consumer device manufacturers and independent software vendors, which we refer to as OEM revenue.
We derive our Creative Professional revenue primarily from brands, agencies, publishers, corporations, enterprises, small businesses and individuals.
We derive our OEM revenue primarily from consumer device manufacturers.
We classify cloud-based subscriptions and other services, such as font related services, custom font design and post contract support as service revenue.
All other revenue is classified as license revenue.
We operate our business based on our two principal markets, Creative Professional and OEM, which is the basis for the following discussion of operating results.

Creative Professional revenue is growing at a faster rate than OEM revenue.
We expect these trends to continue.
Our gross profit is subject to variability from 



period-to-period, depending on the product mix and the level of custom font design and SaaS based service revenue.

This was partially offset by a decline in printer revenue.
Service revenue decreased in the three months ended June 30, 2019, as compared to the same period in 2018, mainly due to increased customer churn in the last half of 2018.
Gross profit from license revenue, before amortization of acquired technology, was consistent at 84.8% and 84.9% in the three months ended June 30, 2019 and 2018, respectively.

Liquidity and Capital Resources  



Cash Flows for the Six Months Ended June 30, 2019 and 2018  



Since our inception, we have financed our operations primarily through cash from operations, private and public stock sales and long-term debt arrangements, as described below.
We believe our existing cash and cash equivalents, cash flow from operating activities and available bank borrowings will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash needs for at least one year from the issuance of these financial statements.
At June 30, 2019, our principal sources of liquidity were cash and cash equivalents totaling $47.8 million and a $200.0 million revolving credit facility, of which there was $65.0 million of outstanding borrowings.
On May 3, 2018, our Board of Directors approved a share repurchase program of up to $25.0 million of our outstanding common stock, which permitted purchases through June 7, 2019.
In the six months ended June 30, 2019, we used $7.7 million in cash to purchase the remaining shares outstanding under the plan.
The following table presents our cash flows from operating activities, investing activities and financing activities for the periods presented (in thousands):  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 



Operating Activities

Decreased accrued expenses used $9.7 million in cash, primarily a result of the payment of 2018 accrued variable compensation.
Increased deferred revenue and decreased accounts receivable generated $9.1 million in cash as a result of customer payments received.
Prepaid expenses and other assets used $7.3 million in cash, mainly due to an increase in long-term unbilled receivables from a large multi-year customer agreement, in

Increased tax refunds receivable combined with decreased accrued income taxes used $4.6 million during the six months ended June 30, 2019.
Variations in operating cash flows occur from 



time-to-time, because our enterprise customers make upfront payments on subscription revenue or conversely may enter into multi-year license agreements with future billing installments of the earned consideration.
The timing and extent of such payments may significantly impact our cash balances.
We generated $3.3 million in cash from operations during the six months ended June 30, 2018.

Credit Facility  



On March 22, 2019, the Company entered into a new credit agreement (the “New Credit Agreement”) by and among the Company, the Company’s subsidiary, Monotype Imaging Inc., (“the Borrower”), any financial institution that becomes a Lender and Bank of America, N.A., as administrative agent.
Pursuant to the New Credit Agreement the Lenders have agreed to provide the Borrower with a five-year $200.0 million senior secured revolving credit facility (the “Credit Facility”).
The Credit Facility permits the Company to request that the Lenders, at their election, increase the secured credit facility to a maximum of $300.0 million.
The Credit Facility provides more flexibility in addition to an increased borrowing capacity and extended terms, as defined above.
The New Credit Agreement replaced the Company’s existing $150.0 million revolving credit facility (the “Original Credit Agreement”) by and between the Company and Silicon Valley Bank.
The Original Credit Agreement was terminated effective March 22, 2019 and was scheduled to expire on September 15, 2020.
The Company had $75.0 million outstanding under the Original Credit Agreement at December 31, 2018.
Available borrowings under the Original Credit Agreement were reduced by approximately $0.5 million for one standby letter of credit issued in connection with a facility lease agreement, leaving $74.5 million available for borrowings at December 31, 2018.
At June 30, 2019, the Company had $65.0 million outstanding under the Credit Facility.
Available borrowings under the Credit Facility have been reduced by approximately $0.5 million for one standby letter of credit issued in connection with a facility lease agreement, leaving $134.5 million available for borrowings at June 30, 2019.

Table of Contents  



Borrowings under the Credit Facility bear interest through March 21, 2024 at a variable rate per annum equal to LIBOR plus between 1.0% and 1.625%, or at the Borrower’s option, the higher of (i) the prime rate as announced by Bank of America and (ii) 0.5% plus the overnight federal funds rate, plus in each case, between 0.0% and 0.625%, with the exact interest rate margin determined based on the consolidated leverage ratio.
At June 30, 2019, our rate, inclusive of applicable margins, was 3.3% for LIBOR.
At December 31, 2018, our rate under the Original Credit Agreement, inclusive of applicable margins, was 4.3% for LIBOR.
The Company is required to pay a commitment fee, based on the consolidated leverage ratio, equal to 0.175%, 0.20%, 0.225% or 0.25% per annum on the undrawn portion available under the revolving credit facility and variable per annum fees in respect of outstanding letters of credit.
In connection with the New Credit Agreement, the Company incurred closing and legal fees of approximately $0.9 million, which have been accounted for as deferred financing costs and will be amortized to interest expense over the term of the New Credit Agreement.
In addition, $34.0 thousand of unamortized deferred financing costs associated with the 



pro-rata share of prior loan syndicate lenders that did not participate in the new facility were written off and charged to other expense in the first quarter of 2019.
The New Credit Agreement includes financial covenants which require the Company to maintain (i) a consolidated leverage ratio of no greater than 3.25 to 1.0 or, upon a qualified acquisition subject to certain conditions, 3.75 to 1.0 and (ii) a minimum consolidated interest coverage ratio of 3.00 to 1.0.
At June 30, 2019, our consolidated leverage ratio was 0.59 to 1.0 and our consolidated interest coverage ratio was 21.38 to 1.0.
Adjusted EBITDA, under the Credit Facility, is defined as consolidated net earnings (or loss), plus net interest expense, income taxes, depreciation and amortization, and share based compensation expense, plus acquisition expenses not to exceed $2.0 million, minus capitalized research and development expense, plus restructuring, issuance costs, cash 



non-operating costs and other expenses or losses minus cash 



non-operating gains and other 



non-cash gains; provided, however that the aggregate of all cash 



non-operating expense shall not exceed 10% of Consolidated EBITDA.
The New Credit Agreement also provides for a number of customary events of default, including, among others, payment, bankruptcy, covenant, representation and warranty, change of control and judgment defaults.
Failure to comply with these covenants, or the occurrence of an event of default, could permit the Lenders under the New Credit Agreement to declare all amounts borrowed under the New Credit Agreement, together with accrued interest and fees, to be immediately due and payable.
The obligations of the Borrower under the Credit Facilities are unconditionally guaranteed by the Company and certain subsidiaries and secured by a lien on substantially all of the present and future property and assets of the Company and such subsidiaries, in each case, subject to limited exceptions and exclusions.
The Credit Facility also contains provisions for an increased interest rate during periods of default.
This 



non-GAAP measure is net adjusted EBITDA, which is defined as income (loss) from operations before depreciation, amortization of acquired intangible assets, stock based compensation expense, acquisition-related compensation and 



one-time 



non-recurring expenses.
We use net adjusted EBITDA as a principal indicator of the operating performance of our business.

Net adjusted EBITDA is not a measure of operating performance under GAAP and should not be considered as an alternative or substitute for GAAP profitability measures such as income (loss) from operations and net income (loss).
We have significant intangible assets and amortization expense is a meaningful element in our financial statements and therefore its exclusion from net adjusted EBITDA is a material limitation.
Stock based compensation and the associated expense has a meaningful impact on our financial statements and therefore its exclusion from net adjusted EBITDA is a material limitation.
As a result, net adjusted EBITDA should be evaluated in conjunction with net income (loss) for complete analysis of our profitability, as net income (loss) includes the financial statement impact of these items and is the most directly comparable GAAP performance measure to net adjusted EBITDA.
As net adjusted EBITDA is not defined by GAAP, our definition of net adjusted EBITDA may differ from and therefore may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies, thereby limiting its usefulness as a comparative measure.
