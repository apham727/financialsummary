The reader should not place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements.
Based on this definition, our critical accounting policies include: valuation of marketable securities, which impacts losses on debt and equity securities when we record impairments; revenue recognition, which impacts the recording of revenues; and valuation of inventories, which impacts cost of revenues and gross margin.
Our critical accounting policies also include: the assessment of impairment of long-lived assets, which impacts their valuation; the assessment of the recoverability of goodwill, which impacts goodwill impairment; accounting for income taxes, which impacts the provision or benefit recognized for income taxes, as well as the valuation of deferred tax assets recorded on our condensed consolidated balance sheets; and valuation and recognition of stock-based compensation, which impacts gross margin, research and development (R&D) expenses, and selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses.

The following table sets forth statement of income data as a percentage of net revenues for the periods indicated:



[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Net Revenues



We sell our products to global manufacturers of electronic products in end markets such as wireline and wireless communications, aerospace and defense, industrial, scientific and medical, test and measurement, audio, video and broadcast, and automotive.
The vast majority of our net revenues are generated by sales of our semiconductor products, but we also generate sales from support products, which include configuration solutions, software and support/services.
We classify our product offerings into two categories: Advanced Products and Core Products:



•Advanced Products include our recent product offerings and include the UltraScale+, UltraScale and 7-series product families.
•Core Products include all other product families.
The most recent modification was made on April 3, 2016, which was the beginning of our fiscal year 2017, whereby we reclassified our product categories to be consistent with how these categories are analyzed and reviewed internally.
Specifically, we grouped the products manufactured at the 28nm, 20nm and 16nm nodes into a category named Advanced Products while all other products are included in a category named Core Products.
Net revenues of $631.2 million in the third quarter of fiscal year 2018 represented an 8% increase from the comparable prior year period of $585.7 million.
Net revenues from Advanced Products increased 30% in the third quarter of fiscal year 2018 versus the comparable prior year period, but the declines from our Core Products partially offset the increase.
No end customer accounted for more than 10% of our net revenues for the third quarter and the first nine months of fiscal years 2018 and 2017.
For the first nine months of fiscal year 2018, approximately 52% of our net revenues were from products sold to distributors for subsequent resale to original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) or their subcontract manufacturers.
As of December 30, 2017, we had $48.0 million of deferred revenue and $15.0 million of deferred cost of revenues recognized as a net $33.0 million of deferred income on shipments to distributors.
As of April 1, 2017, we had $74.2 million of deferred revenue and $19.6 million of deferred cost of revenues recognized as a net $54.6 million of deferred income on shipments to distributors.
Net Revenues by Product



Net revenues by product categories for the third quarter and the first nine months of fiscal years 2018 and 2017 were as follows:



[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]



Net revenues from Advanced Products increased significantly in both the third quarter and the first nine months of fiscal year 2018 compared to the comparable prior year periods.
Net revenues from Core Products decreased in both the third quarter and the first nine months of fiscal year 2018 from the comparable prior year periods.
For both the third quarter and the first nine months of fiscal year 2018, the decreases were largely due to decline in sales of our Virtex-5 and, to a lesser extent, our Spartan-3 and Virtex-6 product families.
26

Net Revenues by End Markets



Our end market revenue data is derived from our understanding of our end customers’ primary markets.
Net revenues by end markets are classified into the following three categories: Communications & Data Center; Industrial, Aerospace & Defense; and Broadcast, Consumer & Automotive.
The percentage change calculation in the table below represents the period-to-period dollar change in each end market.
Net revenues by end markets for the third quarter and the first nine months of fiscal years 2018 and 2017 were as follows:



[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]



Net revenues from Communications & Data Center decreased for the third quarter and the first nine months of fiscal year 2018 from the comparable prior year periods.
The decreases for both periods were primarily driven by lower sales from wireless, particularly in the Europe and Japan regions, and to a lesser extent from wireline, particularly in the North America region.
Net revenues from Industrial, Aerospace & Defense increased for the third quarter and the first nine months of fiscal year 2018 from the comparable prior year periods.
The increases for the third quarter of fiscal year 2018 were primarily due to higher sales from aerospace & defense in the North America region and test & measurement in both the Europe and North America regions.
For the first nine months of fiscal year 2018, sales from all sub-segments grew significantly; in particular sales from aerospace & defense in the North America region and test & measurement in both the Europe and North America regions.
Net revenues from Broadcast, Consumer & Automotive increased for the third quarter and the first nine months of fiscal year 2018 from the comparable prior year periods.
The increases were driven by higher sales across all sub-segments, particularly from consumer and automotive, throughout most regions.
Net Revenues by Geography



Geographic revenue information reflects the geographic location of the distributors, OEMs or contract manufacturers who purchased our products.
This may differ from the geographic location of the end customers.
Net revenues by geography for the third quarter and the first nine months of fiscal years 2018 and 2017 were as follows:



[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]



Net revenues in North America increased in both the third quarter and the first nine months of fiscal year 2018, from the comparable prior year periods.
The increases were primarily due to higher sales from aerospace & defense and test & measurement, but were partially offset by a decrease in wireline.
Net revenues in Asia Pacific increased in both the third quarter and the first nine months of fiscal year 2018 from the comparable prior year periods.
The increases were primarily due to higher sales from consumer, primarily in China.
27

Net revenues in Europe increased in both the third quarter and the first nine months of fiscal year 2018 from the comparable prior year periods.
Net revenues in Japan increased in both the third quarter and the first nine months of fiscal year 2018 from the comparable prior year periods.
The increases for both periods were primarily driven by higher sales in test & measurement, industrial, scientific & medical and automotive, but were partially offset by a decline in sales from wireless.
Gross Margin



[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]



Gross margin was higher by 1.5 percentage points in the third quarter of fiscal year 2018 compared to the same period last year, but remained flat for the first nine months of fiscal year 2018.
The increase in the third quarter of fiscal year 2018 was due to favorable changes in end market mix, as the revenue mix shifted away from wireless, which generally has lower margin.
Advanced Products generally have lower gross margins than Core Products as they are in the early stages of their product life cycle and have higher unit costs associated with relatively lower volumes and early manufacturing maturity.
Research and Development



[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]



R&D spending increased $7.0 million, or 4%, for the third quarter of fiscal year 2018 from the comparable prior year period.
For the first nine months of fiscal year 2018, R&D spending increased $40.1 million, or 9%, from the comparable prior year period.
The increases for both periods were primarily attributable to increases in headcount and employee compensation (including stock-based compensation) to support our next generation product development.
These increases more than offset the decline in mask and wafer spending due to tape-out timing.
We plan to continue to selectively invest in R&D efforts in areas such as new products and more advanced process development, IP cores and software development environments.
We may also consider acquisitions to complement our strategy for technology leadership and engineering resources in critical areas.
28

Selling, General and Administrative



[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]



SG&A expenses were higher in both the third quarter and the first nine months of fiscal year 2018, as compared to the comparable prior year periods.
The increases for both periods were primarily due to higher employee compensation (including stock-based compensation) from increased headcount when compared with the prior year periods.
Amortization of Acquisition-Related Intangibles



[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]



Amortization expense for both the third quarter and the first nine months of fiscal year 2018 decreased from the comparable prior year periods as certain intangibles were fully amortized by fiscal year 2018.
Stock-Based Compensation



[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]



Stock-based compensation expense increased in both the third quarter and the first nine months of fiscal year 2018 from the comparable prior year periods.
The increases were primarily related to higher expenses associated with RSUs granted in the recent quarters, as more RSUs were granted, and were granted at a higher fair value.
Interest and Other Income (Expense), Net



[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]



Our net interest and other income (expense) increased in both the third quarter and the first nine months of fiscal year 2018 from the comparable prior year periods.
The increases were primarily due to higher interest income from the investment portfolio, and to a lesser extent lower interest expenses from 2024 Notes and its related interest rate swap contracts as compared to the total interest expenses recognized from the 2017 Convertible Notes that matured in the first quarter of fiscal 2018.
29

Provision for Income Taxes



[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]



On December 22, 2017, the TCJA was enacted into law.
As a fiscal year-end taxpayer, certain provisions of the TCJA began to impact us in our third quarter of fiscal year 2018, while other provisions will impact us beginning in fiscal year 2019.
The corporate tax rate reduction is effective as of January 1, 2018.
Since the Company has a fiscal year rather than a calendar year, it is subject to rules relating to transitional tax rates.
The increases in the effective tax rates in the third quarter and first nine months of fiscal year 2018 from the comparable prior year periods were primarily due to the one-time transition tax of $582.8 million (including state liabilities), a remeasurement of certain deferred tax assets and liabilities as a result of the reduction in the corporate income tax rate to 21% in the amount of $26.2 million and a release of reserves for uncertain tax positions in fiscal year 2017.
Because of the complexity of the new tax on low-taxed income of foreign subsidiaries, we are continuing to evaluate this provision of the TCJA and the application of ASC 740.
Our selection of an accounting policy will depend, in part, on analyzing our facts to determine what the impact is expected to be under each method.

Financial Condition, Liquidity and Capital Resources



We have historically used a combination of cash flows from operations and equity as well as debt financing to support ongoing business activities, acquire or invest in critical or complementary technologies, purchase facilities and capital equipment, repurchase our common stock and debentures under our repurchase program, pay dividends and finance working capital.
Additionally, our investments in debt securities are liquid and available for future business needs.
The combination of cash, cash equivalents as well as short-term and long-term investments as of December 30, 2017 and April 1, 2017 totaled $3.64 billion and $3.44 billion, respectively.
As of December 30, 2017, we had cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments of $3.54 billion and working capital of $3.74 billion.
As of April 1, 2017, cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments were $3.32 billion and working capital was $2.98 billion.
As of December 30, 2017, $3.20 billion of our $3.54 billion of cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments was held by our non-U.S. jurisdictions.
The TCJA also generally allows companies to repatriate these accumulated foreign earnings without incurring additional U.S. federal taxes beginning after December 31, 2017.
The one-time transition tax liability will be payable in eight annual installments, as outlined in "Contractual Obligations" below.
See “Note 14.
Financial Information,” for additional information about the one-time transition tax.
Operating Activities —During the first nine months of fiscal year 2018, our operations generated net positive cash flow of $577.7 million, which was $50.1 million lower than the $627.8 million generated during the first nine months of fiscal year 2017.
The net cash provided by operations during the first nine months of fiscal year 2018 was primarily from net income as adjusted for non-cash related items, a decrease in inventory as well as an increase in other accrued liabilities and income tax payable.
These items were partially offset by increases in accounts receivable, prepaid expenses and other assets as well as decreases in accounts payable.
Accounts receivable increased by $104.5 million to $348.5 million at December 30, 2017 compared to $243.9 million at April 1, 2017.
Days sales outstanding increased to 51 days at December 30, 2017 from 38 days at April 1, 2017, primarily due to timing of shipments and collections.
Our inventory levels as of December 30, 2017 were slightly lower at $226.5 million compared to $227.0 million at April 1, 2017, and combined inventory days at Xilinx and distribution decreased to 118 days at December 30, 2017 from 127 days at April 1, 2017.
Investing Activities —Net cash used in investing activities was $318.9 million during the first nine months of fiscal year 2018, as compared to net cash provided by investing activities of $362.6 million in the first nine months of fiscal year 2017.
Net cash used in investing activities during the first nine months of fiscal year 2018 consisted primarily of $272.1 million of net cash used in purchases of available-for-sale securities, $28.9 million net cash used in purchases of property, plant and equipment and $17.8 million used in other investing activities.
Financing Activities —Net cash used in financing activities was $314.1 million in the first nine months of fiscal year 2018, as compared to $654.7 million in the first nine months of fiscal year 2017.
Net cash used in financing activities during the first nine months of fiscal year 2018 consisted of $457.9 million of cash repayment for the 2017 Convertible Notes, $310.8 million cash payment to repurchase common stock, $263.8 million dividend payments to stockholders and $44.4 million of payment for RSU withholdings, which were partially offset by $745.2 million of proceeds from issuance of the 2024 Notes and $19.6 million of proceeds from issuance of common stock under employee stock plans.
Contractual Obligations



We lease some of our facilities, office buildings and land under non-cancelable operating leases that expire at various dates through April 2029.
See "Note 15.
Commitments" to our condensed consolidated financial statements, included in "Part I.
Financial Information," for a schedule of our operating lease commitments as of December 30, 2017 and additional information about operating leases.
Due to the nature of our business, we depend upon subcontractors to manufacture our silicon wafers and provide assembly and test services.
The lengthy subcontractor lead times require us to order the materials and services in advance, and we are obligated to pay for the materials and services when completed.
As of December 30, 2017, we had $157.5 million of outstanding inventory and other non-cancelable purchase obligations to subcontractors.
We expect to receive and pay for these materials and services in the next three to six months, as the products meet delivery and quality specifications.
As of December 30, 2017, we also had $27.2 



31

million of non-cancelable license obligations to providers of electronic design automation software and hardware/software maintenance expiring at various dates through December 2019.
On May 30, 2017, we issued $750.0 million principal amount of 2024 Notes with a maturity date on June 1, 2024.
The 2024 Notes were offered to the public at a discounted price of 99.887% of par.
Interest on the 2024 Notes is payable semi-annually on June 1 and December 1.
As of December 30, 2017, we had $750.0 million of the 2024 Notes outstanding.
We also had $500.0 million of 2019 Notes and $500.0 million of 2021 Notes outstanding as of December 30, 2017.
The 2019 Notes and 2021 Notes require payment of interest semiannually on March 15 and September 15.
See "Note 10.
Debt and Credit Facility" to our condensed consolidated financial statements, included in Part 1.
"Financial Information," for additional information about our debentures.
Of the $531.5 million, $520.9 million was the estimated long-term portion of the one-time transition tax that resulted from the enactment of the TCJA, which will be payable in eight annual installments.
The installment amounts will be equal to 8% of the total liability, payable in fiscal years 2019 through 2023, 15% in fiscal year 2024, 20% in fiscal year 2025, and 25% in fiscal year 2026.
See “Note 14.
Financial Information,” for additional information about the one-time transition tax.
The remaining $10.6 million of the long-term income taxes payable is for uncertain tax positions and related interest and penalties.
Due to the inherent uncertainty with respect to the timing of future cash outflows associated with such liabilities, we are unable to reliably estimate the timing of cash settlement with the respective taxing authorities.
Off-Balance-Sheet Arrangements



As of December 30, 2017, we did not have any significant off-balance-sheet arrangements, as defined in Item 303(a)(4)(ii) of Regulation S-K.
Liquidity and Capital Resources



Cash generated from operations is used as our primary source of liquidity and capital resources.
Our investment portfolio is also available for future cash requirements as is our $400.0 million revolving credit facility that, upon certain conditions, may be extended by an additional $150.0 million, and was entered into in December 2016 (expiring in December 2021).
We are not aware of any lack of access to the revolving credit facility; however, we can provide no assurance that access to the credit facility will not be impacted by adverse conditions in the financial markets.
Our credit facility is not reliant upon a single bank.
There have been no borrowings to date under our existing revolving credit facility.
During the first nine months of fiscal year 2018, we repurchased 4.7 million shares of common stock in the open market and through an accelerated share repurchase agreement with an independent financial institution for a total of $310.8 million.
During the first nine months of fiscal year 2017, we repurchased 8.0 million shares of common stock in the open market for a total of $414.0 million.
On October 19, 2016, we announced our plan to utilize the $1.00 billion repurchase authorization under the 2016 Repurchase Program over the next several quarters.
As of December 30, 2017, we have $371.3 million left available for future purchase.
During the first nine months of fiscal year 2018, we paid $263.8 million in cash dividends to stockholders, representing $1.05 per common share.
During the first nine months of fiscal year 2017, we paid $250.7 million in cash dividends to stockholders, representing $0.99 per common share.
On January 23, 2018, our Board of Directors declared a cash dividend of $0.35 per common share for the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2018.
The dividend is payable on February 22, 2018 to stockholders of record on February 7, 2018.
We anticipate that existing sources of liquidity and cash flows from operations will be sufficient to satisfy our cash needs for the foreseeable future.
However, the risk factors discussed in "Item 1A.
