Overview



MTS Systems Corporation is a leading global supplier of high performance test systems and sensors.
Our testing hardware and software solutions help customers accelerate and improve design, development and manufacturing processes and are used for determining the mechanical behavior of materials, products and structures.
Our high performance sensors provide controls for a variety of applications measuring acceleration, position, vibration, motion, pressure, force and sound.
As of September 30, 2017, we had 3,500 employees and revenue of $787,955 for fiscal year 2017.
Our desire is to be the innovation leader in creating test and measurement solutions and to provide total customer satisfaction.
We believe we can create value for our customers by helping to enhance the precision, improve the reliability and create superior safety for their products, while reducing the delivery time to market.
Our competitive advantages include our proprietary technology and advanced application expertise, our expansive global footprint with long-term customer relationships, our large installed base of testing equipment and our expanded presence in the rapidly growing sensors market.
We are working toward our goals of sustained five to seven percent growth in annual revenue; three to four points of expanded earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA); and mid-teens for return on invested capital (ROIC).
We believe the growth in our end markets, combined with four primary opportunities we are currently pursuing, will support these goals: 



•Realize growth within the rapidly expanding Sensors market through an increase in our global market share and new product development;



•Expand Test services offerings into our large installed base of Test equipment;



•Capitalize on growth opportunities in the Test materials sector spurred by new manufacturing processes, focus on light-weight materials in aerospace and ground vehicle markets, and trends in energy exploration; and 



•Adapt our industry-leading ground vehicle testing applications to align with emerging trends in vehicle electrification, autonomous vehicles and simulation.
We believe that our business model supports our growth objectives, provided that we continue to move aggressively to build our infrastructure, expand our offerings and execute on opportunities with our key customers around the world.
In order to accelerate our revenue growth over the next five years, investments in infrastructure, sales support and field service capacity and capability are essential.
See Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 1 of Part I of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for further discussion of the impact of the Tax Act.
Restructuring Initiative



During the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2017, we initiated a series of Test workforce reductions and facility closures intended to increase organizational effectiveness, gain manufacturing efficiencies and provide cost savings that can be reinvested in our growth initiatives.
These actions include the transfer of certain production operations in China to a contract manufacturing partner in fiscal year 2018.
As a result, we recorded $739 and $1,340 of pre-tax restructuring expense in the three and nine months ended June 30, 2018, respectively.
See Note 16 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 1 of Part I of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for further discussion of restructuring initiatives.
Foreign Currency



Approximately 70% of our revenue has historically been derived from customers outside of the U.S. Our financial results are principally exposed to changes in exchange rates between the U.S. dollar and the Euro, the Japanese yen and the Chinese yuan.
The discussion below quantifies the impact of foreign currency translation on our financial results for the periods discussed.

31

Other Income (Expense), Net



[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 



The increase in other income (expense), net for the three and nine months ended June 30, 2018 was primarily driven by a relative decrease in losses on foreign currency transactions.
Excluding the impact of these discrete benefits, the effective tax rate for the three months ended July 1, 2017 was 2.2%.
The effective tax rate for the nine months ended June 30, 2018 decreased primarily due to certain discrete benefits of $25,378 from the estimated impact of the Tax Act.
The discrete benefits primarily related to $32,264 of estimated benefit from the remeasurement of our estimated net deferred tax liabilities, partially offset by $6,886 of estimated expense associated with the mandatory deemed repatriation tax.
The nine months ended July 1, 2017 included certain discrete benefits of $2,801 which consisted of additional U.S. tax benefits for prior fiscal years associated with domestic manufacturing, deductible PCB acquisition-related expenses and U.S. R&D tax credit.
Excluding the impact of these discrete benefits, the effective tax rate for the nine months ended June 30, 2018 and July 1, 2017 would have been 15.2% and 11.2%, respectively.
Net Income



[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]



Net income and diluted earnings per share for the three months ended June 30, 2018 decreased due to an increase in the effective tax rate and higher operating expenses, partially offset by increased gross profit.

Cash Flow Comparison



The following table summarizes our cash flows from total operations:



[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]



Operating Activities



The decrease in cash provided by operating activities was primarily due to a decrease in cash provided by working capital associated with timing fluctuations from inventory purchases, advanced payments from customers, accounts receivable payments received, unbilled accounts receivable accruals and billings and accounts payable payments.
Timing of payroll-related payments also contributed to the decrease in cash provided by operating activities.
This decrease in cash provided by operating activities was partially offset by a decrease in cash used by other assets and liabilities primarily driven by an increase in income taxes payable, as well as an increase in net income offset by a decrease in deferred income taxes due to the remeasurement of our estimated deferred tax liabilities as a result of the Tax Act.
38

Investing Activities



The decrease in cash used in investing activities was primarily due to the timing of investments in property and equipment in the current year.
Financing Activities



The increase in cash used in financing activities was primarily due to the annual required excess cash flow payment and planned prepayments on the tranche B term loan made in fiscal year 2018.
Liquidity and Capital Resources



We had cash and cash equivalents of $66,403 as of June 30, 2018.
Of this amount, $2,722 was located in North America, $24,530 in Europe and $39,151 in Asia.
The North American balance was primarily invested in bank deposits.
