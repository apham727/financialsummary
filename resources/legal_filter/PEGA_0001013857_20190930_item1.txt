NEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS



Leases



On January 1, 2019, the Company adopted Accounting Standards Codification 842 “Leases” (“ASC 842”) using the modified retrospective method, reflecting any cumulative effect as an adjustment to equity.
Results for reporting periods beginning on or after January 1, 2019 are presented under ASC 842, while prior period amounts were not adjusted and continue to be reported in accordance with the Company’s historical accounting under ASC 840 “Leases”.
The Company elected the permitted practical expedients to not reassess the following related to leases that commenced before the effective date of ASC 842: (i) whether any expired or existing contracts contain leases; (ii) the lease classification for any expired or existing leases; and (iii) initial direct costs for any existing leases.
Upon adoption, the Company recorded right of use assets of $41.8 million and lease liabilities of $54.2 million.
The difference between the value of the right of use assets and lease liabilities is due to the reclassification of existing deferred rent, prepaid rent, and unamortized lease incentives as of January 1, 2019.
See Note 9.
“Leases” for additional information.
Financial instruments



In June 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued Accounting Standards Update No.
2016-13, “Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments,” which requires measurement and recognition of expected credit losses for financial assets measured at amortized cost, including accounts receivable, upon initial recognition of that financial asset using a forward-looking expected loss model, rather than an incurred loss model.
Credit losses relating to available-for-sale debt securities should be recorded through an allowance for credit losses when the fair value is below the amortized cost of the asset, removing the concept of “other-than-temporary” impairments.
The effective date for the Company will be January 1, 2020, with early adoption permitted.

(2) Included in other long-term assets.
Contract assets are client committed amounts for which revenue recognized exceeds the amount billed to the client and the right to payment is subject to conditions other than the passage of time, such as the completion of a related performance obligation.
Contract assets and deferred revenue are netted at the contract level for each reporting period.
The change in deferred revenue in the nine months ended September 30, 2019 was primarily due to revenue recognized during the period that was included in deferred revenue at December 31, 2018, partially offset by new billings in advance of revenue recognition.
5.
DEFERRED CONTRACT COSTS



The Company recognizes an asset for the incremental costs of obtaining a client contract, which relate to sales commissions.
As a result, there are no commensurate commissions paid on contract renewals.
Deferred costs are amortized on a straight-line basis over the benefit period, which is on average 5 years.

FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS 



Assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis



The Company records its cash equivalents, marketable securities, and investments in privately-held companies at fair value on a recurring basis.
The Company’s cash equivalents are composed of money market funds and time deposits, which are classified within Level 1 and Level 2, respectively, in the fair value hierarchy.
The Company’s investments in privately-held companies are classified within Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy.
If applicable, the Company will recognize transfers into and out of levels within the fair value hierarchy at the end of the reporting period in which the actual event or change in circumstance occurs.
There were no transfers between levels during the nine months ended September 30, 2019.
The Company’s assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis were:

For certain other financial instruments, including accounts receivable and accounts payable, the carrying value approximates fair value due to the relatively short maturity of these items.

LEASES



The Company’s leases are primarily for office space used in the ordinary course of business.
Accounting policy



All the Company’s leases are operating leases.
The Company accounts for a contract as a lease when it has the right to control the asset for a period of time while obtaining substantially all of the asset’s economic benefits.
The Company determines the initial classification and measurement of its operating right of use assets and lease liabilities at the lease commencement date and thereafter if modified.
Fixed lease costs are recognized on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease.
The Company combines lease and non-lease components in the determination of lease costs for its office space leases.
The lease liability includes lease payments related to options to extend or renew the lease term if the Company is

The weighted-average remaining lease term and discount rate for the Company’s leases were:



[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]



(1) The rates implicit in most of the Company’s leases are not readily determinable, therefore the Company uses its incremental borrowing rate as the discount rate when measuring operating lease liabilities.
The incremental borrowing rate represents an estimate of the interest rate the Company would incur to borrow an amount equal to the lease payments on a collateralized basis over the term of the lease.
Maturities of lease liabilities are:



[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]



(1) Lease liabilities are measured at the present value of the remaining lease payments using a discount rate determined at lease commencement unless the discount rate is updated as a result of a lease reassessment event.
As of December 31, 2018, the Company’s future minimum rental payments required under operating leases with noncancellable terms in excess of one year as determined before the adoption of ASC 842 were:

EARNINGS PER SHARE



Basic earnings per share is computed using the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during the applicable period.
Diluted earnings per share is computed using the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during the applicable period, plus the dilutive effect of outstanding stock options and RSUs, using the treasury stock method.
In periods of loss, all stock options and RSUs are excluded, as their inclusion would be anti-dilutive.

SUBSEQUENT EVENTS



On November 6, 2019, the Company entered into a five-year $100 million, senior secured revolving credit agreement (the “Credit Agreement”) with PNC Bank, National Association (“PNC”).
Subject to specific circumstances, the Credit Agreement allows the Company to increase the aggregate commitment up to $200 million.
