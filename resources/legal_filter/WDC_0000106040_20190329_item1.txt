Note 2.Recent Accounting Pronouncements



Accounting Pronouncements Recently Adopted



On August 29, 2018, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) No.
2018-15, “Customer’s Accounting for Implementation Costs Incurred in a Cloud Computing Arrangement That Is a Service Contract” (“ASU 2018-15”), to reduce diversity in practice in accounting for the costs of implementing cloud computing arrangements that are service contracts.
ASU 2018-15 allows entities to apply the guidance in the FASB Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) 350-40 to determine which implementation costs are eligible to be capitalized as assets in a cloud computing arrangement that is considered a service contract.
The Company adopted this standard on a prospective basis effective June 30, 2018, the beginning of fiscal year 2019, as allowed by the standard.
The adoption of this standard and the costs capitalized for the nine months ended March 29, 2019 were not material to the Company’s Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements.
In February 2018, the FASB issued ASU No.
The adoption of this standard did not have a material impact on the Company’s Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements.
In August 2017, the FASB issued ASU No.
2017-12, “Derivatives and Hedging (Topic 815): Targeted Improvements to Accounting for Hedging Activities” (“ASU 2017-12”).
ASU 2017-12 simplifies hedge accounting through changes to both designation and measurement requirements.
For hedges that qualify as highly effective, the new standard eliminates the requirement to separately measure and record hedge ineffectiveness with the entire change in fair value of designated hedge reported in the results of operations in the same line item as the hedged item.
The Company early adopted this standard effective June 30, 2018, using the modified retrospective approach.
The adoption of this standard did not have a material impact on the Company’s Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements.
In May 2017, the FASB issued ASU No.
2017-09, “Compensation-Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Scope of Modification Accounting” (“ASU 2017-09”).
ASU 2017-09 provides clarification when a change to the terms or conditions of a share-based payment award must be accounted for as a modification.
The new guidance requires modification accounting if the fair value, vesting condition or the classification of the award is not the same immediately before and after a change to the terms and conditions of the award.
The Company adopted this standard on a prospective basis effective June 30, 2018.
The adoption of this standard did not have a material impact on the Company’s Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements.
In March 2017, the FASB issued ASU No.
2017-07, “Compensation-Retirement Benefits (Topic 715): Improving the Presentation of Net Periodic Pension Cost and Net Periodic Postretirement Benefit Cost” (“ASU 2017-07”).
ASU 2017-07 requires that the Company report the service cost component in the same line item or items as other compensation costs arising from services rendered by the pertinent employees during the period.
In addition, the other components of net benefit cost are now presented in Other income (expense), net in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations.
The Company adopted this standard effective June 30, 2018.
The adoption of this standard did not have a material impact on the Company’s Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements.
In January 2017, the FASB issued ASU No.
2017-01, “Business Combinations (Topic 805): Clarifying the Definition of a Business” (“ASU 2017-01”).
ASU 2017-01 narrows the definition of a “business.” This standard provides guidance to assist entities with evaluating when a set of transferred assets and activities is a business.
The Company adopted this standard effective June 30, 2018 and will apply it prospectively to transactions occurring thereafter.
The adoption of this standard did not have a material impact on the Company’s Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements.

NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)



In October 2016, the FASB issued ASU No.
2016-16, “Income Taxes (Topic 740): Intra-Entity Transfers of Assets Other Than Inventory” (“ASU 2016-16”).
ASU 2016-16 removes the prohibition in the FASB ASC Topic 740 against the immediate recognition of the current and deferred income tax effects of intra-entity transfers of assets other than inventory.
The Company adopted this standard effective June 30, 2018.
The adoption of this standard did not have a material impact on the Company’s Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements.
In January 2016, the FASB issued ASU No.
2016-01, “Financial Instruments — Overall (Subtopic 825-10): Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities” (“ASU 2016-01”).
ASU 2016-01 provides guidance related to accounting for equity investments, financial liabilities under the fair value option and the presentation and disclosure requirements for financial instruments.
Marketable equity securities previously classified as available-for-sale equity investments are now measured and recorded at fair value with changes in fair value recorded within Other income (expense), net in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations rather than as a component of Other comprehensive income as in prior years.
In addition, the FASB clarified guidance related to the valuation allowance assessment when recognizing deferred tax assets resulting from unrealized losses on available-for-sale debt securities.
The Company adopted this standard effective June 30, 2018.
The adoption of this standard did not have a material impact on the Company’s Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements.
In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU No.
2014-09, “Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606),” which superseded the requirements in ASC 605 “Revenue Recognition” (Topic 605).
Topic 606 outlines a comprehensive five-step revenue recognition model based on the principle that an entity should recognize revenue when control of the promised goods or services is transferred to customers at an amount that reflects the consideration to which the Company expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services.
The Company adopted Topic 606 effective June 30, 2018, using the modified retrospective method to all contracts that were not completed contracts as of the beginning of the fiscal year.
The cumulative effect of adopting Topic 606 was a post-tax increase to the opening retained earnings of $56 million as of June 30, 2018, which was primarily related to our license and royalty revenue arrangements.
These arrangements had no remaining performance obligations but were previously recognized under Topic 605 when they were reported to the Company by its licensees, which was generally one quarter in arrears from the licensees’ sales of the licensed products.
See Note 3, Revenues, for additional disclosures related to this standard.
Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet Adopted



In November 2018, the FASB issued ASU No.
2018-18, “Collaborative Arrangements (Topic 808): Clarifying the Interaction between Topic 808 and Topic 606” (“ASU 2018-18”).
ASU 2018-18 clarifies that certain transactions between collaborative arrangement participants should be accounted for as revenue when the collaborative arrangement participant is a customer in the context of a unit of account and precludes recognizing as revenue consideration received from a collaborative arrangement participant if the participant is not a customer.
This ASU requires retrospective adoption to the date the Company adopted ASC 606 by recognizing a cumulative-effect adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings of the earliest annual period presented.
The amendments are effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2019, which for the Company is the first quarter of fiscal 2021.

NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)



In October 2018, the FASB issued ASU No.
2018-16, “Derivatives and Hedging (Topic 815): Inclusion of the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR) Overnight Index Swap (OIS) Rate as a Benchmark Interest Rate for Hedge Accounting Purposes” (“ASU 2018-16”).
ASU 2018-16 allows for the use of the OIS rate based on the SOFR as a U.S. benchmark interest rate for hedge accounting purposes under Topic 815, Derivatives and Hedging.
For public entities who have adopted ASU 2017-12, the amendments are effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2018, which for the Company is the first quarter of fiscal 2020.
In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU No.
2016-13, “Financial Instruments-Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments” (“ASU 2016-13”).
ASU 2016-13 seeks to provide financial statement users with more decision-useful information about the expected credit losses on financial instruments, including trade receivables, and other commitments to extend credit held by a reporting entity at each reporting date.
The amendments require an entity to replace the incurred loss impairment methodology in current U.S. GAAP with a methodology that reflects current expected credit losses and requires consideration of a broader range of reasonable and supportable information to inform credit loss estimates.
The amendments are effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2019, which for the Company is the first quarter of fiscal 2021.
The Company is currently evaluating the impact this update will have on its Consolidated Financial Statements.
In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No.
2016-02, “Leases (Topic 842)” (“ASU 2016-02”).
ASU 2016-02 supersedes ASC 840 “Leases”.
The amendments in this update require, among other things, that lessees recognize the following for all leases (unless a policy election is made by class of underlying asset to exclude short-term leases) at the commencement date: (1) a lease liability, which is a lessee’s obligation to make lease payments arising from a lease, measured on a discounted basis; and (2) a right-of-use asset, which is an asset that represents the lessee’s right to use, or the direct use of, a specified asset for the lease term.
The FASB issued ASU 2018-11 on July 30, 2018, which allows entities to apply the provisions of ASC 842 at the effective date without adjusting comparative periods.
The standard is effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2018, with early adoption permitted, and provides optional practical expedients to simplify transition.
The Company’s cross-functional project management team continues to identify and evaluate the impact of the amended guidance on the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements and related disclosures, business processes, internal controls, and information systems.
The Company has identified its leases and selected a third-party lease accounting software solution.
The Company is in the process of implementing its lease accounting software solution and changes to its processes and internal controls to address the new lease standard.
The Company’s implementation efforts are progressing as planned.
The Company expects to adopt this standard in the first quarter of fiscal 2020 and elect the transition method provided in ASU 2018-11 to apply Topic 842 as of the date of adoption without adjusting comparative periods.
The Company also expects to elect the package of practical expedients and not reassess prior conclusions including (a) whether its contracts are or contain a lease, (b) lease classification and (c) capitalization of initial direct costs.
The Company continues to evaluate the impact ASU 2016-02 will have on its Consolidated Financial Statements.

Note 3.Revenues 



The Company offers a broad range of data storage products that include Client Devices, Data Center Devices and Solutions, and Client Solutions.
Client Devices consist of hard disk drives (“HDDs”) and solid state drives (“SSDs”) for computing devices; flash-based embedded storage products; and flash-based memory wafers.
Data Center Devices and Solutions consist of high-capacity enterprise HDDs and high-performance enterprise SSDs, data center software and system solutions.
Client Solutions consist of HDDs and SSDs embedded into external storage products and removable flash-based products.
The Company recognizes revenue when it satisfies a performance obligation by transferring control over a product or service to the customer.
The transaction price to be recognized as revenue is adjusted for variable consideration, such as sales incentives, and excludes amounts collected on behalf of third parties, including taxes imposed by governmental authorities.
The Company’s services revenue mainly includes post contract customer support, warranty as a service and maintenance contracts.
The performance obligations for the Company’s services are generally satisfied ratably over the service period based on the nature of the service provided and contract terms.
Revenue for a right to access arrangement is recognized over the contract period using the time lapse method.
For the sales-based royalty arrangements, the Company estimates and recognizes revenue in the period in which customers’ licensable sales occur.
The Company’s customer payment terms are typically less than three months from the date control over the product or service is transferred to the customer.
The Company uses the practical expedient and does not recognize a significant financing component for payment considerations of less than one year.
The financing components of contracts with payment terms were not material.
The Company provides distributors and retailers (collectively referred to as “resellers”) with limited price protection for inventories held by resellers at the time of published list price reductions and/or a right of return.
The Company also provides resellers and original equipment manufacturers (“OEMs”) with other sales incentive programs.
The Company uses judgment in its assessment of variable consideration in contracts to be included in the transaction price.
The Company uses the expected value method to arrive at the amount of variable consideration.
The Company believes the estimate of variable consideration is not constrained and that the expected value method is the appropriate estimate of the amount of variable consideration based on the fact that the Company has a large number of contracts with similar characteristics.
An immaterial amount of the Company’s revenue arrangements include more than one performance obligation, which are typically comprised of tangible products, software and support services for multiple distinct licenses.
For these multiple-element arrangements, the Company evaluates whether each deliverable is a distinct promise and should be accounted for as a separate performance obligation.
If a promised good or service is not distinct in accordance with the revenue guidance, the Company combines that good or service with the other promised goods or services in the arrangement until a distinct bundle of goods is identified.
The Company allocates the transaction price to the performance obligations of each distinct product or service, or distinct bundle, based on their relative standalone selling prices.
Where a separate standalone selling price is not available, the transaction price is based on the Company’s best estimate of the selling price.
The Company uses one or a combination of more than one of the following methods to estimate the standalone selling price: the adjusted market assessment approach, the expected cost plus a margin approach, or another suitable method based on the facts and circumstances.

Contract assets represent the Company’s rights to consideration where performance obligations are completed but the customer payments are not due until another performance obligation is satisfied.
The Company did not have any contract assets as of either March 29, 2019 or the date of adoption of Topic 606.
The Company incurs sales commissions and other direct incremental costs to obtain sales contracts.
Prior to the adoption of the new revenue standard, the Company’s policy was to expense all contract acquisition costs as incurred.
Other direct incremental costs to obtain contracts that have an expected benefit of greater than one year are amortized over the period of expected cash flows from the related contracts, and the amortization expense is recorded as a reduction to revenue.
Total capitalized contract costs and the related amortization as of and for the three and nine months ended March 29, 2019 were not material.
Contract liabilities relate to customers’ payments in advance of performance under the contract and primarily relate to remaining performance obligations under support and maintenance contracts.
As of March 29, 2019 and the date of adoption of Topic 606, contract liabilities were $46 million and $120 million, respectively, and were reflected in Accrued expenses.
Changes in the contract liability balance during the nine months ended March 29, 2019 include $93 million of revenue recognized during the period of which the substantial majority relates to the balance that was deferred at June 29, 2018, partially offset by payments received and billings in advance of satisfying performance obligations.
The Company applies the practical expedients and does not disclose transaction price allocated to the remaining performance obligations for (i) arrangements that have an original expected duration of one year or less, which mainly consist of the support and maintenance contracts, and (ii) variable consideration amounts for sale-based or usage-based royalties for IP license arrangements, which typically range longer than one year.
Remaining performance obligations are mainly attributed to right-to-access patent license arrangements and customer support and service contracts which will be recognized over the remaining contract period.
The transaction price allocated to the remaining performance obligations as of March 29, 2019 was $204 million, which is mainly attributable to the functional IP license and service arrangements.
The Company expects to recognize this amount as revenue as follows: $20 million during the remainder of fiscal 2019, $62 million in fiscal 2020, $47 million in fiscal 2021 and $75 million thereafter.
The impact of the adoption of Topic 606 was not material.
The Company’s top 10 customers accounted for 41% and 45% of its net revenue for the three and nine months ended March 29, 2019, respectively, and 44% and 42% of its net revenue for the three and nine months ended March 30, 2018, respectively.
For the three and nine months ended March 29, 2019 and March 30, 2018, no single customer accounted for 10% or more of the Company’s net revenue.

Goodwill



The Company tests for impairment, at a minimum, on an annual basis or earlier where certain events or changes in circumstances indicate that goodwill may more likely than not be impaired.
The fair value of the Company using a market capitalization approach based on the Company’s share price would include a control premium based on recent transactions that have occurred in the technology industry.
This indicative fair value exceeded the Company’s book value; therefore, management did not believe that it was more likely than not that goodwill was impaired as of March 29, 2019.
18

WESTERN DIGITAL CORPORATION



NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)



The Company’s regularly scheduled annual impairment test is performed as of the first day of its fiscal fourth quarter.
The Company uses qualitative factors to determine whether goodwill is more likely than not impaired and whether a quantitative test for impairment is considered necessary.
If the Company concludes from the qualitative assessment that goodwill is more likely than not impaired, the Company is required to perform a quantitative assessment to determine the amount of impairment.
The Company is required to use judgment when applying the goodwill impairment test, including the identification of reporting units, assignment of assets, liabilities and goodwill to reporting units, and determination of the fair value of each reporting unit.
The Company is in the process of completing its annual impairment test.
IPR&D is initially accounted for as an indefinite-lived intangible asset.
During the three and nine months ended March 29, 2019, the Company reclassified $8 million of acquired IPR&D to existing technology and commenced amortization over its estimated useful life of 2 years.
Level 2.Inputs other than Level 1 that are observable, either directly or indirectly, such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities; quoted prices in markets that are not active; or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities.

Equity Securities Without a Readily Determinable Fair Value (“RDFV”)



From time to time, the Company enters into certain strategic investments for the promotion of business and strategic objectives.
The equity securities of these privately-held companies do not have a RDFV.
Under ASU 2016-01, these equity securities are now measured and recorded using the measurement alternative, which is cost minus impairment, if any, plus or minus changes resulting from qualifying observable price changes.
In addition, the existing impairment model has been replaced with a new one-step qualitative impairment model.
As of March 29, 2019 and June 30, 2018, these investments were not material.

Debt consisted of the following as of March 29, 2019 and June 29, 2018:



[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]



In November 2018, the Company repaid the previously outstanding borrowings under its revolving credit facility.
At March 29, 2019, the Company’s borrowing capacity under the revolving credit facility was $2.25 billion.
The credit agreement governing the Company’s revolving credit facility and term loans (as amended, the “Credit Agreement”) requires the Company to comply with certain financial covenants with respect to the revolving credit facility and Term Loan A-1, consisting of a Leverage Ratio and an Interest Coverage Ratio (each as defined below).
These covenants are based upon a trailing twelve-month consolidated adjusted EBITDA as defined in the Credit Agreement (“Adjusted EBITDA”).
As of March 29, 2019, the Company was in compliance with all financial covenants under the Credit Agreement.
In April 2019, the Company amended the Credit Agreement for the purposes of providing additional flexibility by adjusting the leverage ratio maintenance covenant levels applicable to the term A loan and revolving facilities thereunder and amending the definition of Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA under the financial maintenance covenants to include an addback for certain depreciation related payments with respect to the Company’s Flash Ventures.
As amended, the Company is now required to maintain a maximum ratio of total funded debt to trailing twelve-month Adjusted EBITDA (“Leverage Ratio”) at the end of each quarter of 4.25 to 1.00 through the quarter ending October 2, 2020, 4.00 to 1.00 through the quarter ending July 2, 2021, 3.75 to 1.00 through the quarter ending December 31, 2021, 3.50 to 1.00 through the quarter ending July 1, 2022, and 3.25 to 1.00 thereafter.
In addition, the Company is required to maintain a minimum ratio of Adjusted EBITDA to interest expense (“Interest Coverage Ratio”), both calculated on a trailing twelve-month basis, at the end of each quarter of 3.50 to 1.00.
The Credit Agreement also requires the Company and its subsidiaries to comply with customary covenants that include, among others, limitations on the incurrence of additional debt, liens on property, acquisitions and investments, loans and guarantees, mergers, consolidations, liquidations and dissolutions, asset sales, dividends and other payments in respect of the Company’s capital stock, prepayments of certain debt, transactions with affiliates and certain modifications of organizational documents and certain debt agreements.
In addition, the indentures governing the Company’s 2026 Senior Unsecured Notes and the 2024 Convertible Notes contain restrictive covenants that limit the Company’s and its subsidiaries’ ability to, among other things, consolidate, merge or sell all or substantially all of their assets; create liens; and incur, assume or guarantee additional indebtedness.

In addition, the Company is obligated to pay for half of Flash Ventures’ fixed costs regardless of the output the Company chooses to purchase.
The Company is not able to estimate its total wafer purchase commitment obligation beyond its rolling three-month purchase commitment because the price is determined by reference to the future cost of producing the semiconductor wafers.
In addition, the Company is committed to fund 49.9% to 50.0% of each Flash Ventures entity’s capital investments to the extent that each Flash Ventures entity’s operating cash flow is insufficient to fund these investments.
Flash Ventures has historically operated near 100% of its manufacturing capacity.
Off-Balance Sheet Liabilities



Flash Ventures sells to and leases back from a consortium of financial institutions a portion of its tools and has entered into equipment lease agreements of which the Company guarantees half or all of the outstanding obligations under each lease agreement.
The lease agreements contain customary covenants for Japanese lease facilities.
In addition to containing customary events of default related to Flash Ventures that could result in an acceleration of Flash Ventures’ obligations, the lease agreements contain acceleration clauses for certain events of default related to the guarantors, including the Company.
The following table presents the Company’s portion of the remaining guarantee obligations under the Flash Ventures’ lease facilities in both Japanese yen and U.S. dollar-equivalent, based upon the Japanese yen to U.S. dollar exchange rate as of March 29, 2019.

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]



(1) Weighted average service period assumes the performance metrics are met for the PSUs.
Stock Repurchase Program



The Company’s Board of Directors previously authorized $5.00 billion for the repurchase of the Company’s common stock.
On July 25, 2018, the Company’s Board of Directors authorized a new $5.00 billion share repurchase program that is effective through July 25, 2023, replacing all prior programs.
For the three months ended March 29, 2019, the Company did not make any stock repurchases.
For the nine months ended March 29, 2019, the Company repurchased 0.8 million shares for a total cost of $61 million under the previous authorization and 7.6 million shares for a total cost of $502 million under the new authorization.
Therefore, the Company’s stock repurchases under all stock repurchase authorizations in effect for the nine months ended March 29, 2019 totaled $563 million.
The remaining amount available to be repurchased under the Company’s current stock repurchase program as of March 29, 2019 was $4.50 billion.
Repurchases under the stock repurchase program may be made in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions and may be made under a Rule 10b5-1 plan.
The Company expects stock repurchases to be funded principally by operating cash flows.
Dividends to Shareholders



Since the first quarter of 2013, the Company has issued a quarterly cash dividend.
During the nine months ended March 29, 2019, the Company declared aggregate cash dividends of $1.50 per share on its outstanding common stock totaling $436 million, including $146 million that was paid on April 15, 2019.

NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)



On May 2, 2019, the Board declared a cash dividend of $0.50 per share to shareholders of record as of June 28, 2019, which will be paid on July 15, 2019.
The Company may modify, suspend or cancel its cash dividend policy in any manner and at any time.
As the Company finalized the accounting for the tax effects of the enactment of the 2017 Act during the one-year measurement period permitted by applicable SEC guidance, the Company reflected adjustments to the recorded provisional amounts.
During the second quarter of fiscal 2019, the Company completed its accounting for the tax effects of the enactment of the 2017 Act.
Additional information regarding the significant provisions of the 2017 Act that impacted the Company is provided below.
Re-measurement of deferred taxes



The Company recorded a provisional income tax benefit of $65 million for the year ended June 29, 2018, which related to the re-measurements of the Company’s deferred tax balances and is based primarily on the rates at which the deferred tax assets and liabilities are expected to reverse in the current and future fiscal years, which are generally 29% and 22%, respectively.
As of December 28, 2018, the Company had finalized the accounting for the tax effects related to the re-measurements of the Company’s deferred tax balances with no material change for the six months ended December 28, 2018.
For the year ended June 29, 2018, the Company recorded a provisional amount for the mandatory deemed repatriation tax liability of $1.57 billion for foreign subsidiaries.
During the first quarter of fiscal 2019, the Company reduced its mandatory deemed repatriation tax liability by $302 million, of which $250 million was for the utilization of recorded deferred tax assets related to existing tax attributes.
The utilization of the deferred tax assets was a reclassification that did not have an impact on the Company’s income tax provision for the three months ended September 28, 2018.
The remaining $52 million reduction to the mandatory deemed repatriation tax primarily related to the Company’s decision to no longer carry forward its 2018 operating loss and, instead, apply it against the mandatory deemed repatriation tax.
The Company’s estimate of the mandatory deemed repatriation tax liability after these refinements was $1.26 billion.
The utilization of the deferred tax assets resulted in an income tax benefit of $19 million for the three months ended March 29, 2019 with the remaining amount being a reclassification that did not have an impact on the Company’s income tax provision.
These regulations favorably impacted certain positions previously taken with respect to amounts recorded in the Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements.
As of March 29, 2019, the Company’s estimate of the mandatory deemed repatriation tax liability after these refinements was $1.25 billion, excluding a $146 million liability for unrecognized tax benefits, which increased by $11 million from the second quarter.
During the one-year measurement period, the Company had evaluated the expected manner of recovery to determine whether or not to continue to assert indefinite reinvestment on a part or all the foreign undistributed earnings.
The provisional tax expense recorded by the Company as of June 28, 2018 was based upon an assumption that all of its foreign undistributed earnings are indefinitely reinvested.
As of the second quarter of fiscal 2019, the Company removed its permanent reinvestment assertion and intends to repatriate all of its foreign undistributed earnings.
In addition, a state income tax expense of $54 million was recorded, partially offset by a decrease to the Company’s valuation allowance of $45 million.
This provision is effective for tax years beginning on or after January 1, 2018, which for the Company is the fiscal year that began on June 30, 2018 (fiscal year 2019).
There was no change in the Company’s accounting as a result of this election.
For the three months ended March 29, 2019, these discrete effects consist of income tax benefits of $71 million related to the mandatory deemed repatriation tax.
For the nine months ended March 29, 2019, these discrete effects consist of $107 million related to the mandatory deemed repatriation tax and $152 million related to the Company’s decision to change its indefinite reinvestment assertion.
The net windfall tax benefits related to vesting and exercises of stock-based awards were not material for the three and nine months ended March 29, 2019.
The primary drivers for the difference between the effective tax rate for the three months ended March 30, 2018 and the U.S. Federal statutory rate of 28% included discrete effects consisting of an income tax benefit of $211 million from deductible make-whole premiums and the write-off of unamortized issuance costs from the Company’s debt financing transactions.
The primary drivers for the remaining difference between the effective tax rate for the three and nine months ended March 30, 2018 and the U.S. Federal statutory rate of 28% were tax credits and tax holidays in Malaysia, Philippines, Singapore and Thailand that expired or expire at various dates during fiscal years 2018 through 2030 and net windfall tax benefits related to vesting and exercises of stock-based awards of $46 million and $73 million for the three and nine months ended March 30, 2018, respectively.
During the nine months ended March 29, 2019, the Company recorded an increase of $157 million in its liability for unrecognized tax benefits (excluding accrued interest and penalties).
As of March 29, 2019, the Company’s liability for unrecognized tax benefits (excluding accrued interest and penalties) was approximately $708 million.
Accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as of March 29, 2019 was $120 million.
The Company and the IRS Appeals Office did not reach a settlement on the disputed matters.
The Company filed a petition with the U.S. Tax Court in September 2018.
The Company filed a petition with the U.S. Tax Court in March 2019.
The Company believes that its tax positions are properly supported and will vigorously contest the position taken by the IRS.

Note 12.Net Income (Loss) Per Common Share 



The following table presents the computation of basic and diluted income (loss) per common share:



[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]



The Company computes basic income (loss) per common share using net income (loss) and the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period.
Diluted income (loss) per common share is computed using net income (loss) and the weighted average number of common shares and potentially dilutive common shares outstanding during the period.
Potentially dilutive common shares include dilutive outstanding employee stock options, RSUs and PSUs, and rights to purchase shares of common stock under the Company’s ESPP.
For the three and nine months ended March 29, 2019 and the nine months ended March 30, 2018, the Company reported a net loss, and all outstanding equity awards have been excluded from such periods because including them would be anti-dilutive.
See Note 10, Shareholders’ Equity.
The Company currently expects the closure to be substantially completed by the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019 and to result in total pre-tax charges of approximately $110 million.
These charges are expected to consist of approximately $70 million in employee termination benefits and $40 million in asset-related, contract termination and other charges, of which $56 million were recognized in the year ended June 29, 2018.
During the nine months ended March 29, 2019, the Company recognized an additional $7 million in employee termination benefits and $9 million in asset-related, contract termination and other charges.
The following table presents an analysis of the components of the restructuring charges, payments and adjustments made against the reserve during the nine months ended March 29, 2019:
