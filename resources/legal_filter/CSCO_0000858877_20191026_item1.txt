Basis of Presentation



The fiscal year for Cisco Systems, Inc. (the “Company,” “Cisco,” “we,” “us,” or “our”) is the 52 or 53 weeks ending on the last Saturday in July.
Fiscal 2020 and fiscal 2019 are each 52-week fiscal years.
The Consolidated Financial Statements include our accounts and those of our subsidiaries.
All intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated.
We conduct business globally and are primarily managed on a geographic basis in the following three geographic segments: the Americas; Europe, Middle East, and Africa (EMEA); and Asia Pacific, Japan, and China (APJC).
We have prepared the accompanying financial data as of October 26, 2019 and for the first quarter of fiscal 2020 and fiscal 2019, without audit, pursuant to the rules and regulations of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”).
Certain information and footnote disclosures normally included in financial statements prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (“GAAP”) have been condensed or omitted pursuant to such rules and regulations.
The July 27, 2019 Consolidated Balance Sheet was derived from audited financial statements, but does not include all disclosures required by accounting principles generally accepted in the United States.
However, we believe that the disclosures are adequate to make the information presented not misleading.
Our consolidated financial statements include our accounts and entities consolidated under the variable interest and voting models.
The noncontrolling interests attributed to these investments, if any, are presented as a separate component from our equity in the equity section of the Consolidated Balance Sheets.
The share of earnings attributable to the noncontrolling interests are not presented separately in the Consolidated Statements of Operations as these amounts are not material for any of the fiscal periods presented.
Certain reclassifications have been made to the amounts in prior periods in order to conform to the current period’s presentation.
We have evaluated subsequent events through the date that the financial statements were issued.

Recent Accounting Pronouncements



(a)



New Accounting Updates Recently Adopted



Leases In February 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 842, Leases, a new standard requiring lessees to recognize operating and finance lease liabilities on the balance sheet, as well as corresponding right-of-use (ROU) assets.
This standard also made some changes to lessor accounting and aligns key aspects of the lessor accounting model with the revenue recognition standard.
In addition, new disclosures are required to enable users of financial statements to assess the amount, timing, and uncertainty of cash flows arising from leases.
ASC 842 requires adoption using the modified retrospective approach, with the option of applying the requirements of the standard either i) retrospectively to each prior comparative reporting period presented, or ii) retrospectively at the beginning of the period of adoption.
We adopted this standard at the beginning of our first quarter of fiscal 2020 and applied it at the beginning of the period of adoption and did not restate prior periods.
We adopted ASC 842 on July 28, 2019 which resulted in the recognition of $1.2 billion of operating lease ROU assets included in other assets and $1.2 billion of operating lease liabilities included in other current liabilities and other long-term liabilities.
There were no transition adjustments recorded from the adoption of ASC 842 as a lessor.
We have elected to apply the package of practical expedients permitted under the transition guidance within ASC 842 which does not require reassessment of initial direct costs, classification of a lease and definition of a lease.
As a lessee, we determine if an arrangement is a lease at commencement.
Our ROU lease assets represent our right to use an underlying asset for the lease term and lease liabilities represent our obligation to make lease payments related to the lease.
Operating lease ROU assets and liabilities are recognized at the commencement date based on the present value of lease payments over the lease term.
We use incremental borrowing rates based on information available at the commencement date to determine the present value of our lease payments.

(Unaudited) 



As a lessor, we determine if an arrangement is a lease at inception.
We provide leasing arrangements for our equipment to certain qualified customers.
Our lease portfolio primarily consists of sales-type leases.
Residual value estimates are reviewed on a periodic basis and other-than-temporary declines are expensed in the period they occur.
Our leases generally provide an end-of-term option for the customer to extend the lease under mutually-agreed terms, return the leased equipment, or purchase the equipment for either the then-market value of the equipment or a pre-determined purchase price.
If a customer chooses to terminate their lease prior to the original end of term date, the customer is required to pay all remaining lease payments in full.
For additional information, see Note 8.
The accounting standard update will be effective for us beginning in the first quarter of fiscal 2021 on a modified retrospective basis.
3.
As a result, our contracts may contain multiple performance obligations.
Term software licenses represent multiple obligations, which include software licenses and software maintenance.
We refer to our term software licenses, security software licenses, SaaS, and associated service arrangements as subscription offers.
Transfer of control occurs once the customer has the contractual right to use the product, generally upon shipment or once title and risk of loss has transferred to the customer.
Transfer of control can also occur over time for software maintenance and services as the customer receives the benefit over the contract term.
Term software licenses include multiple performance obligations where the term licenses are recognized upfront upon transfer of control, with the associated software maintenance revenue recognized ratably over the contract term as services and software updates are provided.
SaaS arrangements do not include the right for the customer to take possession of the software during the term, and therefore have one distinct performance obligation which is satisfied over time with revenue recognized ratably over the contract term as the customer consumes the services.
SSP is estimated for each distinct performance obligation and judgment may be required in their determination.
In instances where SSP is not directly observable, we determine SSP using information that may include market conditions and other observable inputs.
Variable consideration includes contractual potential penalties and various rebate, cooperative marketing and other incentive programs that we offer to our distributors, partners and customers.

We assess certain software licenses, such as for security software, that contain critical updates or upgrades which customers can download throughout the contract term.
These updates or upgrades provide the customer the full functionality of the purchased security software licenses and are required to maintain the security license's utility as the risks and threats in the environment are rapidly changing.
In these circumstances, the revenue from these software arrangements is recognized as a single performance obligation satisfied over the contract term.
The following table presents this disaggregation of revenue (in millions):



[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]



Amounts may not sum due to rounding.
(1) During the second quarter of fiscal 2019, we completed the divestiture of the Service Provider Video Software Solutions (“SPVSS”) business.
Total revenue includes SPVSS business revenue of $168 million for the first quarter of fiscal 2019.
We are shifting and expanding more of our business to software and subscriptions across our core networking portfolio.
Term software licenses are multiple performance obligations where the term license is recognized upfront upon transfer of control with the associated software maintenance revenue recognized ratably over the contract term.
SaaS arrangements in this category have one distinct performance obligation which is satisfied over time with revenue recognized ratably over the contract term.
Applications consists of offerings that utilize the core networking and data center platforms to provide their functions.
The products consist primarily of software offerings, including software licenses and SaaS, as well as hardware.
Term software licenses are multiple performance obligations where the term license is recognized upfront upon transfer of control with the associated software maintenance revenue recognized ratably over the contract term.
SaaS arrangements in this category have one distinct performance obligation which is satisfied over time with revenue recognized ratably over the contract term.
Security primarily includes our network security, cloud and email security, identity and access management, advanced threat protection, and unified threat management products.
These products consist of both hardware and software offerings, including software licenses and SaaS.
Updates and upgrades for the term software licenses are critical for our software to perform its intended commercial purpose because of the continuous need for our software to secure our customers' network environments against frequent threats.
Therefore, security software licenses are generally represented by a single distinct performance obligation with revenue recognized ratably over the contract term.
SaaS arrangements in this category have one distinct performance obligation which is satisfied over time with revenue recognized ratably over the contract term.

Other Products primarily includes our cloud and system management products.
These products include both hardware and software licenses.
Our offerings in this category are distinct performance obligations where revenue is recognized upfront upon transfer of control.
In addition to our product offerings, we provide a broad range of service and support options for our customers, including technical support services and advanced services.
Technical support services represent the majority of these offerings which are distinct performance obligations that are satisfied over time with revenue recognized ratably over the contract term.
Advanced services are distinct performance obligations that are satisfied over time with revenue recognized as services are delivered.
The sales arrangements as discussed above are typically made pursuant to customer purchase orders based on master purchase or partner agreements.
Cash is received based on our standard payment terms which is typically 30 days.
We provide financing arrangements to customers for all of our hardware, software and service offerings.
Refer to Note 9 for additional information.
For these arrangements, cash is typically received over time.
(b)Contract Balances



Accounts receivable, net was $4.9 billion as of October 26, 2019 compared to $5.5 billion as of July 27, 2019, as reported on the Consolidated Balance Sheet.
Contract assets consist of unbilled receivables and are recorded when revenue is recognized in advance of scheduled billings to our customers.
These amounts are primarily related to software and service arrangements where transfer of control has occurred but we have not yet invoiced.
As of October 26, 2019 and July 27, 2019, our contract assets for these unbilled receivables were $954 million and $860 million, respectively, and were included in other current assets and other assets.
Deferred revenue was $18.6 billion as of October 26, 2019 compared to $18.5 billion as of July 27, 2019.
We recognized approximately $3.7 billion of revenue during the first quarter of fiscal 2020, that was included in the deferred revenue balance at July 27, 2019.
(c)Remaining Performance Obligations



Remaining Performance Obligations (RPO) are comprised of deferred revenue plus unbilled contract revenue.
As of October 26, 2019, the aggregate amount of RPO was $24.9 billion, comprised of $18.6 billion of deferred revenue and $6.3 billion of unbilled contract revenue.
We expect approximately 56% of this amount to be recognized as revenue over the next year.
As of July 27, 2019, the aggregate amount of RPO was $25.3 billion, comprised of $18.5 billion of deferred revenue and $6.8 billion of unbilled contract revenue.
(d)Capitalized Contract Acquisition Costs



We capitalize direct and incremental costs incurred to acquire contracts, primarily sales commissions, for which the associated revenue is expected to be recognized in future periods.
We incur these costs in connection with both initial contracts and renewals.
These costs are initially deferred and typically amortized over the term of the customer contract which corresponds to the period of benefit.
Deferred sales commissions were $707 million and $750 million as of October 26, 2019 and July 27, 2019, respectively, and were included in other current assets and other assets.
4.
Acquisitions and Divestitures



We completed four acquisitions during the first quarter of fiscal 2020.
A summary of the allocation of the total purchase consideration is presented as follows (in millions):



[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]



The total purchase consideration related to acquisitions completed during the first quarter of fiscal 2020 consisted of cash consideration.
The total cash and cash equivalents acquired from these acquisitions was approximately $10 million.
Total transaction costs related to acquisition and divestiture activities were $5 million and $10 million for the first quarter of fiscal 2020 and 2019, respectively.

The goodwill generated from acquisitions completed during the first quarter of fiscal 2020 is primarily related to expected synergies.
Pending Acquisition of Acacia Communications On July 9, 2019, we announced our intent to acquire Acacia Communications, Inc. (“Acacia”), a public fabless semiconductor company that develops, manufactures and sells high-speed coherent optical interconnect products that are designed to transform communications networks through improvements in performance, capacity and cost.
Under the terms of the agreement, we have agreed to pay total consideration of approximately $2.6 billion, net of cash and marketable securities, to acquire Acacia.
The acquisition is expected to close during the second half of fiscal 2020, subject to customary closing conditions and regulatory approvals.
Upon close of the acquisition, revenue from Acacia will be included in our Infrastructure Platforms product category.

Restructuring and Other Charges



We initiated a restructuring plan during fiscal 2018 (the “Fiscal 2018 Plan”) in order to realign the organization and enable further investment in key priority areas with estimated pretax charges of approximately $600 million.
These aggregate pretax charges are primarily cash-based and consist of employee severance and other one-time termination benefits, and other associated costs.
In connection with the Fiscal 2018 Plan, we have incurred charges of $184 million for the first quarter of fiscal 2020, and have incurred cumulative charges of $614 million.
We do not expect to incur significant charges under the Fiscal 2018 Plan in the future and expect this plan to be substantially completed in the first half of fiscal 2020.

(b)Lessor Arrangements



Our leases primarily represent sales-type leases with terms of four years on average.
We provide leasing of our equipment and complementary third-party products primarily through our channel partners and distributors, for which the income arising from these leases is recognized through interest income.
Interest income for the first quarter of fiscal 2020 was $26 million and was included in interest income in the Consolidated Statement of Operations.
The net investment of our lease receivables is measured at the commencement date as the gross lease receivable, residual value less unearned income and allowance for credit loss.
For additional information, see Note 9.
Future minimum lease payments on our lease receivables as of October 26, 2019 are summarized as follows (in millions):

Financing Receivables 



(a)Financing Receivables 



Financing receivables primarily consist of lease receivables, loan receivables, and financed service contracts.
Lease receivables consist of arrangements with terms of four years on average.
Loan receivables represent financing arrangements related to the sale of our hardware, software, and services, which may include additional funding for other costs associated with network installation and integration of our products and services.
Loan receivables have terms of three years on average.
Financed service contracts include financing receivables related to technical support and advanced services.
Revenue related to the technical support services is typically deferred and included in deferred service revenue and is recognized ratably over the period during which the related services are to be performed, which typically ranges from one to three years.
A summary of our financing receivables is presented as follows (in millions):

(b)Credit Quality of Financing Receivables



Gross receivables, excluding residual value, less unearned income categorized by our internal credit risk rating as of October 26, 2019 and July 27, 2019 are summarized as follows (in millions): 



[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]



[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]



We determine the adequacy of our allowance for credit loss by assessing the risks and losses inherent in our financing receivables by portfolio segment.
The portfolio segment is based on the types of financing offered by us to our customers, which consist of the following: lease receivables, loan receivables, and financed service contracts.
Our internal credit risk ratings of 1 through 4 correspond to investment-grade ratings, while credit risk ratings of 5 and 6 correspond to non-investment grade ratings.
Credit risk ratings of 7 and higher correspond to substandard ratings.
The following tables present the aging analysis of gross receivables, excluding residual value and less unearned income as of October 26, 2019 and July 27, 2019 (in millions): 



[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]



[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]



Past due financing receivables are those that are 31 days or more past due according to their contractual payment terms.
The data in the preceding tables is presented by contract, and the aging classification of each contract is based on the oldest outstanding receivable, and therefore past due amounts also include unbilled and current receivables within the same contract.
As of October 26, 2019, we had financing receivables of $188 million, net of unbilled or current receivables, that were greater than 120 days plus past due but remained on accrual status as they are well secured and in the process of collection.
Such balance was $215 million as of July 27, 2019.

(c)Allowance for Credit Loss Rollforward 



The allowances for credit loss and the related financing receivables are summarized as follows (in millions): 



[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]



[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]



We assess the allowance for credit loss related to financing receivables on either an individual or a collective basis.
When the evaluation indicates that it is probable that all amounts due pursuant to the contractual terms of the financing agreement, including scheduled interest payments, are unable to be collected, the financing receivable is considered impaired.
All such outstanding amounts, including any accrued interest, will be assessed and fully reserved at the customer level.
Our internal credit risk ratings are categorized as 1 through 10, with the lowest credit risk rating representing the highest quality financing receivables.
Typically, we also consider receivables with a risk rating of 8 or higher to be impaired and will include them in the individual assessment for allowance.
These balances, as of October 26, 2019 and July 27, 2019, are presented under “(b) Credit Quality of Financing Receivables” above.
We evaluate the remainder of our financing receivables portfolio for impairment on a collective basis and record an allowance for credit loss at the portfolio segment level.

Available-for-Sale Debt Investments and Equity Investments



The following table summarizes our available-for-sale debt investments and equity investments (in millions):



[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]



(1) We held equity interests in certain private equity funds of $0.7 billion and $0.6 billion as of October 26, 2019 and July 27, 2019, respectively, which are accounted for under the NAV practical expedient.
These transactions are accounted for as a secured lending of the securities, and the securities are typically loaned only on an overnight basis.
The average daily balance of securities lending was $21 million and $0.5 billion for the first quarter of fiscal 2020 and 2019, respectively.
We require collateral equal to at least 102% of the fair market value of the loaned security and that the collateral be in the form of cash or liquid, high-quality assets.
We engage in these secured lending transactions only with highly creditworthy counterparties, and the associated portfolio custodian has agreed to indemnify us against collateral losses.
We did not experience any losses in connection with the secured lending of securities during the periods presented.
As of October 26, 2019 and July 27, 2019, we had no outstanding securities lending transactions.
(d)Variable Interest Entities



In the ordinary course of business, we have investments in privately held companies and provide financing to certain customers.
These privately held companies and customers are evaluated for consolidation under the variable interest or voting interest entity models.
As of October 26, 2019, the carrying value of investments in privately held companies was $1.2 billion.
$659 million of such investments are considered to be in variable interest entities which are unconsolidated.
We have total funding commitments of $311 million related to these privately held investments, some of which are based on the achievement of certain agreed-upon milestones, and some of which are required to be funded on demand.
11.
Fair Value 



Fair value is defined as the price that would be received from selling an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date.
(a)Fair Value Hierarchy



The accounting guidance for fair value measurement requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value.
The standard establishes a fair value hierarchy based on the level of 



23

CISCO SYSTEMS, INC.



NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)



(Unaudited) 



independent, objective evidence surrounding the inputs used to measure fair value.
A financial instrument’s categorization within the fair value hierarchy is based upon the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement.
The fair value hierarchy is as follows:



Level 1 applies to assets or liabilities for which there are quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
Level 2 applies to assets or liabilities for which there are inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability, such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets; quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in markets with insufficient volume or infrequent transactions (less active markets); or model-derived valuations in which significant inputs are observable or can be derived principally from, or corroborated by, observable market data.
Level 3 applies to assets or liabilities for which there are unobservable inputs to the valuation methodology that are significant to the measurement of the fair value of the assets or liabilities.
(b)Assets and Liabilities Measured at Fair Value on a Recurring Basis



Assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis were as follows (in millions):



[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]



Level 1 marketable equity securities are determined by using quoted prices in active markets for identical assets.
Our derivative instruments are primarily classified as Level 2, as they are not actively traded and are valued using pricing models that use observable market inputs.
We did not have any transfers between Level 1 and Level 2 fair value measurements during the periods presented.

(c)Assets Measured at Fair Value on a Nonrecurring Basis



The following table presents gains and losses on assets that were measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis (in millions):



[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]



These assets were measured at fair value due to events or circumstances we identified as having significant impact on their fair value during the respective periods.
The carrying value of our non-marketable equity securities recorded to fair value on a non-recurring basis is adjusted for observable transactions for identical or similar investments of the same issuer or impairment.
These securities are classified as Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy because we estimate the value based on valuation methods using the observable transaction price at the transaction date and other unobservable inputs such as volatility, rights, and obligations of the securities we hold.
(d) Other Fair Value Disclosures 



The fair value of short-term loan receivables and financed service contracts approximates their carrying value due to their short duration.
The aggregate carrying value of long-term loan receivables and financed service contracts as of October 26, 2019 and July 27, 2019 was $3.6 billion and $3.7 billion, respectively.
The estimated fair value of long-term loan receivables and financed service contracts approximates their carrying value.
We use significant unobservable inputs in determining discounted cash flows to estimate the fair value of our long-term loan receivables and financed service contracts, and therefore they are categorized as Level 3.
As of October 26, 2019, the estimated fair value of our short-term debt approximates its carrying value due to the short maturities.
As of October 26, 2019, the fair value of our senior notes and other long-term debt was $20.3 billion with a carrying amount of $18.5 billion.
This compares to a fair value of $22.1 billion and a carrying amount of $20.5 billion as of July 27, 2019.
The fair value of the senior notes and other long-term debt was determined based on observable market prices in a less active market and was categorized as Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy.

Borrowings 



(a)Short-Term Debt



The following table summarizes our short-term debt (in millions, except percentages):



[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]



We have a short-term debt financing program of up to $10.0 billion through the issuance of commercial paper notes.
We use the proceeds from the issuance of commercial paper notes for general corporate purposes.
The effective rates for the short- and long-term debt include the interest on the notes, the accretion of the discount, the issuance costs, and, if applicable, adjustments related to hedging.

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]



We entered into interest rate swaps in prior periods with an aggregate notional amount of $4.5 billion designated as fair value hedges of certain of our fixed-rate senior notes.
These swaps convert the fixed interest rates of the fixed-rate notes to floating interest rates based on the London InterBank Offered Rate (“LIBOR”).
For additional information, see Note 13.
Interest is payable semiannually on each class of the senior fixed-rate notes and payable quarterly on the floating-rate notes.
Each of the senior fixed-rate notes is redeemable by us at any time, subject to a make-whole premium.
The senior notes rank at par with the commercial paper notes that may be issued in the future pursuant to our short-term debt financing program, as discussed above under “(a) Short-Term Debt.” As of October 26, 2019, we were in compliance with all debt covenants.

(c)Credit Facility



On May 15, 2015, we entered into a credit agreement with certain institutional lenders that provides for a $3.0 billion unsecured revolving credit facility that is scheduled to expire on May 15, 2020.
Any advances under the credit agreement will accrue interest at rates that are equal to, based on certain conditions, either (i) the highest of (a) the Federal Funds rate plus 0.50%, (b) Bank of America’s “prime rate” as announced from time to time, or (c) LIBOR, or a comparable or successor rate that is approved by the Administrative Agent (“Eurocurrency Rate”), for an interest period of one-month plus 1.00%, or (ii) the Eurocurrency Rate, plus a margin that is based on our senior debt credit ratings as published by Standard & Poor’s Financial Services, LLC and Moody’s Investors Service, Inc., provided that in no event will the Eurocurrency Rate be less than zero.
We may also, upon the agreement of either the then-existing lenders or additional lenders not currently parties to the agreement, increase the commitments under the credit facility by up to an additional $2.0 billion and/or extend the expiration date of the credit facility up to May 15, 2022.
This credit agreement requires that we comply with certain covenants, including that we maintain an interest coverage ratio as defined in the agreement.
As of October 26, 2019, we were in compliance with the required interest coverage ratio and the other covenants, and we had not borrowed any funds under this credit facility.

Derivative Instruments 



(a)Summary of Derivative Instruments



We use derivative instruments primarily to manage exposures to foreign currency exchange rate, interest rate, and equity price risks.
We do, however, seek to mitigate such risks by limiting our counterparties to major financial institutions.
In addition, the potential risk of loss with any one counterparty resulting from this type of credit risk is monitored.
However, our master netting and other similar arrangements with the respective counterparties allow for net settlement under certain conditions, which are designed to reduce credit risk by permitting net settlement with the same counterparty.
As of October 26, 2019 and July 27, 2019, the potential effects of these rights of set-off associated with the derivative contracts would be a reduction to both derivative assets and derivative liabilities of $7 million and $13 million, respectively.
To further limit credit risk, we also enter into collateral security arrangements related to certain derivative instruments whereby cash is posted as collateral between the counterparties based on the fair market value of the derivative instrument.
Under these collateral security arrangements, the net cash collateral received as of October 26, 2019 and July 27, 2019 was $94 million and $76 million, respectively.
Including the effects of collateral, this results in a net derivative asset of $1 million and a net derivative liability of $2 million as of October 26, 2019 and July 27, 2019, respectively.
(c)Foreign Currency Exchange Risk



We conduct business globally in numerous currencies.
Therefore, we are exposed to adverse movements in foreign currency exchange rates.
To limit the exposure related to foreign currency changes, we enter into foreign currency contracts.
We do not enter into such contracts for speculative purposes.
These currency options and forward contracts, designated as cash flow hedges, generally have maturities of less than 24 months.
The derivative instrument’s gain or loss is initially reported as a component of AOCI and subsequently reclassified into earnings when the hedged exposure affects earnings.
During the periods presented, we did not discontinue any cash flow hedges for which it was probable that a forecasted transaction would not occur.
We enter into foreign exchange forward and option contracts to reduce the short-term effects of foreign currency fluctuations on assets and liabilities such as foreign currency receivables, including long-term customer financings, investments, and payables.
These derivatives are not designated as hedging instruments.
Gains and losses on the contracts are included in other income (loss), net, and substantially offset foreign exchange gains and losses from the remeasurement of intercompany balances or other current assets, investments, or liabilities denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the reporting entity.
These derivative instruments generally have maturities of up to six months.
(d)Interest Rate Risk



Interest Rate Derivatives Designated as Fair Value Hedges, Long-Term Debt We hold interest rate swaps designated as fair value hedges related to fixed-rate senior notes that are due in fiscal 2020 through 2025.
Under these interest rate swaps, we receive fixed-rate interest payments and make interest payments based on LIBOR plus a fixed number of basis points.
The effect of such swaps is to convert the fixed interest rates of the senior fixed-rate notes to floating interest rates based on LIBOR.
The gains and losses related to changes in the fair value of the interest rate swaps are included in interest expense and substantially offset changes in the fair value of the hedged portion of the underlying debt that are attributable to the changes in market interest rates.
To diversify our overall portfolio, we also hold equity derivatives that are not designated as accounting hedges.
The change in the fair value of each of these investment types are included in other income (loss), net.
Although not designated as accounting hedges, we utilize derivatives such as total return swaps to economically hedge this exposure and offset the related compensation expense.

Commitments and Contingencies 



(a)Purchase Commitments with Contract Manufacturers and Suppliers 



We purchase components from a variety of suppliers and use several contract manufacturers to provide manufacturing services for our products.
During the normal course of business, in order to manage manufacturing lead times and help ensure adequate component supply, we enter into agreements with contract manufacturers and suppliers that either allow them to procure inventory based upon criteria as defined by us or establish the parameters defining our requirements.
Certain of these purchase commitments with contract manufacturers and suppliers relate to arrangements to secure long-term pricing for certain product components for multi-year periods.
As of October 26, 2019 and July 27, 2019, the liability for these purchase commitments was $121 million and $129 million, respectively, and was included in other current liabilities.
The following table summarizes the compensation expense related to acquisitions (in millions):



[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]



As of October 26, 2019, we estimated that future cash compensation expense of up to $430 million may be required to be recognized pursuant to the applicable business combination agreements.
We also have certain funding commitments, primarily related to our non-marketable equity and other investments, some of which are based on the achievement of certain agreed-upon milestones, and some of which are required to be funded on demand.
The funding commitments were $311 million and $326 million as of October 26, 2019 and July 27, 2019, respectively.
Our products are generally covered by a warranty for periods ranging from 90 days to five years, and for some products we provide a limited lifetime warranty.
(d)Financing and Other Guarantees



In the ordinary course of business, we provide financing guarantees for various third-party financing arrangements extended to channel partners and end-user customers.
Payments under these financing guarantee arrangements were not material for the periods presented.

Channel Partner Financing Guarantees We facilitate arrangements for third-party financing extended to channel partners, consisting of revolving short-term financing, generally with payment terms ranging from 60 to 90 days.
These financing arrangements facilitate the working capital requirements of the channel partners, and, in some cases, we guarantee a portion of these arrangements.
The volume of channel partner financing was $7.6 billion and $7.2 billion for the first quarter of fiscal 2020 and 2019, respectively.
The balance of the channel partner financing subject to guarantees was $1.2 billion and $1.4 billion as of October 26, 2019 and July 27, 2019, respectively.
End-User Financing Guarantees We also provide financing guarantees for third-party financing arrangements extended to end-user customers related to leases and loans, which typically have terms of up to three years.
The volume of financing provided by third parties for leases and loans as to which we had provided guarantees was $5 million and $3 million for the first quarter of fiscal 2020 and 2019, respectively.
These agreements may limit the time within which an indemnification claim can be made and the amount of the claim.
Charter Communications, Inc., which acquired Time Warner Cable (“TWC”) in May 2016, is seeking indemnification from us for a final judgment obtained by Sprint Communications Company, L.P. (“Sprint”) against TWC in federal court in Kansas.
Following a trial on March 3, 2017, a jury in Kansas found that TWC willfully infringed five Sprint patents and awarded Sprint $139.8 million in damages.
On March 14, 2017, the Kansas court declined Sprint's request for enhanced damages and entered judgment in favor of Sprint for $139.8 million plus 1.06% in post-judgment interest.
On May 30, 2017, the Court awarded Sprint $20.3 million in pre-judgment interest and denied TWC's post-trial motions.
TWC appealed to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, and, on November 30, 2018, a panel of the court affirmed the judgment.
TWC filed a petition for rehearing en banc on January 29, 2019, which was denied on March 19, 2019.
TWC petitioned the U.S. Supreme Court for review of the judgment, which was denied on November 4, 2019.
In addition, we have entered into indemnification agreements with our officers and directors, and our Amended and Restated Bylaws contain similar indemnification obligations to our agents.
It is not possible to determine the maximum potential amount under these indemnification agreements due to our limited history with prior indemnification claims and the unique facts and circumstances involved in each particular agreement.

(f)Legal Proceedings



Brazil Brazilian authorities have investigated our Brazilian subsidiary and certain of our former employees, as well as a Brazilian importer of our products, and its affiliates and employees, relating to alleged evasion of import taxes and alleged improper transactions involving the subsidiary and the importer.
We do not expect a final judicial determination for several years.
SRI International  On September 4, 2013, SRI International, Inc. (“SRI”) asserted patent infringement claims against us in the U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware, accusing our products and services in the area of network intrusion detection of infringing two U.S. patents.
The trial on these claims began on May 2, 2016 and, on May 12, 2016, the jury returned a verdict finding willful infringement of the asserted patents.
The jury awarded SRI damages of $23.7 million.
On May 25, 2017, the Court awarded SRI enhanced damages and attorneys’ fees, entered judgment in the new amount of $57.0 million, and ordered an ongoing royalty of 3.5% through the expiration of the patents in 2018.
We appealed to the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit on various grounds, a panel of which, after various proceedings, on July 12, 2019, issued an opinion vacating the enhanced damages award; vacating and remanding in part the willful infringement finding; vacating and remanding the attorneys’ fees award for further proceedings; and affirming the district court's other findings.
Cisco paid SRI $28.1 million, representing the portion of the judgment that the Federal Circuit affirmed, plus interest and royalties on post-verdict sales.
This payment is subject to a refund if any portion of the affirmed judgment is reversed or vacated by the U.S. Supreme Court.
On November 8, 2019, Cisco filed a petition for a writ of certiorari with the U.S. Supreme Court, seeking review of the judgment on the grounds that the asserted patents describe patent-ineligible subject matter.
Straight Path On September 24, 2014, Straight Path IP Group, Inc. (“Straight Path”) asserted patent infringement claims against us in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California, accusing our 9971 IP Phone, Unified Communications Manager working in conjunction with 9971 IP Phones, and Video Communication Server products of infringement.
On November 13, 2017, the Court granted our motion for summary judgment of non-infringement, thereby dismissing Straight Path's claims against us and cancelling a trial which had been set for March 12, 2018.
Straight Path appealed to the U.S. Court of Appeal for the Federal Circuit, and, on January 23, 2019, the court summarily affirmed the finding of non-infringement.
On August 23, 2019, Straight Path filed a petition with the United States Supreme Court challenging the constitutionality of the Federal Circuit’s rule allowing summary affirmance, which was denied on November 18, 2019.
Oyster Optics On November 24, 2016, Oyster Optics, LLC (“Oyster”) asserted patent infringement claims against us in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Texas.
Oyster alleges that certain Cisco ONS 15454 and NCS 2000 line cards infringe U.S. Patent No.
7,620,327 (“the ‘327 Patent”).
Oyster seeks monetary damages.
Oyster's cases against some of the defendants were resolved.
The court vacated the November 4, 2018 trial date set for Oyster's claims against Cisco and one other remaining defendant, pending resolution of Oyster's appeal of the court's summary judgment ruling dismissing certain of Oyster's claims.
Oyster appealed the summary judgment ruling on December 6, 2018.

Employee Benefit Plans 



(a)Employee Stock Incentive Plans



Stock Incentive Plan Program Description As of October 26, 2019, we had one stock incentive plan: the 2005 Stock Incentive Plan (the “2005 Plan”).
In addition, we have, in connection with our acquisitions of various companies, assumed the share-based awards granted under stock incentive plans of the acquired companies or issued share-based awards in replacement thereof.
Share-based awards are designed to reward employees for their long-term contributions to us and provide incentives for them to remain with Cisco.
The number and frequency of share-based awards are based on competitive practices, operating results of Cisco, government regulations, and other factors.
Employees (including employee directors and executive officers) and consultants of Cisco and its subsidiaries and affiliates and non-employee directors of Cisco are eligible to participate in the 2005 Plan.
As of October 26, 2019, the maximum number of shares issuable under the 2005 Plan over its term was 694 million shares.
The 2005 Plan may be terminated by the Board of Directors at any time and for any reason, and is currently set to terminate at the 2021 Annual Meeting unless re-adopted or extended by the shareholders prior to or on such date.
Under the 2005 Plan’s share reserve feature, a distinction is made between the number of shares in the reserve attributable to (i) stock options and SARs and (ii) “full value” awards (i.e., stock grants and stock units).
Shares issued as stock grants, pursuant to stock units or pursuant to the settlement of dividend equivalents are counted against shares available for issuance under the 2005 Plan on a 1.5-to-1 ratio.
If awards issued under the 2005 Plan are forfeited or terminated for any reason before being exercised or settled, then the shares underlying such awards, plus the number of additional shares, if any, that counted against shares available for issuance under the 2005 Plan at the time of grant as a result of the application of the share ratio described above, will become available again for issuance under the 2005 Plan.
(b)Employee Stock Purchase Plan



We have an Employee Stock Purchase Plan under which 721.4 million shares of our common stock have been reserved for issuance as of October 26, 2019.
Eligible employees are offered shares through a 24-month offering period, which consists of four consecutive 6-month purchase periods.
The Employee Stock Purchase Plan is scheduled to terminate on the earlier of (i) January 3, 2030 and (ii) the date on which all shares available for issuance under the Employee Stock Purchase Plan are sold pursuant to exercised purchase rights.
No shares were issued under the Employee Stock Purchase Plan during each of the first quarters of fiscal 2020 and 2019.
As of October 26, 2019, 159 million shares were available for issuance under the Employee Stock Purchase Plan.
(c)Summary of Share-Based Compensation Expense



Share-based compensation expense consists primarily of expenses for stock options, stock purchase rights, restricted stock, and RSUs granted to employees.
The following table summarizes share-based compensation expense (in millions):



[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]



As of October 26, 2019, the total compensation cost related to unvested share-based awards not yet recognized was $3.1 billion which is expected to be recognized over approximately 2.8 years on a weighted-average basis.

(d)Share-Based Awards Available for Grant



A summary of share-based awards available for grant is as follows (in millions):



[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]



For each share awarded as restricted stock or a restricted stock unit award under the 2005 Plan, 1.5 shares was deducted from the available share-based award balance.
For restricted stock units that were awarded with vesting contingent upon the achievement of future financial performance or market-based metrics, the maximum awards that can be achieved upon full vesting of such awards were reflected in the preceding table.
On the date of grant, we estimated the fair value of the total shareholder return (“TSR”) component of the PRSUs using a Monte Carlo simulation model.
For the awards based on financial performance metrics or comparative market-based returns, generally 50% of the PRSUs are earned based on the average of annual operating cash flow and earnings per share goals established at the beginning of each fiscal year over a three-year performance period.
Generally, the remaining 50% of the PRSUs are earned based on our TSR measured against the benchmark TSR of a peer group over the same period.

Employee equity share options, unvested shares, and similar equity instruments granted and assumed by Cisco are treated as potential common shares outstanding in computing diluted earnings per share.
Diluted shares outstanding include the dilutive effect of in-the-money options, unvested restricted stock, and restricted stock units.
The dilutive effect of such equity awards is calculated based on the average share price for each fiscal period using the treasury stock method.
Under the treasury stock method, the amount the employee must pay for exercising stock options and the amount of compensation cost for future service that has not yet been recognized are collectively assumed to be used to repurchase shares.
