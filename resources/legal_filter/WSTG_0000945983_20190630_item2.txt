Forward Looking Statements  



 This report includes “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”).
The Company operates in a rapidly changing business, and new risk factors emerge from time to time.
The Company undertakes no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.

These estimates require significant judgement to determine whether the software’s functionality is dependent on ongoing maintenance or if substantially all functionality is available in the original software download.
We also use judgement in the allocation of sales proceeds among performance obligations, utilizing observable data such as stand-alone selling prices, or market pricing for similar products and services.
Allowance for Accounts Receivable  



 The Company maintains allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers to make required payments.
Management determines the estimate of the allowance for uncollectible accounts receivable by considering a number of factors, including: historical experience, aging of the accounts receivable, and specific information obtained by the Company on the financial condition and the current creditworthiness of its customers.
At the time of sale, we record an estimate for sales returns based on historical experience.
If actual sales returns are greater than estimated by management, additional expense may be incurred.
Accounts Receivable – Long Term  



 In limited circumstances, the Company offers extended payment terms to customers for periods of 12 to 48 months.
The related customer receivables are classified as accounts receivable long-term and discounted to their present value at prevailing market rates at the time of sale.
In subsequent periods, the accounts receivable is increased to the amounts due and payable by the customers through the accretion of interest income on the unpaid accounts receivable due in future years.
The amounts under these long-term accounts receivable due within one year are reclassified to the current portion of accounts receivable.
At times the Company sells receivables to a financial institution on a non-recourse basis for cash, less a discount.
The net proceeds from such sales are included in the operating section of the statement of cash flows as changes in accounts receivable.

 Table of Contents  



 Inventory Allowances  



 The Company writes down its inventory for estimated obsolescence or unmarketable inventory equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated market value based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions.
If actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management, additional inventory write-offs may be required.
In the event the Company were to determine that it would not be able to realize all or part of its net deferred tax assets in the future, an adjustment to the deferred tax assets would be charged to income in the period such determination was made.
Share-Based Payments  



 Under the fair value recognition provision, stock-based compensation cost is measured at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and is recognized as expense on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period.
We record the impact of forfeitures when they occur.
Such changes may lead to a significant change in the expense we recognize in connection with share-based payments.
Interest, Net  



 Interest, net consists primarily of income from the amortization of the discount on accounts receivable long term, net of interest expense on the Company’s credit facility.
Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements  



 In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02, Leases ("ASU 2016-02").
ASU 2016-02 supersedes the lease guidance under FASB ASC Topic 840, Leases, resulting in the creation of FASB ASC Topic 842, Leases.
ASU 2016-02 requires a lessee to recognize in the statement of financial position a liability to make lease payments (the lease liability) and a right-of-use asset representing its right to use the underlying asset for the lease term from operating leases.
For leases with a term of 12 months or less, a lessee is permitted to make an accounting policy election by class of underlying asset not to recognize lease assets and lease liabilities.
In transition, lessees and lessors were originally required to recognize and measure leases at the beginning of the earliest period presented using a modified retrospective approach.
In July 2018, FASB issued ASU No.
2018-11, Targeted Improvements.
This update still requires modified retrospective transition; however, it adds the option to initially apply the new standard at the adoption date and recognize a cumulative-effect adjustment in the current period instead of at the beginning of the earliest period presented.
Under this option, comparative periods presented in the financial statements in which the new lease standard is adopted will continue to be presented in accordance with prior guidance.
The Company adopted the new accounting standard on January 1, 2019 using the modified retrospective transition option.
The new standard provides optional practical expedients in transition, which the Company has elected as a package permitting the Company to not reassess under the new standard prior conclusions regarding lease identification, lease classification and initial direct costs.
Also, in accordance with the new standard, the Company has elected in transition and for an ongoing basis not to apply the recognition requirements for all short-term leases.
The adoption of the new standard had a material effect on the Company’s financial statements, with the most significant effects of adoption relating to (1) the recognition of new right-of-use assets and lease liabilities on its balance sheet for real estate operating leases; and (2) providing significant new disclosures about its leasing activities.
Upon adoption, the Company recognized operating lease liabilities of approximately $3.0 million based on the present value of the remaining minimum rental payments for existing operating leases.
The Company also recognized corresponding right-of-use assets, net of lease incentives of approximately $2.2 million.
There was no impact to stockholders’ equity from the adoption.
In June 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No.
2016-13, Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326) ("ASU No.
2016-13").
ASU No.
2016-13 revises the methodology for measuring credit losses on financial

instruments and the timing of when such losses are recorded.
ASU No.
2016-13 is effective for the Company in the first quarter of 2020, with early adoption permitted, and is to be applied using a modified retrospective approach.
The Company is currently evaluating the potential effects of adopting the provisions of ASU No.
2016-13 on its Consolidated Financial Statements, particularly its recognition of allowances for accounts receivable.
The new standard became effective for the Company beginning with the first quarter of 2019.
The adoption of this guidance did not have a material impact on the Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements.
In June 2018, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) No.
2018-07, “Compensation — Stock Compensation (Topic 718), Improvements to Nonemployee Share-Based Payment Accounting” (“ASU 2018-07”), which aligns the measurement and classification guidance for share-based payments to nonemployees with that for employees, with certain exceptions.
It expands the scope of ASC 718 to include share-based payments granted to nonemployees in exchange for goods or services used or consumed in the entity’s own operations and supersedes the guidance in ASC 505-50.
The ASU retains the existing cost attribution guidance, which requires entities to recognize compensation cost for nonemployee awards in the same period and in the same manner (i.e., capitalize or expense) they would if they paid cash for the goods or services, but it moves the guidance to ASC 718.
The new standard became effective for the Company beginning with the first quarter of 2019.
The adoption of this guidance did not have a material impact on the Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements.
In July 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-09 – Codification Improvements (“ASU 2018-09”), which facilitates amendments to a variety of topics to clarify, correct errors in, or make minor improvements to the accounting standards codification.
The effective date of the standard is dependent on the facts and circumstances of each amendment.
Some amendments do not require transition guidance and will be effective upon the issuance of this standard.
A majority of the amendments in ASU 2018-09 became effective for the Company beginning with the first quarter of 2019.
The adoption of this guidance did not have a material impact on the Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements.
We believe that important measures and ratios include net sales, gross margin, adjusted gross billings, gross profit as a percentage of gross billings, net income as a percentage of net sales, net income as a percentage of gross billings, net income excluding separation expenses, net of taxes and diluted earnings per share excluding separation expenses, net of taxes.
These key indicators include financial information that is prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP and presented in our consolidated financial

When including non-GAAP performance measurements tools, we provide a reconciliation to the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP measure.
We provided a reconciliation of adjusted gross billings to net sales, which is the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP measure.

 Liquidity and Capital Resources  



 Our cash and cash equivalents decreased to $9.4 million as of June 30, 2019 compared to $14.9 million as of December 31, 2018.
The decrease in cash and cash equivalents was primarily the result of $3.9 million of cash and cash equivalents used in operating activities and $1.5 million of cash used for dividends.
Net cash and cash equivalents used in operating activities for the six months ended June 30, 2019 was $3.9 million, comprised primarily of net income adjusted for non-cash items of $3.9 million, offset by changes in operating assets and liabilities of $7.8 million.
Net cash and cash equivalents used in changes in working capital were the result of increases in accounts receivables due to increased sales to a large customer with longer than average payment terms and decreases in accounts payable due to early payment to a vendor for an additional discount that were offset in-part by the utilization of vendor prepayments.
Net cash and cash equivalents used in investing activities during the six months ended June 30, 2019 was $0.1 million.
Net cash and cash equivalents used in financing activities during the six months ended June 30, 2019 was $1.6 million, primarily comprised of dividend payments on our Common Stock.

The Credit Facility, which will be used for working capital and general corporate purposes, matures on August 31, 2020, at which time the Company must pay all outstanding principal of all outstanding loans plus all accrued and unpaid interest, and any interest, fees, costs and expenses, if any.
As of June 30, 2019, no borrowings were outstanding under the Credit Facility.
We anticipate that our working capital needs will increase as we invest in the growth of our business.
We believe that the funds held in cash and cash equivalents and our unused borrowings under our credit facility will be sufficient to fund our working capital and cash requirements for at least the next 12 months.
Contractual Obligations as of June 30, 2019 are summarized as follows:
