Results of Operations  



Three Months Ended November 2, 2019 vs. Three Months Ended October 27, 2018  



Revenue by segment and current quarter percentage change over the prior year for the three months ended November 2, 2019 and October 27, 2018 were:  



  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 



Revenue for the third quarter of the current year was $33.3 million, representing a decrease compared to the previous year third quarter revenue of $34.2 million.
Revenue through domestic channels for the third quarter of the current year was $21.8 million, an increase of 1.3% over the prior years third quarter.
International revenue for the third quarter of the current year was $11.5 million, representing 34.5% of AstroNovas third quarter revenue and reflects a 9.2% decrease over the previous year third quarter primarily as a result of weaker demand from a few customers in Asia in the Product Identification segment and a global slowdown in demand for certain aircraft models in the T&M segment.
Current year third quarter international revenue includes an unfavorable foreign exchange rate impact of $0.3 million.
Hardware revenue in the current quarter was $12.2 million, a 7.1% decrease compared to the prior years third quarter revenue of $13.1 million.
The current quarter decrease in hardware revenue is primarily due to the decline in aerospace printer sales related to the Honeywell product lines within the T&M segment.
This decline is a result of the ripple effects of the Boeing 737 Max grounding, due in part to reductions in new aircraft shipments, as well as the delay of retrofit printer upgrade orders for earlier 737 models so that those planes could remain in service.
Supplies revenue in the current quarter was $17.7 million, a 2.5% decrease over prior years third quarter supplies revenue of $18.1 million.
The decrease in the current quarter supplies revenue as compared to the third quarter of the prior year is primarily attributable to a decrease in revenue of QuickLabel product supplies in the Product Identification segment.
The decrease in supplies revenue for the current quarter was slightly offset by an increase in TrojanLabel product supplies revenue within the Product Identification segment.
Service and other revenue was $3.5 million in the current quarter, a 17.0% increase over the prior year revenue of $3.0 million.
The current quarter increase is primarily due to an increase in parts and repair revenue related to the AstroNova aerospace printer product lines in the T&M segment.
Current year third quarter gross profit was $12.3 million, an 11.6% decrease compared to prior year third quarter gross profit of $13.9 million.
The Companys current quarter gross profit margin of 36.9% reflects a 380 basis point decline from the prior years third quarter gross profit margin of 40.7%.
Specifically, current quarter selling and marketing expenses were $6.9 million, a 5.4% increase compared to $6.6 million in the third quarter of the prior year, as the increases in wages, travel, entertainment and trade show expenditures were offset by a decline in employee benefits for the current year.
Both general and administrative expenses of $2.8 million and research and development (R&D) expenses of $2.1 million remained unchanged from the third quarter of the prior year.
R&D spending as a percentage of revenue for the current quarter of 6.2% remained consistent with the same period of the prior year.
Other expense in the third quarter of fiscal 2020 was $0.2 million compared to $0.5 million in the third quarter of the prior year.
Current quarter other expense primarily includes interest expense on the Companys debt and revolving line of credit of $0.2 million.
Other expense for the third quarter of fiscal 2019 consisted primarily of interest expense on debt of $0.2 million and net foreign exchange loss of $0.3 million.
This compares to the prior years third quarter tax provision of $0.4 million, which reflected a benefit of $0.1 million related to windfall tax benefits related to the Companys stock and an effective tax rate of 22.3%.
The Company reported net income of $0.5 million or $0.06 per diluted share for the third quarter of the current year.
On a comparable basis, net income for the prior years third quarter was $1.4 million or $0.20 per diluted share.
Return on revenue was 1.4% for the third quarter of fiscal 2020 compared to 4.1% for the third quarter of fiscal 2019.
Nine Months Ended November 2, 2019 vs. Nine Months Ended October 27, 2018  



Revenue by product group and current period percentage change over the prior year for the nine months ended November 2, 2019 and October 27, 2018 were:  



  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 



Revenue for the first nine months of the current year was $103.0 million, representing a 3.5% increase compared to the previous years first nine months of revenue of $99.5 million.
Revenue through domestic channels for the first nine months of the current year was $64.5 million, an increase of 6.1% from prior year domestic revenue of $60.8 million.
International revenue for the first nine months of the current year was $38.5 million, a slight decrease from the previous year international revenue of $38.7 million.
The current years first nine months of international revenue reflected an unfavorable foreign exchange rate impact of $1.2 million.
Hardware revenue in the first nine months of the current year was $37.5 million, a 1.3% decrease compared to the prior years first nine months of revenue of $38.0 million.
The decrease in hardware sales is primarily related to the decline in the aerospace printer product line related to the Honeywell Agreement in the T&M segment.
Supplies revenue in the first nine months of the current year was $55.5 million, representing a 5.3% increase over the prior years first nine months revenue of $52.7 million.
The current year increase in supplies revenue is due primarily to the increase in inkjet printer supplies and label sales, tempered by lower thermal film and electrophotographic supplies revenue in the Product Identification segment.
Service and other revenues were $10.0 million in the first nine months of the current year, a 13.4% increase compared to the prior years first nine months service and other revenues of $8.8 million.
Also contributing to the current year increase were sales of parts in the Product Identification segment as a result of the increase in the installed base of printers currently in the field.
Current year first nine months gross profit was $38.5 million, a 2.3% decrease from prior years first nine months gross profit of $39.4 million.
The Companys gross profit margin of 37.4% in the current year reflects a decrease from the prior years first nine months gross profit margin of 39.6%.
Selling and marketing expenses for the current year of $20.1 million increased 3.3% compared to the previous years first nine months due primarily to an increase in wages, outside services, and travel expenses which were slightly offset by lower commissions and benefits.
General and Administrative (G&A) expenses for the first nine months of the current year were $8.4 million, a 1.8% increase compared to the prior years first nine months G&A expenses of $8.3 million.
The increase in G&A expenses in the current year was primarily due to an increase in outside service fees and corporate related expenditures, partially offset by a decrease in employee benefits.
R&D spending in the first nine months of the current year was $5.9 million, a slight increase compared to the prior years first nine months spending of $5.8 million.
Current year spending on R&D represents 5.7% of revenue compared to the prior years first nine months level of 5.9%.

Other expense during the first nine months of the current year was $0.8 million compared to $1.3 million in the first nine months of the previous year.
Current year other expense includes interest expense of $0.6 million on the Companys debt and revolving credit line and $0.3 million of net foreign exchange loss which was partially offset by investment and other income of $0.1 million.
The Company recognized $1.0 million of income tax expense for the first nine months of the prior fiscal year.
The Company reported net income of $3.1 million, or $0.43 per diluted share, for the first nine months of the current year.
On a comparable basis, net income for the first nine months of the prior year was $3.4 million, or $0.49 per diluted share, which included $0.8 million of after-tax income, or $0.12 per diluted share, as a result of a change in accounting estimates in the prior years first quarter for product cost and operating expenses related to a transition services agreement entered into with Honeywell in connection with the Honeywell Agreement.
In addition, during the first quarter of fiscal 2019, a change in accounting estimate for revenue subject to customer rebates under the Honeywell Agreement increased net income by $0.3 million or $0.05 per diluted share.
Return on revenue was 3.0% for the first nine months of fiscal 2020 compared to 3.4% for the first nine months of fiscal 2019.
Segment Analysis  



The Company reports two segments: Product Identification and Test & Measurement and evaluates segment performance based on the segment profit before corporate and financial administration expenses.
Summarized below are the Revenue and Segment Operating Profit for each reporting segment:  



  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 



Product Identification  



Total current quarter revenue from the Product Identification segment of $21.7 million was comparable to revenue for the same period of the prior year.
Product Identifications current quarter segment operating profit was $1.9 million, reflecting a profit margin of 8.6%.
This compares to the prior years third quarter segment profit of $2.0 million and related profit margin of 9.3%.
27   



Table of Contents 



Revenues from the Product Identification segment increased 6.4% to $67.5 million in the first nine months of the current year from $63.4 million in the same period of the prior year.
The current year increase is primarily attributable to strong demand for ink jet supplies in the first quarter from Asian customers, which subsequently declined.
Also contributing to the increase in revenue for the current year was an increase in service and other revenue.
Hardware revenue in the PI segment remained fairly constant compared to the prior year; however the segment did experience a significant revenue contribution from the introduction of QuickLabels new QL -300 printer, as well as double-digit growth in revenue from sales of both QuickLabels monochromatic printers and TrojanLabels T2-C printers.
This growth was tempered by lower sales of other inkjet color printers within the QuickLabel product group.
Product Identification current year segment operating profit was $7.0 million with a profit margin of 10.4%, compared to the prior year segment operating profit of $5.8 million and related profit margin of 9.2 %.
Test & MeasurementT&M  



Revenue from the T&M segment was $11.6 million for the third quarter of the current fiscal year, representing a 7.5% decrease compared to revenue of $12.5 million for the same period in the prior year.
The current quarter revenue decrease is due to the decline in the aerospace printer product line acquired from Honeywell in fiscal 2018 as a result of the ripple effects of the Boeing 737 Max grounding which resulted in part to new aircraft shipment reductions as well as delays of several retrofit printer upgrade orders for earlier 737 models so that those planes could remain in service.
Revenue from the T&M segment was $35.5 million for the first nine months of the current fiscal year, a 1.7% decrease compared to sales of $36.1 million for the same period in the prior year.
The decrease in revenue for the first nine months of the current year is also primarily due to the decline in the aerospace printer product line acquired from Honeywell as a result of the impact of the Boeing 737 Max grounding.

Indebtedness  



In fiscal 2018, the Company and the Companys wholly owned Danish subsidiaries, ANI ApS and TrojanLabel ApS, entered into a credit agreement with Bank of America, N.A.
(the Lender), which, as amended through November 2, 2019 (the Credit Agreement), provides for a secured credit facility consisting of a term loan to ANI ApS in the principal amount of $9.2 million and a term loan to the Company in the principal amount of $15.0 million.
The Credit Agreement also provides for a $10.0 million revolving credit facility for the Company.
Both term loans bear interest at a rate per annum equal to the LIBOR rate plus a margin that varies within a range of 1.0% to 1.5% based on the Companys consolidated leverage ratio.
In connection with our entry into the Credit Agreement, ANI ApS entered into a hedging agreement to manage the variable interest rate risk and currency risk associated with its payments in respect to the term loan.
Under this combined arrangement, payments of principal and interest with respect to approximately $8.9 million of the principal of the term loan will be made in Danish Kroner, and interest on such principal amount will be payable at a fixed rate of 0.67% per annum for the entire term, subject only to potential changes based on the Companys consolidated leverage ratio.
Additionally, the Company entered into a hedging agreement to manage the variable interest rate risk associated with its payments with respect to the $15.0 million term loan.
Under this combined arrangement, interest will be payable at a fixed rate of 2.04% per annum for the entire term, plus an incremental margin of 1.0% to 1.5%, based on the Companys consolidated leverage ratio.
Revolving credit loans may be borrowed, at the Companys option, in U.S.
Dollars or, subject to certain conditions, Euros, British Pounds, Canadian Dollars or Danish Kroner.
Amounts borrowed under the revolving credit facility bear interest at a rate per annum equal to, at the Companys option, either (a) the LIBOR rate (or, in the case of revolving credit loans denominated in a currency other than U.S.
Dollars, the applicable quoted rate), plus a margin that varies within a range of 1.0% to 1.5% based on the Companys consolidated leverage ratio, or (b) a fluctuating reference rate equal to the highest of (i) the federal funds rate plus 0.50%, (ii) Bank of Americas publicly announced prime rate or (iii) the LIBOR rate plus 1.00%, plus a margin that varies within a range of 0.0% to 0.5% based on the Companys consolidated leverage ratio.
The Company is required to pay a commitment fee on the undrawn portion of the revolving credit facility at the rate of 0.25% per annum.
Outstanding borrowings under the revolving credit line during fiscal 2020 bear interest at a weighted average annual rate of 5.26% and the Company has paid $93,000 of interest expense for revolving credit line borrowings for the nine months ended November 2, 2019.
The obligations of ANI ApS in respect of the $9.2 million term loan are guaranteed by the Company and TrojanLabel ApS.
The Companys obligations in respect of the $15.0 million term loan, revolving credit facility and its guarantee in respect of the ANI ApS term loan are secured by substantially all of the assets of the Company (including a pledge of a portion of the equity interests held by the Company in ANI ApS and the Companys wholly owned German subsidiary, AstroNova GmbH), subject to certain exceptions.
The Lender is entitled to accelerate repayment of the loans and to terminate its revolving credit commitment under the Credit Agreement upon the occurrence of any of various customary events of default.

Table of Contents 



The Parties must comply with various customary financial and non-financial covenants under the Credit Agreement.
On December 9, 2019, the Company, ANI ApS, TrojanLabel ApS and the Lender, entered into a Fourth Amendment (the Fourth Amendment) to the Credit Agreement.
Refer to Part II, Item 5 Other Information for further details on the Fourth Amendment and resulting changes to the terms of the Credit Agreement.
The Company believes it is in compliance with all of the covenants in the amended Credit Agreement.
Cash Flow  



The Companys statements of cash flows for the nine months ended November 2, 2019 and October 27, 2018 are included on page 8 of this report.
Net cash provided by operating activities was $1.0 million for the first nine months of fiscal 2020 compared to $2.5 million for the same period of the previous year.
The decrease in net cash provided by operations for the first nine months of the current year is primarily due to the decrease in net income, and an increase in cash used for working capital.
The accounts receivable balance decreased to $22.1 million at the end of the third quarter compared to $23.5 million at year end.
The $1.4 million decrease in the accounts receivable balance from year end is directly related to the decrease in sales for the third quarter of the current year as compared to third quarter sales in fiscal 2019.
The inventory balance was $35.6 million at the end of the third quarter of fiscal 2020, compared to $30.2 million at year end and inventory days on hand increased to 152 days at the end of the current quarter from 120 days at the prior year end.
Also contributing to the inventory increase were delayed shipments to customers in the Product Identification segment and last time buy parts and safety stock increases in the T&M segment.
The net decreased cash position at November 2, 2019 primarily resulted from principal payments of long-term debt and the guaranteed royalty obligation of $4.0 million and $1.4 million, respectively; cash used to acquire property, plant and equipment of $2.4 million and dividends paid of $1.5 million, offset by increased cash provided by current period borrowing on the Companys existing revolving credit facility of $5.0 million.
