ACCOUNTING POLICIES  



Basis of Presentation  



The consolidated interim financial statements include the accounts of Teradyne and its wholly-owned subsidiaries.
All significant intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated.
Certain prior year amounts were reclassified to conform to the current year presentation.
The accompanying financial information should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto contained in Teradynes Annual Report on Form 10-K, filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on March 1, 2018, for the year ended December 31, 2017.
Revenue from Contracts with Customers  



Teradyne adopted Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (ASC 606) on January 1, 2018 using the modified retrospective method for all contracts not completed as of the date of adoption.
The reported results for 2018 reflect the application of ASC 606 while the reported results for 2017 were prepared under the guidance of ASC 605, Revenue Recognition (ASC 605), which is also referred to herein as Legacy GAAP or the previous guidance. Teradyne recorded a net increase  



5   



Table of Contents 



 to retained earnings of $12.7 million as of January 1, 2018 due to the cumulative impact of adopting ASC 606.
Refer to Note B: Accounting Policies in Teradynes 2017 Annual Report on Form 10-K for the policies in effect for revenue prior to January 1, 2018.
The adoption of ASC 606 represents a change in accounting principle that will more closely align revenue recognition with the delivery of Teradynes hardware and services and will provide financial statement readers with enhanced disclosures.
In accordance with ASC 606, revenue is recognized when or as a customer obtains control of promised goods or services.
The amount of revenue recognized reflects the consideration to which Teradyne expects to be entitled to receive in exchange for fulfillment of the performance obligation.
Teradynes primary source of revenue will continue to be from the sale of systems, instruments, robots, and the delivery of services.
In accordance with ASC 606, Teradyne recognizes revenues, when or as control is transferred to a customer.
Teradynes determination of revenue is dependent upon a five step process outlined below.
Step 1: Identify the contract with the customer  



Teradyne accounts for a contract with a customer when there is written approval, the contract is committed, the rights of the parties, including payment terms, are identified, the contract has commercial substance and consideration is probable of collection.
Teradyne determines performance obligations by assessing whether the products or services are distinct from the other elements of the contract.
Step 3: Determine the transaction price  



Teradyne considers the amount stated on the face of the purchase order to be the transaction price.
Step 4: Allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract  



Transaction price is allocated to each individual performance obligation based on the standalone selling price of that performance obligation.
Teradyne uses standalone transactions when available to value each performance obligation.
Step 5: Recognize revenue when (or as) the entity satisfies a performance obligation  



In order to determine the appropriate timing for revenue recognition, Teradyne first determines if the transaction meets any of three criteria for over time recognition.
If the transaction meets the criteria for over time recognition, Teradyne recognizes revenue as the good or service is delivered.
Teradyne uses input variables such as hours or months utilized or costs incurred to determine the amount of revenue to recognize in a given period.
Input variables are used as they best align consumption with benefit to the customer.
For transactions that do not meet the criteria for over time recognition, Teradyne will recognize revenue at a point in time based on an assessment of the five criteria for transfer of control.
Teradyne has concluded that revenue should be recognized when shipped or delivered based on contractual terms.
Typically acceptance of Teradynes products and services is a formality as Teradyne delivers similar systems, instruments and robots to standard specifications.
In cases where acceptance is not deemed a formality, Teradyne will defer revenue recognition until customer acceptance.
6   



Table of Contents 



Revenue recognized in accordance with ASC 606 was $564.5 million and $1,571.0 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2018, respectively.
For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2018, Teradyne also recognized $2.3 million and $10.2 million, respectively, in revenue on leases of Teradyne systems, which are accounted for outside of ASC 606.
Disaggregation of Revenue  



The following table provides information about disaggregated revenue by primary geographical market, major product line and timing of revenue recognition.
[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 



  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 



Performance Obligations  



Hardware  



Teradyne hardware consists primarily of semiconductor test systems and instruments, defense/aerospace test instrumentation and systems, storage test systems and instruments, circuit-board test and inspection systems and instruments, collaborative robots, autonomous mobile robots and wireless test systems.
The hardware includes a standard 12-month warranty.
This warranty is not considered a distinct performance obligation because it does not obligate Teradyne to provide a separate service to the customer and it cannot be purchased separately.
Teradynes hardware is recognized at a point in time upon transfer of control to the customer.
7   



Table of Contents 



Extended Warranty  



Customers have the option to purchase an extended warranty, which extends the warranty period for systems and robots beyond the one-year standard warranty.
The extended warranty is purchased in the same transaction as the system or robot purchase and is classified as a separate performance obligation, which meets the criteria for over time recognition.
The relative standalone selling price of the extended warranty is recognized ratably over the course of the extended warranty based on months completed.
Training and Applications Support  



Teradyne sells training and applications support to customers either in standalone transactions or included with system purchases.
The training and support allow the customer to use Teradynes systems efficiently and effectively.
Training and applications support included in system orders are valued based on their standalone selling price and all training and applications support is recognized over time as the customer receives and consumes the benefit associated with each.
Both are recognized using an input method of hours consumed as this best depicts the transfer of services to the customer.
Service Agreements  



Service agreements are recognized ratably over the period of agreement based on months completed.
Post-Contract Customer Support (PCS)  



Teradyne provides support services for certain systems and robots outside of warranty.
These services include telephone support, bug fixes, and when-and-if available upgrades.
Standalone selling price for PCS is not directly observable as Teradyne does not sell these services separately.
Teradyne has estimated the standalone selling price for these services based on adjusted market assessments.
Teradyne does not allow customer returns or provide refunds to customers for any products or services.
Contract Balances  



The following table provides information about contract liabilities.
Teradyne does not have material contract assets on the balance sheet.
[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 



The amount of revenue recognized during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2018 that was previously included within the deferred revenue and customer advances was $24.5 million and $70.9 million, respectively, and primarily relates to extended warranties, training, application support, and PCS.
Each of these represents a distinct performance obligation.
Customers typically pay for these services net 30 to 60 days from the date that transfer of control of the associated system or product occurs.
Remaining Performance Obligations  



Teradyne does not have material remaining performance obligations from contracts with an original expected duration of greater than one year.
Practical Expedients  



Teradyne has adopted the practical expedients available within ASC 340 Other Assets and Deferred Costs for contract assets, specifically in relation to incremental costs of obtaining a contract.
Teradyne generally expenses sales commissions when incurred because the amortization period would be less than one year.
Teradyne has adopted the practical expedient, which states an entity need not adjust the promised amount of consideration for the effects of a significant financing component if the entity expects, at contract inception, that the period between when the entity transfers a promised good or service to the customer and when the customer pays for that good or service will be one year or less.
Teradyne does not have material payments associated with performance obligations outside this one-year time frame.
Impacts  



The following tables summarize the impact of ASC 606 to Teradynes consolidated financial statements.
Differences are the result of timing differences between the recognition of revenue under ASC 606 and ASC 605 primarily with respect to software transactions deferred due to lack of vendor specific objective evidence of price under ASC 605 and Teradynes assessment of acceptance under ASC 606.
Under Legacy GAAP, Teradyne did not recognize revenue prior to acceptance if payment, title, or risk of loss was tied to acceptance.
Under ASC 606, Teradyne recognizes revenue prior to receipt of acceptance if acceptance is deemed a formality.

Retirement Benefits  



In March 2017, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued ASU 2017-07, CompensationRetirement Benefits (Topic 715): Improving the Presentation of Net Periodic Pension Cost and Net Periodic Postretirement Benefit Cost. Teradyne retrospectively adopted the new accounting guidance on presentation of net periodic pension costs and net periodic postretirement benefit costs in the first quarter of 2018.
This guidance requires the service cost component of net benefit costs to be reported in the same line item in the consolidated statement of operations as other employee compensation costs.
In the three months ended October 1, 2017, the retrospective adoption of this standard increased income from operations by $0.4 million due to the removal of net actuarial pension losses and decreased non-operating (income) expense by the same amount with no impact to net income.
In the nine months ended October 1, 2017, the retrospective adoption of this standard decreased income from operations by $1.3 million due to the removal of net actuarial pension gains and increased non-operating (income) expense by the same amount with no impact to net income.
Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities  



In January 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-01, Financial InstrumentsOverall (Subtopic 825-10): Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities. Teradyne adopted the new  



10   



Table of Contents 



 accounting guidance in the first quarter of 2018 using the modified retrospective approach.
This guidance requires that changes in fair value of equity securities be accounted for directly in earnings.
Previously, the changes in fair value were recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income on the balance sheet.
Teradyne continues to record realized gains in interest income and realized losses in interest expense.
The adoption of this new accounting guidance increased the January 1, 2018 retained earnings balance by $3.1 million and decreased the accumulated other comprehensive income balance by the same amount.
When the reasonable estimate of the loss is within a range of amounts, and no amount in the range constitutes a better estimate than any other amount, Teradyne accrues the amount at the low end of the range.
Attorney fees related to legal matters are expensed as incurred.
C. RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS  



On January 26, 2017, the FASB issued ASU 2017-04, IntangiblesGoodwill and Other (Topic 350): Simplifying the Accounting for Goodwill Impairment. The new guidance removes Step 2 of the goodwill impairment test, which requires a hypothetical purchase price allocation.
Goodwill impairment will now be the amount by which a reporting units carrying value exceeds its fair value, not to exceed the carrying amount of goodwill.
All other goodwill impairment guidance will remain largely unchanged.
Entities will continue to have the option to perform a qualitative assessment to determine if a quantitative impairment test is necessary.
Entities will be required to disclose the amount of goodwill at reporting units with zero or negative carrying amounts.
The revised guidance will be applied prospectively, and is effective in 2020.
Early adoption is permitted for any impairment tests performed after January 1, 2017.
In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842). The guidance in this ASU supersedes the lease recognition requirements in Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) Topic 840, Leases. The new standard establishes a right- of-use (ROU) model that requires a lessee to record an ROU asset and a lease liability on the balance sheet for all leases with terms longer than twelve months.
The new standard is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2018 with early adoption permitted.
A modified retrospective transition approach is required for lessees for capital and operating leases existing at, or entered into after, the beginning of the earliest comparative period presented in the financial statements.
In July 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-11, Leases (Topic 842): Targeted Improvements, which amends ASU 2016-02.
The new ASU offers an additional transition method by which entities may elect not to recast the comparative periods presented in financial statements in the period of adoption and allows lessors to elect a practical expedient to not separate lease and non-lease components when certain conditions are met.
This ASU has the same transition requirements and effective date as ASU 2016-02.
Teradyne elected not to recast the comparative periods presented in financial statements in the period of adoption.

D. ACQUISITIONS  



Mobile Industrial Robots  



On April 25, 2018, Teradyne acquired all the issued and outstanding shares of Mobile Industrial Robots ApS (MiR), a Danish limited liability company located in Odense, Denmark.
MiR is the leading maker of collaborative autonomous mobile robots for industrial applications.
MiR is part of Teradynes Industrial Automation segment.
The total preliminary purchase price of $196.6 million consisted of $145.2 million of cash paid and $51.4 million of contingent consideration, measured at fair value.
The contingent consideration is payable in Euros upon the achievement of certain thresholds and targets for revenue and earnings before interest and taxes for periods from January 1, 2018 to December 31, 2018; January 1, 2018 to December 31, 2019; and January 1, 2018 to December 31, 2020.
At September 30, 2018, the maximum amount of contingent consideration that could be paid is $118.9 million.
The allocation of the preliminary total purchase price to MiRs net tangible liabilities and identifiable intangible assets was based on their estimated fair values as of the acquisition date.
The purchase price and purchase price allocation are preliminary pending the final determination of the fair value of contingent consideration, acquired assets and assumed liabilities.
Teradyne expects to finalize the purchase price calculation in the fourth quarter of 2018.
The following table represents the allocation of the preliminary purchase price:  



  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Table of Contents 



Teradyne estimated the fair value of intangible assets using the income and cost approaches with the following key assumptions: (1) forecasted cash flows and (2) discount rate.
Acquired intangible assets are amortized on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives.
Components of these intangible assets and their estimated useful lives at the acquisition date are as follows:  



  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 



For the three months ended September 30, 2018, MiR contributed $6.5 million of revenues and had a $(3.8) million loss from operations before income taxes.
For the period from April 25, 2018 to September 30, 2018, MiR contributed $11.1 million of revenues and had a $(5.4) million loss from operations before income taxes.
The following unaudited pro forma information gives effect to the acquisition of MiR as if the acquisition occurred on January 1, 2017.
The unaudited pro forma results are not necessarily indicative of what actually would have occurred had the acquisition been in effect for the periods presented:  



  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 



Pro forma results for the nine months ended September 30, 2018 were adjusted to exclude $2.9 million of acquisition related costs, and $0.4 million of non-recurring expense related to fair value adjustment to acquisition-date inventory.
Energid Technologies Corporation  



On February 26, 2018, Teradyne acquired all of the issued and outstanding shares of Energid Technologies Corporation (Energid) for a total purchase price of approximately $27.6 million.
Energids technology enables and simplifies the programming of complex robotic motions used in a wide variety of end markets, ranging from heavy industry to healthcare, utilizing both traditional robots and collaborative robots.
The Energid acquisition was accounted for as a business combination and, accordingly, Energids results have been included in Teradynes Industrial Automation segment from the date of acquisition.
As of the acquisition date, Teradynes purchase price allocation was goodwill of $14.4 million, acquired intangible assets of $12.3 million with an average estimated useful life of 7.7 years, and $1.0 million of net tangible assets.
The acquisition was not material to Teradynes condensed consolidated financial statements.

Inventories, net consisted of the following at September 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017:  



  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 



Inventory reserves at September 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017 were $104.3 million and $102.9 million, respectively.
F. FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS  



Cash Equivalents  



Teradyne considers all highly liquid investments with maturities of three months or less at the date of acquisition to be cash equivalents.
Marketable Securities  



Effective January 1, 2018, Teradyne adopted ASU 2016-01, Financial InstrumentsOverall (Subtopic 825-10): Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities using the modified retrospective approach.
This guidance requires that changes in fair value of equity securities be accounted for directly in earnings.
Prior to 2018, the changes in fair value of equity securities were recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income on the balance sheet.
On a quarterly basis, Teradyne reviews its investments to identify and evaluate those that have an indication of a potential other-than-temporary impairment.
As defined in ASC 820-10, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures, fair value is the price that would be received from the sale of an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants.
For example, a common approach for valuing fixed income securities is the use of matrix pricing.
Matrix pricing is a mathematical technique used to value securities by relying on the securities relationship to other benchmark quoted prices, and is considered a Level 2 input; or  



Level 3: Unobservable inputs that are not supported by market data.
Unobservable inputs are developed based on the best information available, which might include Teradynes own data.
14   



Table of Contents 



Teradynes available-for-sale debt securities are classified as Level 2, and equity securities are classified as Level 1.
Acquisition-related contingent consideration is classified as Level 3.
Teradyne determines the fair value of acquisition-related contingent consideration using a Monte Carlo simulation model.
The vast majority of Level 2 securities are fixed income securities priced by third party pricing vendors.
During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2018 and October 1, 2017, there were no transfers in or out of Level 1, Level 2, or Level 3 financial instruments.
Realized gains related to available-for-sale debt securities recorded in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2018 were $0.2 million, $0.6 million, respectively.
Realized losses related to available-for-sale debt securities recorded in the nine months ended September 30, 2018 were $1.6 million.
Realized gains related to available-for-sale debt securities recorded in the three and nine months ended October 1, 2017 were $0.2 million and $0.7 million, respectively.
Realized losses related to available-for-sale debt securities recorded in the nine months ended October 1, 2017 were $0.3 million.
Unrealized gains related to equity securities held at September 30, 2018 recorded in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2018 were $1.0 million and $1.4 million, respectively.
The cost of securities sold is based on the specific identification method.

Changes in the fair value of Level 3 contingent consideration for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2018 and October 1, 2017 were as follows:  



  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 



 (a)  



In the nine months ended September 30, 2018, Teradyne paid $24.6 million of contingent consideration for the earn-out in connection with the acquisition of Universal Robots A/S (Universal Robots).
In the nine months ended October 1, 2017, Teradyne paid $1.1 million of contingent consideration for the earn-out in connection with the acquisition of Avionics Interface Technology, LLC (AIT).
(b)  



In the three and nine months ended September 30, 2018, the fair value of contingent consideration for the earn-out in connection with the acquisition of Universal Robots was decreased by $0.8 million and $9.2 million, respectively, primarily due to a decrease in forecasted revenue.
In the nine months ended October 1, 2017, the fair value of contingent consideration for the earn-out in connection with the acquisition of Universal Robots was increased by $1.8 million due to an increase in forecasted revenue.
The following table provides quantitative information associated with the fair value measurement of Teradynes Level 3 financial instruments:  



  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 



As of September 30, 2018, the significant unobservable inputs used in the Monte Carlo simulation to fair value the Universal Robots contingent consideration include forecasted revenue, revenue volatility, and discount rate.
The maximum payment for the remaining Universal Robots revenue earn-out is $25.0 million.
As of September 30, 2018, the significant unobservable inputs used in the Monte Carlo simulation to fair value the MiR contingent consideration include forecasted revenue, revenue volatility, earnings before interest and taxes, and discount rate.
As of September 30, 2018, the maximum amount of contingent consideration that could be paid in connection with the acquisition of MiR is $118.9 million.
The earn-out periods in connection with the MiR acquisition end on December 31, 2018, December 31, 2019 and December 31, 2020.

Table of Contents 



Contractual maturities of investments in available-for-sale securities held at September 30, 2018 exclude $3.1 million of debt mutual funds as they do not have a contractual maturity date.
The purpose of Teradynes foreign currency management is to minimize the effect of exchange rate fluctuations on certain foreign currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities.
To minimize the effect of exchange rate fluctuations associated with the remeasurement of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies, Teradyne enters into foreign currency forward contracts.
The change in fair value of these derivatives is recorded directly in earnings, and is used to offset the change in value of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies.
The notional amount of foreign currency forward contracts at September 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017 was $166.6 million and $116.8 million, respectively.

G. DEBT  



Convertible Senior Notes  



On December 12, 2016, Teradyne completed a private offering of $460.0 million convertible senior unsecured notes (the Notes).
The Notes will mature on December 15, 2023, unless earlier repurchased or converted.
The Notes bear interest from December 12, 2016 at a rate of 1.25% per year payable semi-annually in arrears on June 15 and December 15 of each year, beginning on June 15, 2017.
The Notes will be convertible at the option of the noteholders at any time prior to the close of business on the business day immediately preceding September 15, 2023, under the following circumstances: (1) during any calendar quarter beginning after March 31, 2017 (and only during such calendar quarter), if the closing sale price of Teradynes common stock, for at least 20 trading days (whether or not consecutive) during a period of 30 consecutive trading days ending on the last trading day of the immediately preceding calendar quarter is greater than 130% of the conversion price on each applicable trading day; (2) during the five business day period after any five consecutive trading day period (the measurement period) in which the trading price (as defined in the Indenture) per $1,000 principal amount of Notes for each trading day of the measurement period was less than 98% of the product of the closing sale price of the Teradynes common stock and the conversion rate on each such trading day; and (3) upon the occurrence of specified corporate events.
On or after September 15, 2023 until the close of business on the second scheduled trading day immediately preceding the maturity date, holders may convert their Notes at any time, regardless of the foregoing circumstances.
Teradyne may satisfy its conversion obligation by paying or delivering cash, shares of its common stock or a combination of cash and shares of its common stock, at Teradynes election.
The conversion rate for the Notes is 31.4463 shares per $1,000 principal amount, which is equivalent to a conversion price of approximately $31.80 per share of Teradynes common stock.
The conversion rate is subject to adjustment under certain circumstances.
Concurrent with the offering of the Notes, Teradyne entered into convertible note hedge transactions (the Note Hedge Transactions) with the initial purchasers or their affiliates (the Option Counterparties).
The Note Hedge Transactions cover, subject to customary anti-dilution adjustments, approximately 14.5 million shares of Teradynes common stock.
The convertible note hedge is considered indexed to Teradynes stock as the terms of the Note Hedge Transactions do not contain an exercise contingency and the settlement amount equals the difference between the fair value of a fixed number of Teradynes shares and a fixed strike price.
Separately and concurrent with the pricing of the Notes, Teradyne entered into warrant transactions with the Option Counterparties (the Warrant Transactions) in which it sold net-share-settled (or, at its election subject to certain conditions, cash-settled) warrants to the Option Counterparties.
The Warrant Transactions cover, subject to customary anti-dilution adjustments, approximately 14.5 million shares of common stock.
The strike price of the warrants is approximately $39.91 per share.
The strike price is subject to adjustments under certain circumstances.
The net cost of the Notes Hedge Transactions, after being partially offset by the proceeds from the sale of the warrants, was approximately $33 million.

 estimated warranty expense based on historical experience.
[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 



When Teradyne receives revenue for extended warranties, beyond one year, it is deferred and recognized on a straight-line basis over the contract period.
The balance below is included in short and long-term deferred revenue and customer advances on the balance sheet.
Time-based restricted stock unit awards granted to employees vest in equal annual installments over four years.
Restricted stock unit awards granted to non-employee directors vest after a one year period, with 100% of the award vesting on the earlier of (a) the first anniversary of the grant date or (b) the date of the following years Annual Meeting of Shareholders.
Teradyne expenses the cost of the restricted stock unit awards subject to time-based vesting, which is determined to be the fair market value of the shares at the date of grant, ratably over the period during which the restrictions lapse.
Commencing in January 2014, Teradyne granted performance-based restricted stock units (PRSUs) to its executive officers with a performance metric based on relative total shareholder return (TSR).
For TSR grants issued in 2018 and 2017, Teradynes three-year TSR performance is measured against the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) Composite Index.
The final number of TSR PRSUs that vest will vary based upon the level of performance achieved from 200% to 0% of the target shares capped at four times the grant date value.
The TSR PRSUs will vest upon the three-year anniversary of the grant date.
The TSR PRSUs are valued using a Monte Carlo simulation model.
The number of units expected to be earned, based upon the achievement of the TSR market condition, is factored into the grant date Monte Carlo valuation.
Compensation expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the shorter of the three-year service period or the period from the grant date to the date described in the retirement provisions below.
Compensation expense for employees meeting the  



25   



Table of Contents 



 retirement provisions prior to the grant date will be recognized in full on the date of the grant.
Compensation expense is recognized regardless of the eventual number of units that are earned based upon the market condition, provided the executive officer remains an employee at the end of the three-year period.
Compensation expense is reversed if at any time during the three-year service period the executive officer is no longer an employee, subject to the retirement and termination eligibility provisions noted below.
In January 2018 and 2017, Teradyne granted PRSUs to its executive officers with a performance metric based on three-year cumulative non-GAAP profit before interest and tax (PBIT) as a percent of Teradynes revenue.
The final number of PBIT PRSUs that vest will vary based upon the level of performance achieved from 200% to 0% of the target shares.
The PBIT PRSUs will vest upon the three-year anniversary of the grant date.
Compensation expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the shorter of the three year service period or the period from the grant date to the date described in the retirement provisions below.
Compensation expense for employees meeting the retirement provisions prior to the grant date will be recognized in full on the date of grant.
Compensation expense is recognized based on the number of units that are earned based upon the three-year Teradyne PBIT as a percent of Teradynes revenue, provided the executive officer remains an employee at the end of the three-year period subject to the retirement and termination eligibility provisions noted below.
Beginning with PRSUs granted in January 2014, if the recipients employment ends prior to the determination of the performance percentage due to (1) permanent disability or death or (2) retirement or termination other than for cause, after attaining both at least age sixty and at least ten years of service, then all or a portion of the recipients PRSUs (based on the actual performance percentage achieved on the determination date) will vest on the date the performance percentage is determined.
Except as set forth in the preceding sentence, no PRSUs will vest if the executive officer is no longer an employee at the end of the three-year period.
During the nine months ended September 30, 2018 and October 1, 2017, Teradyne granted 0.1 million and 0.1 million TSR PRSUs, respectively, with a grant date fair value of $54.85 and $35.66, respectively.
The fair value was estimated using the Monte Carlo simulation model with the following assumptions:  



  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 



Expected volatility was based on the historical volatility of Teradynes stock and the NYSE Composite Index for the 2018 and 2017 grant over the most recent three-year period.
The risk-free interest rate was determined using the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant.
Dividend yield was based upon an estimated annual dividend amount of $0.36 per share for 2018 grants and $0.28 per share for 2017 grants, divided by Teradynes stock price on the grant date of $47.70 for the 2018 grant and $28.56 for the 2017 grant.
During the nine months ended September 30, 2018 and October 1, 2017, Teradyne granted 0.1 million and 0.1 million, respectively, of PBIT PRSUs with a grant date fair value of $46.62 and $27.72, respectively.
During the nine months ended September 30, 2018, Teradyne granted 0.6 million of service-based restricted stock unit awards to employees at a weighted average grant date fair value of $46.25, 0.1 million of service-based restricted stock unit awards to non-employee directors at a weighted average grant date fair value of $35.81, and 0.1 million of service-based stock options to executive officers at a weighted average grant date fair value of $12.17.

Restricted stock unit awards granted to employees vest in equal annual installments over four years.
Stock options to purchase Teradynes common stock at 100% of the fair market value on the grant date vest in equal annual installments over four years from the grant date and have a maximum term of seven years.
Volatility was determined using historical volatility for a period equal to the expected life.
The risk-free interest rate was determined using the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant.
Dividend yield was based upon an estimated annual dividend amount of $0.36 per share for 2018 grants and $0.28 per share for 2017 grants divided by Teradynes stock price on the grant date of $47.70 for the 2018 grant and $28.56 for the 2017 grant.

N. NET INCOME PER COMMON SHARE  



The following table sets forth the computation of basic and diluted net income per common share:  



  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 



 (1)  



Incremental shares from assumed conversion of the convertible notes was calculated using the difference between the average Teradyne stock price for the period and the conversion price of $31.80, multiplied by 14.5 million shares.
The result of this calculation, representing the total intrinsic value of the convertible debt, was divided by the average Teradyne stock price for the period.
(2)  



Convertible notes hedge warrant shares were calculated using the difference between the average Teradyne stock price for the period and the warrant price of $39.91, multiplied by 14.5 million shares.
The result of this calculation, representing the total intrinsic value of the warrant, was divided by the average Teradyne stock price for the period.
31   



Table of Contents 



The computation of diluted net income per common share for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2018 excludes the effect of the potential vesting of 0.5 million of restricted stock units because the effect would have been anti-dilutive.
