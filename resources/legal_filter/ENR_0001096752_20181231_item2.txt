Non-GAAP Financial Measures



While we report financial results in accordance with GAAP, this discussion also includes Non-GAAP measures.
These Non-GAAP measures are referred to as “adjusted” or “organic” and exclude items such as restructuring charges, the disposition of the Playtex gloves business, investor settlement expense, the Jack Black, L.L.C.
This Non-GAAP information is provided as a supplement to, not as a substitute for, or as superior to, measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP.
We use this Non-GAAP information internally to make operating decisions and believe it is helpful to investors because it allows more meaningful period-to-period comparisons of ongoing operating results.
This Non-GAAP information is also a component in determining management’s incentive compensation.
Finally, we believe this information provides more transparency.
The following provides additional detail on our Non-GAAP measures:



•We analyze our net sales and segment profit on an organic basis to better measure the comparability of results between periods.
Organic net sales and organic segment profit exclude the impact of changes in foreign currency, acquisitions, and dispositions (including the acquisition of Jack Black and the disposition of the Playtex gloves business).
•Adjusted net earnings and adjusted earnings per share are defined as net earnings and diluted earnings per share excluding items such as restructuring charges, the gain on the disposition of the Playtex gloves business, investor settlement expense, Jack Black acquisition and integration costs, Sun Care reformulation charges, the related tax effects of these items, and the impact of the Tax Act.
•Adjusted effective tax rate is defined as the effective tax rate excluding items such as restructuring charges, the gain on the disposition of the Playtex gloves business, investor settlement expense, Jack Black acquisition and integration costs, Sun Care reformulation charges, the related tax effects of these items, and the impact of the Tax Act from the income tax provision and earnings before income taxes.
•Free cash flow is defined as net cash from operating activities less net capital expenditures.
Free cash flow conversion is defined as free cash flow as a percentage of net earnings adjusted for the net impact of non-cash impairments.
All comparisons are with the same period in the prior year, unless otherwise noted.

Significant Events



Project Fuel



In February 2018, we announced Project Fuel, an enterprise-wide transformational initiative that is designed to address all aspects of our business and cost structure, simplifying and transforming the organization, structure and key processes that will enable us to achieve our desired future state operations.
The project will incorporate our Zero-Based Spending (“ZBS”) and global productivity initiatives and will include a new global restructuring initiative.
Initial costs for Project Fuel relate to efforts to fully define the scope and reach of the project.
In addition, the Company has incurred global severance costs related to the reduction of overhead.
While the Company incurred costs and realized savings for Project Fuel in fiscal 2018, most costs will be incurred and savings will be achieved during fiscal 2019 through fiscal 2021.
For further information on our restructuring projects, refer to Note 4 of Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements.
Sun Care Reformulation Costs



As a result of discussions with one of our suppliers during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018, we made certain supply chain and procurement decisions, including implementing a raw material substitution due to anticipated regulatory changes related to European Union Regulation (EC) No 1907/2006 concerning the Registration, Evaluation, Authorization, and Restriction of Chemicals, establishing a European Chemical Agency (“REACH”), that affect the supply chain of select Sun Care products.
We incurred $0.1 in Sun Care reformulation costs in the first quarter of fiscal 2019 and expect to incur additional charges over the next two quarters of fiscal 2019 related to these supply chain decisions.
30



Acquisitions



On March 1, 2018, we completed the acquisition of Jack Black, a leading U.S. based luxury men’s skincare products company, for approximately $90.2, net of cash acquired.
The acquisition will create opportunities to expand our personal care portfolio in growing categories in the U.S. and globally, while nurturing the brand equity of Jack Black.
Refer to Note 3 of our Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion related to the acquisition of Jack Black.
Sale of Playtex Gloves Business



On October 26, 2017, the Company finalized its sale of the Playtex gloves business to a household products company (the “Acquirer”) for $19.0.
The sale was finalized on October 26, 2017.
The sale provides the Acquirer with indefinite and exclusive worldwide rights to the Playtex trademark for gloves.
The strategic sale of the Playtex gloves business will allow the Company to better focus and utilize its resources on its other product lines.
Total assets sold were $3.1, resulting in a pre-tax gain on sale of $15.9 in the first quarter of fiscal 2018.
The gain on sale of Playtex gloves recognized for fiscal year 2018 was $15.3.
Refer to Note 3 of our Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion related to the sale of the Playtex gloves business.
Executive Summary 



The following is a summary of key results for the first quarter of fiscal 2019 compared to the first quarter of fiscal 2018.

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]



(1)Includes pre-tax Selling, general and administrative expense (“SG&A”) of $1.4 for the first quarter of fiscal 2019 associated with certain information technology enablement expenses for Project Fuel.
Operating Results 



The following table presents changes in net sales for the first quarter of fiscal 2019, as compared to the corresponding period in fiscal 2018, and provides a reconciliation of organic net sales to reported amounts.
Net Sales



[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]



For the first quarter of fiscal 2019, net sales were $457.1, a 2.4% decrease when compared with the prior year period.
Excluding the impact of the acquisition of Jack Black, the disposition of the Playtex gloves business, and currency movements, organic net sales decreased 3.5% versus the prior year period, as overall volumes decreased primarily in North America and Latin America offset by growth in Europe and Asia Pacific.
Feminine Care had declines in volumes across all brands of tampons and pads.
Wet Shave was impacted by unfavorable price mix in the quarter.
For further discussion regarding net sales, including a summary of reported versus organic changes, see “Segment Results.”



Gross Profit 



Gross profit was $193.5 during the first quarter of fiscal 2019, as compared to $199.3 in the prior year period.
Gross margin as a percent of net sales for the first quarter of fiscal 2019 was 42.3%, representing a 30 basis point decline over the prior year gross margin of 42.6%.
Excluding $0.1 of costs associated with the Sun Care Reformulation, gross margin decreased 20 basis points to 42.4%.
The impact of lower volumes across all segments (70 basis points) and unfavorable price mix in Wet Shave, Infant Care, and Feminine Care (40 basis points) was mostly offset by favorable cost mix (60 basis points) driven by lower operational spending.
32



Selling, General and Administrative Expense



SG&A was $87.3 in the first quarter of fiscal 2019, or 19.1% of net sales, as compared to $97.9 in the prior year period, or 20.9% of net sales.
Excluding $2.8 of SG&A costs associated with the acquisition of Jack Black, $1.4 of information technology enablement charges for Project Fuel, $0.9 of expenses incurred in connection with an investor settlement and $1.1 of favorable currency, SG&A as a percent of organic net sales decreased by 250 basis points.
The operational improvement in SG&A was largely driven by savings generated through our corporate savings initiatives, including Project Fuel, as well as a favorable comparison to higher prior year one-time expenses related to severance and asset write offs.
Savings were partially offset in part by higher e-commerce investments.
Advertising and Sales Promotion Expense



For the first quarter of fiscal 2019, advertising and promotion expense (“A&P”) was $51.6, up $2.6 as compared to the prior year period.
A&P spending as a percent of net sales was 11.3%, as compared to 10.5% in the prior year period.
The increase in A&P was primarily driven by Sun and Skin Care and Wet Shave.
North America A&P increased, driven by the new Hydro media campaign and f.a.b sampling.
International A&P increased in support of the Hawaiian Tropic launch in Australia.
Research and Development Expense



Research and development expense (“R&D”) for the first quarter of fiscal 2019 was $12.6, compared to $16.1 in the prior year period.
As a percent of sales, R&D was 2.8% in the first quarter of fiscal 2019 compared to 3.4% in the prior year period.
The reduction in R&D as a percent of sales compared to the prior year is primarily driven by timing of spend in Wet Shave in the first quarter of fiscal 2019.
Interest Expense Associated with Debt



Interest expense associated with debt for the first quarter of fiscal 2019 was $16.0, a decrease from the prior year period of $17.8.
The decline in interest expense was the result of lower outstanding debt under the U.S. revolving credit facility in fiscal 2019.
Other Expense



Other expense was $1.3 in the first quarter of fiscal 2019 compared to $1.3 in the prior year period.
Both periods reflect the reclassification of the pension credit from Cost of products sold and SG&A to Other expense.
The impact of the pension benefit was $0.6 in the first quarter of fiscal 2019 and $1.7 in the prior year period.
The offsetting fluctuation was impacted by foreign currency exchange contract gains and losses and the revaluation of nonfunctional currency balance sheet exposures.
Income Tax Provision



The effective tax rate for the first quarter of fiscal 2019 was 105.7% compared to 79.8% in the prior year period.
The effective tax rate for the current period includes a $4.7 net transitional charge resulting from the enactment of the Tax Act.
Excluding the tax impact of restructuring charges, investor settlement expenses, Jack Black acquisition and integration costs, Sun Care reformulation charges, the impact of the Tax Act, and the disposition of the Playtex gloves business, the adjusted effective tax rate was 26.6% and 34.1% for the first quarter of fiscal 2019 and fiscal 2018, respectively.

The following table presents a reconciliation of the adjusted effective tax rate, which is a Non-GAAP measure:



[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]



(1)Includes adjustments for the impact of the Tax Act, restructuring charges, investor settlement expense, Jack Black acquisition and integration costs, Sun Care reformulation charges, and the gain on sale of the Playtex gloves business.
See reconciliation of net earnings to adjusted net earnings.
Savings Initiatives



Project Fuel is an enterprise-wide transformational initiative, launched in the second fiscal quarter of 2018, designed to address all aspects of our business and cost structure, simplifying and transforming the organization, structure and key processes that will enable us to achieve its desired future state operations.
We expect Project Fuel will generate $225 to $240 in total annual gross savings by the end of the 2021 fiscal year.
It is expected that the savings generated will be used to fuel investments and brand building in strategic growth initiatives, offset anticipated operational headwinds from inflation and other rising input costs, and improve our overall profitability and cash flow.
To implement the restructuring element of Project Fuel, we estimate one-time pre-tax charges to be approximately $130 to $140, with an additional capital investment of $60 to $70 through the end of fiscal year 2021.
In the first quarter of fiscal 2019 Project Fuel related restructuring charges and capital expenditures were $18.5 and $5.3, respectively.
First quarter Project Fuel related savings were $24.8, bringing cumulative savings to $40.2.
For further information on our restructuring projects, refer to Note 4 of Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements.

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]



Wet Shave segment profit for the first quarter of fiscal 2019 was $55.0, up $1.3, or 2.4%, inclusive of the impact of currency movements.
Sun and Skin Care



Sun and Skin Care segment net sales and segment profit are affected by the seasonality of sun care products.
As a result, segment net sales and segment profit historically have been higher in the second and third quarters of the fiscal year.
[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]



Sun and Skin Care net sales for the first quarter of fiscal 2019 increased 12.9%, inclusive of a 20.0% increase due to the acquisition of Jack Black, partially offset by a 1.7% decline from the disposition of the Playtex gloves business and a 1.5% decline due to currency movements.
Sales in North America increased due to favorable Sun Care price mix and volume growth in Bulldog.
Globally, Bulldog sales increased nearly 27% with growth coming from both International and North American markets.
[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]



Segment loss for the first quarter of fiscal 2019 was $0.6, a decrease in loss of $5.6 or 90.3%, inclusive of the impact of the acquisition of Jack Black, sale of the Playtex gloves business, and currency movements.

For the first quarter of fiscal 2019, general corporate expenses were $13.7, or 3.0% of net sales, compared to $18.7, or 4.0% of net sales, in the prior year quarter.
The decline in corporate expense relates to prior year severance payouts and reductions in other salary and benefit payments.
Liquidity and Capital Resources



At December 31, 2018, substantially all our cash balances were located outside the U.S.
We manage our worldwide cash requirements by reviewing available funds among the many subsidiaries through which we conduct business and the cost effectiveness with which those funds can be accessed.
We generally repatriate a portion of current year earnings from select non-U.S. subsidiaries only if the economic cost of the repatriation is not considered material.
The counterparties to deposits consist of several major financial institutions.
We consistently monitor positions with, and credit ratings of, counterparties both internally and by using outside ratings agencies.
Our total borrowings were $1,334.1 at December 31, 2018, including $224.0 tied to variable interest rates.
Our total borrowings at September 30, 2018 were $1,300.2.
As of December 31, 2018, we had outstanding borrowings of $39.0 under our unsecured revolving credit facility in the U.S. (the “Revolving Facility”) and $8.6 of outstanding letters of credit.
Taking into account outstanding borrowings and outstanding letters of credit at December 31, 2018, $677.4 remains available under the Revolving Facility.
At September 30, 2018, we had outstanding borrowings of $7.0 under the Revolving Facility.
As of December 31, 2018 and September 30, 2018, we had approximately $185.0 outstanding under the Term Loan.
The Term Loan was retired on February 6, 2019 as a result of a $185.0 prepayment funded through a drawdown on the Revolving Facility.
We had outstanding international borrowings, recorded in Notes payable, of $10.1 and $8.2 as of December 31, 2018 and September 30, 2018, respectively.
The expected minimum required contribution to our pension plans in fiscal 2019 is $7.3; however, discretionary contributions may also be made.
As of December 31, 2018, we were in compliance with the provisions and covenants associated with our debt agreements.

Cash Flows



A summary of our cash flow activities is provided in the following table:



[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]



Operating Activities



Cash flow used by operating activities was $46.4 during the first quarter of fiscal 2019, compared to $24.1 during the same period in the prior year.
Due to the seasonality of our Company’s business, primarily in Sun Care, the first fiscal quarter is typically the lowest operating cash flow quarter of the year.
The decline in operating cash flow in the current quarter was primarily driven by the build of inventory for the upcoming Sun Care season in North America, the processing of returns related to the fiscal 2018 season, and the timing of payments.
These decreases were offset by reduced accounts receivable as additional receivables were sold in the quarter from our $150 uncommitted master accounts receivable purchase agreement entered into on September 15, 2017 with The Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ, Ltd., New York Branch, as the purchaser.
We expect that fiscal 2019 free cash flow will be above 100% of GAAP net earnings.
Investing Activities



Cash flow used by investing activities was $2.9 during the first quarter of fiscal 2019, compared to cash from investing activities of $11.2 during the same period in the prior year.
The change was primarily due to the sale of the Playtex gloves business in fiscal 2018 for $19.0, partially offset by reduced capital expenditures of $9.4 during the first quarter of fiscal 2019 compared to $11.6 during the same period in the prior year.
Additionally, investing cash inflows of $2.5 and $1.7 were reclassified from operating activities as a result of collections on the deferred purchase price of accounts receivables sold.
Financing Activities



Net cash from financing activities was $24.5 during the first quarter of fiscal 2019, compared to net cash from financing activities of $35.9 during the same period in the prior year.
During the first quarter of fiscal 2019, we had $32.0 of additional borrowings under the Revolving Facility, offset by employee shares withheld for taxes and short-term debt.
In the prior year period, we drew $153.0 under the Revolving Facility which was offset by share repurchases of $115.2.
Share Repurchases



During the first quarter of fiscal 2019, we did not repurchase any common stock.
We have 10.0 common shares available for repurchase in the future under the Board’s authorization to repurchase our common shares.
Commitments and Contingencies



Contractual Obligations



During the first three months of fiscal 2019, our net borrowings on our revolving credit facilities were $32.0.
As of December 31, 2018, future minimum repayments of debt are as follows: $185.0 in fiscal 2019, $39.0 in fiscal 2020, $600.0 in fiscal 2021, and $500.0 in fiscal 2022.
The $185.0 Term Loan due in fiscal 2019 was repaid February 6, 2019 resulting in additional repayments of $185.0 due in fiscal 2020.
There have been no other material changes in our contractual obligations since the presentation in our Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC on November 19, 2018.
