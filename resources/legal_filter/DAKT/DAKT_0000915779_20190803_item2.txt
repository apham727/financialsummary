We design, manufacture and sell a wide range of display systems to customers throughout the world. We focus our sales and marketing efforts on markets, geographical regions and products. Our five business segments consist of four domestic business units and the International business unit. The four domestic business units consist of Commercial, Live Events, High School Park and Recreation, 
and Transportation, all of which include the geographic territories of the United States and Canada. Disclosures related to our business segments are provided in "Note 5. Segment Reporting" of the Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Report. 
Our net sales and profitability historically have fluctuated due to the impact of uniquely configured orders, such as display systems for professional sports facilities, colleges and universities, and spectacular projects in the commercial area, as well as the seasonality of the sports market. Uniquely configured orders can include several displays, controllers, and subcontracted structure builds, each of which can occur on varied schedules per the customer's needs. Outdoor installation sales can be impacted by outdoor weather conditions and the construction season. Our third fiscal quarter tends to be a slower quarter because it includes two holidays, it is affected by sports seasonality, and generally less outdoor construction work occurs due to weather conditions. 
Our mission is to be the world leader at informing and entertaining audiences through dynamic audio-visual communication systems. We organize into business units to focus on customer loyalty over time to earn new and replacement business because our products have a finite lifetime. See "Note 5. Segment Reporting" of the Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Report for further information. Our strategies include the creation of a comprehensive line of innovative solutions and systems and our ability to create and leverage platform designs and technologies. These strategies align us to effectively deliver value to our varied customers and their market needs, while serving our stakeholders over the long-term. We focus on creating local capabilities for sales, service, and manufacturing in geographies with expected digital market opportunities. We believe consistently generating profitable growth will provide value to our stakeholders (customers, employees, shareholders, suppliers, and communities).
•our ability to generate profits over the long-term to provide a shareholder return.
•National accounts standard display market opportunities due to customers' desire to communicate their message, advertising and content consistently across the country. Increased demand is possible from national retailers, quick serve restaurants, petroleum retailers, and other nationwide organizations. 
•Additional standard display offerings using micro-light emitting diode ("LED") designs.
•Dynamic messaging systems demand growth due to market adoption and expanded use of this technology. 
•The use of architectural lighting products for commercial buildings, which real estate owners use to add accents or effects to an entire side or circumference of a building to communicate messages or to decorate the building.
•The continued deployment of digital billboards as Out-of-Home ("OOH") advertising companies continue developing new sites and replacing digital billboards reaching end of life. This is dependent on no adverse changes occurring in the digital billboard regulatory environment restricting future billboard deployments, as well as maintaining our current market share in a business that is concentrated in a few large OOH companies.
•Lower product costs, driving an expansion of the marketplace.
•Our product and service offerings, including additional micro-LED offerings which remain the most integrated and comprehensive offerings in the industry.
•The competitive nature of sports teams, which strive to out-perform their competitors with display systems.
•The desire for high-definition video displays, which typically drives larger displays or higher resolution displays, both of which increase the average transaction size.
•Increasing use of LED technologies replacing signage previously using LCD technology in and surrounding live events facilities.
•Increased demand for video systems in high schools as school districts realize the revenue generating potential of these displays compared to traditional scoreboards and these systems' ability to provide or enhance academic curriculum offerings for students.
•Increased demand for different types of displays and dynamic messaging systems, such as message centers at schools to communicate to students, parents and the broader community.
•Lower system costs driving the use of more sophisticated displays in school athletic facilities, such as large integrated video systems.
•Expanding control system options tailored for the markets' needs.
Daktronics, Inc. operates on a 52- or 53-week fiscal year, with our fiscal year ending on the Saturday closest to April 30 of each year. When April 30 falls on a Wednesday, the fiscal year ends on the preceding Saturday. Within each fiscal year, each quarter is comprised of 13-week periods following the beginning of each fiscal year. In each 53-week year, an additional week is added to the first quarter, and each of the last three quarters is comprised of a 13-week period. The fiscal year ended April 27, 2019 consisted of 52 weeks. Fiscal 2020 will be a 53-week year; therefore, the quarter ended August 3, 2019 contains operating results for 14 weeks while the quarter ended July 28, 2018 contains operating results for 13 weeks.
Sales and orders were impacted as a result of the first quarter of fiscal 2020 including 14 weeks compared to the more common 13 weeks. The first quarter of fiscal 2019 contained 13 weeks. 
For net sales, during the first quarter of fiscal 2020, we achieved a $12.9 million per week average run rate as compared to $11.9 million per week during the first quarter of fiscal 2019, or an approximate 8.6% increase. This change was driven by the order volume reasons described below and the timing of conversion related to the seasonality in our business.
For orders, during the first quarter of fiscal 2020, we achieved a $13.4 million per week average run rate as compared to $12.3 million per week during the first quarter of fiscal 2019, or an approximate 9.1% increase. We had an increase in orders placed during the first quarter of fiscal 2020 related to new releases of our product offerings.
The increase in orders for the three months ended August 3, 2019 compared to the same period one year ago was primarily due to the timing of projects in the on-premise and OOH niches. 
Orders increased for the three months ended August 3, 2019 compared to the same period one year ago due to an increase in the number of projects for professional sports, arenas, and college and universities venues.
Orders decreased for the three months ended August 3, 2019 compared to the same period one year ago due to variability in order timing and a decrease in large video projects compared to the same period last year.
Orders for the three months ended August 3, 2019 compared to the same period one year ago remained relatively flat. 
Orders increased for the three months ended August 3, 2019 compared to the same period one year ago primarily due to general variations in the timing of large contracts and account-based order placements.
The product order backlog as of August 3, 2019 was $207 million as compared to $177 million as of July 28, 2018 and $202 million at the end of the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019. Historically, our product order backlog varies due to the seasonality of our business, the timing of large projects, and customer delivery schedules for these orders. The product order backlog as of August 3, 2019 increased in our Live Events, Transportation, and International business units from July 28, 2018 and decreased in our High School Park and Recreation business unit.
All areas of selling expenses were impacted as a result of the first quarter of fiscal 2020 including 14 weeks compared to the more common 13 weeks. The first quarter of fiscal 2019 contained 13 weeks. Selling expense in our Commercial, Live Events, and High School Park and Recreation business units increased in the first quarter of fiscal 2020 compared to the same quarter a year ago due to personnel related expenses. Selling expense in our International business unit decreased in the first quarter of fiscal 2020 compared to the same quarter a year ago due to a decrease in third-party commissions. Selling expense in our Transportation business unit for the first quarter of fiscal 2020 remained relatively flat compared to the same quarter a year ago. 
All areas of operating expenses were impacted as a result of the first quarter of fiscal 2020 including 14 weeks compared to the more common 13 weeks. The first quarter of fiscal 2019 contained 13 weeks.
General and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries, other employee-related costs, professional fees, shareholder relations costs, facilities and equipment-related costs for administrative departments, training costs, and the cost of supplies. 
General and administrative expenses in the first quarter of fiscal 2020 increased as compared to the same period one year ago primarily due to the additional week of operating results added to the first quarter of fiscal 2020. 
technologies are focused on varied pixel density for image quality and use, expanded product line offerings for our various markets and geographies, improved quality and reliability, and improved cost points. We plan to make continued investments in our software and controller capabilities throughout our various product offerings. Through our design efforts, we focus on standardizing display components and control systems for both single site and network displays. 
The change in interest income, net for the first quarter of fiscal 2020 compared to the same period one year ago was primarily due to the change in investment levels caused by the volatility of working capital needs.
We calculate the provision for income taxes during interim reporting periods by applying an estimate of the annual effective tax rate for the full fiscal year to “ordinary” income or loss (pretax income or loss excluding unusual or infrequently occurring discrete items) for the reporting period. Due to various factors, including having operations in multiple jurisdictions worldwide, our effective tax rate is subject to fluctuation. 
We have recorded a tax rate of 12.6 percent for the first quarter of fiscal 2020 as compared to an effective tax rate benefit of 13.1 percent for the first quarter of fiscal 2019. The change in the effective tax rate is primarily driven by the benefit of research and development tax credits and foreign tax credits proportionate to pre-tax book income for each period.
Working capital was $120.2 million and $119.6 million at August 3, 2019 and April 27, 2019, respectively. The changes in working capital, particularly changes in accounts receivable, accounts payable, inventory, and contract assets and liabilities, and the sports market seasonality can have a significant impact on the amount of net cash provided by operating activities largely due to the timing of payments and receipts. On multimillion-dollar orders, the time between order acceptance and project completion may extend up to or exceed 12 months depending on the amount of custom work and a customer’s delivery needs. We often receive down payments or progress payments on these orders.
We had $4.0 million of retainage on long-term contracts included in receivables and contract assets as of August 3, 2019, which has an impact on our liquidity. We expect to collect these amounts within one year. When working capital is needed, we have historically financed our cash needs through a combination of cash flow from operations and borrowings under bank credit agreements.  During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019, we violated one of our bank covenants, but we received a waiver from our banking institution for the year ended April 27, 2019. As of August 3, 2019, we were in compliance with all applicable bank loan covenants.
For more information on these agreements, see "Note 10. Financing Agreements" of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended April 27, 2019. We expect to enter into a new credit facility, loan agreement, and guaranty agreement prior to our current agreements expiring in November 2019.
We are sometimes required to obtain performance bonds for display installations, and we have a bonding line available through a surety company for an aggregate of $150.0 million in bonded work outstanding. If we were unable to complete the work, and our customer would call upon the bond for payment, the surety company would subrogate its loss to Daktronics. At August 3, 2019, we had $21.8 million of bonded work outstanding against this line.
Our business growth and profitability improvement strategies depend on investments in capital expenditures and strategic investments. We are projecting capital expenditures to be less than $25 million for fiscal 2020 for purchases of manufacturing equipment for new or enhanced product production, expanded capacity, investments in quality and reliability equipment, and continued information infrastructure investments. We also evaluate and may invest in new technologies or acquire companies aligned with our business strategy. 
We believe our working capital available from all sources will be adequate to meet the cash requirements of our operations and strategies in the foreseeable future. If our growth extends beyond current expectations, or if we make significant strategic investments, we may need to utilize and possibly increase our credit facilities or seek other means of financing. We anticipate we will be able to obtain any needed funds under commercially reasonable terms from our current lenders or other sources, although this availability cannot be guaranteed.
There has been no material change in our off-balance sheet arrangements and contractual obligations since the fiscal year ended April 27, 2019. For additional information, see our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended April 27, 2019.
