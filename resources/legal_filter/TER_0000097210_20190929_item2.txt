Overview  



We are a leading global supplier of automation equipment for test and industrial applications.
Our industrial automation products include collaborative robotic arms, autonomous mobile robots and advanced robotic control software used by global manufacturing and light industrial customers to improve quality, increase manufacturing and material handling efficiency and decrease manufacturing costs.
Our automatic test equipment and industrial automation products and services include:  



   • 



semiconductor test (“Semiconductor Test”) systems;   



   • 



industrial automation (“Industrial Automation”) products;   



   • 



defense/aerospace (“Defense/Aerospace”) test instrumentation and systems, storage test (“Storage Test”) systems, and circuit-board test and inspection (“Production Board Test”) systems (collectively these products represent “System Test”); and   



   • 



wireless test (“Wireless Test”) systems.
It is difficult to predict whether these positive trends will continue in 2020.
On February 26, 2018, we acquired Energid Technologies Corporation (“Energid”) for a total purchase price of approximately $27.6 million.
Energid’s technology enables and simplifies the programming of complex robotic motions used in a wide variety of end markets, ranging from heavy industry to healthcare, utilizing both traditional robots and collaborative robots.
On April 25, 2018, we acquired Mobile Industrial Robots ApS (“MiR”), a Danish limited liability company.
MiR is the leading maker of collaborative autonomous mobile robots for industrial applications.
The total purchase price was approximately $197.8 million, which included cash paid of approximately $145.2 million and $52.6 million in fair value of contingent consideration payable upon achievement of certain thresholds and targets for revenue and earnings before interest and taxes through 2020.
Contingent consideration for 2018 was $30.8 million and was paid in March 2019.
The maximum payment for the remaining MiR contingent consideration that could be paid is $81.0 million.

MiR and Energid are included in our Industrial Automation segment.
On January 30, 2019, we acquired all of the issued and outstanding shares of Lemsys SA (“Lemsys”) for a total purchase price of approximately $9.1 million.
Lemsys strengthens our position in the electrification trends of vehicles, solar, wind, and industrial applications.
Lemsys is included in our Semiconductor Test segment.
On June 3, 2019, we invested $15 million in RealWear, Inc. (“RealWear”).
RealWear, a private company, develops and sells advanced wearable technology including industrial, hands-free, head-mounted augmented reality devices that make the workplace safer and more productive.
On October 18, 2019, we entered into an agreement to acquire 100% of the equity of AutoGuide, LLC (“AutoGuide”), a maker of high-payload autonomous mobile robots (AMRs), an emerging and fast growing segment of the global forklift market for $58 million of cash and up to $107 million in earn-outs potentially through 2022.
AutoGuide is based in Chelmsford, MA.
AutoGuide’s AMRs are used for material transport of payloads up to 4,500 kg in manufacturing, warehouse and logistics applications.
The acquisition of AutoGuide is expected to close in the fourth quarter of 2019, subject to customary closing conditions and regulatory approval.
AutoGuide will be included in Teradyne’s Industrial Automation segment.
Investment in Other Company  



We hold an investment in a private company that develops and sells advanced wearable technology.
The investment was recorded at cost and is evaluated for impairment or an indication of changes in fair value resulting from observable price changes in orderly transactions for the identical or a similar investment of the same issuer on a quarterly basis.
See Note D: “Acquisitions and Investment in Other Company.”  



Leases  



In February 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) 



2016-02,  



“Leases (Topic 842)” (“Topic 842”), which requires a lessee to record a 



right-of-use (“ROU”) asset and a lease liability on the balance sheet for operating leases with terms longer than twelve months.
We adopted this standard and the related amendments (collectively “ASC 842”) on January 1, 2019 and utilized the modified retrospective approach provided by ASU 



2018-11,  



“Leases (Topic 842): Targeted Improvements,” that allowed for a cumulative effect adjustment in the period of adoption.
Under this method of adoption, the comparative information in the consolidated financial statements has not been revised and continues to be reported under the previously applicable lease accounting guidance (ASC 840).
We also utilized the package of practical expedients permitted under the transition guidance which included the carry-forward of historical lease classification.
Adoption of ASC 842 resulted in recording ROU assets and lease liabilities of approximately $50.1 million and $54.3 million, respectively.
Operating lease liabilities were calculated using the discount rate on January 1, 2019.
The adoption of ASC 842 did not have a material impact on beginning retained earnings, the consolidated statement of operations, cash flows, or earnings per share.
Under ASC 842, a contract is or contains a lease when we have the right to control the use of an identified asset.
We determine if an arrangement is a lease at inception of the contract, which is the date on which the terms of the contract are agreed to and the agreement creates enforceable rights and obligations.
The commencement date of the lease is the date that the lessor makes an underlying asset available for use.
As of September 29, 2019, we do not have material leases that have not yet commenced.
We determine if the lease is operating or finance at the lease commencement date based upon the terms of the lease and the nature of the asset.
The lease term used to calculate the lease liability includes options to extend or terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain that the option will be exercised.
34 



Table of Contents 



For leases commencing after January 1, 2019, the lease liability is measured at the present value of future lease payments, discounted using the discount rate for the lease at the commencement date.
As we are typically unable to determine the implicit rate, we use an incremental borrowing rate based on the lease term and economic environment at commencement date.
We initially measure payments based on an index by using the applicable rate at lease commencement.
Variable payments that do not depend on an index are not included in the lease liability and are recognized as they are incurred.
The ROU asset is initially measured as the amount of lease liability, adjusted for any initial lease costs, prepaid lease payments, and reduced by any lease incentives.
Our contracts often include 



non-lease components such as common area maintenance.
We elected the practical expedient to account for the lease and 



non-lease components as a single lease component.
For leases with a term of one year or less we elected not to record the lease asset or liability.
The lease payments are recognized in the consolidated statement of earnings on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
The increase in System Test revenues of $23.7 million, or 47.8%, was primarily due to higher sales in Storage Test of 3.5” hard disk drive and system level testers, higher sales in Defense/Aerospace test instrumentation and systems, and higher sales in Production Board Test from higher 5G demand.
The increase in Industrial Automation revenues of $3.0 million, or 4.6%, was due to higher demand for collaborative autonomous mobile robots.
The increase in Wireless Test revenues of $8.0 million, or 23.3%, was primarily due to higher demand for millimeter wave test products driven by new wireless standards and 5G.
Revenues by country as a percentage of total revenues were as follows (1):  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Revenues attributable to a country are based on location of customer site.
Gross Profit  



Our gross profit was as follows:  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 



36 



Table of Contents 



Gross profit as a percent of revenue increased by 0.4 points, primarily due to favorable product mix in Semiconductor Test and Storage Test.
This quarterly process identifies obsolete and excess inventory.
Obsolete inventory, which represents items for which there is no demand, is fully reserved.
Excess inventory, which represents inventory items that are not expected to be consumed during the next twelve quarters for our Semiconductor Test, System Test and Industrial Automation segments and the next four quarters for our Wireless Test segment, is written-down to estimated net realizable value.
During the three months ended September 29, 2019, we recorded an inventory provision of $3.0 million included in cost of revenues primarily due to downward revisions to previously forecasted demand levels, of which $1.9 million was related to Semiconductor Test, $0.7 million was related to Wireless Test and $0.4 million was related to System Test.
During the three months ended September 30, 2018, we recorded an inventory provision of $3.3 million included in cost of revenues primarily due to downward revisions to previously forecasted demand levels, of which $2.1 million was related to Semiconductor Test, $0.7 million was related to Wireless Test, and $0.4 million was related to Industrial Automation.
During the three months ended September 29, 2019 and September 30, 2018, we scrapped $3.4 million and $1.7 million of inventory, respectively.
During the three months ended September 29, 2019 and September 30, 2018, we sold $0.8 million and $1.0 million of previously written-down or 



written-off inventory, respectively.
As of September 29, 2019, we had inventory related reserves, which had been written-down or 



written-off totaling $101.2 million.
We have no 



pre-determined timeline to scrap the remaining inventory.
Selling and Administrative  



Selling and administrative expenses were as follows:  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 



The increase of $9.0 million in selling and administrative expenses was due primarily to higher spending in Industrial Automation from higher sales and marketing spending in Universal Robots and MiR, and higher stock compensation expense from the modification of Teradyne’s former chief financial officer’s outstanding equity awards.
Restructuring and Other  



During the three months ended September 29, 2019, we recorded a $7.8 million gain for the decrease in the fair value of the MiR contingent consideration liability, partially offset by $0.5 million recorded for employee severance charges primarily in Industrial Automation, $0.5 million for acquisition related compensation and expenses, and $0.3 million of fixed assets impairment in Wireless Test.

Table of Contents 



During the three months ended September 30, 2018, we recorded $1.7 million for employee severance charges, primarily in Semiconductor Test and $0.8 million for acquisition related compensation, partially offset by a $0.8 million gain for the decrease in the fair value of the Universal Robots contingent consideration liability.
Interest and Other  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 



Interest income decreased by $1.0 million due primarily to lower unrealized gains on equity marketable securities in 2019.
Other (income) expense, net decreased by $0.7 million due primarily to lower foreign exchange losses.
The increase in income before income taxes in System Test was primarily due to higher sales in Storage Test of 3.5” hard disk drive testers and system level testers, higher sales in Defense/Aerospace test instrumentation and systems, and higher sales in Production Board Test from higher 5G demand.
The increase in income before income taxes in Wireless Test was primarily due to higher demand for millimeter wave test products.
The decrease in income before income taxes in Industrial Automation was primarily due to higher sales and marketing, and engineering spending.
Income Taxes  



The effective tax rate for the three months ended September 29, 2019 and September 30, 2018 was 10.5% and 14.8%, respectively.
The decrease in the effective tax rate from the three months ended September 29, 2019 to the three months ended September 30, 2018 primarily resulted from the tax rate effect of a projected shift in the geographic distribution of income, which reduces the income subject to taxation in higher tax rate jurisdictions relative to lower tax rate jurisdictions, an increase in the net favorable impact of the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, and an increase in net discrete tax benefit.

Revenues  



Revenues by our four reportable segments were as follows:  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 



The decrease in Semiconductor Test revenues of $37.2 million, or 3.2%, was driven primarily by a decrease in sales in the automotive and memory test segments, partially offset by an increase in semiconductor tester sales for 5G infrastructure and image sensors.
The increase in Industrial Automation revenues of $33.0 million, or 18.7%, was primarily due to higher demand for collaborative robots.
The increase in System Test revenues of $42.6 million, or 26.2%, was primarily due to higher sales in Storage Test of 3.5” hard disk drive testers, higher sales in Defense/Aerospace test instrumentation and systems, and higher sales in Production Board Test from higher 5G demand.

Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements  



On January 26, 2017, the FASB issued ASU 



2017-04,  



“Intangibles—Goodwill and Other (Topic 350): Simplifying the Accounting for Goodwill Impairment.” The new guidance removes Step 2 of the goodwill impairment test, which requires a hypothetical purchase price allocation.
Goodwill impairment will be the amount by which a reporting unit’s carrying value exceeds its fair value, not to exceed the carrying amount of goodwill.
All other goodwill impairment guidance will remain largely unchanged.
Entities will continue to have the option to perform a qualitative assessment to determine if a quantitative impairment test is necessary.
The same 



one-step impairment test will be applied to goodwill at all reporting units, even those with zero or negative carrying 



43 



Table of Contents 



amounts.
Entities will be required to disclose the amount of goodwill at reporting units with zero or negative carrying amounts.
The revised guidance will be applied prospectively, and is effective in 2020.
Early adoption is permitted for any impairment tests performed after January 1, 2017.
Item 2:  



Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds
