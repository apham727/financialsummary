Revenue. Consolidated revenue for the three months ended March 31, 2019, increased by 1.2 percent year over year, from $439.6 million in the first quarter of 2018 to $444.7 million in the first quarter of 2019. Increases in revenues for the three month period in our Industrial and Government and Defense business units were partially offset by declines in the Commercial business unit.
Cost of goods sold. Cost of goods sold for the three months ended March 31, 2019 were $211.1 million compared to cost of goods sold for the three months ended March 31, 2018 of $221.7 million. The decrease in cost of goods sold for the three month periods is primarily related to the decline in our Commercial business unit, which was largely a result of our divestiture of the Consumer and Small and Medium-sized ("SMB") Security businesses as announced in February 2018.
Gross profit. Gross profit for the quarter ended March 31, 2019, was $233.7 million compared to $217.9 million for the same quarter last year. Gross margin, defined as gross profit divided by revenue, increased from 49.6 percent in the first quarter of 2018 to 52.5 percent in the first quarter of 2019. The increase in gross margin for the three and nine month periods was primarily due to product mix in the Government and Defense business unit and product mix and productivity improvement in the Industrial business unit. 
Research and development expenses. Research and development expenses for the first quarter of 2019 totaled $48.0 million, compared to $44.6 million in the first quarter of 2018. Research and development expenses as a percentage of revenue were 10.8 percent for the three months ended March 31, 2019 and 10.1 percent for the three months ended March 31, 2018. We have, and will continue to have, fluctuations in quarterly spending depending on product development needs and overall business spending priorities and believe that annual spending levels are most indicative of our commitment to research and development. Over the past five annual periods through December 31, 2018, our annual research and development expenses have varied between 8.5 percent and 9.9 percent of revenue, and we currently expect these expenses to remain within that approximate range, on an annual basis, for the foreseeable future.
Selling, general, and administrative expenses. Selling, general, and administrative expenses were $104.6 million and $107.7 million for the quarters ended March 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. The decrease in selling, general, and administrative expenses year over year is primarily attributed to a $15 million regulatory settlement recorded in the first quarter of 2018 partially offset by acquisition related expenses for acquisitions occurring in the first quarter of 2019. Selling, general, and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue were 23.5 percent and 24.5 percent for the quarters ended March 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. Over the past five annual periods through December 31, 2018, our annual selling, general and administrative expenses have varied between 19.4 percent and 21.8 percent of revenue, and excluding the impact of the $15.0 million regulatory settlement cost described above, we currently expect these expenses to remain within that approximate range, on an annual basis, for the foreseeable future.
Loss on sale of business. During the first quarter of 2018, we recorded an additional pre-tax loss on the sale of our Consumer and SMB Security businesses of $10.2 million. See Note 20, "Business Acquisitions and Divestitures," of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.
Interest expense. Interest expense for the three months ended March 31, 2019, was $5.5 million, compared to $4.1 million for the same period of 2018. Interest expense for the three month period in 2019 was primarily associated with the $425 million aggregate principal amount of our 3.125 percent senior unsecured notes and interest on amounts drawn under our credit facility. Interest expense for the same period in 2018 was primarily associated with the $425 million aggregate principal amount of our 3.125 percent senior unsecured notes. 
Income taxes. Our income tax provision of $13.0 million for the three months ended March 31, 2019, represents an effective tax rate of 17.4 percent. Our income tax provision for the three months ended March 31, 2018 was $15.4 million, which represented an effective tax rate of 28.2 percent. The effective tax rate for the three months ended March 31, 2019 is lower than the United States Federal tax rate of 21 percent mainly due to a reduction in previously non-deductible interest expense and excess tax benefits from stock compensation, offset partially by state taxes, higher tax rates applied to income earned in certain foreign jurisdictions, and other discrete items.
Industrial business unit revenue for the quarter ended March 31, 2019 increased by 5.1 percent compared to the same period of 2018. The increase in revenue for the three month period ended March 31, 2019, compared to the same period of 2018, was predominately attributable to strong growth across the cooled cores and UAS product lines partially offset by volume declines in the Integrated Imaging Systems (IIS) business. The increases in earnings from operations and corresponding operating margin for the three month period ended March 31, 2019, compared to the same period of 2018, were predominately attributable to favorable product mix in the OEM cores business and productivity initiatives to improve manufacturing efficiency across all divisions. The decline in backlog during the three months ended March 31, 2019 is primarily attributed to productivity initiatives executed during the period to reduce lead times for customer deliveries of our machine vision and volume hand-held product lines.
Government and Defense business unit revenue for the quarter ended March 31, 2019 increased by 8.8 percent compared to the same period of 2018. The increase in both revenue and earnings from operations for the three month period ended March 31, 2019, compared to the same period of 2018, was primarily driven by increased volumes of UAS products and surveillance systems as well as the partial period revenue related to the acquisitions of Aeryon Labs Inc. and Endeavor Robotics Holdings Inc. during the quarter ended March 31, 2019. The decline in operating margin for the three month period ended March 31, 2019, compared to the same period of 2018 is also attributed to the inclusion of the results from these acquisitions. See Note 20, "Business Acquisitions and Divestitures," for further information. The increase in year-over-year backlog is primarily driven by timing of orders and subsequent timing of deployment of major programs in addition to the first quarter of 2019 acquisitions as noted above. 
Commercial business unit revenue for the quarter ended March 31, 2019 decreased by 16.1 percent compared to the same period of 2018. The decrease in both revenue and earnings from operations for the three month period ended March 31, 2019 compared to the same period of 2018 was primarily due to the divestiture of our Consumer and SMB Security business during the first quarter of 2018 and volume declines in our Outdoor and Tactical Systems ("OTS") business. The decrease in year over year backlog is primarily attributed to a shift to non-current backlog for certain orders as well as volume declines in the OTS business. 
At March 31, 2019, we had a total of $284.4 million in cash and cash equivalents, $95.2 million of which resided in the United States and $189.2 million at our foreign subsidiaries, compared to cash and cash equivalents at December 31, 2018, of $512.1 million, of which $327.0 million resided in the United States and $185.1 million at our foreign subsidiaries. The decrease in cash and cash equivalents during the three months ended March 31, 2019, was primarily due to cash used for business acquisitions of $579.6 million, common stock repurchases of $25.0 million, dividend payments of $23.0 million, a minority interest investment of $5.0 million and capital expenditures of $9.1 million, partially offset by cash provided from operations of $55.5 million, net proceeds of $348.1 million from our revolving credit facility and long-term debt, and proceeds of $9.7 million from shares issued under our stock compensation plans.
Cash provided by operating activities during the three months ended March 31, 2019 totaled $55.5 million, which primarily consisted of net earnings, adjusted for depreciation and amortization, stock-based compensation, other non-cash items and changes in working capital. The increase of cash provided by operating activities in 2019 over 2018 was due to an increase in net income and working capital improvements.
Cash used by investing activities for the three months ended March 31, 2019 totaled $590.7 million, which consisted primarily of business acquisitions, a minority interest investment and capital expenditures in the ordinary course of business.
Cash provided by financing activities for the three months ended March 31, 2019 totaled $308.3 million, which primarily consisted of cash provided from net proceeds from our revolving credit facility and long-term debt, and proceeds from shares issued under our stock compensation plans, partially offset by repurchases of shares of our common stock and the payment of quarterly dividends.
To manage the interest rate risk arising from the variability in interest expense attributable to amounts drawn under the Swedish kronor term loan, we entered into a floored amortizing interest rate swap with a Swedish kronor notional amount equivalent to $150.0 million. The interest rate swap was designated, and effective, as cash flow hedges.
In June 2016, we issued $425.0 million aggregate principal amount of our 3.125 percent senior unsecured notes due June 15, 2021 (the “Notes”). The net proceeds from the issuance of the Notes were approximately $421.0 million, after deducting underwriting discounts and offering expenses, which are being amortized over a period of five years. Interest on the Notes is payable semiannually in arrears on December 15 and June 15. The proceeds from the Notes were used to repay our 3.750 percent senior unsecured notes that were due September 1, 2016, and are being used for general corporate purposes, which include working capital and capital expenditure needs, business acquisitions, and repurchases of our common stock.
On February 8, 2017, our Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to 15.0 million shares of our outstanding common stock. This authorization expired on February 8, 2019. On February 7, 2019, our Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to 15.0 million shares of our outstanding common stock. This authorization will expire on February 7, 2021. As of March 31, 2019, a total of 0.5 million shares have been repurchased under the February 7, 2019 authorization. 
As of March 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018, the Company has accrued income tax liabilities of $42.9 million related to the transition tax enacted on December 22, 2017 as part of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. Of the amounts accrued, none are expected to be due within one year. The remaining transition tax will not accrue interest and will be paid in annual installments beginning in 2020 through 2024.
See Note 17, "Contingencies," of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for the disclosure of certain matters by the Company to the United States Department of State Office of Defense Trade Controls Compliance, communications to the Company from the United States Department of Commerce Bureau of Industry and Security, and the Company's current estimates of the range of potential loss associated with quality concerns identified by the Company regarding certain SkyWatch Surveillance Towers.
All share repurchases are subject to applicable securities law, and are at times and in amounts as management deems appropriate. These repurchases were through open market transactions under the authorization by our Board of Directors on February 7, 2019 to repurchase of up to 15.0 million shares of our outstanding common stock. This authorization will expire on February 7, 2021.
