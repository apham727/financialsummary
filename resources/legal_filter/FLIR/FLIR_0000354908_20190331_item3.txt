Interest Rate Risk
The Company’s exposure to changes in market interest rates relates primarily to interest paid on the Company’s floating rate long-term debt. The Company’s floating rate long-term debt consists of amounts borrowed under our revolving loan facility that bears interest at the respective Eurocurrency rate (i.e. LIBOR) plus a scheduled spread. Fluctuations in market interest rates will cause interest expense increases or decreases on such long-term debt.
