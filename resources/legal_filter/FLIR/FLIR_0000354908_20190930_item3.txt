Interest Rate Risk
The Company’s exposure to changes in market interest rates relates primarily to interest paid on the Company’s outstanding floating rate debt. The Company’s outstanding floating rate debt consists of amounts borrowed under our revolving loan facility as well as outstanding term loans. These borrowings bear interest at the respective Eurocurrency rate (e.g. LIBOR) plus a scheduled spread. Fluctuations in market interest rates will cause interest expense increases or decreases on such outstanding debt.
See Note 6, "Derivative Financial Instruments - Interest Rate Swap Contracts," Note 13, "Credit Agreement," and Note 14, "Long-Term Debt," of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements and Item 2 of Part I, "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations," for additional information on the Company's interest rate risk.
