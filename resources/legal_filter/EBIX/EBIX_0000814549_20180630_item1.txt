financial statements and notes thereto included in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2017.
Restricted Cash- As part of the ItzCash Card Limited ("ItzCash") acquisition, $4.0 million of the possible future contingent earn-out payments is being held in escrow accounts for the twelve month period following the effective date of the acquisition to ensure that the acquired business achieves the minimum specified annual gross revenue threshold. This threshold has been achieved and will be paid out in the subsequent quarter. Additionally, as part of the Wdev Solucoes em Technologia SA ("Wdev") acquisition, upfront cash consideration is being held in an escrow account for the thirty-eight month period following the effective date of the acquisition to ensure that the acquired business achieves the minimum specified annual net revenue threshold, which if not achieved will result in said funds being returned to Ebix. As of June 30, 2018 there is $2.6 million included in other long-term assets of the Company's Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet.
 Advertising—Advertising costs amounted to $3.9 million and $3.1 million in the first six months of 2018 and 2017, respectively, and are included in sales and marketing expenses in the accompanying Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income. Under legacy US GAAP 340-20, direct response advertising was eligible for capitalization if certain conditions were met. During the first six months of 2017 reported sales and marketing expenses included $2.0 million of amortization of certain direct-response advertising costs associated with our medical education services, which have been capitalized in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification ("ASC") Topic 340. These costs were previously amortized to advertising expense over periods ranging from twelve to twenty-four months based on the type of product the customer purchased. Effective January 1, 2018 Subtopic 340-40 replaced that guidance to require the costs of direct-response advertising to be expensed as they are incurred or the first time the advertising takes place. The Company was required to recognize a cumulative effective change to opening retained earnings in the year of adoption of the standard. The Company recorded a one-time $1.9 million adjustment to retained earnings on January 1, 2018 and is expensing all future costs from this date forward. Under the new guidance Subtopic 340-40, the Company's expense decreased by $497 thousand during the first six months of 2018 from what would have been recorded under legacy US GAAP 340-20.
•Level 2 Inputs - Other than quoted prices included in Level 1 inputs, which are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly, for substantially the full term of the asset or liability.
 A financial instrument's level within the fair value hierarchy is based on the lowest level of any input that is significant to the fair value measurement.
•Short-term investments (commercial bank certificates of deposits and mutual funds), for which the fair values are measured as a Level 1 instrument.
•Contingent accrued earn-out business acquisition consideration liabilities for which fair values are measured as Level 3 instruments. These contingent consideration liabilities were recorded at fair value on the acquisition date and are re-measured quarterly based on the then assessed fair value and adjusted if necessary. The increases or decreases in the fair value of contingent consideration payable can result from changes in anticipated revenue levels and changes in assumed discount periods and rates. As the fair value measure is based on significant inputs that are not observable in the market, they are categorized as Level 3.
Revenue Recognition—In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers ("Topic 606"). Topic 606 outlines a single comprehensive model for companies to use in accounting for revenue arising from contracts with customers, and supersedes most current revenue recognition guidance, including industry-specific guidance. In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-08, Principal Versus Agent Considerations (Reporting Revenue Gross Versus Net), which amends the principal-versus-agent implementation guidance and in April 2016 the FASB issued ASU 2016-10, Identifying Performance Obligations and Licensing, which amends the guidance in those areas in the new revenue recognition standard.
• recognition of revenue when, or as, we satisfy a performance obligation.
For contracts that contain multiple deliverables, we analyze the revenue arrangements in accordance with the relevant technical accounting guidance, which provides criteria governing how to determine whether goods or services that are delivered separately in a bundled sales arrangement should be considered as separate performance obligations for the purpose of revenue recognition. These types of arrangements include obligations pertaining to software licenses, system set-up, and professional services associated with product customization or modification. Delivery of the various contractual obligations typically occurs over periods of less than eighteen months. These arrangements generally do not have refund provisions or have very limited refund terms. 
Software development arrangements involving significant customization, modification or production are accounted for in accordance with the appropriate technical accounting guidance issued by FASB using the percentage-of-completion method. The Company recognizes revenue using periodic reported actual hours worked as a percentage of total expected hours required to complete the project arrangement and applies the percentage to the total arrangement fee.
driven by the deferral of certain services revenues associated with programming, setup, and implementation activities related to our SaaS offering and changes related to costs to obtain customers, including the related amortization period.
During the first quarter of 2018 the company recorded its meetings, incentives, conference, events (“M.I.C.E.“) revenue on a net basis for its Via.com division. The net amount reported in operating revenues was $256 thousand ($2.06 million gross revenue less associated costs of $1.8 million). During the second quarter the company determined that it is the principal to these transactions under the relevant guidance in Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, and the gross basis presentation is more appropriate for these type of revenue transactions. As a result the second quarter’s revenues included the gross presentation of the first quarter amounts. This resulted in an increase in the second quarter’s operating revenues of $1.80 million and costs of services provided of $1.8 million. Additionally the M.I.C.E. revenue pertaining to the second quarter was $1.14 million gross revenue, reported in Operating Revenues of the Company’s Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income, and associated costs of $1.03 million, reported in Costs of Services Provided of the Company’s Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income.
The Company records deferred revenue when it receives payments or invoices in advance of the performance of services. A significant portion of this balance relates to contracts where the customer has paid in advance for the use of our SaaS platforms over a specified period of time. This portion is recognized as the related performance obligation is fulfilled (generally less than one year). The remaining portion of the deferred revenue balance consists primarily of customer-specific customizations that are not distinct from related performance obligations that transfer over time. This portion is recognized over the expected useful life of the customizations.
The adoption of Topic 606 resulted in an increase to deferred revenue, which in turn generated an additional deferred tax asset that increased the Company’s net deferred tax asset position. 
Accounts Receivable and the Allowance for Doubtful Accounts—Reported accounts receivable include $107.0 million of trade receivables stated at invoice billed amounts and $41.3 million of unbilled receivables (net of the estimated allowance for doubtful accounts receivable in the amount of $6.1 million). The unbilled receivables pertain to certain projects for which the timing of billing is tied to contractual milestones. The Company is continuing to evaluate the 2017 and 2018 acquisitions that collectively make up the EbixCash Financial Exchanges, refer to Part I, Item I Business in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2017, and their impact on our condensed consolidated balance sheets. The Company adheres to such contractually stated performance milestones and accordingly issues invoices to customers as per contract billing schedules. Approximately $5.8 million of deferred revenue is included in billed accounts receivable at June 30, 2018. The Company recognized and recorded bad debt expense in the amount of $1.1 million and $2.1 million for the three and six-month periods ended June 30, 2018 and $316 thousand and $723 thousand for the three and six-month periods ended June 30, 2017, respectively. Accounts receivable are written off against the allowance account when the Company has exhausted all reasonable collection efforts. During the six months ended June 30, 2018 and 2017, $137 thousand and $313 thousand, respectively, of accounts receivable, which had been specifically reserved for in prior periods, were written off. 
The aforementioned two-step quantitative testing process involves comparing the reporting unit carrying values to their respective fair values; we determine fair value of our reporting units by applying the discounted cash flow method using the present value of future estimated net cash flows. If the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying value, then no further testing is required. However, if a reporting unit's fair value were to be less than its carrying value, we would then determine the amount of the impairment charge, if any, which would be the amount that the carrying value of the reporting unit's goodwill exceeded its implied value. Projections of cash flows are based on our views of growth rates, operating costs, anticipated future economic conditions and the appropriate discount rates relative to risk and estimates of residual values. We believe that our estimates are consistent with assumptions that marketplace participants would use in their estimates of fair value. The use of different estimates or assumptions for our projected discounted cash flows (e.g., growth rates, future economic conditions, discount rates and estimates of terminal values) when determining the fair value of our reporting units could result in different values and may result in a goodwill impairment charge.
In 2017 the goodwill residing in the Exchange reporting unit, the RCS reporting unit, and the Carrier reporting unit were evaluated for impairment using step-one of the quantitative testing process described above. The fair value of three of these reporting units were found to be greater than their carrying value and,therefore, step-two of the quantitative testing process described above became unnecessary because no impairment was indicated. In specific regards to the RCS reporting unit, its assessed fair value was $158.0 million which was $42.4 million or 36.7% in excess of its $115.6 million carrying value. Key assumptions used in the fair value determination were annual revenue growth of 7.5% to 12.5% and discount rate of 16%. As of September 30, 2017 there was $78.2 million of goodwill assigned to the RCS reporting unit. A significant reduction in future revenues for the RCS reporting unit would negatively affect the fair value determination for this unit and may result in an impairment to goodwill and a corresponding charge against earnings. We perform our annual goodwill impairment evaluation and testing as of September 30th of each year. This evaluation is performed during the fourth quarter each year. During the year ended December 31, 2017 we had no impairment of our reporting unit goodwill balances. 
Changes in the carrying amount of goodwill for the six months ended June 30, 2018 and the year ended December 31, 2017 are reflected in the following table.
Amortization expense recognized in connection with acquired intangible assets was $1.7 million and $3.6 million for the
In June 2018 the FASB issued ASU 2018-07, Compensation—Stock Compensation (Topic 718) Improvements to Nonemployee Share-Based Payment Accounting. ASU 2018-07 is intended to reduce cost and complexity and to improve financial reporting for share-based payments to nonemployees. The amendments in this ASU are effective for public business entities for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within that fiscal year. The Company has yet to assess the impact that the adoption of this ASU will have on Ebix's consolidated income statement and balance sheet. 
In January 2017 the FASB issued ASU 2017-04, Intangibles—Goodwill and Other (Topic 350) Simplifying the Test for Goodwill Impairment". To simplify the subsequent measurement of goodwill, the FASB eliminated Step 2 from the goodwill impairment test. In computing the implied fair value of goodwill under Step 2, an entity had to perform procedures to determine the fair value at the impairment testing date of its assets and liabilities (including unrecognized assets and liabilities). Instead, under the amendments in this ASU, an entity should perform its annual, or interim, goodwill impairment test by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount. A public business entity filer should adopt the amendments in this ASU for its annual or any interim goodwill impairment tests in fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019. The Company has yet to assess the impact that the adoption of this ASU will have on Ebix's consolidated income statement and balance sheet.
In January 2017 the FASB issued ASU 2017-01, Business Combinations (Topic 805) Clarifying the Definition of a Business which amended the existing FASB ASC. The standard provides additional guidance to assist entities with evaluating whether transactions should be accounted for as acquisitions (or disposals) of assets or businesses. The definition of a business affects many areas of accounting, including acquisitions, disposals, goodwill, and consolidation. ASU 2017-01 is effective for fiscal 2019 with early adoption permitted. The Company has yet to assess the impact that the adoption of this ASU will have on Ebix's consolidated income statement and balance sheet
In November 2016 the FASB issued ASU 2016-18, Statement of Cash Flow (Topic 230) Restricted Cash amends ASC 230 to add or clarify guidance on the classification and presentation of restricted cash in the statement of cash flows. The amendments in this ASU require that a statement of cash flows explain the change during the period in the total of cash, cash equivalents, and amounts generally described as restricted cash or restricted cash equivalents. Therefore, amounts generally described as restricted cash and restricted cash equivalents should be included with cash and cash equivalents when reconciling the beginning-of-period and end-of-period total amounts shown on the statement of cash flows. The amendments are effective for public business entities for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, and interim periods within those fiscal years. The amendments in this ASU should be applied using a retrospective transition method to each period presented. The Company adopted the new guidance on January 1, 2018 with no material impact to its statement of cash flows. For the six months ended June 30, 2018 and 2017, the Company held $4.0 million and $4.0 million, respectively, in "Restricted cash" and $2.6 million and $2.9 million, respectively, in "Other long-term assets" of the Company's Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet.
recognize the income tax consequences of an intra-entity transfer of an asset other than inventory when the transfer occurs. The amendments eliminate the exception for an intra-entity transfer of an asset other than inventory. Two common examples of assets included in the scope of the amendments are intellectual property, and property, plant and equipment. The amendments do not include new disclosure requirements; however, existing disclosure requirements might be applicable when accounting for the current and deferred income taxes for an intra-entity transfer of an asset other than inventory. The amendments align the recognition of income tax consequences for intra-entity transfers of assets other than inventory with International Financial Reporting Standards. IAS 12, Income Taxes, requires recognition of current and deferred income taxes resulting from an intra-entity transfer of any asset (including inventory) when the transfer occurs. The amendments are effective for public business entities for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim reporting periods within those annual reporting periods. Early adoption is permitted for all entities in the first interim period if an entity issues interim financial statements. The amendments should be applied on a modified retrospective basis through a cumulative-effect adjustment directly to retained earnings as of the beginning of the period of adoption. The Company adopted the new guidance on January 1, 2018 with no material impact to its consolidated financial statements.
In February 2016 the FASB issued ASU 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842). This new accounting guidance is intended to improve financial reporting about leasing transactions. The ASU affects all companies and other organizations that lease assets such as real estate, airplanes, and manufacturing equipment. The ASU will require organizations that lease assets referred to as “Lessees” to recognize on the balance sheet the assets and liabilities for the rights and obligations created by those leases. An organization is to provide disclosures designed to enable users of financial statements to understand the amount, timing, and uncertainty of cash flows arising from leases. These disclosures include qualitative and quantitative requirements concerning additional information about the amounts recorded in the financial statements. Under the new guidance, a lessee will be required to recognize assets and liabilities for leases with lease terms of more than twelve months. Consistent with current GAAP, the recognition, measurement, and presentation of expenses and cash flows arising from a lease by a lessee primarily will depend on its classification as a finance or operating lease. However, unlike current GAAP which requires only capital leases to be recognized on the balance sheet the new ASU will require both types of leases (i.e., operating and capital) to be recognized on the balance sheet. The FASB lessee accounting model will continue to account for both types of leases. The capital lease will be accounted for in substantially the same manner as capital leases are accounted for under existing GAAP. For operating leases there will have to be the recognition of a lease liability and a lease asset for all such leases greater than one year in term. Public companies will be required to adopt the new leasing standard for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2018. Early adoption is permitted for all companies and organizations. For calendar year-end public companies, this means an adoption date of January 1, 2019 and retrospective application to previously issued annual and interim financial statements for 2018 and 2017. Lessees with a large portfolio of leases are likely to see a significant increase in balance sheet assets and liabilities. See Note 5 for the Company’s current lease commitments. The Company is evaluating the impact that this new leasing ASU will have on its financial statements.
 The Company seeks to execute accretive business acquisitions (which primarily targets businesses that are complementary to Ebix's existing products and services), in combination with organic growth initiatives, as part of its comprehensive business growth and expansion strategy. 
Effective April 1, 2018 Ebix entered into an agreement to acquire India based CentrumDirect Limited ("Centrum"), a leader in India’s foreign exchange and outward remittance markets for approximately $179.5 million.

On August 18, 2017 Ebix entered into an agreement to acquire MTSS Business of YouFirst Money Express Private Limited ("YouFirst") for upfront cash consideration in the amount $10.2 million. The acquisition, effective September 1, 2017, was funded in October following the securing of requisite approvals for the closing. The valuation and purchase price allocation for the YouFirst acquisition remains preliminary and will be finalized as soon as practicable but in no event longer than one year from the effective date of this transaction.
Effective June 1, 2017 Ebix acquired the assets of beBetter Health, Inc., ("beBetter"), a technology enabled corporate wellness provider that provides end-to-end wellness solutions offering a variety of tools and programs, including interactive platforms, health screening, coaching, tobacco cessation, weight and stress management, health information, and numerous other products and services. Ebix acquired the assets and intellectual property of beBetter for $1.0 million plus possible future contingent earn-out payments of up to $2.0 million based on earned revenues over the subsequent twenty-four month period following the effective date of the acquisition. 
Effective April 1, 2017 Ebix entered into a joint venture with India-based Essel Group, while acquiring an 80% stake in ItzCash Card Limited ("ItzCash"), India’s leading payment solutions exchange. ItzCash is recognized as a leader in the prepaid cards and bill payments space in India. Under the terms of the agreement, ItzCash was valued at a total enterprise value of approximately $150 million. Accordingly, Ebix acquired an 80% stake in ItzCash for $120 million including upfront cash of $76.3 million plus possible future contingent earn-out payments of up to $44.0 million based on earned revenues over the subsequent thirty-six month period following the effective date of the acquisition. $4.0 million of the possible future contingent earn-out payments is being held in escrow accounts for the twelve month period following the effective date of the acquisition to ensure that the acquired business achieves the minimum specified annual gross revenue threshold, which if not achieved will result in said funds being returned to Ebix. The Company has determined that the fair value of the contingent earn-out consideration is $19.4 million as of June 30, 2018. The valuation and purchase price allocation for the ItzCash acquisition remains preliminary. 
 Consideration paid by the Company for the businesses it purchases is allocated to the assets and liabilities acquired based upon their estimated fair values as of the date of the acquisition. The excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair values 
of assets acquired and liabilities assumed is recorded as goodwill. Recognized goodwill pertains to the value of the expected synergies to be derived from combining the operations of the businesses we acquire including the value of the acquired workforce. 
The aggregated unaudited pro forma financial information pertaining to all of the Company's acquisitions that have an impact on the six months ended June 30, 2018 and June 30, 2017, which includes the acquisitions of the ItzCash (acquired April 2017), beBetter (acquired June 2017), YouFirst (acquired September 2017), WallStreet (acquired October 2017), Paul Merchants (acquired November 2017), Via (acquired November 2017), Transcorp (acquired February 2018), Centrum (acquired April 2018), and Smartclass (acquired April 2018) and as presented in the table below is provided for informational purposes only and is not a projection of the Company's expected results of operations for any future period. No effect has been given in this pro forma information for future synergistic benefits that may still be realized as a result of combining these companies or costs that may yet be incurred in integrating their operations. The 2018 and 2017 pro forma financial information below assumes that all such business acquisitions were made on January 1, 2017, whereas the Company's reported financial statements for the three and six months ended June 30, 2018 only include the operating results from these businesses since the effective date that they were acquired by Ebix.
During the three months ended June 30, 2018 the Company's reported total operating revenues increased by $37.2 million or 43% to $124.6 million as compared to $87.4 million during the same period in 2017.
During the six months ended June 30, 2018 the Company's reported total operating revenues increased by $66.4 million or 40% to $232.9 million as compared to $166.5 million during the same period in 2017.

The 2018 and 2017 pro forma financial information assumes that all business acquisitions made during this period were made on January 1, 2017, whereas the Company's reported financial statements for three months and six months ended June 30, 2018 only includes the revenues from these businesses since the effective date that they were acquired or consolidated by Ebix, being April 2017 for Itzcash, June 2017 for beBetter, September 2017 for YouFirst, October 2017 for WallStreet, November 2017 for Paul Merchants, November 2017 for Via, February 2018 for Transcorp, April 2018 for Centrum, and April 2018 for Smartclass.
•2018 and 2017 pro forma revenue contains actual revenue of the acquired entities before acquisition date, as reported by the sellers, as well as actual revenue of the acquired entities after acquisition, whereas the reported growth in revenues of the acquired entities after acquisition date are only reflected for the period after their acquisition.
•Revenue billed to existing clients from the cross selling of acquired products has been assigned to the acquired section of our business.
On November 3, 2017 the Company and certain of its subsidiaries entered into the Fifth Amendment (the “Fifth Amendment”) to the Credit Agreement to exercise $50 million of its aggregate $100 million accordion option, increasing the total Term Loan Commitment to $175 million. $20 million of the increase was funded on November 3, 2017 and the remaining $30 million shall be disbursed upon the satisfaction of certain closing requirements set forth in the Fifth Amendment. Both such disbursements are tied to permitted acquisitions as set forth in the Fifth Amendment.
On November 3, 2017, the Company and certain of its subsidiaries entered into the Fourth Amendment and Waiver (the “Fourth Amendment”) to the Credit Agreement. The Fourth Amendment waives certain technical defaults related to the failure to give required notice with respect to i) the existence of a subsidiary having intellectual property with an aggregate value above a stipulated amount and ii) the additional investment in a joint venture entity resulting in that entity becoming a subsidiary of the Company for the purpose of the Credit Agreement. In addition to such waiver, the Fourth Amendment also loosened the leverage ratios the Company is required to satisfy in connection with permitted acquisitions and for compliance generally.
On October 19, 2017, the Company and certain of its subsidiaries entered into the Third Amendment and Waiver (the “Third Amendment”) to the Credit Agreement. The Third Amendment waives certain technical defaults related to the Company’s making certain restricted payments in excess of those permitted under the Credit Agreement. In addition to such waiver, the Third Amendment also loosened the limitations on the restricted payment covenant under the Credit Agreement.
As of June 30, 2018 the Company's consolidated balance sheet includes $5.4 million of remaining deferred financing costs in connection with this credit facility, which are being amortized as a component of interest expense over the five-year term of the financing agreement. In regards to these deferred financing costs, $3.3 million pertains to the revolving line of credit component of the Credit Agreement, and $2.1 million pertains to the term loan component of the Credit Agreement of which $449 
thousand is netted against the current portion and $1.6 million is netted against the long-term portions of the term loan as reported on the Condensed Consolidated Balance.
At June 30, 2018, the outstanding balance on the term loan was $246.9 million of which $12.5 million is due within the next twelve months, with $3.13 million payments having been made during the six months ended June 30, 2018. This term loan also carried an interest rate of 4.25%. The current and long-term portions of the term loan are included in the respective current and long-term sections of the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets, the amounts of which were $12.5 million and $234.4 million respectively at June 30, 2018. 
Lease Commitments—The Company leases office space under non-cancelable operating leases with expiration dates ranging through 2029, with various renewal options. Capital leases range from three to five years and are primarily for computer equipment. There were multiple assets under various individual capital leases at June 30, 2018 and 2017. Rental expense for office facilities and certain equipment subject to operating leases for the six months ended June 30, 2018 and 2017 was $7.8 million and $2.5 million (net of a $(948) thousand purchase accounting adjustment), respectively.
As of June 30, 2018 a liability of $9.2 million for uncertain tax positions is included in other long-term liabilities of the Company's Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet. During the three and six months ended June 30, 2018 there was $29 thousand and $59 thousand in additions to this liability reserve, respectively. During the three and six months ended June 30, 2017, there were $2.8 million and $3.3 million, respectively, in additions to this liability reserve. The Company recognizes interest accrued and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as part of income tax expense.
During the first six months of 2018 the United States' revenues decreased $6.8 million due primarily to a combination of decreased professional services and a seasonal decrease of continuing medical education services. Canada's revenues decreased by $1.1 million primarily due to decreased revenue from professional services. Latin America's revenues increased $2.3 million primarily due to increased professional services, net of a $(795) thousand decrease due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates. Australia's revenues increased by $1.7 million primarily due to a combination of increased professional services and transaction fees, and a $409 thousand increase due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates. India's revenue increased $63.4 million of which $2.5 million is due to the various new e-governance contracts with a number of large clients and $60.8 million due to the revenues associated with the acquisitions of ItzCash (Q2 2017), YouFirst (Q3 2017), Wall Street (Q4 2017), Paul Merchants (Q4 2017), Via (Q4 2017), Transcorp (Q1 2018), Centrum (Q2 2018) and Smartclass (Q2 2018). Increases in Indonesia, Philippines, Singapore and United Arab Emirates are due to the November 2017 acquisition of Via (Q4 2017).
In the geographical information table above the significant changes to long-lived assets from June 30, 2017 to June 30, 2018 were comprised of an increase in the United States of $4.4 million primarily due to capitalized continuing medical education product costs and the continued build out of our global corporate headquarters campus in Johns Creek, Georgia. A decrease occurred in Latin America of $4.1 million primarily due to a 14.8% weakening of the Brazilian Real versus the U.S. Dollar which caused a $1.2 million decrease in the translation of long-lived assets plus continued amortization of intangible assets. An increase in India of $307.1 million is primarily due to a $313.3 million increase associated with the acquisitions of YouFirst (Q3 2017), Wall Street (Q4 2017), Paul Merchants (Q4 2017), Via (Q4 2017), Transcorp (Q1 2018), Centrum (Q2 2018) and Smartclass (Q2 2018), partially offset for purchase accounting adjustments made for ItzCash (Q2 2017) acquisition. The Europe increase of $3.3 million is primarily due to an increase in deferred tax assets primarily due to the release of valuation allowances of operating loss carryforwards, partially offset by the amortization of intangible assets and capitalized software development costs.
Effective January 2, 2018 Paul Merchants acquired a 10% equity interest in Ebix’s combined international remittance business in India (comprised of YouFirst, Wall Street , Paul Merchants, and Transcorp) for cash consideration of $5.0 million. The consolidation of these acquisitions into Ebix's Financial Exchange operations will bring synergies and reduce certain redundancies to the combined operation.
