Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
Restricted Cash - The carrying value of our restricted cash in current assets was $18.2 million and $8.3 million at September 30, 2019 and December 31, 2018, respectively. The September 30, 2019 balance consists of upfront cash consideration and possible future contingent earn-out payments held in an escrow account in connection with a 2016 business acquisition. If earn-out targets are not achieved, amounts held in escrow will be returned to the Company. The Company also holds fixed deposits pledged with banks for issuance of bank guarantees and letters of credit related to its India operations.
Advertising—Advertising costs amounted to $2.0 million and $2.3 million in the three months ended September 30, 2019 and 2018, respectively, and $7.6 million and $6.2 million in the nine months ended 2019 and 2018, respectively. The costs are included in sales and marketing expenses in the accompanying Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income. 
•Level 1 Inputs - Unadjusted quoted prices available in active markets for identical investments to the reporting entity at the measurement date.
•Level 2 Inputs - Other than quoted prices included in Level 1 inputs, which are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly, for substantially the full term of the asset or liability.
 A financial instrument's level within the fair value hierarchy is based on the lowest level of any input that is significant to the fair value measurement.
•Short-term investments (commercial bank certificates of deposits and mutual funds), for which the fair values are measured as a Level 1 instrument.
Quantitative Information about Level 3 Fair Value Measurements
Sensitivity to Changes in Significant Unobservable Inputs
and determination of the fair value of contingent earn-out liabilities for purchased businesses. During 2018 and 2019, certain of the Company's contingent earn-out liabilities were adjusted because of changes to anticipated future revenues from these acquired businesses, or as a result of finalizing purchase price allocations that were previously provisional.
Revenue Recognition—The Company derives its revenues primarily from software subscription and transaction fees, software license fees, financial transaction fees, risk compliance solution services fees, and professional service fees including associated fees for consulting, implementation, training, and project management provided to customers with installed systems and applications. 
•identification of the contract, or contracts, with a customer;
•allocation of the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract; and
EbixCash Exchanges ("EbixCash") 
EbixCash also offers several other services, primarily including payment services and ticketing and travel services for which revenue is impacted by varying factors. EbixCash acts as the principal in transactions and reports revenue on a gross basis, as EbixCash controls the service at all times prior to transfer to the customer, is primarily responsible for fulfilling the customer contracts, has the risk of loss, and has the ability to establish transaction prices.
Foreign Exchange and Outward Remittance Services
For EbixCash’s foreign exchange and payment services, customers agree to terms and conditions for all transactions, either at the time of initiating a transaction or signing a contract with EbixCash to provide payment services on the customer’s behalf. In the majority of EbixCash’s foreign exchange and payment services, EbixCash makes payments to the recipient to satisfy its performance obligation to the customer, and therefore, EbixCash recognizes revenue on foreign exchange and payment services when this performance obligation has been fulfilled.
Consumer Payment Services
considerations for each of EbixCash’s bill payment services. For all transactions, EbixCash’s customers agree to EbixCash’s terms and conditions, either at the time of initiating a transaction (where the consumer is determined to be the customer for revenue recognition purposes) or upon signing a contract with EbixCash to provide services on the biller’s behalf (where the biller is determined to be the customer for revenue recognition purposes). As with consumer money transfers, customers engage EbixCash to perform one integrated service—collect money from the consumer and process the bill payment transaction, thereby providing the billers real-time or near real-time information regarding their customers’ payments and simplifying the billers’ collection efforts. EbixCash’s revenues from bill payment services are generated from contracts to process transactions at any time during the duration of the contract. The transaction price on bill payment services is contractual and determinable. Certain biller agreements may include per-transaction or fixed periodic rebates, which EbixCash records as a reduction to revenue.
EbixCash Travel revenues are primarily derived from commissions and transaction fees received from various travel providers and international exchanges involved in the sale of travel to the consumer. EbixCash Travel revenue is for a single performance obligation and is recognized at a point in time. Travel revenues include reservation commissions, segment fees from global travel exchange providers, and transaction net revenues (i.e., the amount charged to travelers less the amount owed to travel service providers) in connection with our reservation services; ancillary fees, including travel insurance-related revenues and certain reservation booking fees; and credit card processing rebates and customer processing fees. EbixCash Travel services include the sale of hotel rooms, airline tickets, bus tickets and train tickets. EbixCash’s Travel revenue is also derived from ticket sales, wherein the commissions payable to EbixCash Travel, along with any transaction fees paid by travel providers and travel exchanges, is recognized as revenue after completion of the service. The transaction price on such services is agreed upon at the time of the purchase.
EbixCash Travel revenue for the corporate MICE (Meetings, Incentives, Conferences, and Exhibitions) packages is recognized at full purchase value at the completion of the obligation with the corresponding costs recorded under direct expenses. For MICE revenues, EbixCash Travel acts as the principal in transactions, and accordingly reports revenue on a gross basis. EbixCash Travel controls the service at all times prior to transfer to the customer, is responsible for fulfilling the customer contracts, has the risk of loss, and has the ability to establish transaction prices.
Insurance Exchanges
Software-as-a-Service ("SaaS")
The Company allocates the transaction price to each distinct performance obligation using the relative stand-alone selling price. Determining the stand-alone selling price may require significant judgement. The stand-alone selling price is the price at which an entity has sold or would sell a promised good or service separately to a customer. The Company determines the stand-alone selling price based on observable price of products or services sold separately in comparable circumstances, when such observable prices are available. When standalone selling price is not directly observable, the Company estimates the stand-alone selling price using the market assessment approach by considering historical pricing and other market factors.
Transaction Fees
Risk Compliance Services ("RCS")
RCS revenues consist of two revenue streams—Certificates of Insurance (COI) and Consulting Services. COI revenues are derived from consideration paid by customers for the creation and tracking of certificates of insurance. These are transactional-based revenues. Consulting Services revenues are driven by distinct consulting service engagements rendered to customers for which revenues are recognized using the output method on a time and material basis as the services are performed.
The Company provides services to issue and track certificates of insurance in the United States and Australian markets. Revenue is derived from transaction fees for each certificate issued or tracked. The Company recognizes revenue at the issuance of each certificate or over the period the certificate is being tracked.
 Disaggregation of Revenue
The revenues for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2018 shown below have been adjusted to reflect this change.
Costs to Obtain and Fulfill a Contract
Contract Liabilities
The Company records contract liabilities when it receives payments or invoices in advance of the performance of services. A significant portion of this balance relates to contracts where the customer has paid in advance for the use of our SaaS platforms over a specified period of time. This portion is recognized as the related performance obligation is fulfilled (generally less than one year). Part of our performance obligation for these contracts consists of the requirement to provide our customers with continued access to, and use of, our SaaS platforms and associated customizations. Without continued access to the SaaS platform, the customizations have no separate benefit to the customer. Our customers simultaneously receive and consume the benefits as we provide access over time. The remaining portion of the contract liabilities balance consists primarily of customer-specific customizations that are not distinct from related performance obligations that transfer over time. This portion is recognized over the expected useful life of the customizations.
Accounts Receivable and the Allowance for Doubtful Accounts—Reported accounts receivable include $165.4 million of trade receivables stated at invoice billed amounts and $35.3 million of contract assets (net of the estimated allowance for doubtful accounts receivable in the amount of $21.0 million). The Company records a contract asset when revenue recognized on a contract exceeds the billings. The contract asset is transferred to receivables when the entitlement to payment becomes unconditional. These contract assets are primarily related to project based revenue where we recognize revenue using the input method calculated using expected hours to complete the project measured against the actual hours completed to date. Approximately $4.4 million and $10.2 million, respectively, of contract liabilities (deferred revenue) is uncollected and included in billed accounts receivable at September 30, 2019 and December 31, 2018. The Company recognized bad debt expense in the amount of $11.9 million and $10.6 million for the three and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2019 and $524 thousand and $2.6 million for the three and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2018, respectively. Management specifically analyzes accounts receivable and historical bad debts, write-offs, customer concentrations, customer credit-worthiness, current economic trends and changes in our customer payment terms when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts. 
In the third quarter of 2019, the Company recorded a $12.1 million bad debt reserve as a precautionary measure, against the receivables due from a public sector entity, BSNL, in India. Payment of these receivables has been delayed due to liquidity issues at BSNL. The Government of India has recently approved funding to BSNL and the Company expects the accounts to be collectible once the Government funding reaches BSNL.
The aforementioned quantitative testing process involves comparing the reporting unit carrying values to their respective fair values; we determine fair value of our reporting units by applying the discounted cash flow method using the present value of future estimated net cash flows. If the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying value, then no further testing is required. However, if a reporting unit’s fair value were to be less than its carrying value, we would then determine the amount of the impairment charge, if any, which would be the amount that the carrying value of the reporting unit’s goodwill exceeded its implied value. We perform our annual goodwill impairment evaluation and testing as of October 1st of each year or when events or circumstances dictate more frequently. During the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 we had no impairment of our reporting unit goodwill balances.
Changes in the carrying amount of goodwill for the nine months ended September 30, 2019 and the year ended December 31, 2018 are reflected in the following table.
Amortization expense recognized in connection with acquired intangible assets was $2.7 million and $7.9 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2019, respectively, and $1.6 million and $5.2 million for the three months and nine months ended September 30, 2018, respectively.
In November 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-18, Collaborative Arrangements (Topic 808) Clarifying the Interaction between Topic 808 and Topic 606 (Revenues from Customers). ASU 2018-18 clarifies the interaction between the guidance for certain collaborative arrangements and the Revenue Recognition financial accounting and reporting standard. A collaborative arrangement is a contractual arrangement under which two or more parties actively participate in a joint operating activity and are exposed to significant risks and rewards that depend on the activity’s commercial success. The ASU provides guidance on how to assess whether certain transactions between collaborative arrangement participants should be accounted for within the revenue recognition standard. The ASU also provides comparability in the presentation of revenue for certain transactions between collaborative arrangement participants. It accomplishes this by allowing organizations to only present units of account in collaborative arrangements that are within the scope of the revenue recognition standard together with revenue accounted for under the revenue recognition standard. The parts of the collaborative arrangement that are not in the scope of the revenue recognition standard should be presented separately from revenue accounted for under the revenue recognition standard. The amendments in ASU No. 2018-18 are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019, and interim periods within those fiscal years. The Company has yet to assess the joint ventures the Company is involved with and the impact that the adoption of this ASU will have on its consolidated income statement and balance sheet. 
•Remove the disclosure of the policy for timing of transfers between levels;
•Add a disclosure for the range and weighted average of significant unobservable inputs used to develop Level 3 fair value measurement.
The Company has yet to assess the impact that the adoption of this ASU will have on Ebix's consolidated income statement and balance sheet. 
In June 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-07, Compensation-Stock Compensation (Topic 718) Improvements to Non-employee Share-Based Payment Accounting. ASU 2018-07 is intended to reduce cost and complexity and to improve financial reporting for share-based payments to non-employees. The amendments in this ASU are effective for public business entities for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within that fiscal year. The adoption of ASU 2018-07 did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows.
In January 2017 the FASB issued ASU 2017-01, Business Combinations (Topic 805) Clarifying the Definition of a Business which amended the existing FASB ASC. The standard provides additional guidance to assist entities with evaluating whether transactions should be accounted for as acquisitions (or disposals) of assets or businesses. The definition of a business affects many areas of accounting, including acquisitions, disposals, goodwill, and consolidation. ASU 2017-01 is effective for fiscal 2019 
 The Company seeks to execute accretive business acquisitions (which primarily targets businesses that are complementary to Ebix's existing products and services), in combination with organic growth initiatives, as part of its comprehensive business growth and expansion strategy.

 Consideration paid by the Company for the businesses it purchases is allocated to the assets and liabilities acquired based upon their estimated fair values as of the date of the acquisition. The excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed is recorded as goodwill. Recognized goodwill pertains to the value of the expected synergies to be derived from combining the operations of the businesses we acquire including the value of the acquired workforce.

The Government of India has recently approved funding to BSNL and while the Company expects the accounts to be collectible once the Government funding reaches BSNL.
In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842). This new accounting guidance is intended to improve financial reporting about leasing transactions. The ASU requires organizations that lease assets referred to as “Lessees” to recognize on the balance sheet the assets and liabilities for the rights and obligations created by those leases. An organization is to provide disclosures designed to enable users of financial statements to understand the amount, timing, and uncertainty of cash flows arising from leases. These disclosures include qualitative and quantitative requirements concerning additional information about the amounts recorded in the financial statements. Under the new guidance, a lessee is required to recognize assets and liabilities for leases with lease terms of more than twelve months. Consistent with current GAAP, the recognition, measurement, and presentation of expenses and cash flows arising from a lease by a lessee primarily will depend on its classification as a finance or operating lease. However, unlike former GAAP, which requires only financing leases to be recognized on the balance sheet, the new ASU requires both types of leases (i.e., operating and financing) to be recognized on the balance sheet. The financing lease will be accounted for in substantially the same manner as capital leases were accounted for under the previous guidance. For operating leases, there is now the recognition of a lease liability and a lease asset for all such leases greater than one year in term.
The Company leases office space under non-cancelable operating leases with expiration dates ranging through 2029, with various renewal options. Finance leases range from three to five years and are primarily for office equipment. There were multiple assets under various individual finance leases at September 30, 2019 and 2018. Rental expense for office and airport facilities and certain equipment subject to operating leases for the nine months ended September 30, 2019 and 2018 was $28.0 million and $14.7 million, respectively.
