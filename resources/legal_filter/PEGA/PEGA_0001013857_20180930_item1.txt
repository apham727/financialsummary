On January 1, 2018, the Company adopted Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606) using the full retrospective method which required that each prior reporting period presented be adjusted to reflect the application of this ASU. See Note 2. New Accounting Pronouncements for additional information.  
Financial instruments  
In June 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued ASU No. 2016-13, Financial InstrumentsCredit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments, which requires measurement and recognition of expected credit losses for financial assets measured at amortized cost, including accounts receivable, upon initial recognition of that financial asset using a forward-looking expected loss model, rather than an incurred loss model. Credit losses relating to available-for-sale debt securities should be recorded through an allowance for credit losses when the fair value is below the amortized cost of the asset, removing the concept of other-than-temporary impairments. The effective date for the Company will be January 1, 2020, with early adoption permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the effect this ASU will have on its consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.  
Leases  
In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842), which requires lessees to record most leases on their balance sheets, recognizing a lease liability for the obligation to make lease payments and a right-of-use asset for the right to use the underlying asset for the lease term. The effective date for the Company will be January 1, 2019, with early adoption permitted. The Company expects that most of its operating lease commitments will be subject to this ASU and recognized as operating lease liabilities and right-of-use assets upon adoption with a material impact to the Companys balance sheet but an immaterial impact to its results of operations and cash flows. The Company expects to elect the optional transition method to apply the new lease standard prospectively at the adoption date, as opposed to recasting prior reporting periods. As a result, the Company expects to recognize a cumulative-effect adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings in the period of adoption.  
ASC 606 and ASC 340-40  
On January 1, 2018, the Company adopted the ASC 606 revenue recognition standard and has adjusted prior periods to conform.  
Perpetual licenses with extended payment terms and term licenses - Revenue from perpetual licenses with extended payment terms and term licenses is now recognized when control is transferred to the client, which is defined as the point in time when the client can use and benefit from the license. Previously, the Company recognized revenue over the term of the agreements as payments became due or earlier if prepaid. Any unrecognized license revenue from these arrangements is recognized in the period that control transfers or as a cumulative adjustment to retained earnings as of December 31, 2015. Unbilled receivables in the Companys unaudited condensed consolidated balance sheets increased significantly upon adoption due to the revenue from term licenses being recognized prior to amounts being due, or prepaid, by clients and perpetual licenses with extended payment terms.

For additional information on the Companys accounting policies as a result of the adoption of ASC 606 and ASC 340-40 see Note 4. Receivables, Contract Assets, and Deferred Revenue, Note 5. Deferred Contract Costs, and Note 9. Revenue.  
Includes cash, cash equivalents, marketable securities, income taxes receivable, other current assets, property and equipment, intangible assets, goodwill, and other long-term assets (as reflected in the consolidated balance sheets in the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2017).  
Table of Contents 
Adoption of ASC 606 and ASC 340-40 did not change the Companys total cash provided by or used in operating, financing, or investing activities in the Companys unaudited condensed consolidated statements of cash flows for the nine months ended September 30, 2017.  
Table of Contents 
As of September 30, 2018, remaining maturities of marketable securities ranged from October 2018 to August 2021, with a weighted-average remaining maturity of approximately 1.5 years.  
Receivables  
Unbilled receivables are the amounts due from clients where the only condition to the right of payment is the passage of time. As of September 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017, the allowance for doubtful accounts was not material.  
Contract assets and deferred revenue  
 (1) Included in other current assets.  
 (2) Included in other long-term assets.  
 (3) Included in other long-term liabilities.  
The change in deferred revenue in the nine months ended September 30, 2018 was primarily due to $225.1 million of revenue recognized, excluding the impact of netting contract assets and deferred revenue at the contract level, during the period that was included in deferred revenue at December 31, 2017, partially offset by new billings in advance of revenue recognition.  
Major clients  
No client represented 10% or more of the Companys total receivables as of September 30, 2018 or December 31, 2017.

Assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis  
Level 1 - observable inputs such as quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities;  
Level 2 - significant other inputs that are observable either directly or indirectly; and  
The Companys cash equivalents are composed of money market funds and time deposits, which are classified within Level 1 and Level 2, respectively, in the fair value hierarchy. The Companys marketable securities, which are classified within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy are valued based on a market approach using quoted prices, when available, or matrix pricing compiled by third party pricing vendors, using observable market inputs such as interest rates, yield curves, and credit risk. The Companys investments in privately-held companies are classified within Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy and are valued using model-based techniques, including option pricing models and discounted cash flow models.  
 (1) Included in other long-term assets.

Revenue policy  
Software license revenue is primarily derived from sales of the Companys Pega Platform and software applications.  
Maintenance revenue includes revenue from client support including software upgrades on a when and-if available basis, telephone support, and bug fixes or patches.  
Services revenue is primarily derived from cloud revenue, which is sales of the Companys hosted Pega Platform and software applications, and consulting revenue, which is primarily related to new license implementations.  
Contracts with multiple performance obligations  
The Company has concluded that its software licenses are distinct performance obligations, as the client can benefit from the software on its own. Software license revenue is typically recognized at a point in time when control is transferred to the client, which is defined as the point in time when the client can use and benefit from the license. The software license is delivered before related services are provided and is functional without services, updates, and technical support.  
Stand-alone selling price for software licenses is determined using the residual approach. The Company utilizes the residual approach as license performance obligations are sold for a broad range of amounts (the selling price is highly variable) and a stand-alone selling price is not discernible from past transactions or other observable evidence. Periodically, the Company reevaluates whether the residual approach is appropriate for its license performance obligations when sold with other performance obligations. If the standalone selling price analysis illustrates that software license performance obligations are no longer highly variable, the Company will utilize the relative allocation method for such arrangements.  
Table of Contents 
Term license fees are usually payable in advance on a monthly, quarterly, or annual basis over the term of the license agreement, which is typically three to five years and may be renewed for additional terms at the clients option. Perpetual license fees are usually payable when the contract is executed.  
Maintenance  
Maintenance contracts entitle clients to receive technical support and software updates, on a when and if available basis, during the term of the maintenance contract. Technical support and software updates are considered distinct services but accounted for as a single performance obligation, as they each constitute a series of distinct services that are substantially the same and have the same pattern of transfer to the client. Maintenance revenue is recognized over time on a straight-line basis over the contract period.  
Maintenance fees are usually payable in advance on a monthly, quarterly, or annual basis over the term of the agreement.  
Services  
Services revenue is comprised of consulting, including software license implementations, training, reimbursable expenses, and cloud, which is derived from sales of the Companys hosted Pega Platform and software application environments. The Company has concluded that most services are distinct performance obligations. Consulting may be provided on a stand-alone basis or bundled with other performance obligations.  
The stand-alone selling price for fixed price consulting is based on the estimated hours versus actual hours in similar geographies and for similar contract sizes. Revenue for fixed price consulting is recognized over time as the services are provided. Fees for fixed price consulting are usually payable as contract milestones are achieved.  
Contract modifications  
if the additional products and services are distinct from the products and services in the original arrangement, and  
if the amount of consideration expected for the added products and services reflects the stand-alone selling price of those products and services.  
a prospective basis as a termination of the existing contract and the creation of a new contract; or  
a cumulative catch-up basis.

Major clients  
The Company recognizes stock-based compensation using the accelerated recognition method, treating each vesting tranche as if it were an individual grant. As of September 30, 2018, the Company had, net of estimated forfeitures, $74.2 million of unrecognized stock-based compensation expense, related to all unvested restricted stock units (RSUs) and stock options, which was expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 2.2 years.  
Grants  
Includes approximately 0.1 million RSUs which were granted in connection with the election by certain employees to receive 50% of their 2018 target incentive compensation under the Companys Corporate Incentive Compensation Plan in the form of RSUs instead of cash. Stock-based compensation of approximately $8.2 million associated with this RSU grant is expected to be recognized over a one-year period beginning on the grant date.  
RSU vestings and stock option exercises  
During the nine months ended September 30, 2018, 1.2 million shares of common stock were issued due to stock option exercises and RSU vestings under the Companys stock-based compensation plans.
