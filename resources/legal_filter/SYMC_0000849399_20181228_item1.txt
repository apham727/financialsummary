Significant accounting policies



There have been no material changes to our significant accounting policies as of and for the nine months ended December 28, 2018, except for those noted in Note 2 and Note 3, as compared to the significant accounting policies described in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended March 30, 2018.
Note 2.
Recent Accounting Standards



Recently adopted authoritative guidance



Revenue Recognition - Contracts with Customers.
In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued new authoritative guidance for revenue from contracts with customers.
The standard’s core principle is that a company recognizes revenue when it transfers promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration that the company expects to receive in exchange for those goods or services.
In addition, companies are required to capitalize certain contract acquisition costs, including commissions paid, when contracts are signed.
The asset recognized from capitalized incremental and recoverable acquisition costs is amortized on a straight-line basis consistent with the timing of transfer of the products or services to which the asset relates.
On March 31, 2018, the first day of our fiscal 2019, we adopted the new guidance on a modified retrospective basis, applying the practical expedient to all uncompleted contracts as of March 31, 2018, and as a result, results for reporting periods beginning in the first quarter of our fiscal 2019 are presented under the new revenue recognition guidance, while prior period amounts are not adjusted and continue to be reported under the prior revenue recognition guidance.
During the three and nine months ended December 28, 2018, as a result of the adoption of the new revenue recognition guidance, our net revenue increased $17 million and $26 million, respectively.
Our operating expenses increased $1 million during the three months ended December 28, 2018 and decreased $10 million during the nine months ended December 28, 2018.

The effects of the adoption of the new revenue recognition guidance on our December 28, 2018 Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets were as follows:



[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]



 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED][DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]



The adoption of the new revenue recognition guidance had no impact on our Condensed Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.
Financial Instruments - Recognition and Measurement.
In January 2016, the FASB issued new authoritative guidance on financial instruments.
The new guidance enhances the reporting model for financial instruments, which includes amendments to address aspects of recognition, measurement, presentation and disclosure.
We adopted this new guidance in the first quarter of fiscal 2019.
Substantially all of our equity investments that were not accounted for under the equity method were previously accounted for under the cost method and are now accounted for using the measurement alternative defined as cost, less impairments, adjusted for observable price changes.
Income Taxes - Intra-Entity Asset Transfers Other Than Inventory.
We adopted this new guidance in the first quarter of fiscal 2019 using a modified retrospective transition method.
The adoption resulted in a cumulative-effect adjustment of a $742 million increase to retained earnings.
This cumulative-effect adjustment primarily consisted of additional deferred tax assets related to an intra-entity sale of intangible assets in periods prior to adoption, partially offset by the write-off of income tax consequences deferred from pre-adoption intra-entity transfers and other liabilities for amounts not recognized under legacy GAAP.

Opening Balance Sheet Adjustments



The following summarizes the effect of adopting the above new accounting standards:



[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]



 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED][DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]



Recently issued authoritative guidance not yet adopted



Leases.
In February 2016, the FASB issued new guidance on lease accounting which will require lessees to recognize assets and liabilities on their balance sheet for the rights and obligations created by operating leases and will also require disclosures designed to give users of financial statements information on the amount, timing, and uncertainty of cash flows arising from leases.
The new guidance will be effective for us in our first quarter of fiscal 2020 and early adoption is permitted.
We expect to adopt the new guidance on a modified retrospective basis in our first quarter of fiscal 2020.
We have selected and are in the process of implementing a lease accounting system and finalizing our accounting policy and use of optional practical expedients.
We are continuing to evaluate the impact of this new standard on our Consolidated Financial Statements and disclosures.
Credit Losses.
In June 2016, the FASB issued new authoritative guidance on credit losses which changes the impairment model for most financial assets and certain other instruments.
For trade receivables and other instruments, we will be required to use a new forward-looking “expected loss” model.
The standard will be effective for us in our first quarter of fiscal 2021.
Internal-Use Software.
In August 2018, the FASB issued new guidance that clarifies the accounting for implementation costs in a cloud computing arrangement.
The new guidance aligns the requirements for capitalizing implementation costs incurred in a hosting arrangement that is a service contract with the requirements for capitalizing implementation costs incurred to develop or obtain internal-use software.
The standard will be effective for us in our first quarter of fiscal 2021, with early adoption permitted.
We are currently evaluating the adoption date and the impact of the adoption of this guidance on our Consolidated Financial Statements and disclosures.

Note 3.
For arrangements with multiple performance obligations, which may include hardware, software licenses, cloud services, support and maintenance, and professional services, we allocate revenue to each performance obligation on a relative fair value basis based on management’s estimate of stand-alone selling price (“SSP”).
Judgment is required to determine the SSP for each performance obligation.
The determination of SSP is made by taking into consideration observable prices in historical transactions.
Enterprise Security



Revenue for our Enterprise Security products is earned from arrangements that can include various combinations of software licenses, cloud services, hardware, support and maintenance, and professional services, which are sold directly to end-users or through a multi-tiered distribution channel.
We generally do not offer rights of return for Enterprise Security products and the distribution channel does not hold inventory.
As a result, historical returns and related reserves have been insignificant.
We offer channel rebates and marketing programs for our Enterprise Security products.
We had reserves for Enterprise Security rebates and marketing programs of $8 million recorded in Other current liabilities as of December 28, 2018, and $6 million recorded against Accounts receivable, net as of March 30, 2018.
Consumer Digital Safety



We sell consumer products and services directly to end-users and consumer packaged software products through a multi-tiered distribution channel.
We offer various channel and end-user rebates for our Consumer Digital Safety products.
Our reserves for end-user rebates are estimated based on the terms and conditions of the promotional program, actual sales during the promotion, the amount of redemptions received, historical redemption trends by product and by type of promotional program, and the value of the rebate.
We had reserves for Consumer Digital Safety rebates of $11 million recorded in Other current liabilities as of December 28, 2018 and $21 million recorded against Accounts receivable, net as of March 30, 2018.
For consumer products that include content updates, rebates are recognized as a ratable offset to revenue or contract liabilities over the term of the subscription.
Performance obligations



At contract inception, we assess the products and services promised in the contract to identify each performance obligation and evaluate whether the performance obligations are capable of being distinct and are distinct within the context of the contract.
Determining whether products and services are considered distinct performance obligations that should be accounted for separately versus together may require significant judgment.
In determining whether products and services are considered distinct performance obligations, we assess whether the customer can benefit from the products and services on their own or together with other readily available resources, and whether our promise to transfer the product or service to the customer is separately identifiable from other promises in the contract.
10

Our typical performance obligations include the following:



Performance Obligation When Performance Obligations are Typically Satisfied



Products and services transferred at a point in time:  



License with distinct deliverables When software activation keys have been made available for download



Hardware with distinct deliverables When control of the product passes to the customer; typically upon shipment



Products and services transferred over time:  



License with interrelated deliverables Over the expected performance term, beginning on the date that software activation keys are made available to the customer



Cloud hosted solutions Over the contract term, beginning on the date that service is made available to the customer



Support and maintenance Ratably over the course of the service term



Professional services As the services are provided



Timing of revenue recognition



As a result of the adoption of the new revenue recognition guidance, the timing of recognition of certain of our performance obligations has changed.
For example, certain term-based licenses with distinct performance obligations have a portion of revenue recognized up front when the software activation keys have been made available for download, whereas these arrangements were previously recognized over time.
In addition, allocating the transaction price for perpetual software licenses and support on a relative standalone selling price basis under the new guidance has generally resulted in more revenue allocated to the upfront license compared to the residual method of allocation under the previous guidance.
Conversely, certain of our perpetual licenses are not distinct from their accompanying support and maintenance under the new guidance and are now recognized over time.
The following table provides our revenue disaggregated by the timing of recognition under both the new guidance and the legacy guidance during the three months ended December 28, 2018:



[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]



11

The following table provides our revenue disaggregated by the timing of recognition under both the new guidance and the legacy guidance during the nine months ended December 28, 2018:



[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]



Contract liabilities



Contract liabilities consist of deferred revenue and customer deposit liabilities and represent cash payments received or due in advance of our performance obligations.
Deferred revenue represents billings under non-cancelable contracts before the related product or service is transferred to the customer.
Certain arrangements in our Consumer Digital Safety segment include terms that allow the end user to terminate the contract and receive a pro-rata refund for a period of time.
In these arrangements, we have concluded there are no enforceable rights and obligations during the period in which the option to cancel is exercisable by the customer and therefore the consideration received or due from the customer is recorded as a customer deposit liability.
During the three months ended December 28, 2018, we recognized $831 million of revenue from our beginning third quarter of fiscal 2019 contract liabilities balance.
During the nine months ended December 28, 2018, we recognized $1,954 million of revenue from our beginning fiscal 2019 contract liabilities balance.
Contract acquisition costs



Sales commissions that are incremental to obtaining a customer contract for which revenue is deferred are accrued and capitalized, and subsequently amortized to sales and marketing expense on a straight-line basis over three years, the expected period of benefit.
Commissions paid on renewals of support and maintenance are not commensurate with the initial commissions paid, and therefore the amortization period of commissions for initial contracts considers the estimated term of specific anticipated renewal contracts over the life of the customer.
During the three and nine months ended December 28, 2018, we recognized $25 million and $72 million, respectively, of amortization expense of capitalized contract acquisition costs.
There were no impairment losses recognized during the periods.

Note 4.
Acquisitions and Divestiture



Fiscal 2019 acquisitions



During the nine months ended December 28, 2018, we completed acquisitions of companies for an aggregate purchase price of $42 million, net of $3 million cash acquired.
The purchase prices were primarily allocated to goodwill and intangible assets.
Fiscal 2018 acquisitions



In July 2017, we completed our acquisitions of Israel-based Fireglass Ltd. and Skycure Ltd.
The total aggregate consideration for these acquisitions, primarily consisting of cash, was $345 million, net of $15 million cash acquired.
In addition, during the nine months ended December 29, 2017, we completed acquisitions of other companies for an aggregate purchase price of $66 million, net of cash acquired.
Fiscal 2018 divestiture



On October 31, 2017, we completed the sale of our website security (“WSS”) and public key infrastructure (“PKI”) solutions in our Enterprise Security segment to DigiCert Parent Inc. (“DigiCert”) and received aggregate consideration of $1.1 billion, consisting of approximately $960 million in cash and shares of common stock representing an approximate 28% interest in the outstanding common stock of DigiCert valued at $160 million as of October 31, 2017.
During our fourth quarter of fiscal 2018, the cash consideration was adjusted to $951 million as a result of sales price adjustments.
As of October 31, 2017, our WSS and PKI solutions had net assets of $450 million.
We incurred direct costs of $8 million, which was netted against the gain on divestiture.
During our third quarter of fiscal 2018, we recognized a gain on divestiture of $658 million, consisting of a $7 million gain on the sale of a short-term investment that was included in the transaction and a $651 million gain on the sale of other assets and liabilities.
During our fourth quarter of fiscal 2018, the total gain on sale was adjusted to $653 million as a result of sales price adjustments.
Income before income taxes for our WSS and PKI solutions during the three and nine months ended December 29, 2017 was $8 million and $66 million, respectively.

Note 7.
Financial Instruments and Fair Value Measurements



For financial instruments measured at fair value, fair value is the price that would be received from selling an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date.
The three levels of inputs that may be used to measure fair value are:



•Level 1: Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
•Level 2: Observable inputs other than Level 1 prices, such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities, quoted prices in less active markets or model-derived valuations.
All significant inputs used in our valuations, such as discounted cash flows, are observable or can be derived principally from or corroborated with observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities.
•Level 3: Unobservable inputs to the valuation methodology that are significant to the measurement of the fair value of assets or liabilities.
Financial instruments not recorded at fair value on a recurring basis include our non-marketable equity investments, equity method investment and our long-term debt.
Non-marketable equity investments



Our non-marketable equity investments are investments in privately-held companies without a readily determinable fair value.
Effective March 31, 2018, we adopted the new accounting guidance related to the recognition and measurement of financial instruments.
As a result, starting the first quarter of fiscal 2019, we measure these investments at cost minus impairment, if any, plus or minus changes resulting from observable price changes in orderly transactions for identical or similar investments of the same issuer.
As of December 28, 2018 and March 30, 2018, the carrying value of our non-marketable equity investments was $179 million and $175 million, respectively.
Equity method investment



Our investment in equity securities that is accounted for using the equity method is included in Other long-term assets in our Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets and consists of our equity investment in a privately-held company that had a carrying value of $51 million and $134 million at December 28, 2018 and March 30, 2018, respectively.
16

We recorded a loss from equity interests of $24 million and $84 million during the three and nine months ended December 28, 2018, respectively, in Other income (expense), net in our Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations.
This loss for the nine months ended December 28, 2018 was reflected as a reduction in the carrying amount of our investment in equity interests in our Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets.
The following table summarizes unaudited financial data from the privately-held company which was provided to us on a three-month lag:



[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]



Current and long-term debt



As of December 28, 2018 and March 30, 2018, the total fair value of our current and long-term fixed rate debt was $3.8 billion and 3.9 billion, respectively.
The fair value of our variable rate debt approximated its carrying value.
Note 8.
Debt 



The following table summarizes components of our debt:



[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]



(1)The senior term facilities bear interest at a rate equal to the London Interbank Offered Rate (“LIBOR”) plus a margin based on the current debt rating of our non-credit-enhanced, senior unsecured long-term debt and the underlying loan agreements.
The interest rates for the outstanding senior term loans are as follows:



[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]



As of December 28, 2018, the future contractual maturities of debt by fiscal year are as follows:



[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]



17

Based on the closing price of our common stock of $18.56 on December 28, 2018, the if-converted value of our 2.5% Convertible Senior Notes exceeded the principal amount by approximately $53 million and the if-converted value of our 2.0% Convertible Senior Notes was below the principal amount.
The following table sets forth total interest expense recognized related to our 2.5% and 2.0% Convertible Senior Notes:



[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]



Revolving credit facility



We have an unsecured revolving credit facility to borrow up to $1.0 billion through May 10, 2021.
For our current credit rating, borrowings under the revolving credit facility are subject to the same interest rate as our Senior Term Loan A-2.
We are obligated to pay commitment fees on the unused commitment at a rate based on our debt ratings.
As of December 28, 2018 and March 30, 2018, there were no borrowings outstanding under this revolving credit facility.
Covenant compliance



The Senior Term Loan agreements A-2, A-5 and our revolving credit facility contain customary representations and warranties, affirmative and negative covenants, including compliance with specified financial ratios, non-financial covenants for financial reporting, and restrictions on subsidiary indebtedness, liens, stock repurchases and dividends (with exceptions permitting our regular quarterly dividend).
Our Convertible Senior Notes agreements and the agreement for our 5.0% Senior Note due April 15, 2025 also require us to file periodic reports with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) by specified deadlines.
As of December 28, 2018, we were in compliance with all debt covenants.
Note 9.
As part of our foreign currency risk mitigation strategy, we have entered into foreign exchange forward contracts for up to six months in duration.
We do not use derivative financial instruments for speculative trading purposes, nor do we hedge our foreign currency exposure in a manner that entirely offsets the effects of the changes in foreign exchange rates.
The notional amount of our outstanding foreign exchange forward contracts in U.S. dollar equivalent was as follows:



[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]



The fair value of our foreign exchange forward contracts is presented on a gross basis in our Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets.
As of December 28, 2018 and March 30, 2018, the fair value was insignificant.
To mitigate losses in the event of nonperformance by counterparties, we have entered into master netting arrangements with our counterparties that allow us to settle payments on a net basis.
The effect of netting on our derivative assets and liabilities was not material as of December 28, 2018 and March 30, 2018.
Our foreign exchange forward contracts are not designated as hedging instruments.
The related gain (loss) recognized in Other income (expense), net in our Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations was as follows:

Note 10.
Restructuring, Transition and Other Costs



Our restructuring, transition and other costs consist primarily of severance, facilities, transition and other related costs.
Severance costs generally include severance payments, outplacement services, health insurance coverage and legal costs.
Fiscal 2019 Plan



In August 2018, we announced a restructuring plan (the “Fiscal 2019 Plan”) under which we will initiate targeted reductions of up to approximately 8% of our global workforce.
We estimate that we will incur total costs in connection with the Fiscal 2019 Plan of approximately $50 million, primarily for severance and termination benefits.
These actions are expected to be completed in fiscal 2020.
As of December 28, 2018, we have incurred costs of $9 million related to our Fiscal 2019 Plan.
Fiscal 2017 Plan



We initiated a restructuring plan in the first quarter of fiscal 2017 to reduce complexity by means of long-term structural improvements (the “Fiscal 2017 Plan”), under which we reduced headcount and closed certain facilities.
These actions were substantially completed at the end of our first quarter of fiscal 2019.
As of December 28, 2018, liabilities for excess facility obligations at several locations around the world are expected to be paid throughout the respective lease terms, the longest of which extends through fiscal 2025.
As of December 28, 2018, we have incurred costs of $289 million related to our Fiscal 2017 Plan.
Note 11.
Income Taxes



The following table summarizes our effective tax rate for income from continuing operations for the periods presented:



[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]



19

We recorded an income tax benefit on discontinued operations of $3 million and $30 million for the three months ended December 28, 2018 and December 29, 2017, respectively.
We recorded income tax expense on discontinued operations of $1 million, and $7 million for the nine months ended December 28, 2018 and December 29, 2017, respectively.
As of December 28, 2018, we have completed our accounting for the effects of the enactment of the Act in accordance with SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin No.
118 and the amounts are no longer considered provisional.
The adoption of this policy does not result in change to our fiscal year 2019 tax provision.

PRUs



In October 2018, we released 12 million PRUs that vested on March 30, 2018.
Liability-classified awards settled in shares



For certain employees, we settled fiscal 2018 bonuses in approximately 1 million RSUs.
These awards were granted and vested in the first quarter of fiscal 2019.
Certain fiscal 2019 bonuses are expected to be settled in RSUs in the first quarter of 



21

fiscal 2020.
As of December 28, 2018 and March 30, 2018, the total liability associated with liability-classified awards was $21 million and $25 million, respectively, which is presented in Accrued compensation and benefits in our Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets.
All participant contributions were refunded.
In addition, the enrollment in the purchase period beginning August 16, 2018 was cancelled.
As of December 28, 2018, the total unrecognized stock-based compensation costs, net of estimated forfeitures, were as follows:



[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]



Note 14.
Net Income Per Share



Basic income per share is computed by dividing net income by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during the period.
Diluted net income per share also includes the incremental effect of dilutive potentially issuable common shares outstanding during the period using the treasury stock method.
Dilutive potentially issuable common shares includes the dilutive effect of the shares underlying convertible debt and employee equity awards.
22

The components of basic and diluted net income (loss) per share are as follows:



[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]



(1) Net income per share amounts may not add due to rounding.
Under the treasury stock method, our Convertible Senior Notes will generally have a dilutive impact on net income per share when our average stock price for the period exceeds approximately $16.77 per share for the 2.5% Convertible Senior Notes and $20.41 per share for the 2.0% Convertible Senior Notes.
The conversion feature of both notes was anti-dilutive during the nine months ended December 28, 2018 as there was a loss from continuing operations in the period.
Note 15.

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]



Purchase obligations



As of December 28, 2018, we had purchase obligations of $1,090 million associated with agreements for purchases of goods or services.
Management believes that cancellation of these contracts is unlikely, and we expect to make future cash payments according to the contract terms.
In addition, our bylaws contain indemnification obligations to our directors, officers, employees and agents, and we have entered into indemnification agreements with our directors and certain of our officers to give such directors and officers additional contractual assurances regarding the scope of the indemnification set forth in our bylaws and to provide additional procedural protections.
We maintain director and officer insurance, which may cover certain liabilities arising from our obligation to indemnify our directors and officers.
Such indemnification agreements might not be subject to maximum loss clauses.

Litigation contingencies 



Audit Committee Investigation



Several securities class action and derivative lawsuits were filed against us following our announcement on May 10, 2018 of the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors’ (the “Audit Committee”) internal investigation (the “Audit Committee Investigation”), including an action brought derivatively on behalf of Symantec’s 2008 Employee Stock Purchase Plan.
In addition, we have received certain demands from purported stockholders to inspect corporate books and records under Delaware law.
We will continue to incur legal fees in connection with these pending cases, including expenses for the reimbursement of legal fees of present and former officers and directors under indemnification obligations.
GSA



During the first quarter of fiscal 2013, we were advised by the Commercial Litigation Branch of the Department of Justice’s (“DOJ”) Civil Division and the Civil Division of the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the District of Columbia that the government is investigating our compliance with certain provisions of our U.S. General Services Administration (“GSA”) Multiple Award Schedule Contract No.
GS-35F-0240T effective January 24, 2007, including provisions relating to pricing, country of origin, accessibility, and the disclosure of commercial sales practices.
As reported on the GSA’s publicly-available database, our total sales under the GSA Schedule contract were approximately $222 million from the period beginning January 2007 and ending September 2012.
We have fully cooperated with the government throughout its investigation and in January 2014, representatives of the government indicated that their initial analysis of our actual damages exposure from direct government sales under the GSA schedule was approximately $145 million; since the initial meeting, the government’s analysis of our potential damages exposure relating to direct sales has increased.
The government has also indicated they are going to pursue claims for certain sales to California, Florida, and New York as well as sales to the federal government through reseller GSA Schedule contracts, which could significantly increase our potential damages exposure.
In 2012, a sealed civil lawsuit was filed against Symantec related to compliance with the GSA Schedule contract and contracts with California, Florida, and New York.
On July 18, 2014, the Court-imposed seal expired, and the government intervened in the lawsuit.
On September 16, 2014, the states of California and Florida intervened in the lawsuit, and the state of New York notified the Court that it would not intervene.
On October 3, 2014, the DOJ filed an amended complaint, which did not state a specific damages amount.
On October 17, 2014, California and Florida combined their claims with those of the DOJ and the relator on behalf of New York in an Omnibus Complaint, and a First Amended Omnibus Complaint was filed on October 8, 2015; the state claims also do not state specific damages amounts.
This amount contemplates estimated losses from both the investigation of compliance with the terms of the GSA Schedule contract as well as possible violations of the False Claims Act.
Other



We are involved in a number of other judicial and administrative proceedings that are incidental to our business.
Although adverse decisions (or settlements) may occur in one or more of the cases, it is not possible to estimate the possible loss or losses from each of these cases.
