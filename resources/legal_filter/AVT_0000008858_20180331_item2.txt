There are references to the impact of foreign currency translation in the discussion of the Company’s results of operations.
In the discussion that follows, results excluding this impact, primarily for subsidiaries in Europe, the Middle East and Africa (“EMEA”) and Asia/Pacific, are referred to as “constant currency.”  



 In addition to disclosing financial results that are determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the U.S. (“GAAP”), the Company also discloses certain non-GAAP financial information, including:  



   ·    Sales adjusted for certain items that impact the year-over-year analysis, which includes the impact of certain acquisitions by adjusting Avnet’s prior periods to include the sales of acquired businesses, as if the acquisitions had occurred at the beginning of the earliest period presented.
Management also uses these non-GAAP measures to establish operational goals and, in many cases, for measuring performance for compensation purposes.
However, any analysis of results on a non-GAAP basis should be used as a complement to, and in conjunction with, results presented in accordance with GAAP.

 OVERVIEW  



 Organization  



 Avnet, Inc., founded in 1921 and incorporated in New York in 1955, together with its consolidated subsidiaries (the “Company” or “Avnet”), is a global value-added distributor of electronic components that supports customers at each stage of a product’s lifecycle.
Avnet creates a vital link in the technology supply chain that connects the world’s leading electronic component manufacturers with a global customer base primarily comprised of original equipment manufacturers, electronic manufacturing services providers and original design manufacturers.
Avnet’s two operating groups – Electronic Components (“EC”) and Premier Farnell (“PF”) – have operations in each of the three major economic regions of the world: the Americas; EMEA; and Asia/Pacific, consisting of Asia, Australia and New Zealand (“Asia”).
A summary of each operating group is provided in Note 13, “Segment information” to the Company’s consolidated financial statements included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.
Results of Operations  



 Executive Summary  



 Sales for the third quarter of fiscal 2018 were $4.80 billion, an increase of 8.0% from sales for the third quarter of fiscal 2017 of $4.44 billion.
The increase in sales was due to the increased sales in PF and the EMEA and Asia regions of EC, offset by sales declines in the EC Americas region.
Sales in constant currency increased year over year by 2.4% with both EC and PF contributing to the increase.
Gross profit margin for the third quarter of fiscal 2018 decreased 55 basis points compared to the third quarter of fiscal 2017.
Avnet operating loss margin was (1.1)% in the third quarter of fiscal 2018 as compared with 2.6% of operating income margin in the third quarter of fiscal 2017.
Both periods included amortization and restructuring, integration and other expenses.
The third quarter of fiscal 2018 also includes goodwill impairment expense.
Excluding these expenses from both periods, adjusted operating income margin was 3.7% in the third quarter of fiscal 2018 as compared to 3.9% in the third quarter of fiscal 2017.

 The following table presents the reconciliation of reported sales to organic sales for the first nine months of fiscal 2017.
[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 



   (1)    Includes PF acquired on October 17, 2016, which has operations in each Avnet region.
Sales for the third quarter of fiscal 2018 were $4.80 billion, an increase of 8.0%, or $353.2 million, from the prior year third quarter sales of $4.44 billion.
Excluding the translation impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates, sales increased 2.4% over the prior year third quarter with both operating groups contributing to this increase.
EC sales of $4.40 billion in the third quarter of fiscal 2018 increased $313.2 million or 7.7% from the prior year third quarter sales of $4.09 billion.
This increase was primarily driven by increased sales in Asia due to organic growth and in EMEA primarily due to the benefit from the weakening of the U.S. Dollar, partially offset by declines in the Americas region due to supplier channel and program changes.
PF sales for the third quarter of fiscal 2018 were $391.0 million, an increase of $40.0 million or 11.4% from the prior year third quarter sales of $351.0 million driven by growth in all three regions including the benefit from the weakening U.S. Dollar.

 Table of Contents  



 Sales for the first nine months of fiscal 2018 were $13.98 billion, an increase of 8.9%, or $1.14 billion, as compared to sales of $12.83 billion for the first nine months of fiscal 2017.
This increase was primarily due to the acquisition of PF, which was acquired in the second quarter of fiscal 2017, and an overall increase in sales in EC as double-digit growth in the EMEA and Asia regions of EC offset a year to date decrease of 8.9% in the EC Americas region.
Organic sales for the first nine months of 2018 increased $765.8 million, or 5.8%, compared to the first nine months of fiscal 2017 primarily due to double-digit sales growth in EMEA and Asia regions, offset by a decline of 7.9% in the Americas region.
Gross Profit and Gross Profit Margins  



 Gross profit for the third quarter of fiscal 2018 was $653.5 million, an increase of $23.6 million, or 3.7%, from the third quarter of fiscal 2017 gross profit of $630.0 million primarily driven by the increase in sales.
Gross profit margin decreased 55 basis points to 13.6% from the third quarter of fiscal 2017, with both operating groups contributing to the decrease.
Asia sales represented approximately 38% of the total EC sales in the third quarter of fiscal 2018 as compared with approximately 36% in the third quarter of fiscal 2017.
Gross profit and gross profit margins were $1.87 billion and 13.4%, respectively, for the first nine months of fiscal 2018 as compared with $1.74 billion and 13.5%, respectively, for the first nine months of fiscal 2017.
Selling, General and Administrative Expenses  



 Selling, general and administrative expenses (“SG&A expenses”) were $501.4 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2018, an increase of $21.2 million, or 4.4%, from the third quarter of fiscal 2017.
The year-over-year increase in SG&A expenses was due to the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates, partially offset by decreases from restructuring actions taken in the trailing twelve months ended March 31, 2018.
In the third quarter of fiscal 2018, SG&A expenses as a percentage of sales were 10.5% and as a percentage of gross profit were 76.7%, as compared with 10.8% and 76.2%, respectively, in the third quarter of fiscal 2017.
SG&A expenses for the first nine months of fiscal 2018 were $1.48 billion, or 10.6% of sales, as compared with $1.28 billion, or 9.9% of sales, in the first nine months of fiscal 2017.
SG&A expenses were 79.0% of gross profit in the first nine months of 2018 as compared with 73.3% in the first nine months of fiscal 2017.
Impairment Expenses  



 As of December 30, 2017, the $181.4 million in goodwill related to the Electronic Components Americas core reporting unit (the “Americas”) primarily represented goodwill allocated from the acquisitions of Bell Micro, G2 and Round 2, all of which occurred prior to fiscal 2011.
The allocation of goodwill to the Americas represented the expected synergies the Americas would realize from these historical acquisitions.
Once goodwill has been assigned to a reporting unit, for accounting purposes, the goodwill is no longer directly associated with the underlying acquisitions that the goodwill originated from, but rather the reporting unit to which it has been allocated.
24  



 Table of Contents  



 As a result of the interim impairment testing and related fair value estimate of the Americas as of the third quarter of fiscal 2018, the Company impaired all of the goodwill in the Americas and recorded $181.4 million of goodwill impairment expense in the third quarter of fiscal 2018.
See Note 4 “Goodwill and long-lived assets” to the Company’s consolidated financial statements included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.
In addition, the Company incurred integration, accelerated depreciation, acquisition/divestiture and other costs.
Integration costs are primarily related to the integration of acquired businesses including PF, the integration of certain regional and global businesses including Avnet after the TS divestiture, and incremental costs incurred as part of the consolidation, relocation, and closure of warehouse and office facilities.
Accelerated depreciation relates to the incremental depreciation expense incurred related to the shortening of the estimated useful life of the Company’s enterprise resource planning (“ERP”) system in the Americas compared to depreciation expense based on the original useful life of such ERP system as such ERP system is in the process of being replaced.
The Company recorded restructuring, integration and other expenses of $25.1 million during the third quarter of fiscal 2018.
The Company recorded $5.9 million of restructuring costs in the third quarter of fiscal 2018 in order to realize approximately $7.2 million in expected annualized operating cost savings once such restructuring actions initiated before the end of the third quarter of fiscal 2018 are completed.

Refer to Note 9, “Pension Plan,” for further information on the pension settlement losses.
Income from discontinued operations was $181.9 million and $253.8 million in the third quarter and the first nine months of fiscal 2017, respectively, due to the operating results of the TS business, which was sold in the third quarter of fiscal 2017.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES  



 Cash Flow  



 Cash Flow from Operating Activities  



 During the first nine months of fiscal 2018, the Company generated $17.9 million of cash from its operating activities compared to $184.6 million of cash used in the first nine months of fiscal 2017.

Cash used for working capital and other was $121.5 million during the first nine months of fiscal 2018, including increases in inventories of $337.9 million and accounts receivable of $98.1 million.
The Company utilized cash to invest in inventory levels primarily as a result of a strong book to bill and lengthening product lead times.

 Liquidity  



 The Company held cash and cash equivalents of $430.1 million as of March 31, 2018, of which $396.3 million was held outside the United States.
As of July 1, 2017, the Company held cash and cash equivalents of $836.4 million, of which $619.5 million was held outside of the United States.
As of the end of the third quarter of fiscal 2018, the Company had a combined total borrowing capacity of $1.65 billion under the Credit Facility and the Program.
There were no borrowings outstanding and $2.0 million in letters of credit issued under the Credit Facility and $95.0 million in borrowings outstanding under the Program, resulting in approximately $1.55 billion of total availability as of March 31, 2018.
Availability under the Program is subject to the Company having sufficient eligible trade accounts receivable to support desired borrowings.
During the third quarter and first nine months of fiscal 2018, the Company had an average daily balance outstanding of approximately $0.6 million and $3.0 million, respectively, under the Credit Facility and approximately $298.0 million and $230.0 million, respectively, under the Program.

During periods of weakening demand in the electronic components industry, the Company typically generates cash from operating activities.
Conversely, the Company is more likely to use operating cash flows for working capital requirements during periods of higher growth.
The Company used $98.5 million in cash flows from operating activities over the trailing four fiscal quarters ended March 31, 2018 for continuing operations.
To the extent the cash balances held in foreign locations cannot be remitted back to the U.S. in a tax efficient manner, those cash balances are generally used for ongoing working capital, capital expenditure needs and to support acquisitions, and are currently expected to be permanently reinvested outside the United States.
The Company is still evaluating the impact of repatriating any additional foreign cash as a result of the Act.
In addition, local government regulations may restrict the Company’s ability to move funds among various locations under certain circumstances.
Management does not believe such restrictions would limit the Company’s ability to pursue its intended business strategy.
Management believes that Avnet’s available borrowing capacity, its current cash on hand including the remaining proceeds and marketable securities from the sale of the TS business and the Company’s expected ability to generate operating cash flows in the future will be sufficient to meet its future liquidity needs.
Additionally, as the Company integrates PF and restructures to transform Avnet into an electronic components focused business, the Company expects to use cash for restructuring, integration and other expenses.
