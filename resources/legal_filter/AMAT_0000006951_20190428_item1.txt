See accompanying Notes to Consolidated Condensed Financial Statements.
These unaudited interim consolidated condensed financial statements should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in Applied’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended October 28, 2018 (2018 Form 10-K).
Applied’s fiscal year ends on the last Sunday in October of each year.
Fiscal 2019 and 2018 each contain 52 weeks, and the first half of fiscal 2019 and 2018 each contained 26 weeks.
At the beginning of the first quarter of fiscal 2019, Applied adopted the new revenue recognition standard using the full retrospective method.
All financial statements and disclosures have been recast to comply with this new guidance.
See "Recent Accounting Pronouncements - Accounting Standards Adopted" section below for further information.
Changes to Significant Accounting Policies 



Applied adopted various amended guidance during the first quarter of fiscal 2019.
The following accounting policies have been updated as part of the adoption of the new standards.
Allowance for Doubtful Accounts 



Applied maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers to make required payments.
This allowance is based on historical experience, credit evaluations, specific customer collection history and any customer-specific issues Applied has identified.
Shipping and Handling Costs



Applied accounts for shipping and handling activities related to contracts with customers as costs to fulfill our promise to transfer the associated products.
Warranty 



Applied provides for the estimated cost of warranty when revenue is recognized.
If actual warranty costs differ substantially from Applied’s estimates, revisions to the estimated warranty liability would be required.
9



APPLIED MATERIALS, INC.



NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED CONDENSED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (Continued)



Applied also sells extended warranty contracts to its customers which provide an extension of the standard warranty coverage period of up to 2 years.
Applied receives payment at the inception of the contract and recognizes revenue ratably over the extended warranty coverage period, as the customer simultaneously receives and consumes the benefits of the extended warranty.
Revenue Recognition from Contracts with Customers



Applied recognizes revenue when promised goods or services are transferred to a customer in an amount that reflects the consideration to which Applied expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services.
Applied determines revenue recognition through the following five steps; (1) identification of the contract(s) with customers, (2) identification of the performance obligations in the contract, (3) determination of the transaction price, (4) allocation of the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract, and (5) recognition of revenue when, or as, a performance obligation is satisfied.
Identifying the contract(s) with customers.
Applied sells manufacturing equipment, services, and spare parts directly to its customers in the semiconductor, display, and related industries.
Identifying the performance obligations.
Applied’s performance obligations include delivery of manufacturing equipment, service agreements, spare parts, installation, extended warranty and training.
Applied’s service agreements are considered one performance obligation and may include multiple goods and services that we provide to the customer to deliver against a performance metric.
Determine the transaction price.
The transaction price for Applied’s contracts with customers may include fixed and variable consideration.
Allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations.
A contract’s transaction price is allocated to each distinct performance obligation identified within the contract.
For contracts with multiple performance obligations, Applied allocates the contract’s transaction price to each performance obligation using the relative standalone selling price of each distinct good or service in the contract.
Recognizing the revenue as performance obligations are satisfied.
Revenue from service agreements is recognized over time as customers receive the benefits of services.
The incremental costs to obtain a contract are not material.
Payment Terms.
Payment terms vary by contract.
The remainder is typically due upon customer technical acceptance.
Applied’s payment terms do not generally contain a significant financing component.
Investments



All of Applied’s investments, except equity investments held in privately-held companies, are classified as available-for-sale at the respective balance sheet dates.
Investments classified as available-for-sale are measured and recorded at fair value with changes in fair value recorded in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Operations.
Equity investments without readily determinable fair value are measured at cost, less impairment, adjusted by observable price changes.
Adjustments resulting from impairments and observable prices changes will be recorded in the accompanying Consolidated Condensed Statements of Operations.

Recent Accounting Pronouncements



Accounting Standards Adopted



Retirement Benefits.
In March 2017, the FASB issued authoritative guidance which requires companies to present the service cost component of net benefit cost in the same line items in which they report compensation cost.
Applied adopted this guidance in the first quarter of fiscal 2019 on a retrospective basis.
Business Combinations.
In January 2017, the FASB issued authoritative guidance that clarifies the definition of a business to help companies evaluate whether acquisition or disposal transactions should be accounted for as asset groups or as businesses.
Applied adopted this guidance in the first quarter of fiscal 2019 on a prospective basis.
In October 2016, the FASB issued authoritative guidance that changed the tax accounting for intra-entity transfers of assets other than inventory.
After adoption, the income tax effect of intra-entity transfers is realized at the time of the transfer instead of over the life of the asset.
Applied adopted this guidance in the first quarter of fiscal 2019 using a modified retrospective approach, resulting in a cumulative effect adjustment to retained earnings.
Upon adoption, deferred tax assets increased by $1.6 billion related to the estimated income tax effects of future amortization of intra-entity intangible asset transfers, with an offset to retained earnings.
Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments.
In August 2016, the FASB issued authoritative guidance which addresses classification of certain cash receipts and cash payments related to the statement of cash flows.
Effective in the first quarter of fiscal 2019, Applied adopted the authoritative guidance retrospectively.
Financial Instruments: Classification and Measurement.
In January 2016, the FASB issued authoritative guidance that requires equity investments that do not result in consolidation, and are not accounted for under the equity method, to be measured at fair value, and requires recognition of any changes in fair value in net income unless the investments qualify for a new measurement alternative.
Applied adopted this standard in the first quarter of fiscal year 2019.
Upon adoption, Applied elected to apply the measurement alternative for equity investments without readily determinable fair value.
Under the alternative, Applied measures investments without readily determinable fair value at cost, less impairment, adjusted by observable price changes prospectively to all equity investments that exist as of adoption and will reassess at each reporting period whether an investment qualifies for the alternative.
Adopting this standard required Applied to record a cumulative net increase to retained earnings of approximately $21 million with the corresponding $17 million decrease in accumulated other comprehensive income, net of tax, for the unrealized gains and losses associated with equity investments with readily determinable fair values, as the authoritative guidance is required to be adopted prospectively.
Revenue Recognition.
Applied adopted this authoritative guidance in the first quarter of fiscal 2019 using the full retrospective method, which required restating each prior reporting period presented.
For all periods prior to the date of initial adoption of this standard, Applied elected to use the practical expedient pursuant to which Applied excluded disclosures of both transaction prices allocated to remaining performance obligations and when these performance obligations are expected to be recognized as revenue.
The most significant impact from the adoption of this standard is fewer constraints on revenue recognition upon shipment of manufacturing equipment.
Adoption of the standard related to revenue recognition impacted Applied’s Consolidated Balance Sheet at October 28, 2018 as follows:



[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]



12



APPLIED MATERIALS, INC.



NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED CONDENSED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (Continued)



Adoption of the revenue recognition standard did not impact cash provided by or used in investing or financing activities in Applied’s Consolidated Condensed Statement of Cash Flows for the first half of fiscal 2018.
In August 2018, the FASB issued authoritative guidance that adds, removes, and clarifies disclosure requirements for defined benefit and other postretirement plans.
This authoritative guidance will be effective for Applied in fiscal 2021 on a retrospective basis, with early adoption permitted.
Applied is currently evaluating the effect of this new guidance on Applied’s consolidated financial statements.
Fair Value Measurement: Changes to the Disclosure Requirements for Fair Value Measurement.
In August 2018, the FASB issued authoritative guidance that eliminates, amends, and adds disclosure requirements for fair value measurements.
While the amended and new disclosure requirements primarily relate to Level 3 fair value measurements, the authoritative guidance also eliminates disclosure requirements related to the amount and reasons for transfer between Level 1 and Level 2 of fair value hierarchy, policy for timing of transfer between levels, and the valuation processes for Level 3 fair value measurements.
The authoritative guidance will be effective for Applied in the first quarter of fiscal 2020.
Early adoption is permitted only for the removal and amendment of certain disclosures, while the new disclosures requirements are to be applied prospectively.
Applied is currently evaluating the effect of this new guidance on Applied’s consolidated financial statements.
Derivatives and Hedging.
The authoritative guidance expands the application of hedge accounting for non-financial and financial risk components and eases certain hedge effectiveness assessment requirements.
The authoritative guidance will be effective for Applied in the first quarter of fiscal 2020, with early adoption permitted.
Applied is currently evaluating the effect of this new guidance on Applied’s consolidated financial statements.
Receivables: Nonrefundable Fees and Other Costs.
In March 2017, the FASB issued authoritative guidance that will shorten the amortization period for certain callable debt securities held at a premium to the earliest call date to more closely align with expectations incorporated in market pricing.
This authoritative guidance will be effective for Applied in the first quarter of fiscal 2020 on a modified retrospective basis, with early adoption permitted.
Applied is currently evaluating the impact of adopting this new accounting guidance on Applied’s consolidated financial statements.
Goodwill Impairment.
In January 2017, the FASB issued authoritative guidance that simplifies the process required to test goodwill for impairment.
The authoritative guidance will be effective for Applied in the first quarter of fiscal 2021.
Early adoption is permitted.
13



APPLIED MATERIALS, INC.



NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED CONDENSED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (Continued)



Financial Instruments: Credit Losses.
In June 2016, the FASB issued authoritative guidance that modifies the impairment model for certain financial assets by requiring use of an expected loss methodology, which will result in more timely recognition of credit losses.
The authoritative guidance will be effective for Applied in the first quarter of fiscal 2021.
Early adoption is permitted beginning in the first quarter of fiscal 2020.
Applied is currently evaluating the effect of this new guidance on Applied’s consolidated financial statements.
Leases.
In February 2016, the FASB issued authoritative guidance for lease accounting, which requires lessees to recognize lease assets and liabilities on the balance sheet for certain lease arrangements that are classified as operating leases under the previous standard, and to provide for enhanced disclosures.
The authoritative guidance will be effective for Applied in the first quarter of fiscal 2020 and should be applied using a modified retrospective approach.
Early adoption is permitted.
Applied is currently evaluating the effect of this new guidance on Applied’s consolidated financial statements.

Note 2Earnings Per Share



Basic earnings per share is determined using the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period.
Diluted earnings per share is determined using the weighted average number of common shares and potential common shares (representing the dilutive effect of stock options, restricted stock units, and employee stock purchase plan shares) outstanding during the period.
Applied’s net income has not been adjusted for any period presented for purposes of computing basic or diluted earnings per share due to the Company’s non-complex capital structure.

Gains and Losses on Investments



During the three and six months ended April 28, 2019 and April 29, 2018, gross realized gains and losses on investments for these periods were not material.
As of April 28, 2019, and October 28, 2018, gross unrealized losses related to Applied’s debt investment portfolio were not material.
Applied regularly reviews its debt investment portfolio to identify and evaluate investments that have indications of possible impairment.
17



APPLIED MATERIALS, INC.



NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED CONDENSED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (Continued)



Applied determined that the gross unrealized losses on its marketable fixed-income securities as of April 28, 2019 and April 29, 2018 were temporary in nature and therefore it did not recognize any impairment of its marketable fixed-income securities during the three and six months ended April 28, 2019 or April 29, 2018.
Impairment charges on equity investments in privately-held companies during the three and six months ended April 28, 2019 and April 29, 2018 were not material.
Unrealized gains and losses on investments classified as equity investments are recognized in other income (expense), net in the Consolidated Condensed Statement of Operations.
Prior to the adoption of Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2016-01 Financial Instruments-Overall (Subtopic 825-10): Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities in the first quarter of fiscal 2019, these unrealized gains and temporary losses were included within accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), net of any related tax effect.
The components of gain (losses) on equity investments for the three and six months ended April 28, 2019 were as follows:

Note 4 Fair Value Measurements



Applied’s financial assets are measured and recorded at fair value on a recurring basis, except for equity investments in privately-held companies.
These equity investments are generally accounted for under the measurement alternative, defined as cost, less impairments, adjusted for subsequent observable price changes and are periodically assessed for impairment when events or circumstances indicate that a decline in value may have occurred.
Applied’s nonfinancial assets, such as goodwill, intangible assets, and property, plant and equipment, are recorded at cost and are assessed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable.
Fair Value Hierarchy



Applied uses the following fair value hierarchy, which prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value into three levels and bases the categorization within the hierarchy upon the lowest level of input that is available and significant to the fair value measurement:



•Level 1 — Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities;



•Level 2 — Inputs other than Level 1 that are observable, either directly or indirectly, such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities, quoted prices in markets that are not active, or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities; and



•Level 3 — Unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the fair value of the assets or liabilities.
Applied’s investments consist primarily of debt securities that are classified as available-for-sale and recorded at their fair values.
In the event a fair value estimate is unavailable from a pricing service, Applied generally obtains non-binding price quotes from brokers.
Applied then reviews the information provided by the pricing services or brokers to determine the fair value of its short-term and long-term investments.
In addition, to validate pricing information obtained from pricing services, Applied periodically performs supplemental analysis on a sample of securities.
Applied reviews any significant unanticipated differences identified through this analysis to determine the appropriate fair value.
As of April 28, 2019, substantially all of Applied’s available-for-sale, short-term and long-term investments were recognized at fair value that was determined based upon observable inputs.
Applied’s equity investments with readily determinable values consist of publicly traded equity securities.
Upon adoption of ASU 2016-01, these investments are measured at fair value using quoted prices for identical assets in an active market and the changes in fair value of these equity investments are recognized in the consolidated statements of operations.
Applied adopted the standard using a modified retrospective transition method and reclassified the unrealized gains on these equity investments of $21 million to retained earnings as a cumulative-effect adjustment on the condensed consolidated balance sheets.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED CONDENSED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (Continued)



Assets Measured at Fair Value on a Recurring Basis



Financial assets (excluding cash balances) measured at fair value on a recurring basis are summarized below:



[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]



There were no transfers between Level 1 and Level 2 fair value measurements during the three and six months ended April 28, 2019 or April 29, 2018.
Applied did not have any financial assets measured at fair value on a recurring basis within Level 3 fair value measurements as of April 28, 2019 or October 28, 2018.
Assets and Liabilities without Readily Determinable Values Measured on a Non-recurring Basis



Applied’s equity investments without readily determinable values consist of equity investments in privately-held companies.
Upon adoption of ASU 2016-01, Applied elected the measurement alternative, defined as cost, less impairments, adjusted for subsequent observable price changes on a prospective basis for certain equity investments without readily determinable fair values and is required to account for any subsequent observable changes in fair value within the statements of operations.
Applied adopted the guidance prospectively, effective October 29, 2018, and there was no impact to Applied’s condensed consolidated financial statements.
Prior to the adoption of ASU 2016-01, these investments were generally accounted for under the cost method of accounting.
Impairment charges on equity investments in privately-held companies during the three and six months ended April 28, 2019 and April 29, 2018 were not material.
Other



The carrying amounts of Applied’s financial instruments, including cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, notes payable - short term, and accounts payable and accrued expenses, approximate fair value due to their short maturities.
As of April 28, 2019, the aggregate principal amount of long-term debt was $5.4 billion, and the estimated fair value was $5.7 billion.
As of October 28, 2018, the aggregate principal and estimated fair value amounts of long-term debt were both $5.4 billion.
The estimated fair value of long-term debt is determined by Level 2 inputs and is based primarily on quoted market prices for the same or similar issues.
See Note 10 of the Notes to the Consolidated Condensed Financial Statements for further detail of existing debt.

Note 5Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities



Derivative Financial Instruments



Applied conducts business in a number of foreign countries, with certain transactions denominated in local currencies, such as the Japanese yen, euro, Israeli shekel and Taiwanese dollar.
Applied uses derivative financial instruments, such as forward exchange contracts and currency option contracts, to hedge certain forecasted foreign currency denominated transactions expected to occur typically within the next 24 months.
The terms of currency instruments used for hedging purposes are generally consistent with the timing of the transactions being hedged.
Applied does not use derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes.
Derivative instruments and hedging activities, including foreign currency exchange and interest rate contracts, are recognized on the balance sheet at fair value.
Hedges related to anticipated transactions are designated and documented at the inception of the hedge as cash flow hedges and foreign exchange derivatives are typically entered into once per month.
Cash flow hedges are evaluated for effectiveness quarterly.
The majority of the after-tax net income or loss related to foreign exchange derivative instruments included in AOCI as of April 28, 2019 is expected to be reclassified into earnings within 12 months.
Both ineffective hedge amounts and hedge components excluded from the assessment of effectiveness are recognized in earnings.
The amount recognized due to discontinuance of cash flow hedges that were probable not to occur by the end of the originally specified time period was not significant for the three and six months ended April 28, 2019 and April 29, 2018.
Additionally, forward exchange contracts are generally used to hedge certain foreign currency denominated assets or liabilities.
These derivatives are typically entered into once per month and are not designated for hedge accounting treatment.
Accordingly, changes in the fair value of these hedges are recorded in earnings to offset the changes in the fair value of the assets or liabilities being hedged.
The fair values of foreign exchange derivative instruments as of April 28, 2019 and October 28, 2018 were not material.

Credit Risk Contingent Features



If Applied’s credit rating were to fall below investment grade, it would be in violation of credit risk contingent provisions of the derivative instruments discussed above, and certain counterparties to the derivative instruments could request immediate payment on derivative instruments in net liability positions.
The aggregate fair value of all derivative instruments with credit-risk related contingent features that were in a net liability position was immaterial as of April 28, 2019.
Entering into derivative contracts with banks exposes Applied to credit-related losses in the event of the banks’ nonperformance.
Note 6Accounts Receivable, Net 



Applied has agreements with various financial institutions to sell accounts receivable and discount promissory notes from selected customers.
Applied sells its accounts receivable without recourse.
Applied, from time to time, also discounts letters of credit issued by customers through various financial institutions.
The discounting of letters of credit depends on many factors, including the willingness of financial institutions to discount the letters of credit and the cost of such arrangements.
Applied sold $677 million and $1.1 billion of accounts receivable during the three and six months ended April 28, 2019, respectively.
Applied sold $390 million and $766 million of accounts receivable during the three and six months ended April 29, 2018, respectively.
Applied did not discount letters of credit issued by customers or discount promissory notes during the three and six months ended April 28, 2019 and April 29, 2018. Financing charges on the sale of receivables and discounting of letters of credit are included in interest expense in the accompanying Consolidated Condensed Statements of Operations and were not material for all periods presented.
Accounts receivable are presented net of allowance for doubtful accounts of $32 million and $33 million as of April 28, 2019 and October 28, 2018, respectively.
Applied sells its products principally to manufacturers within the semiconductor and display industries.
Note 7 Contract Balances



Contract assets primarily result from receivables for goods transferred to customers where payment is conditional upon technical sign off and not just the passage of time.
Applied’s contract assets and liabilities are reported in a net position on a contract-by-contract basis at the end of each reporting period.
Contract assets are generally classified as current and included in Other Current Assets in the Consolidated Condensed Balance Sheets.
Contract balances at the end of each reporting period were as follows:



[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]



The increase in contract assets during the six months ended April 28, 2019, was primarily due to goods transferred to customers where payment was conditional upon technical sign off, offset by the reclassification of contract assets to net accounts receivable upon meeting conditions to the right to payment.
During the six months ended April 28, 2019, Applied recognized revenue of approximately $539 million related to contract liabilities at October 28, 2018.
There were no impairment losses recognized on Applied’s accounts receivables and contract assets during the three and six months ended April 28, 2019.

Note 9Goodwill, Purchased Technology and Other Intangible Assets



Goodwill and Purchased Intangible Assets



Applied’s methodology for allocating the purchase price relating to purchase acquisitions is determined through established and generally accepted valuation techniques.
Goodwill is measured as the excess of the purchase price over the sum of the amounts assigned to tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired less liabilities assumed.
Applied assigns assets acquired (including goodwill) and liabilities assumed to one or more reporting units as of the date of acquisition.
Goodwill and purchased intangible assets with indefinite useful lives are not amortized, but are reviewed for impairment annually during the fourth quarter of each fiscal year and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable.
To test goodwill for impairment, Applied first performs a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value.
If it is concluded that this is the case, Applied then performs the two-step goodwill impairment test.
Otherwise, the two-step goodwill impairment test is not required.
Under the two-step goodwill impairment test, Applied would in the first step compare the estimated fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying value.
Applied determines the fair value of each of its reporting units based on a weighting of income and market approaches.
If the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, Applied would then perform the second step of the impairment test in order to determine the implied fair value of the reporting unit’s goodwill.
If Applied determines that the carrying value of a reporting unit’s goodwill exceeds its implied fair value, Applied would record an impairment charge equal to the difference.
As of April 28, 2019, Applied’s reporting units include Semiconductor Product Group and Imaging and Process Control Group, which combine to form the Semiconductor Systems reporting segment, Applied Global Services, and Display and Adjacent Markets.
The evaluation of goodwill and intangible assets for impairment requires the exercise of significant judgment.
Details of goodwill as of April 28, 2019 and October 28, 2018 were as follows:



[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]



During the six months ended April 28, 2019, the increase in goodwill was primarily due to acquisitions completed in the second quarter of fiscal 2019, which were not significant to Applied’s results of operations.
A summary of Applied’s purchased technology and intangible assets is set forth below:



[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

APPLIED MATERIALS, INC.



NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED CONDENSED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (Continued)



Finite-Lived Purchased Intangible Assets



Applied amortizes purchased intangible assets with finite lives using the straight-line method over the estimated economic lives of the assets, ranging from 1 to 15 years.
Applied evaluates long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of an asset group may not be recoverable.
Applied assesses the fair value of the assets based on the amount of the undiscounted future cash flow that the assets are expected to generate and recognizes an impairment loss when estimated undiscounted future cash flow expected to result from the use of the asset, plus net proceeds expected from disposition of the asset, if any, are less than the carrying value of the asset.
When Applied identifies an impairment, Applied reduces the carrying value of the group of assets to comparable market values, when available and appropriate, or to its estimated fair value based on a discounted cash flow approach.
Intangible assets, such as purchased technology, are generally recorded in connection with a business acquisition.
Applied evaluates the useful lives of its intangible assets each reporting period to determine whether events and circumstances require revising the remaining period of amortization.
Details of finite-lived intangible assets were as follows:

Note 10Borrowing Facilities and Debt



Applied has credit facilities for unsecured borrowings in various currencies of up to $1.6 billion, of which $1.5 billion is comprised of a committed revolving credit agreement with a group of banks that is scheduled to expire in September 2021.
This agreement provides for borrowings in United States dollars at interest rates keyed to one of various benchmark rates selected by Applied for each advance, plus a margin based on Applied’s public debt rating and includes financial and other covenants.
Remaining credit facilities in the amount of approximately $72 million are with Japanese banks.
Applied’s ability to borrow under these facilities is subject to bank approval at the time of the borrowing request, and any advances will be at rates indexed to the banks’ prime reference rate denominated in Japanese yen.
No amounts were outstanding under any of these facilities as of both April 28, 2019 and October 28, 2018, and Applied has not utilized these credit facilities.
In fiscal 2011, Applied established a short-term commercial paper program of up to $1.5 billion.
As of April 28, 2019, Applied did not have any commercial paper outstanding.
See Note 1.

Stock Repurchase Program



In February 2018, the Board of Directors approved a common stock repurchase program authorizing up to an aggregate of $6.0 billion in repurchases.
As of April 28, 2019, approximately $3.0 billion remained available for future stock repurchases under this repurchase program.
The following table summarizes Applied’s stock repurchases for the three and six months ended April 28, 2019 and April 29, 2018:

Applied records treasury stock purchases under the cost method using the first-in, first-out (FIFO) method.
Upon reissuance of treasury stock, amounts in excess of the acquisition cost are credited to additional paid in capital.
If Applied reissues treasury stock at an amount below its acquisition cost and additional paid in capital associated with prior treasury stock transactions is insufficient to cover the difference between the acquisition cost and the reissue price, this difference is recorded against retained earnings.
Dividends



In March 2019 and December 2018, Applied’s Board of Directors declared quarterly cash dividends, in the amount of $0.21 and $0.20 per share, respectively.
The dividend declared in March 2019 is payable in June 2019.
Dividends paid during the six months ended April 28, 2019 and April 29, 2018 totaled $381 million and $211 million, respectively.
Applied currently anticipates that cash dividends will continue to be paid on a quarterly basis, although the declaration of any future cash dividend is at the discretion of the Board of Directors and will depend on Applied’s financial condition, results of operations, capital requirements, business conditions and other factors, as well as a determination by the Board of Directors that cash dividends are in the best interests of Applied’s stockholders.
In addition, the plan provides for the automatic grant of restricted stock units to non-employee directors and permits the grant of share-based awards to non-employee directors and consultants.
Share-based awards made under the plan may be subject to accelerated vesting under certain circumstances in the event of a change in control of Applied.
During the three and six months ended April 28, 2019 and April 29, 2018, Applied recognized share-based compensation expense related equity awards and ESPP shares.
The effect of share-based compensation on the results of operations was as follows:

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED CONDENSED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (Continued)



The cost associated with share-based awards that are subject solely to time-based vesting requirements, less expected forfeitures, is recognized over the awards’ service period for the entire award on a straight-line basis.
The cost associated with performance-based equity awards, which include both performance and market goals, is recognized for each tranche over the service period.
The cost of equity awards related to performance goals is based on an assessment of the likelihood that the applicable performance goals will be achieved.
For the equity awards based on market goals, the cost is recognized based upon the assumption of 100% achievement of the goal.
As of April 28, 2019, Applied had $470 million in total unrecognized compensation expense, net of estimated forfeitures, related to grants of share-based awards and shares issued under Applied’s ESPP, which will be recognized over a weighted average period of 2.6 years.
As of April 28, 2019, there were 67 million shares available for grants of share-based awards under the Employee Stock Incentive Plan, and an additional 15 million shares available for issuance under the ESPP.
Each metric will be weighted 50% and will be measured over a three-year period.
The awards become eligible to vest only if performance goals are achieved and will vest only if the grantee remains employed by Applied through each applicable vesting date, subject to a qualifying retirement described below.
The number of shares that may vest in full after three years ranges from 0% to 200% of the target amount.
The awards provide for a partial payout based on actual performance at the conclusion of the three-year performance period in the event of a qualifying retirement based on age and years of service.
The fair value of the portion of the awards subject to targeted levels of adjusted operating margin is estimated on the date of grant.
If the performance goals are not met as of the end of the performance period, no compensation expense is recognized, and any previously recognized compensation expense is reversed.
The fair value of the portion of the awards subject to targeted levels of relative total shareholder return is estimated on the date of grant using a Monte Carlo simulation model.
Compensation expense is recognized based upon the assumption of 100% achievement of the TSR goal and will not be reversed even if the threshold level of TSR is never achieved, and is reflected over the service period and reduced for estimated forfeitures.
Applied issued a total of 2 million shares during the three and six months ended April 28, 2019 and a total of 1 million shares during the three and six months ended April 29, 2018.
Compensation expense is calculated using the fair value of the employees’ purchase rights under the Black-Scholes model.
The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission issued Staff Accounting Bulletin No.
Accounting for the remeasurement of deferred tax assets was completed in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018, and the accounting for the transition tax was completed in the first quarter of fiscal 2019.
Proposed regulations are not authoritative and may change in the regulatory review process.
Applied has chosen the period cost method.
Applied’s effective tax rates for the second quarter of fiscal 2019 and 2018 were 12.3 percent and 12.8 percent, respectively.
The effective tax rate for the second quarter of fiscal 2019 was lower than the same period in the prior fiscal year primarily due to tax expense of $71 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2018 for adjustments to the transition tax and remeasurement of deferred tax assets as a result of the Tax Act.
Applied’s effective tax rates for the first half of fiscal 2019 and 2018 were 12.8 percent and 48.2 percent, respectively.
The effective tax rate for the first half of fiscal 2019 was lower than the same period in the prior fiscal year primarily due to tax expense of $1.1 billion in the first half of fiscal 2018 for the transition tax and remeasurement of deferred tax assets as a result of the Tax Act.
Excluding the tax expense of $1.1 billion, the effective tax rate for the first half of fiscal 2019 was higher than the rate in the same period of the prior fiscal year primarily due to tax expense of $81 million in the first half of fiscal 2019 related to changes in uncertain tax positions and the excess tax benefit from share-based compensation in the first half of fiscal 2019 being $45 million less than in the same period in the prior fiscal year.

Note 14Industry Segment Operations



Applied’s three reportable segments are: Semiconductor Systems, Applied Global Services, and Display and Adjacent Markets.
As defined under the accounting literature, Applied’s chief operating decision-maker has been identified as the President and Chief Executive Officer, who reviews operating results to make decisions about allocating resources and assessing performance for the entire Company.
Segment information is presented based upon Applied’s management organization structure as of April 28, 2019 and the distinctive nature of each segment.
Future changes to this internal financial structure may result in changes to Applied’s reportable segments.
The Semiconductor Systems reportable segment includes semiconductor capital equipment for etch, rapid thermal processing, deposition, chemical mechanical planarization, metrology and inspection, wafer packaging, and ion implantation.
The Applied Global Services segment provides integrated solutions to optimize equipment and fab performance and productivity, including spares, upgrades, services, certain remanufactured earlier generation equipment and factory automation software for semiconductor, display and other products.
Each operating segment is separately managed and has separate financial results that are reviewed by Applied’s chief operating decision-maker.
Each reportable segment contains closely related products that are unique to the particular segment.
Segment operating income is determined based upon internal performance measures used by Applied’s chief operating decision-maker.
The chief operating decision-maker does not evaluate operating segments using total asset information.
Applied derives the segment results directly from its internal management reporting system.
The accounting policies Applied uses to derive reportable segment results are substantially the same as those used for external reporting purposes.
Management uses these results to evaluate the performance of, and to assign resources to, each of the reportable segments.
These operating expenses include costs related to share-based compensation; certain management, finance, legal, human resources, and research, development and engineering functions provided at the corporate level; and unabsorbed information technology and occupancy.
In addition, Applied does not allocate to its reportable segments restructuring and asset impairment charges and any associated adjustments related to restructuring actions, unless these actions pertain to a specific reportable segment.
Management does not consider the unallocated costs in measuring the performance of the reportable segments.
Net sales and operating income (loss) for each reportable segment were as follows:
