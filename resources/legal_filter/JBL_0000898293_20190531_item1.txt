1.
Basis of Presentation  



The accompanying unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (U.S.
GAAP) for interim financial information and with the instructions to Form 10-Q and Article 10 of Regulation S-X.
In the opinion of management, all adjustments (consisting of normal recurring accruals) necessary to present fairly the information set forth therein have been included.
Jabil Inc. (the Company) has made certain reclassification adjustments to conform prior periods Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements to the current presentation.
The accompanying unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements and footnotes included in the Annual Report on Form 10-K of the Company for the fiscal year ended August 31, 2018.
2.
Earnings Per Share and Dividends  



Earnings Per Share  



The Company calculates its basic earnings per share by dividing net income attributable to the Company by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period.
The Companys diluted earnings per share is calculated in a similar manner, but includes the effect of dilutive securities.
The difference between the weighted average number of basic shares outstanding and the weighted average number of diluted shares outstanding is primarily due to dilutive unvested restricted stock unit awards (restricted stock units) and dilutive stock appreciation rights.
Performance-based restricted stock units are considered dilutive when the related performance criteria have been met assuming the end of the reporting period represents the end of the performance period.
Inventories  



Inventories consist of the following (in thousands):

Restricted Stock Units  



Certain key employees have been granted time-based, performance-based and market-based restricted stock units.
The time-based restricted stock units generally vest on a graded vesting schedule over three years.
The performance-based restricted stock units generally vest on a cliff vesting schedule over three years and up to a maximum of 150%, depending on the specified performance condition and the level of achievement obtained.
The performance-based restricted stock units have a vesting condition that is based upon the Companys cumulative adjusted core earnings per share during the performance period.
The market-based restricted stock units generally vest on a cliff vesting schedule over three years and up to a maximum of 200%, depending on the specified performance condition and the level of achievement obtained.
The market-based restricted stock units have a vesting condition that is tied to the Companys total shareholder return based on the Companys stock performance in relation to the companies in the Standard and Poors (S&P) Super Composite Technology Hardware and Equipment Index excluding the Company.
During the nine months ended May 31, 2019 and 2018, the Company awarded approximately 1.6 million and 1.4 million time-based restricted stock units, respectively, 0.4 million and 0.4 million performance-based restricted stock units, respectively and 0.4 million and 0.4 million market-based restricted stock units, respectively.

Concentration of Risk and Segment Data  



Concentration of Risk  



Sales of the Companys products are concentrated among specific customers.
During the nine months ended May 31, 2019, the Companys five largest customers accounted for approximately 43% of its net revenue and 82 customers accounted for approximately 90% of its net revenue.
Sales to these customers were reported in the Electronics Manufacturing Services (EMS) and Diversified Manufacturing Services (DMS) operating segments.
The Company procures components from a broad group of suppliers.
Some of the products manufactured by the Company require one or more components that are available from only a single source.
Segment Data  



Net revenue for the operating segments is attributed to the segment in which the service is performed.
An operating segments performance is evaluated based on its pre-tax operating contribution, or segment income.
Transactions between operating segments are generally recorded at amounts that approximate those at which we would transact with third parties.

Notes Payable and Long-Term Debt  



Notes payable and long-term debt outstanding as of May 31, 2019 and August 31, 2018 are summarized below (in thousands):  



  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 



 (1)  



As of May 31, 2019, the Company has $2.0 billion in available unused borrowing capacity under its revolving credit facilities.
In addition, the revolving credit facilities and the 4.900% Senior Notes contain debt leverage and interest coverage covenants.
The Company is also subject to certain covenants requiring the Company to offer to repurchase the 5.625%, 4.700%, 4.900% or 3.950% Senior Notes upon a change of control.
As of May 31, 2019 and August 31, 2018, the Company was in compliance with its debt covenants.
Fair Value  



The estimated fair values of the Companys publicly traded debt, including the 5.625%, 4.700% and 3.950% Senior Notes, were approximately $416.5 million, $517.9 million and $480.1 million, respectively, as of May 31, 2019.
The fair value estimates are based upon observable market data (Level 2 criteria).
The estimated fair value of the Companys private debt, the 4.900% Senior Notes, was approximately $311.2 million, as of May 31, 2019.
This fair value estimate is based on the Companys indicative borrowing cost derived from discounted cash flows (Level 3 criteria).
The carrying amounts of borrowings under credit facilities and under loans approximate fair value as interest rates on these instruments approximate current market rates.
8.
Trade Accounts Receivable Securitization and Sale Programs  



The Company regularly sells designated pools of trade accounts receivable under a foreign asset-backed securitization program, a North American asset-back securitization program and uncommitted trade accounts receivable sale programs (collectively referred to herein as the programs).
The Company continues servicing the receivables sold and in exchange receives a servicing fee under each of the programs.
Servicing fees related to each of the programs recognized during the three months and nine months ended May 31, 2019 and 2018 were not material.
The Company does not record a servicing asset or liability on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets as the Company estimates that the fee it receives to service these receivables approximates the fair market compensation to provide the servicing activities.
The adoption of Accounting Standards Update No.
2016-15 (ASU 2016-15) described in Note 14, New Accounting Guidance, resulted in a reclassification of cash flows from operating activities to investing activities in the Companys Condensed Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows for cash receipts related to collections on the deferred purchase price receivable (i.e.
beneficial interest) on asset-backed securitization transactions.
In addition, the beneficial interest of $162.2 million and $1.5 billion for the nine months ended May 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively, obtained in exchange for securitized receivables are reported as non-cash investing activities.

Asset-Backed Securitization Programs  



The Company continuously sells designated pools of trade accounts receivable under its foreign asset-backed securitization program to a special purpose entity, which in turn sells certain of the receivables to an unaffiliated financial institution and a conduit administered by an unaffiliated financial institution on a monthly basis.
Effective October 1, 2018, the foreign asset-backed securitization program terms were amended and the program was extended to September 30, 2021.
In connection with this amendment, there is no longer a deferred purchase price receivable for the foreign asset-backed securitization program as the entire purchase price is paid in cash when the receivables are sold.
The remaining amount due to the financial institution of $398.7 million was subsequently settled for $25.2 million of cash and $373.5 million of trade accounts receivable sold to the financial institution.
The previously sold trade accounts receivable were recorded at fair market value.
Prior to the amendment, any portion of the purchase price for the receivables not paid in cash upon the sale occurring was recorded as a deferred purchase price receivable, which was paid from available cash as payments on the receivables were collected.
The foreign asset-backed securitization program contains a guarantee of payment by the special purpose entity, in an amount equal to approximately the net cash proceeds under the program.
No liability has been recorded for obligations under the guarantee as of May 31, 2019.
The special purpose entity in the foreign asset-backed securitization program is a separate bankruptcy-remote entity whose assets would be first available to satisfy the creditor claims of the unaffiliated financial institution.
The Company is deemed the primary beneficiary of this special purpose entity as the Company has both the power to direct the activities of the entity that most significantly impact the entitys economic performance and the obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive the benefits that could potentially be significant to the entity from the transfer of the trade accounts receivable into the special purpose entity.
Accordingly, the special purpose entity associated with the foreign asset-backed securitization program is included in the Companys Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements.
The North American asset-backed securitization program was terminated on October 9, 2018 and as of this date approximately $500.0 million of accounts receivable sold under the program was exchanged for the outstanding deferred purchase price receivable of $300.0 million and $200.0 million of cash.
The previously sold trade accounts receivable were recorded at fair market value.
On November 27, 2018, the Company entered into a new North American asset-backed securitization program.
The Company continuously sells designated pools of trade accounts receivable under its new North American asset-backed securitization program to a special purpose entity, which in turn sells certain of the receivables to conduits administered by unaffiliated financial institutions on a monthly basis.
The special purpose entity in the North American asset-backed securitization program is a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company and is included in the Companys Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements.
There is no longer a deferred purchase price receivable for the North American asset-backed securitization program as the entire purchase price is paid in cash when the receivables are sold.
Additionally, $204.4 million in receivables are pledged as collateral to the unaffiliated financial institution as of May 31, 2019.
Following is a summary of the asset-backed securitization programs and key terms:  



  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

(3)  



Recorded initially at fair value as prepaid expenses and other current assets on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets and are valued using unobservable inputs (Level 3 inputs), primarily discounted cash flows, and due to their credit quality and short-term maturity the fair values approximated book values.
The unobservable inputs consist of estimated credit losses and estimated discount rates, which both have an immaterial impact on the fair value calculations.
(4)  



Excludes $650.3 million of trade accounts receivable sold, $488.1 million of cash and $13.9 million of net cash received prior to the amendment of the foreign asset-backed securitization program and under the previous North American asset-backed securitization program.
The asset-backed securitization programs require compliance with several covenants.
The North American asset-backed securitization program covenants include compliance with the interest ratio and debt to EBITDA ratio of the Credit Facility.
As of May 31, 2019 and August 31, 2018, the Company was in compliance with all covenants under the asset-backed securitization programs.

New Accounting Guidance  



Recently Adopted Accounting Guidance  



During fiscal year 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued an accounting standard, which is a comprehensive new revenue recognition model that requires a company to recognize revenue to depict the transfer of goods or services to a customer at an amount that reflects the consideration it expects to receive in exchange for those goods or services.
The accounting standard became effective for the Company in the first quarter of fiscal year 2019.
Refer to Note 16  Revenue to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for further details.
During fiscal year 2016, the FASB issued a new accounting standard to address certain aspects of recognition, measurement, presentation and disclosure of financial instruments.
This guidance became effective for the Company in the first quarter of fiscal year 2019, and was applied prospectively by means of a cumulative-effect adjustment to the Consolidated Balance Sheet as of September 1, 2018 to equity investments that existed as of the date of adoption of the standard.
During fiscal year 2016, the FASB issued a new accounting standard to address the presentation of certain transactions within the statement of cash flows with the objective of reducing the existing diversity in practice.
This standard was adopted on September 1, 2018 on a retrospective basis and resulted in a reclassification of cash flows from operating activities to investing activities in the Companys Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows for cash receipts related to collections on the deferred purchase price receivable on asset-backed securitization transactions.
The increase in cash flow from investing activities and the corresponding decrease to cash flow from operating activities upon adoption of the standard was $96.8 million and $1.6 billion for the nine months ended May 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively.
During fiscal year 2017, the FASB issued a new accounting standard to improve the accounting for the income tax consequences of intra-entity transfers of assets other than inventory.
The new standard eliminates the exception for an intra-entity transfer of an asset other than inventory and requires an entity to recognize the income tax consequences when the transfer occurs.
This guidance became effective for the Company beginning in the first quarter of fiscal year 2019.
This guidance was adopted on a modified retrospective basis and an immaterial cumulative-effect adjustment was recorded, which reduced retained earnings as of September 1, 2018.
During fiscal year 2017, the FASB issued a new accounting standard which clarifies the scope of accounting for asset derecognition and adds further guidance for recognizing gains and losses from the transfer of non-financial assets in contracts with non-customers.
This guidance became effective for the Company beginning in the first quarter of fiscal year 2019 coincident with the new revenue recognition guidance.
During fiscal year 2017, the FASB issued a new accounting standard to improve the presentation of net periodic pension benefit cost.
Prior periods have not been reclassified due to immateriality.
During the second quarter of fiscal year 2018, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) staff issued Staff Accounting Bulletin No.
SAB 118 provides a measurement period that should not extend beyond one year from the Tax Act enactment date for companies to complete the accounting under ASC 740.
The Company applied SAB 118 and provided required disclosures in Note 15Income Taxes.

Recently Issued Accounting Guidance  



During fiscal year 2016, the FASB issued a new accounting standard revising lease accounting.
The new guidance requires organizations to recognize lease assets and lease liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheet and disclose key information regarding leasing arrangements.
This guidance is effective for the Company beginning in the first quarter of fiscal year 2020.
Early application of the new standard is permitted and the standard must be adopted using a modified retrospective approach.
The Company intends to elect the package of practical expedients offered, which allows entities to not reassess: i) whether any contracts prior to the adoption date are or contain leases, ii) lease classification, and iii) whether capitalized initial direct costs continue to meet the definition of initial direct costs under the new guidance.
In preparation for the adoption, the Company is implementing a new lease accounting system.
While the Company is currently evaluating accounting policy elections and assessing overall impacts this new standard will have on its Consolidated Financial Statements, the new guidance is expected to have a material impact on the consolidated balance sheets upon adoption, primarily due to the recognition of right-of-use assets and operating lease liabilities.
During fiscal year 2016, the FASB issued an accounting standard, which replaces the existing incurred loss impairment methodology with a methodology that reflects expected credit losses and requires consideration of a broader range of reasonable and supportable information to inform credit loss estimates.
This guidance is effective for the Company beginning in the first quarter of fiscal year 2021 and early adoption is permitted beginning in the first quarter of fiscal year 2020.
This guidance must be applied using a modified retrospective or prospective transition method, depending on the area covered by this accounting standard.
The Company is currently assessing the impact this new standard may have on its Consolidated Financial Statements.
During fiscal year 2017, the FASB issued a new accounting standard to improve the financial reporting of hedging relationships to better portray the economic results of an entitys risk management activities by simplifying the application of hedge accounting and improving the related disclosures in its financial statements.
This guidance is effective for the Company beginning in the first quarter of fiscal year 2020, with early adoption permitted.
The guidance must be applied using a modified retrospective approach.
During fiscal year 2018, the FASB issued a new accounting standard which aligns the requirements for capitalizing implementation costs incurred in a hosting arrangement that is a service contract with the requirements for capitalizing implementation costs incurred to develop or obtain internal-use software.
This guidance is effective for the Company beginning in the first quarter of fiscal year 2021, with early adoption permitted.
The Company is currently assessing the impact this new standard may have on its Consolidated Financial Statements.
Recently issued accounting guidance not discussed above is not applicable or did not have, or is not expected to have, a material impact to the Company.
15.
During the first quarter of fiscal year 2019, the Company elected to record the Global Intangible Low-Taxed Income effects as a period cost.
The Company intends to indefinitely reinvest the remaining earnings from the Companys foreign subsidiaries for which a deferred tax liability has not already been recorded.
The accumulated earnings are the most significant component of the basis differences which are indefinitely reinvested.
16.
Revenue  



Effective September 1, 2018, the Company adopted ASU 2014-09, Revenue Recognition (Topic 606).
The new standard is a comprehensive new revenue recognition model that requires the Company to recognize revenue in a manner which depicts the transfer of goods or services to its customers at an amount that reflects the consideration the Company expects to receive in exchange for those goods or services.
19   



Table of Contents 



Prior to the adoption of the new standard, the Company recognized substantially all of its revenue from contracts with customers at a point in time, which was generally when the goods were shipped to or received by the customer, title and risk of ownership had passed, the price to the buyer was fixed or determinable and collectability was reasonably assured (net of estimated returns).
Under the new standard, the Company will recognize revenue over time for the majority of its contracts with customers which will result in revenue for those customers being recognized earlier than under the previous guidance.
Revenue for all other contracts with customers will continue to be recognized at a point in time, similar to recognition prior to the adoption of the standard.
Under the new standard, such upfront costs will be recognized as an asset and amortized on a systematic basis consistent with the pattern of the transfer of control of the products or services to which to the asset relates.
The Company adopted ASU 2014-09 using the modified retrospective method by applying the guidance to all open contracts upon adoption and recorded a cumulative effect adjustment as of September 1, 2018, net of tax, of $42.6 million.
No adjustments have been made to prior periods.

Significant Judgments  



The Company is one of the leading providers of worldwide manufacturing services and solutions.
The Company provides comprehensive electronics design, production and product management services to companies in various industries and end markets.
The Company derives substantially all of its revenue from production and product management services (collectively referred to as manufacturing services), which encompasses the act of producing tangible products that are built to customer specifications, which are then provided to the customer.
As a result, the Company considers its contract with a customer to be the combination of the manufacturing service contract and the purchase order, or any agreements or other similar documents.
The majority of our manufacturing service contracts relate to manufactured products which have no alternative use and for which the Company has an enforceable right to payment for the work completed to date.
As a result, revenue is recognized over time when or as the Company transfers control of the promised products or services (known as performance obligations) to its customers.

Most of our contracts have a single performance obligation as the promise to transfer the individual manufactured product or service is capable of being distinct and is distinct within the context of the contract.
The Company also derives revenue to a lesser extent from electronic design services to certain customers.
Revenue from electronic design services is generally recognized over time as the services are performed.
For the Companys over time customers, it believes the measure of progress which best depicts the transfer of control is based on costs incurred to date, relative to total estimated cost at completion (i.e., an input method).
This method is a faithful depiction of the transfer of goods or services because it results in the recognition of revenue on the basis of our to-date efforts in the satisfaction of a performance obligation relative to the total expected efforts in the satisfaction of the performance obligation.
The Company believes that the use of an input method best depicts the transfer of control to the customer, which occurs as we incur costs on our contracts.
The transaction price of each performance obligation is generally based upon the contractual stand-alone selling price of the product or service.
Certain contracts with customers include variable consideration, such as rebates, discounts, or returns.
Taxes collected from the Companys customers and remitted to governmental authorities are presented within the Companys Consolidated Statement of Operations on a net basis and are excluded from the transaction price.
The Company has elected to account for shipping and handling activities related to contracts with customers as costs to fulfill the promise to transfer the goods.

Contract Balances  



Timing of revenue recognition may differ from the timing of invoicing to customers.
The Company records an asset when revenue is recognized prior to invoicing a customer (contract assets) while a liability is recognized when a customer pays an invoice prior to the Company transferring control of the goods or services (contract liabilities).
Amounts recognized as contract assets are generally transferred to receivables in the succeeding quarter due to the short-term nature of the manufacturing cycle.
Contract assets are classified separately on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets and transferred to receivables when right to payment becomes unconditional.
No impairment costs related to contract assets were recognized during the three months and nine months ended May 31, 2019.
Revenue recognized during the nine months ended May 31, 2019 that was included in the contract liability balance as of September 1, 2018 was $350.9 million.
Fulfillment Costs  



The Company capitalizes costs incurred to fulfill its contracts that i) relate directly to the contract or anticipated contracts, ii) are expected to generate or enhance the Companys resources that will be used to satisfy the performance obligation under the contract, and iii) are expected to be recovered through revenue generated from the contract.
Prior to the adoption of the new guidance, unless explicit reimbursement contracts existed, these costs were expensed as incurred.

The Company assesses the capitalized fulfillment costs for impairment at the end of each reporting period.
The Company will recognize an impairment loss to the extent the carrying amount of the capitalized costs exceeds the recoverable amount.
Recoverability is assessed by considering the capitalized fulfillment costs in relation to the forecasted profitability of the related manufacturing performance obligations.
As of May 31, 2019, capitalized costs to fulfill are $74.4 million.
Amortization of fulfillment costs was $9.8 million and $29.7 million, respectively, for the three months and nine months ended May 31, 2019.
No impairments related to fulfillments costs were recognized during the three months and nine months ended May 31, 2019.
Remaining Performance Obligations  



The Company applied the practical expedient and did not disclose the value of unsatisfied performance obligations for contracts with an original expected length of one year or less.
