Business and Market Environment
Juniper designs, develops, and sells products and services for high-performance networks to enable customers to build scalable, reliable, secure and cost-effective networks for their businesses, while achieving agility, efficiency and value through automation. 
Further, our intent is to lead in the area of software solutions that simplify the operation of networks, and to allow our customers across our key verticals to deliver further value through their networks. We anticipate that our increased focus on software business models will result in an increase in software revenues as a percentage of total revenues over time. 
•Strategic Enterprise is now referred to as ‘Enterprise’
Types of customers included in the key verticals remain unchanged.
We are focused on and continue to see significant opportunities from the implementation of cloud architectures, such as large public and private data centers, as well as distributed cloud infrastructure, which resides in multiple, distributed data centers in order to place applications or services closer to end users, such as enabling security and "network-as-a-service."
We believe the network needs for our customers in our Service Provider, Cloud, and Enterprise verticals are converging, as these customers recognize the need for high performance networks and leveraging the cloud for improved agility and greater levels of operating efficiency. 
As these customers continue to grow, we believe their network architectures will continue to evolve. We believe our understanding of high performance networking technology and our strategy position us to capitalize on the industry transition to more automated, cost-efficient, scalable networks.
Innovations
During the third quarter of 2018, we continued to execute on our product strategy. We announced innovations across our PTX, QFX, and MX series of products. We believe the new technology will help Service Provider, Cloud, and Enterprise customers recalibrate network economics as they transition to 400G to lower cost-per-bit while keeping up with increasing bandwidth demands from next generation mobile network build-outs, or 5G, augmented and virtual reality, cloud, and 4K video production and distribution. We also upgraded our services processing card (SPC3 Advanced Security Acceleration card) that can improve performance by as much as eleven times to our SRX5000 line of Services Gateways across a variety of key performance metrics, helping Service Providers, Cloud providers, and Enterprises meet the demands of multicloud; Internet of Things, or IoT; 5G; and the enterprise edge, while continuing to provide customers investment protection with their SPC2 installed base. We also announced Contrail Edge Cloud that allows Service Providers to cost effectively deploy new services to the space and power-constrained network edge. It virtualizes compute, storage, and networking resources efficiently and economically in lightweight edge environments such as central offices, base stations, hubs, and switching sites. Moreover, we recently introduced our software-based Contrail Enterprise Multicloud solution, which began shipping in third quarter of 2018. We are seeing strong customer adoption as our Enterprise customers migrate to multicloud solutions for end-to-end policy, control, and visibility.
In the third quarter of 2018, we also announced new and expanding partnerships with companies like Nutanix and Ericsson, which we expect will help strengthen our ability to capitalize on multicloud and 5G initiatives and drive our competitive advantage in the marketplace.

Financial Results and Key Performance Metrics Overview
On January 1, 2018, we adopted Financial Accounting Standards Board, or FASB, Accounting Standards Update, or ASU, No. 2014-09 (Topic 606) - Revenue from Contracts with Customers, which we refer to as Topic 606. The standard provides guidance for revenue recognition that superseded the revenue recognition requirements in Accounting Standards Codification Topic 605, Revenue Recognition, which we refer to as Topic 605, and most industry specific guidance. See Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, in the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 1 of Part I of this Report for further discussion on the adoption of Topic 606. Results for reporting periods beginning after January 1, 2018 are presented under Topic 606, while prior period amounts are not adjusted and continue to be reported in accordance with the historic accounting under Topic 605. 
For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2018, the adoption of Topic 606 resulted in a decrease in revenue recognition of $4.6 million and $19.5 million, respectively, due to lower service revenues, partly offset by higher product revenues. Product revenues during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2018 were higher by $22.8 million and $80.7 million, respectively, under Topic 606, compared to Topic 605, primarily due to the impact of revenue allocation between products and services, timing of revenue recognition from sales to distributors, and variable consideration. The 
product revenues increase from Topic 606 was allocated among all product categories. Service revenues during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2018 were lower by $27.4 million and $100.2 million, respectively, under Topic 606, compared to Topic 605, primarily due to the impact of revenue allocation between products and services, and due to certain contractual clauses. We believe the adoption of Topic 606 will continue to impact the allocation of revenues between product and service.

Revenues
Three Months Ended September 30, 2018 compared with the Three Months Ended September 30, 2017
Product net revenues decreased during the three months ended September 30, 2018, compared to the same period in 2017, due to a decrease in revenues from our routing products, partially offset by higher revenues from switching, driven by the impact of the adoption of Topic 606, and growth in security. 
Service net revenues decreased during the three months ended September 30, 2018, compared to the same period in 2017, due to the impact of Topic 606. Excluding the impact of Topic 606, our service net revenues would have increased year-over-year, primarily due to strong renewal and attach rates of support contracts. As a result of Topic 606, we expect that our service net revenues will see a decrease for the full year 2018 compared to 2017.
Nine Months Ended September 30, 2018 compared with the Nine Months Ended September 30, 2017
Product net revenues decreased during the nine months ended September 30, 2018, compared to the same period in 2017, primarily due to Cloud and Service Provider, impacting routing and switching in the Americas. The decrease in product revenues was partially offset by the impact of Topic 606 and growth in security.
We experienced growth in revenues from our security business during the nine months ended September 30, 2018, compared to the same period in 2017, across all verticals as customers transitioned to our newer product offerings. We expect that our security business will see year-over-year growth for the full year 2018.
Service net revenues decreased during the nine months ended September 30, 2018, compared to the same period in 2017, due to the impact of Topic 606. Excluding the impact of Topic 606, our service net revenues would have increased year-over-year, driven primarily by strong renewal and attach rates of support contracts.

Product gross margin
Product gross margin as a percentage of product revenues decreased during the nine months ended September 30, 2018, compared to the same period in 2017, primarily due to product mix, partially offset by the impact of Topic 606.
Service gross margin 
Service gross margin as a percentage of service net revenues decreased during the nine months ended September 30, 2018, compared to the same period in 2017, primarily due to lower revenues from the impact of Topic 606, increased professional services costs to support our software deployments, and higher service delivery costs.
Operating Expenses
Three Months Ended September 30, 2018 compared with the Three Months Ended September 30, 2017
Nine Months Ended September 30, 2018 compared with the Nine Months Ended September 30, 2017
Subsequent to September 30, 2018, we amended the 2018 Restructuring Plan to further implement certain organizational changes resulting in a realignment of our workforce. As a result, we expect to record severance charges of approximately $5.0 million related to headcount reductions in the fourth quarter of 2018.
Other Expense, Net 
Three Months Ended September 30, 2018 compared with the Three Months Ended September 30, 2017
Total other expense, net increased during the three months ended September 30, 2018, compared to the same period in 2017, primarily due to losses on equity investments, partially offset by an increase in interest income related to our fixed income investment portfolio, as a result of higher yields. With higher interest rates, other expense, net is expected to be lower over the next few quarters.
Nine Months Ended September 30, 2018 compared with the Nine Months Ended September 30, 2017
Total other expense, net decreased during the nine months ended September 30, 2018, compared to the same period in 2017, primarily due to an increase in interest income related to our fixed income investment portfolio, as a result of higher yields and a higher average portfolio balance, partially offset by losses on equity investments.
Income Tax (Benefit) Provision
The effective tax rate during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2018 differs from the federal statutory rate of 21%, primarily due to the recognition of certain previously unrecognized tax benefits of $67.6 million, which includes interest of $8.4 million, a reduction of expected tax liabilities of $33.2 million, federal research and development credits, and a favorable change in the forecasted geographic mix of earnings. The recognition of $67.6 million in previously unrecognized tax benefits is due to a lapse in the federal statute of limitations relative to fiscal years 2010 through 2014. The reduction of expected tax liabilities of $33.2 million is a result of filing a change in accounting method for the tax recognition of deferred product revenue in the U.S. to better align with the financial statement recognition of such revenue.
Summary of Cash Flows 
Operating Activities
Investing Activities
Net cash provided by investing activities increased during the nine months ended September 30, 2018, compared to the same period in 2017. The increase was primarily due to the liquidation of repatriated offshore investments to fund the accelerated share repurchase program discussed below.
Net cash used in financing activities increased during the nine months ended September 30, 2018, compared to the same period in 2017. The increase was primarily due to higher repurchases of our common stock, as a result of the accelerated share repurchase program described further below, and increases in payments of cash dividends.
In January 2018, our Board of Directors, which we refer to as the Board, approved a $2.0 billion share repurchase program, which we refer to as the 2018 Stock Repurchase Program. The 2018 Stock Repurchase Program replaces the previous authorization approved by the Board in 2014. 
As of September 30, 2018, there was $1.3 billion of authorized funds remaining under the 2018 Stock Repurchase Program. 
Future share repurchases under the 2018 Stock Repurchase Program will be subject to a review of the circumstances at that time and will be made from time to time in private transactions or open market purchases as permitted by securities laws and other legal requirements. Our 2018 Stock Repurchase Program may be discontinued at any time. See Note 8, Equity, in the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 1 of Part I of this Report for further discussion of our share purchase program. 
We declared and paid cash dividends of $0.18 per share each quarter, totaling $187.0 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2018. Any future dividends, and the establishment of record and payment dates, are subject to approval by the Board or an authorized committee thereof. See Note 14, Subsequent Event, in the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 1 of Part I of this Report for discussion of our dividend declaration subsequent to September 30, 2018. 
We have an unsecured revolving credit facility that will expire in 2019, which enables borrowings of up to $500.0 million, with the option, subject to the lenders' approval, to increase the amount of the credit facility by up to an additional $200.0 million. As of September 30, 2018, we were in compliance with all covenants and there were no amounts outstanding under our credit facility.
