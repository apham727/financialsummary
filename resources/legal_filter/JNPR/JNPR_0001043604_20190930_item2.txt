Business and Market Environment
Further, our intent is to expand our software business by introducing new software solutions to our product portfolio that simplify the operation of networks, and allow our customers across our key verticals flexibility in consumption and deployment. We believe our software and related services revenues as a percentage of total revenues will increase over time as we introduce new software solutions designed to better monetize the value of software functionality in our offerings. 
We believe the network needs for our customers in our Cloud, Service Provider, and Enterprise verticals are converging, as these customers recognize the need for high performance networks and are adopting cloud architectures for their infrastructure and service delivery, such as large public and private data centers and service provider edge data centers, for improved agility and greater levels of operating efficiency. 
In the third quarter of 2019, we experienced weakness within our Service Provider vertical, which we believe is due to continued business challenges facing some of our largest Service Provider customers. We believe our relationships with our existing Service Provider customers generally remain strong and we expect Service Provider revenues to decline more modestly year-over-year in 2020 as compared to 2019. Enterprise has increased sequentially over the past two quarters driven by demand in our U.S. federal business as well as broad Enterprise strength, and we expect another sequential increase in the fourth quarter of 2019. Our Cloud vertical has returned to year-over-year growth for the past two quarters and we expect our Cloud vertical to grow in the fourth quarter of 2019 as compared to the same quarter in 2018, as we continued to see momentum within our customers' wide area networks, particularly from certain of our switching products.
Financial Results and Key Performance Metrics Overview
Of our top ten customers for the third quarter of 2019, three were in Cloud, six were in Service Provider, and one was in Enterprise. Of these customers, three were located outside of the U.S.

On July 24, 2018, the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals, or the Court, issued an opinion in Altera Corp. v. Commissioner requiring related parties in an intercompany cost-sharing arrangement to share expenses related to share-based compensation. On June 7, 2019, the Court upheld the cost-sharing regulations, subject to the right of appeal by Altera. On July 22, 2019, Altera petitioned the Court for rehearing. We will continue to monitor ongoing developments and potential impacts to our financial statements. If a judicial decision against Altera had been finalized in the reporting period, our effective tax rate for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2019 would have been higher.
Summary of Cash Flows 
Operating Activities
Net cash provided by operations decreased during the nine months ended September 30, 2019, compared to the same period in 2018. The decrease was primarily due to lower cash collections from customers as a result of lower invoicing, partially offset by a decrease in cash payments to suppliers.
Investing Activities
Net cash used in investing activities was $704.1 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2019, compared to net cash provided by investing activities of $730.0 million for the same period in 2018. During the nine months ended September 30, 2019, the payment for the acquisition of Mist was $270.9 million and net purchases of investments was $349.7 million. During the nine months ended September 30, 2018, net proceeds from sales, maturities and redemptions of investments was $872.4 million, primarily from the liquidation of repatriated offshore investments to fund the ASR discussed below.
In January 2018, our Board of Directors, which we refer to as the Board, approved a $2.0 billion share repurchase program, which we refer to as the 2018 Stock Repurchase Program. As part of the 2018 Stock Repurchase Program, in February 2018, we entered into an ASR to repurchase $750.0 million of our common stock. We made an up-front payment of $750.0 million pursuant to the ASR to repurchase our common stock. The aggregate number of shares ultimately repurchased of 29.3 million shares of common stock was determined based on a volume weighted average repurchase price, less an agreed upon discount, of $25.62 per share.
During the third quarter of 2019, we also repurchased 2.1 million shares of our common stock in the open market for an aggregate purchase price of $50.0 million at an average price of $23.63 per share.
As of September 30, 2019, there was approximately $900.0 million of authorized funds remaining under the 2018 Stock Repurchase Program. 
We declared and paid a quarterly cash dividend of $0.19 per share, totaling $64.7 million and $196.4 million during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2019, respectively. Any future dividends, and the establishment of record and payment dates, are subject to approval by the Board or an authorized committee thereof. See Note 16, Subsequent Events, in the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 1 of Part I of this Report for discussion of our dividend declaration subsequent to September 30, 2019. 
In April 2019, we entered into a new credit agreement with certain institutional lenders that provides for a five-year $500.0 million unsecured revolving credit facility (the “Revolving Credit Facility”), with an option to increase the Revolving Credit Facility by up to an additional $200.0 million, subject to the lenders' approval. The Prior Revolving Credit Facility was terminated substantially concurrently with our entering into the Revolving Credit Facility. The Revolving Credit Facility will terminate in April 2024, subject to two one-year maturity extension options, on the terms and conditions as set forth in the credit agreement. As of September 30, 2019, we were in compliance with all covenants in the Credit Agreement, and no amounts were outstanding.
