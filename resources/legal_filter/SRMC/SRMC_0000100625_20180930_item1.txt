Accounting Policies 
   a) Revenue Recognition  
Page 6 of 22 
FieldServer services consist of orders for custom development of protocol drivers. Generally, customers place orders for FieldServer products concurrently with their order for protocol drivers. However, if custom development of the protocol driver is required, the product order is not processed until development of the protocol driver is complete. The driver development involves further research after receipt of order, preparation of a scope document to be approved by the customer and then engineering time to write, test and release the driver program. When development of the driver is complete the customer is notified and can proceed with a FieldServer product. Revenues for protocol driver development are recognized at a point in time when the control of the product is transferred to the customer generally occurring upon shipment or delivery of the related product that includes the developed protocol drivers (as noted in FieldServer Products above).

Discounts and Allowances 
Discounts are applied at time of order entry and sales are processed at net pricing. No allowances are offered to customers. 
   b) Recent Accounting Pronouncements  
In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-2, “Leases” (Topic 842), which is intended to improve financial reporting for lease transactions. This ASU will require organizations that lease assets, such as real estate, airplanes and manufacturing equipment, to recognize on their balance sheet the assets and liabilities for the rights to use those assets for the lease term and obligations to make lease payments created by those leases that have terms of greater than 12 months. The recognition, measurement, and presentation of expenses and cash flows arising from a lease by a lessee primarily will depend on its classification as finance or operating lease. This ASU will also require disclosures to help investors and other financial statement users better understand the amount and timing of cash flows arising from leases. These disclosures will include qualitative and quantitative requirements, providing additional information about the amounts recorded in the financial statements. The ASU is effective for the Company for the year ending December 31, 2019 and interim reporting periods within that year, and early adoption is permitted. Management has not yet determined the effect of this ASU on the Company’s financial statements. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of adopting the new lease accounting standards on its financial statements. The Company is in process of creating an inventory of its leases where the Company may be a lessee to assess the potential impact to the Company’s financial statements upon adoption of the new lease accounting standards. 
   c) Employee Stock-Based Compensation  
In April 2016 and in May 2016, the Company’s Board of Directors and the Company’s shareholders, respectively, approved the Company’s 2016 Equity Incentive Plan (the “2016 Stock Plan”) and reserved a total of (i) 279,680 shares, plus (ii) 2,550,320 shares that remained available for issuance under the 2006 Stock Plan immediately prior to its expiration, plus (iii) any shares subject to stock options or restricted stock granted under the 2006 Stock Plan that, on or after the date the 2016 Stock Plan became effective, expired or otherwise terminated without having been exercised in full, or were forfeited to or repurchased by the Company, with the maximum number of shares to be added to the 2016 Stock Plan pursuant to clauses (ii) and (iii) equal to 2,668,320. Options granted under our 2006 Stock Plan and 2016 Stock Plan are at the fair market value of our common stock at the grant date, typically vest ratably over four years, and expire ten years from the grant date. As of September 30, 2018, a total of 1,216,000 shares were issued under the 2016 Stock Plan. 
All share-based payments to employees (incentive stock options) are recognized in the financial statements based on their fair values at the date of grant. The calculated fair value is recognized as expense (net of any capitalization) over the requisite service period, net of estimated forfeitures, using the straight-line method. The Company considers many factors when estimating expected forfeitures, including types of awards, employee class and historical experience. The modified prospective method of application requires compensation expense to be recognized in the financial statements for all unvested stock options beginning in the quarter of award. The cost is based on the grant date fair value of the stock option. Compensation expense recognized in future periods for share-based compensation will be adjusted for the effects of estimated forfeitures.

For the nine-month periods ended September 30, 2018 and 2017, general and administrative expenses included stock-based compensation expense of $149,951 and $230,034, respectively, decreasing the Company’s income and increasing loss before provision for income taxes and net income resulting from the recognition of compensation expense associated with employee stock options. There was no material impact on the Company’s basic and diluted net loss per share as a result of recognizing the employee stock-based compensation expense. The Company did not modify the terms of any previously granted stock options during the nine-month periods ended September 30, 2018 and 2017. 
   d) Subsequent Events  
Net Income (Loss) Per Share 
Basic earnings (loss) per share (“EPS”) is computed using the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period. Diluted EPS is computed using the weighted average number of common and dilutive potential common shares outstanding during the period. Dilutive potential common shares consist of common shares issuable upon exercise of stock options using the treasury stock method. No adjustments to earnings were made for purposes of per share calculations.
