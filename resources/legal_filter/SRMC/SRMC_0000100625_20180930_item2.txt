For the three-month period ended September 30, 2018, sales of our instrumentation products, including fire and gas detection, military sales and environment controllers, were approximately $2,813,000 compared to approximately $2,536,000 in the three-month period ended September 30, 2017, representing an 11% increase. For the nine-month period ended September 30, 2018, sales of our instrumentation products were approximately $8,116,000 compared to approximately $6,906,000 in the same period in 2017 representing an 18% increase. 
In the three-month period ended September 30, 2018, sales of FieldServer products were approximately $3,181,000 compared to approximately $2,641,000 in the same period in 2017, representing a 20% increase. In the nine-month period ended September 30, 2018, sales of our FieldServer products were approximately $8,580,000, compared to approximately $7,634,000 in sales reported in the same period in 2017, representing a 12% increase. 
FieldServer sales include both box products and original equipment manufacturer (“OEM”) modules. Box products provide a platform for delivery and operation of our software for integration with building automation systems and are generally sold to building automation integrators. Strong increases in OEM sales offset lower sales of box products. 
Selling and marketing expenses, which consist primarily of salaries, commissions and promotional expenses were approximately $1,490,000, or 25% of net sales for the three-month period ended September 30, 2018, compared to approximately $1,225,000, or 24% of net sales, in the comparable period in the prior year. For the nine-month periods ended September 30, 2018 and 2017, selling and marketing expenses were approximately $4,220,000, or 25% of net sales, and approximately 3,841,000, or 26% of net sales, respectively. The increase in our selling expenses in the three and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2018 compared to the same period in the prior year are primarily attributed to the addition of resources. 
General and administrative expenses, which consist primarily of salaries, building rent, insurance expenses, information technology expenses and fees for professional services, were approximately $1,014,000, or 17% of net sales, for the three-month period ended September 30, 2018 compared to approximately $743,000, or 14% of net sales, in the three-month period ended September 30, 2017. For the nine-month periods ended September 30, 2018 and September 2017, general and administrative expenses were approximately $2,917,000, or 17% of net sales, and approximately $2,356,000, or 16% of net sales, respectively. General and administrative expenses have increased 36% in the three-month period and increased 24% in the nine-month reporting periods ended September 30, 2018 compared to the same periods in 2017, primarily due to increased salary expenses and outsourced professionals. 
In the three-month period ended September 30, 2018, our income from operations was approximately $321,000 compared to income from operations of approximately $369,000 for the three-month period ended September 30, 2017. In the nine-month period ended September 30, 2018, our income from operations was approximately $498,000 compared to a loss from operations of approximately $447,000 in the nine-month period ended September 30, 2017. The loss in the nine-month period of 2017 was due to non-recurring expenses. 
After interest income and provision for income tax expense, our net income for the three-month period ended September 30, 2018 was approximately $214,000 compared to net income of approximately $192,000 in the same period of 2017. For the nine-month period ended September 30, 2018, our net income was approximately $311,000 compared to a net loss of approximately $367,000 in the same period of 2017.

We maintain a line of credit with our commercial bank in the maximum amount of $2,000,000. No borrowings have been made under our line of credit during the first nine months of fiscal year 2018 and there were no outstanding balances at September 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017. As of September 30, 2018, we were in compliance with the financial covenants of the line of credit. 
In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued ASU 2014-09, “Revenue from Contracts with Customers” (Topic 606). ASC 606 requires the recognition of revenue when promised goods or services are transferred to customers in an amount that reflects the considerations to which the entity expects to be entitled to in exchange for those goods or services. On January 1, 2018, the Company adopted ASC 606 by using the modified retrospective method. The comparative information has not been recast and continues to be reported under the accounting standards in effect for those periods. The adoption did not have a material impact to the nature and timing of its revenues, condensed statements of operations, condensed statements cash flows and condensed balance sheets. The majority of the impact has been on sales returns and the impact has been deemed immaterial. 
The Company’s revenues are derived from the sale of FieldServer products, FieldServer products services, Gas Detection and Environment Control products, and Gas Detection and Environment Control products services. The Company accounts for a contract with a customer when there’s approval and commitment from both parties, the rights of the parties are identified, payment terms are identified, the contract has commercial substance and collectability of consideration is probable. 
FieldServer services consist of orders for custom development of protocol drivers. Generally customers place orders for FieldServer products concurrently with their order for protocol drivers. However, if custom development of the protocol driver is required, the product order is not processed until development of the protocol driver is complete. The driver development involves further research after receipt of order, preparation of a scope document to be approved by the customer and then engineering time to write, test and release the driver program. When development of the driver is complete the customer is notified and can proceed with a FieldServer product. Revenues for protocol driver development are recognized at a point in time when the control of the product is transferred to the customer generally occurring upon shipment or delivery of the related product that includes the developed protocol drivers (as noted in FieldServer Products above). 
Discounts are applied at time of order entry and sales are processed at net pricing. No allowances are offered to customers. 
The Company provides a warranty on all products sold for a period of two years after the date of shipment. Warranty issues are usually resolved with repair or replacement of the product. This standard warranty is assurance type warranty and does not offer any services in addition to the assurance that the product will continue working as specified. Therefore, warranties are not considered separate performance obligations in the arrangement. Instead, estimated future warranty obligations related to products are provided by charges to condensed statements of operations in the period in which the related revenue is recognized. 
The Company records accounts receivable when it has an unconditional right to consideration. Contract liabilities are recorded when cash payments are received or due in advance of performance. Contract liabilities consist of only advance payments, where the Company has unsatisfied performance obligations. Contract liabilities are classified as deferred revenue and included within “Other current liabilities” on the condensed balance sheets. At times, billing may occur subsequent to revenue recognition, resulting in an unbilled receivable which represents a contract asset. The Company does not have any unbilled receivable on the condensed balance sheets. 
Payment terms vary by customer. The time between invoicing and when payment is due is not significant. For certain products or services and customer types, payment is required before the products or services are delivered to the customer. 
There were no significant changes in estimates during the period that would affect the contract balances. The amounts of revenue recognized during the nine months ended September 30, 2018 and September 30, 2017 from the opening deferred revenue balances were $32,059 and $8,167, respectively. For the three and nine month periods ended September 30, 2018, and September 30, 2017 no impairment losses related to contract balances were recognized in the condensed statement of operations. 
The Company has elected to account for shipping and handling activities related to contracts with customers as costs to fulfill the promise to transfer the associated products. 
Remaining performance obligations represent the transaction price allocated to performances obligations that are unsatisfied or partially unsatisfied as of the end of the reporting period. Unsatisfied and partially unsatisfied performance obligations consist of contract liabilities and non-cancellable backlog. Non-cancellable backlog includes goods and services for which customer purchase orders have been accepted that are scheduled or in the process of being scheduled for shipment. As of September 30, 2018, the remaining performance obligation is approximately $4,693,000, 51% or $2,409,000 of which is expected to be recognized in 3 months and 21% or $998,000 of which is expected to be recognized in the next fiscal year. The remainder is expected to be recognized after fiscal year 2019. 
Our domestic sales are generally made on an open account basis unless specific experience or knowledge of the customer’s potential inability or unwillingness to meet the payment terms dictate secured payments. Our international sales are generally made based on secure payment terms including cash wire advance payments and letters of credit. International sales are made on open account terms where sufficient historical experience justifies the assumption of customer credit risk. In many of our larger sales, our customers are frequently construction contractors who are in need of our field services to complete their work and obtain payment. Management’s ability to manage the credit terms and utilize the leverage provided by the clients’ need for our services is critical to the effective application of credit terms and minimization of accounts receivable losses. 
We maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts which is analyzed on a periodic basis to determine adequacy. We believe that we have demonstrated the ability to make reasonable and reliable estimates of allowances for doubtful accounts based on significant historical experience. 
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or estimated market, with cost being determined on the first-in, first-out method. We use an Enterprise Requirements Planning (“ERP”) software system which provides data upon which management relies to determine inventory trends and identify excesses. The carrying value of inventory is reduced to market for slow moving and obsolete items based on historical experience and current product demand. We evaluate the carrying value of inventory quarterly. The adequacy of carrying amounts is dependent upon management’s ability to forecast demands accurately, manage product changes efficiently, and interpret the data provided by the ERP system.
