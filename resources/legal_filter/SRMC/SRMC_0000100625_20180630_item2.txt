Gross profit for the three-month period ended June 30, 2018 was approximately $3,210,000, or 58% of net sales, compared to approximately $2,787,000, or 58% of net sales, in the same period in 2017. Gross profit for the six-month period ended June 30, 2018 was approximately $6,376,000, or 60% of net sales, compared to approximately $5,521,000, or 59% of net sales, in the same period in 2017. The margins in each of the first half and second quarter of 2018 are generally consistent with our historical results. 
Selling and marketing expenses, which consist primarily of salaries, commissions and promotional expenses were approximately $1,343,000, or 24% of net sales, for the three-month period ended June 30, 2018, compared to approximately $1,260,000, or 26% of net sales, in the comparable period in the prior year. For the six-month periods ended June 30, 2018 and June 30, 2017, selling and marketing expenses were approximately $2,730,000, or 26% of net sales, and approximately $2,616,000, or 28% of net sales, respectively. Selling expenses have increased in the three and six-month periods ending June 30, 2018 primarily because we added a Regional Sales Manager for Asia and Canada as well as a Regional Sales Manager for Latin America. 
General and administrative expenses, which consist primarily of salaries, building rent, insurance expenses, information technology expenses and fees for professional services, were approximately $989,000, or 18% of net sales, for the three-month period ended June 30, 2018 compared to approximately $825,000, or 17% of net sales, in the three-month period ended June 30, 2017. For the six-month periods ended June 30, 2018 and June 30, 2017, general and administrative expenses were approximately $1,904,000, or 18% of net sales, and approximately $1,613,000, or 17% of net sales, respectively. Our general and administrative expenses have acclimated to a higher run-rate in 2018 primarily due to technology upgrades to key customer and delivery focused systems. 
In the three-month period ended June 30, 2018, our income from operations was approximately $86,000, representing an increase of approximately $733,000 compared to our loss from operations of approximately $647,000 in the three-month period ended June 30, 2017. In the six-month period ended June 30, 2018, our income from operations was approximately $177,000 representing an increase of approximately $993,000 compared to our loss from operations of $816,000 in the six-month period ended June 30, 2017. The increase in income in both the second quarter and first half of 2018 compared to the same periods in 2017 is due primarily to the non-recurring expense for separation packages for our two former senior executives.

The other $500,000 was a fully refundable amount which the Company returned to the payer in August 2017.

Critical Accounting Policies 
  Page 12 of 20 
a) Revenue Recognition 
In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued ASU 2014-09, “Revenue from Contracts with Customers” (Topic 606). ASC 606 requires the recognition of revenue when promised goods or services are transferred to customers in an amount that reflects the considerations to which the entity expects to be entitled to in exchange for those goods or services. On January 1, 2018, the Company adopted ASC 606 by using the modified retrospective method. The comparative information has not been recast and continues to be reported under the accounting standards in effect for those periods. The adoption did not have a material impact to the nature and timing of its revenues, condensed statements of operations, condensed statements cash flows and condensed balance sheets. The majority of the impact has been on sales returns and the impact has been deemed immaterial. 
Gas Detection and Environment Control Products

Gas Detection and Environment Control Services 
FieldServer Products 
FieldServer services consist of orders for custom development of protocol drivers. Generally, customers place orders for FieldServer products concurrently with their order for protocol drivers. However, if custom development of the protocol driver is required, the product order is not processed until development of the protocol driver is complete. The driver development involves further research after receipt of order, preparation of a scope document to be approved by the customer and then engineering time to write, test and release the driver program. When development of the driver is complete the customer is notified and can proceed with a FieldServer product. Revenues for protocol driver development are recognized at a point in time when the control of the product is transferred to the customer generally occurring upon shipment or delivery of the related product that includes the developed protocol drivers (as noted in FieldServer Products above). 
Discounts and Allowances 
Discounts are applied at time of order entry and sales are processed at net pricing. No allowances are offered to customers. 
b) Contract Costs 
  Page 14 of 20 
c) Warranty 
The Company provides a warranty on all products sold for a period of two years after the date of shipment. Warranty issues are usually resolved with repair or replacement of the product. This standard warranty is assurance type warranty and does not offer any services in addition to the assurance that the product will continue working as specified. Therefore, warranties are not considered separate performance obligations in the arrangement. Instead, estimated future warranty obligations related to products are provided by charges to condensed statements of operations in the period in which the related revenue is recognized. 
The Company records accounts receivable when it has an unconditional right to consideration. Contract liabilities are recorded when cash payments are received or due in advance of performance. Contract liabilities consist of only advance payments, where the Company has unsatisfied performance obligations. Contract liabilities are classified as deferred revenue and included within “Other current liabilities” on the condensed balance sheets. At times, billing may occur subsequent to revenue recognition, resulting in an unbilled receivable which represents a contract asset. The Company does not have any unbilled receivable on the condensed balance sheets. 
Payment terms vary by customer. The time between invoicing and when payment is due is not significant. For certain products or services and customer types, payment is required before the products or services are delivered to the customer. 
There were no significant changes in estimates during the period that would affect the contract balances. The amounts of revenue recognized during the six months ended June 30, 2018 and June 30, 2017 from the opening deferred revenue balances were $1,133 and $2,708, respectively. For the periods ended June 30, 2018, and June 30, 2017 no impairment losses related to contract balances were recognized in the condensed statement of operations. 
e) Disaggregation of Revenue 
f) Shipping and Handling 
g) Remaining Performance Obligations 
h) Accounts Receivable and Related Allowances 
We maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts which is analyzed on a periodic basis to determine whether it is adequate. We believe that we have demonstrated the ability to make reasonable and reliable estimates of allowances for doubtful accounts based on significant historical experience. 
i) Inventories 
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value, cost being determined on the first-in, first-out method. The Company uses an Enterprise Requirements Planning (“ERP”) software system which provides data upon which management relies to determine inventory trends and identify excesses. The carrying value of inventory is reduced to net realizable value for slow moving and obsolete items based on historical experience and current product demand. We evaluate the carrying value of inventory quarterly. The adequacy of carrying amounts is dependent upon management’s ability to forecast demands accurately, manage product changes efficiently, and interpret the data provided by the ERP system.
