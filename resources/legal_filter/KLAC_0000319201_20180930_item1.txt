NOTE 1 – BASIS OF PRESENTATION



Basis of Presentation.
The condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared by the Company pursuant to the rules and regulations of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”).
Certain information and footnote disclosures normally included in financial statements prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America have been condensed or omitted pursuant to such rules and regulations.
In the opinion of management, the unaudited interim financial statements reflect all adjustments (consisting only of normal, recurring adjustments) necessary for a fair presentation of the financial position, results of operations, comprehensive income, and cash flows for the periods indicated.
These financial statements and notes, however, should be read in conjunction with Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” included in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2018, filed with the SEC on August 6, 2018.
The condensed consolidated financial statements include the accounts of KLA-Tencor and its majority-owned subsidiaries.
All significant intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated.
The results of operations for the three months ended September 30, 2018 are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for any other interim period or for the full fiscal year ending June 30, 2019.
Certain reclassifications have been made to the prior year’s Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements to conform to the current year presentation.
The reclassifications did not have material effects on the prior year’s Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets, Statements of Operations, Comprehensive Income and Cash Flows.
Proposed Merger with Orbotech, Ltd. 



On March 18, 2018, the Company entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the “Merger Agreement”) with Orbotech, Ltd. (“Orbotech”) under which KLA-Tencor will acquire Orbotech for $38.86 in cash and 0.25 of a share of KLA-Tencor common stock in exchange for each ordinary share of Orbotech, which at the time of announcement valued Orbotech at $3.2 billion in enterprise value.
The merger contemplated by the Merger Agreement (the “Orbotech Merger”) is subject to receipt of required regulatory approvals and satisfaction of the other customary closing conditions.
Management Estimates.
Actual results could differ from those estimates.
Comparability.
Effective on the first day of fiscal 2019, the Company adopted Accounting Standards Update 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (“ASC 606”).
Prior periods were not retrospectively restated, and accordingly, the consolidated balance sheet as of June 30, 2018, and the condensed consolidated statements of operations for the three months ended September 30, 2017 were prepared using accounting standards that were different than those in effect for the three months ended September 30, 2018.
Recent Accounting Pronouncements.
Recently Adopted



In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued ASC 606, which supersedes the guidance in ASC 605, Revenue Recognition (“ASC 605”).
Under ASC 606, revenue is recognized when a customer obtains control of promised goods or services in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services.
In addition, ASC 606 requires enhanced disclosures, including disclosure of the nature, amount, timing, and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from contracts with customers.
The Company adopted the ASC 606 as of July 1, 2018, using the modified retrospective transition approach.
For additional details, refer to Note 2 “Revenue.”

In January 2016, the FASB issued an accounting standard update that changes the accounting for financial instruments primarily related to equity investments (other than those accounted for under the equity method of accounting or those that result in consolidation of the investee), financial liabilities under the fair value option, and the presentation and disclosure requirements for financial instruments.
The Company adopted this update beginning in the first quarter of its fiscal year ending June 30, 2019 on a prospective basis and the adoption had no material impact on its condensed consolidated financial statements.
In October 2016, the FASB issued an accounting standard update to recognize the income tax consequences of intra-entity transfers of assets other than inventory when they occur.
This eliminates the exception to postpone recognition until the asset has been sold to an outside party.
The Company adopted this update beginning in the first quarter of its fiscal year ending June 30, 2019 on a modified retrospective basis and the adoption had no material impact on its condensed consolidated financial statements.
In January 2017, the FASB issued an accounting standard on clarifying the definition of a business, with the objective of adding guidance to assist entities with evaluating whether transactions should be accounted for as acquisitions (or disposals) of assets or businesses.
The Company adopted this update beginning in the first quarter of its fiscal year ending June 30, 2019 on a prospective basis.
In January 2017, the FASB issued an accounting standard update to simplify the subsequent measurement of goodwill by removing the second step of the two-step impairment test, which requires an entity to determine the fair value of assets and liabilities similar to what is required in a purchase price allocation.
Under the update, goodwill impairment will be calculated as the amount by which a reporting unit’s carrying value exceeds its fair value.
The Company early adopted this update in the first quarter of its fiscal year ending June 30, 2019 on a prospective basis.
In March 2017, the FASB issued an accounting standard update that changes the statements of operation classification of net periodic benefit cost related to defined benefit pension and/or other post-retirement benefit plans.
Under the update, employers will present the service cost component of net periodic benefit cost in the same statements of operations line item(s) as other employee compensation costs arising from services rendered during the period.
Only the service cost component will be eligible for capitalization in assets.
Employers will present the other components of the net periodic benefit costs separately from the line item(s) that includes the service cost and outside of any subtotal of operating income, if one is presented.
The Company adopted this update beginning in the first quarter of its fiscal year ending June 30, 2019 on a retrospective basis and the adoption had no material impact on its condensed consolidated financial statements.
In May 2017, the FASB issued an accounting standard update regarding stock compensation that provides guidance about which changes to the terms and conditions of a share-based payment award require an entity to apply modification accounting in order to reduce diversity in practice and reduce complexity.
The Company adopted this update beginning in the first quarter of its fiscal year ending June 30, 2019 on a prospective basis and the adoption had no material impact on its condensed consolidated financial statements.
The Company early adopted this update in the first quarter of its fiscal year ending June 30, 2019 and applied this update in the period of adoption.
As a result of the adoption, the Company made a reclassification from AOCI to beginning retained earnings of approximately $10.7 million related to the stranded tax effects.
Updates Not Yet Effective



In February 2016, the FASB issued an accounting standard update which amends the existing accounting standards for leases.
Consistent with current guidance, the recognition, measurement, and presentation of expenses and cash flows arising from a lease by a lessee primarily will depend on its classification.
Under the new guidance, a lessee will be required to recognize assets and liabilities for all leases with lease terms of more than 12 months using a modified retrospective transition method.
In July 2018, the FASB issued an amendment to the standard which provide the Company an option to apply the practical expedient allowed in the standard retrospectively with the cumulative effect recognized as of the date of adoption.
The update is effective for the Company beginning in the first quarter of its fiscal year ending June 30, 2020.
Early adoption is permitted.
The Company is currently evaluating the impact of this accounting standard update on its condensed consolidated financial statements.

In June 2016, the FASB issued an accounting standard update that changes the accounting for recognizing impairments of financial assets.
Under the update, credit losses for certain types of financial instruments will be estimated based on expected losses.
The update also modifies the impairment models for available-for-sale debt securities and for purchased financial assets with credit deterioration since their origination.
The update is effective for the Company beginning in the first quarter of its fiscal year ending June 30, 2021, with early adoption permitted starting in the first quarter of fiscal year ending June 30, 2020.
The Company is currently evaluating the impact of this accounting standard update on its condensed consolidated financial statements.
In August 2017, the FASB issued an accounting standard update to hedge accounting to better align the Company’s risk management activities by refining financial and non-financial hedging strategy eligibilities.
This update also amends the presentation and disclosure requirements to increase transparency to better understand an entity’s risk exposures and how hedging strategies are used to manage those exposures.
This standard update is effective for the Company beginning in the first quarter of its fiscal year ending June 30, 2020, and early adoption is permitted.
The Company is currently evaluating the impact of this accounting standard update on its condensed consolidated financial statements.
In August 2018, the FASB issued an accounting standard update which modifies the existing accounting standards for fair value measurement disclosure.
This update eliminates the amount of and reasons for transfers between level 1 and level 2 of the fair value hierarchy, and the policy for timing of transfers between levels.
This standard update is effective for the Company beginning in the first quarter of its fiscal year ending June 30, 2021, and early adoption is permitted.
The Company is currently evaluating the impact of this accounting standard update on its condensed consolidated financial statements.
In August 2018, the FASB issued an accounting standard update to amend the disclosure requirements related to defined benefit pension and other post-retirement plans.
Some of the changes include adding a disclosure requirement for significant gains and losses related to changes in the benefit obligation for the period, and removing the amounts in accumulated other comprehensive income expected to be recognized as components of net periodic benefit cost over the next fiscal year.
This standard update is effective for the Company for the fiscal year ending June 30, 2021, and early adoption is permitted.
The Company is currently evaluating the impact of this accounting standard update on its condensed consolidated financial statements.
In August 2018, the FASB issued an accounting standard update to align the requirements for capitalizing implementation costs incurred in a cloud computing arrangement that is a service contract with the requirements for capitalizing implementation costs incurred to develop or obtain internal-use software.
The guidance clarifies which costs should be capitalized including the cost to acquire the license and the related implementation costs.
This standard update is effective for the Company beginning in the first quarter of its fiscal year ending June 30, 2021, with an option to be adopted either prospectively or retrospectively.
Early adoption is permitted.
The Company is currently evaluating the impact of this accounting standard update on its condensed consolidated financial statements.
Significant Accounting Policies.
Except for the accounting policy for revenue recognition, which was updated as a result of adopting ASC 606, and Global Intangible Low-Taxed Income (“GILTI”), there have been no material changes to our significant accounting policies in Note 1 “Description of Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies,” of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2018.
Revenue Recognition.
The Company primarily derives revenue from the sale of process control and yield management solutions for the semiconductor and related nanoelectronics industries, maintenance and support of all these products, installation and training services and the sale of spare parts.
The Company’s solutions provide a comprehensive portfolio of inspection, metrology and data analytics products, which are accompanied by a flexible portfolio of services to enable its customers to maintain the performance and productivity of the solutions purchased.
The Company’s solutions are generally not sold with a right of return, nor has the Company experienced significant returns from or refunds to its customers.
The Company accounts for a contract with a customer when there is approval and commitment from both parties, the rights of the parties are identified, payment terms are identified, the contract has commercial substance and collectibility of consideration is probable.
The Company’s revenues are measured based on consideration stipulated in the arrangement with each customer, net of any sales incentives and amounts collected on behalf of third parties, such as sales taxes.
The revenues are recognized as separate performance obligations that are satisfied by transferring control of the product or service to the customer.
9

The Company’s arrangements with its customers include various combinations of products and services, which are generally capable of being distinct and accounted for as separate performance obligations.
A product or service is considered distinct if it is separately identifiable from other deliverables in the arrangement and if a customer can benefit from it on its own or with other resources that are readily available to the customer.
The transaction consideration, including any sales incentives, is allocated between separate performance obligations of an arrangement based on the stand-alone selling prices (“SSP”) for each distinct product or service.
From time to time, the Company’s contracts are modified to account for additional, or to change existing, performance obligations.
The Company’s contract modifications are generally accounted for prospectively.
Product revenue



The Company recognizes revenue from product sales at a point in time when the Company has satisfied its performance obligation by transferring control of the product to the customer.
The Company uses judgment to evaluate whether the control has transferred by considering several indicators, including:



•whether the Company has a present right to payment;



•the customer has legal title;



•the customer has physical possession;



•the customer has significant risk and rewards of ownership; and



•the customer has accepted the product, or whether customer acceptance is considered a formality based on history of acceptance of similar products (for example, when the customer has previously accepted the same tool, with the same specifications, and when we can objectively demonstrate that the tool meets all of the required acceptance criteria, and when the installation of the system is deemed perfunctory).
Not all of the indicators need to be met for the Company to conclude that control has transferred to the customer.
In circumstances in which revenue is recognized prior to the product acceptance, the portion of revenue associated with its performance obligations to install product is deferred and recognized upon acceptance.
The Company enters into volume purchase agreements with some of its customers.
The Company adjusts the transaction consideration for estimated credits earned by its customers for such incentives.
These credits are estimated based upon the forecasted and actual product sales for any given period, and agreed-upon incentive rate.
The estimate is updated at each reporting period.
The Company offers perpetual and term licenses for defects and data analysis software.
The primary difference between perpetual and term licenses is the duration over which the customer can benefits from the use of the software, while the functionality and the features of the software are the same.
The software is generally bundled with the post-contract customer support (“PCS”), which includes unspecified software updates that are made available throughout the entire term of the arrangement.
Revenue from software licenses is recognized at a point in time, when the software is made available to the customer.
Revenue from PCS is deferred at contract inception and recognized ratably over the service period, or as services are performed.
Services and spare parts revenue



The majority of product sales include a standard 12-month warranty that is not separately paid for by the customers.
The customers may also purchase extended warranty for periods beyond the initial year as part of the initial product sale.
The Company has concluded that the standard 12-month warranty as well as any extended warranty periods included in the initial product sales are separate performance obligations.
The estimated fair value of warranty services is deferred and recognized ratably as revenue over the warranty period, as the customer simultaneously receives and consumes the benefits of warranty services provided by the Company.
Additionally, the Company offers product maintenance and support services, which the customer may purchase separately from the standard and extended warranty offered as part of the initial product sale.
Revenue from separately negotiated maintenance and support service contracts is also recognized over time based on the terms of the applicable service period.
Revenue from services performed in the absence of a maintenance contract, including training revenue, is recognized when the related services are performed.
The Company also sells spare parts, revenue from which is recognized when control over the spare parts is transferred to the customer.
10

Installation services include connecting and validating configuration of the product.
In addition, several testing protocols are completed to confirm the equipment is performing to customer specifications.
Revenue from product installation are deferred and recognized at a point in time, once installation is complete.
Significant Judgments



 The Company’s contracts with its customers often include promises to transfer multiple products and services.
Each product and service is generally capable of being distinct and represents a separate performance obligation.
Determining the SSP for each distinct performance obligation and allocation of consideration from an arrangement to the individual performance obligations and the appropriate timing of revenue recognition are significant judgments with respect to these arrangements.
The Company typically estimates the SSP of products and services based on observable transactions when the products and services are sold on a standalone basis and those prices fall within a reasonable range.
The Company typically has more than one SSP for individual products and services due to the stratification of these products by customers and circumstances.
In these instances, the Company uses information such as the size of the customer, geographic region, as well as customization of the products in determining the SSP.
In instances where the SSP is not directly observable, the Company determines the SSP using information that includes market conditions, entity-specific factors, including discounting strategies, information about the customer or class of customer that is reasonably available and other observable inputs.
Although the products are generally not sold with a right of return, the Company may provide other credits or sales incentives, which are accounted for either as variable consideration or material right, depending on the specific terms and conditions of the arrangement.
These credits and incentives are estimated at contract inception and updated at the end of each reporting period if and when additional information becomes available.
As outlined above, the Company uses judgment to evaluate whether or not the customer has obtained control of the product and considers the several indicators in evaluating whether or not control has transferred to the customer.
Not all of the indicators need to be met for the Company to conclude that control has transferred to the customer.
Contract Assets/Liabilities 



The timing of revenue recognition, billings and cash collections may result in accounts receivable, contract assets, and contract liabilities (deferred revenue) on the Company’s condensed consolidated balance sheet.
A receivable is recorded in the period the Company delivers products or provides services when the Company has an unconditional right to payment.
Contract assets primarily relate to the value of products and services transferred to the customer for which the right to payment is not just dependent on the passage of time.
Contract assets are transferred to receivable when rights to payment become unconditional.
A contract liability is recognized when the Company receives payment or has an unconditional right to payment in advance of the satisfaction of performance.
The contract liabilities represent (1) Deferred product revenue relates to the value of products that have been shipped and billed to customers and for which the control has not been transferred to the customers, and (2) Deferred service revenue, which is recorded when the Company receives consideration, or such consideration is unconditionally due, from a customer prior to transferring services to the customer under the terms of a sales contract.
Deferred service revenue typically results from warranty services, and maintenance and other service contracts.
Contract assets and liabilities related to rights and obligations in a contract are recorded net in the condensed consolidated balance sheets.
Upon the adoption of ASC 606, deferred costs of revenue is included in other current assets while under the legacy guidance deferred costs of revenue was included in deferred system profit.
NOTE 2 – REVENUE



New Revenue Accounting Standard



Method and Impact of Adoption



The Company adopted ASC 606 on July 1, 2018 using the modified retrospective transition approach for all contracts completed and not completed as of the date of adoption.
Under the modified retrospective transition approach, periods prior to the adoption date were not adjusted and continue to be reported in accordance with ASC 605.
A cumulative effect of applying ASC 606 was recorded to beginning retained earnings to reflect the impact of all existing arrangements under ASC 606.
11

The net decrease to retained earnings of $21.0 million as of July 1, 2018 due to the adoption of ASC 606 was primarily related to the following items:[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]



•An increase in retained earnings of approximately $26.0 million as a result of a change in the timing of transfer of control over products to the customers.
Revenue under ASC 606 is expected to be recognized earlier than it would have been under legacy guidance primarily due to the Company’s assessment of timing of transfer of control.
The following table summarizes the effects of adopting ASC 606 on the Company’s condensed consolidated balance sheet as of September 30, 2018:



[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]



 The following table summarizes the effects of adopting ASC 606 on the Company’s condensed consolidated statements of operations for the three months ended September 30, 2018:



[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]



 12

Revenue recognized under ASC 606 is higher than it would have been under legacy guidance.
This is primarily driven by the changes related to the accounting of standard warranty and our assessment of transfer of control.
Under ASC 606, revenue is recognized earlier than it would have been recognized under legacy guidance primarily due to the Company's assessment of timing of transfer of control.
Additionally, the Company renders standard warranty coverage on its products for 12 months, providing labor and parts necessary to repair and maintain the products during the warranty period.
Prior to adoption of ASC 606, the Company accounted for the estimated warranty cost as a charge to costs of sales when revenue was recognized.
Upon adoption of ASC 606, the standard warranty for the majority of products is recognized as a separate performance obligation.
Contract Balances



[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]



The Company’s payment terms and conditions vary by contract type, although terms generally include a requirement of payment of 70% to 90% of total contract consideration within 30 to 60 days of shipment, with the remainder payable within 30 days of acceptance.
In instances where the timing of revenue recognition differs from the timing of invoicing, the Company has determined that its contracts generally do not include a significant financing component.
The change in contract assets during the three months ended September 30, 2018 is mainly due to $13.7 million of revenue recognized in excess of the amounts billed to the customers, partially offset by $13.0 million of contract assets reclassified to accounts receivable as the Company’s right to consideration for these contract assets became unconditional.
Contract assets are included in Other current assets on the Company's condensed consolidated balance sheet.
During the three months ended September 30, 2018, the Company recognized revenue of $279.0 million that was included in contract liabilities as of July 1, 2018.
This was partially offset by the value of products and services billed to customers for which control of the products and service has not transferred to the customers.
Contract liabilities are included in current and non-current liabilities on the Company's condensed consolidated balance sheets.
Remaining Performance Obligations



As of September 30, 2018, the Company had $1.41 billion of remaining performance obligations, which represents the Company’s obligation to deliver products and services, and consists primarily of sales orders where written customer requests have been received.
The Company expects to recognize approximately 5% to 15% of these performance obligations as revenue beyond the next twelve months, subject to risk of delays, pushouts, and cancellation by the customer, usually with limited or no penalties.
Refer to Note 17 “Segment Reporting and Geographic Information” for further information, including revenue by geographic region as well as significant product and service offering.
Practical expedient



The Company applies the following practical expedients:



•The Company accounts for shipping and handling costs as activities to fulfill the promise to transfer the goods, instead of a promised service to its customer.
•The Company has elected to not adjust the promised amount of consideration for the effects of a significant financing component as the Company expects, at contract inception, that the period between when the entity transfers a promised good or service to a customer and when the customer pays for that good or service will generally be one year or less.
•The Company has elected to adopt the practical expedient for contract costs, specifically in relation to incremental costs of obtaining a contract.
13

•The Company has elected to adopt the practical expedient for contract modifications, specifically to reflect the aggregate effect of all modifications that occur before July 1, 2018 in determining the transaction price, identifying the satisfied and unsatisfied performance obligations, and allocating the transaction price to the performance obligations.
NOTE 3 – FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS



The Company’s financial assets and liabilities are measured and recorded at fair value, except for its debt and certain equity investments in privately-held companies.
Prior to July 1, 2018, the equity investments were generally accounted for under the cost method of accounting and were periodically assessed for other-than-temporary impairment when an event or circumstance indicated that an other-than-temporary decline in value may have occurred.
Effective July 1, 2018, equity investments without a readily available fair value are accounted for using the measurement alternative.
The measurement alternative is calculated as cost minus impairment, if any, plus or minus changes resulting from observable price changes.
The Company’s non-financial assets, such as goodwill, intangible assets, and land, property and equipment, are recorded at cost and are assessed for impairment when an event or circumstance indicates that an other-than-temporary decline in value may have occurred.
Fair Value of Financial Instruments.
The Company has evaluated the estimated fair value of financial instruments using available market information and valuations as provided by third-party sources.
The use of different market assumptions and/or estimation methodologies could have a significant effect on the estimated fair value amounts.
The fair value of the Company’s cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable and other current assets and liabilities approximate their carrying amounts due to the relatively short maturity of these items.
Fair Value Hierarchy.
The authoritative guidance for fair value measurements establishes a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value.
The hierarchy gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level 1 measurements) and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs (Level 3 measurements).
The three levels of the fair value hierarchy are described below:



Level 1 Valuations based on quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the entity has the ability to access.
Level 2 Valuations based on quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities, quoted prices in markets that are not active, or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities.
Level 3 Valuations based on inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the fair value of the assets or liabilities.
A financial instrument’s level within the fair value hierarchy is based on the lowest level of any input that is significant to the fair value measurement.
As of September 30, 2018, the types of instruments valued based on quoted market prices in active markets included money market funds, certain U.S. Treasury securities and U.S. Government agency securities.
Such instruments are generally classified within Level 1 of the fair value hierarchy.
The types of instruments valued based on other observable inputs included corporate debt securities, sovereign securities, certain U.S. Treasury securities and U.S. Government agency securities.
The market inputs used to value these instruments generally consist of market yields, reported trades and broker/dealer quotes.
Such instruments are generally classified within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy.
The principal market in which the Company executes its foreign currency contracts is the institutional market in an over-the-counter environment with a relatively high level of price transparency.
The market participants generally are large financial institutions.
The Company’s foreign currency contracts’ valuation inputs are based on quoted prices and quoted pricing intervals from public data sources and do not involve management judgment.
These contracts are typically classified within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy.
The fair value of contingent consideration payable, which relates to the acquisitions of privately-held companies, was classified as Level 3 and estimated using significant inputs that were not observable in the market.

(1) Time deposits excluded from fair value measurements.
KLA-Tencor’s investment portfolio consists of both corporate and government securities that have a maximum maturity of three years.
The longer the duration of these securities, the more susceptible they are to changes in market interest rates and bond yields.
As yields increase, those securities with a lower yield-at-cost show a mark-to-market unrealized loss.
Most of the Company’s unrealized losses are due to changes in market interest rates and bond yields.
The Company believes that it has the ability to realize the full value of all of these investments upon maturity.
The following table summarizes the fair value and gross unrealized losses of the Company’s investments that were in an unrealized loss position as of the date indicated below: 



[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

(1) As of September 30, 2018, the amount of total gross unrealized losses related to investments that had been in a continuous loss position for 12 months or more was $7.3 million.
The contractual maturities of securities classified as available-for-sale, regardless of their classification on the Company’s Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet, as of the date indicated below were as follows:



[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]



Actual maturities may differ from contractual maturities because borrowers may have the right to call or prepay obligations with or without call or prepayment penalties.
Realized gains and losses on available-for-sale securities for the three months ended September 30, 2018 and 2017 were immaterial.
NOTE 6 - BUSINESS COMBINATIONS



During the three months ended September 30, 2018, the Company acquired certain assets and assumed certain liabilities of a privately-held company for a total purchase consideration of $4.1 million, which includes a promise to pay an additional consideration of up to $1.5 million contingent on the achievement of certain milestones.
As of September 30, 2018, the estimated fair value of the additional consideration was $1.5 million, which is classified as a current liability on the condensed consolidated balance sheet.
19

On July 11, 2018, the Company acquired the outstanding shares of a privately-held company for a total purchase consideration of $11.3 million, including the fair value of the promise to pay an additional consideration of up to $4.5 million contingent on the achievement of certain revenue milestones.
As of September 30, 2018, the estimated fair value of the additional consideration was $1.6 million, which is classified as a current liability on the condensed consolidated balance sheet.
The Company has included the financial results of the acquisitions completed during the first quarter of the fiscal year 2019 in its condensed consolidated financial statements from the date of acquisition.
These results were not individually or in aggregate material to our condensed consolidated financial statements.
For the fiscal year ended June 30, 2018, the Company acquired a product line from Keysight Technologies, Inc., a related party, for a total purchase consideration of $12.1 million, of which $5.2 million was allocated to goodwill based on the fair value at the acquisition date.

The Company has four reporting units: Wafer Inspection, Patterning, Global Service and Support (“GSS”), and Others.
The following table presents goodwill balances and the movements by reporting unit during the three months ended September 30, 2018:



[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]



The acquired goodwill during the three months ended September 30, 2018 resulted primarily from the acquisition of certain assets and liabilities of privately-held companies.
See Note 6 “Business Combinations” for additional details.
As of September 30, 2018, there have been no significant events or circumstances affecting the valuation of goodwill subsequent to the qualitative assessment performed in the third quarter of the fiscal year ended June 30, 2018.
For additional details, refer to Note 6 “Goodwill and Purchased Intangible Assets,” of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2018.
The next annual assessment of goodwill by reporting unit is scheduled to be performed in the third quarter of the fiscal year ending June 30, 2019.
Purchased Intangible Assets



The components of purchased intangible assets as of the dates indicated below were as follows:



[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]



Purchased intangible assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset or asset group may not be recoverable.
20

For the three months ended September 30, 2018 and 2017, amortization expense for purchased intangible assets was $1.4 million and $1.2 million, respectively.
The increase in the gross carrying value resulted primarily from the acquisition of certain assets and liabilities of privately-held companies.
See Note 6 “Business Combinations” for additional details.
Based on the purchased intangible assets recorded as of September 30, 2018, and assuming no subsequent additions to, or impairment of, the underlying assets, the remaining estimated annual amortization expense is expected to be as follows:

NOTE 8 – DEBT



The following table summarizes the debt of the Company as of September 30, 2018 and June 30, 2018:



[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]



__________________ 



(1)The effective interest rate disclosed above for this series of Senior Notes excludes the impact of the treasury rate lock hedge discussed below.
The effective interest rate including the impact of the treasury rate lock hedge was 4.626%.
As of September 30, 2018, future principal payments for the long-term debt are $250.0 million in fiscal year 2020; $500.0 million in fiscal year 2022; and $1.50 billion after fiscal year 2023.
Senior Notes: 



In November 2014, the Company issued $2.50 billion aggregate principal amount of senior, unsecured long-term notes (collectively referred to as “Senior Notes”).
The Company issued the Senior Notes as part of the leveraged recapitalization plan under which the proceeds from the Senior Notes in conjunction with the proceeds from the term loans and cash on hand were used (x) to fund a special cash dividend of $16.50 per share, aggregating to approximately $2.76 billion, (y) to redeem $750.0 million of Senior Notes, including associated redemption premiums, accrued interest and other fees and expenses and (z) for other general corporate purposes, including repurchases of shares pursuant to the Company’s stock repurchase program.
21

The interest rate specified for each series of the Senior Notes will be subject to adjustments from time to time if Moody’s Investor Service, Inc. (“Moody’s”) or Standard & Poor’s Ratings Services (“S&P”) or, under certain circumstances, a substitute rating agency selected by us as a replacement for Moody’s or S&P, as the case may be (a “Substitute Rating Agency”), downgrades (or subsequently upgrades) its rating assigned to the respective series of Senior Notes such that the adjusted rating is below investment grade.
If the adjusted rating of any series of Senior Notes from Moody’s (or, if applicable, any Substitute Rating Agency) is decreased to Ba1, Ba2, Ba3 or B1 or below, the stated interest rate on such series of Senior Notes as noted above will increase by 25 bps, 50 bps, 75 bps or 100 bps, respectively (“bps” refers to Basis Points and 1% is equal to 100 bps).
If the rating of any series of Senior Notes from S&P (or, if applicable, any Substitute Rating Agency) with respect to such series of Senior Notes is decreased to BB+, BB, BB- or B+ or below, the stated interest rate on such series of Senior Notes as noted above will increase by 25 bps, 50 bps, 75 bps or 100 bps, respectively.
The interest rates on any series of Senior Notes will permanently cease to be subject to any adjustment (notwithstanding any subsequent decrease in the ratings by any of Moody’s, S&P and, if applicable, any Substitute Rating Agency) if such series of Senior Notes becomes rated “Baa1” (or its equivalent) or higher by Moody’s (or, if applicable, any Substitute Rating Agency) and “BBB+” (or its equivalent) or higher by S&P (or, if applicable, any Substitute Rating Agency), or one of those ratings if rated by only one of Moody’s, S&P and, if applicable, any Substitute Rating Agency, in each case with a stable or positive outlook.
In October 2014, the Company entered into a series of forward contracts to lock the 10-year treasury rate (“benchmark rate”) on a portion of the Senior Notes with a notional amount of $1.00 billion in aggregate.
For additional details, refer to Note 15, “Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities.” 



The original discount on the Senior Notes amounted to $4.0 million and is being amortized over the life of the debt.
Interest is payable semi-annually on May 1 and November 1 of each year.
The debt indenture (the “Indenture”) includes covenants that limit the Company’s ability to grant liens on its facilities and enter into sale and leaseback transactions, subject to certain allowances under which certain sale and leaseback transactions are not restricted.
In certain circumstances involving a change of control followed by a downgrade of the rating of a series of Senior Notes by at least two of Moody’s, S&P and Fitch Inc., unless the Company has exercised its right to redeem the Senior Notes of such series, the Company will be required to make an offer to repurchase all or, at the holder’s option, any part, of each holder’s Senior Notes of that series pursuant to the offer described below (the “Change of Control Offer”).
In the Change of Control Offer, the Company will be required to offer payment in cash equal to 101% of the aggregate principal amount of Senior Notes repurchased plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, on the Senior Notes repurchased, up to, but not including, the date of repurchase.
Based on the trading prices of the Senior Notes on the applicable dates, the fair value of the Senior Notes as of September 30, 2018 and June 30, 2018 was approximately $2.31 billion and $2.33 billion, respectively.
While the Senior Notes are recorded at cost, the fair value of the long-term debt was determined based on quoted prices in markets that are not active; accordingly, the long-term debt is categorized as Level 2 for purposes of the fair value measurement hierarchy.
As of September 30, 2018, the Company was in compliance with all of its covenants under the Indenture associated with the Senior Notes.
Revolving Credit Facility:



In November 2017, the Company entered into a Credit Agreement (the “Credit Agreement”) providing for a $750.0 million five-year unsecured Revolving Credit Facility (the “Revolving Credit Facility”), which replaced its prior Credit Facility.
Subject to the terms of the Credit Agreement, the Revolving Credit Facility may be increased in an amount up to $250.0 million in the aggregate.
The Company may borrow, repay and reborrow funds under the Revolving Credit Facility until its maturity on November 30, 2022 (the “Maturity Date”), at which time such Revolving Credit Facility will terminate, and all outstanding loans under such facility, together with all accrued and unpaid interest, must be repaid.
The Company may prepay outstanding borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility at any time without a prepayment penalty.
Borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility will bear interest, at the Company’s option, at either: (i) the Alternative Base Rate (“ABR”) plus a spread, which ranges from 0 bps to 75 bps, or (ii) the London Interbank Offered Rate (“LIBOR”) plus a spread, which ranges from 100 bps to 175 bps.
The spreads under ABR and LIBOR are subject to adjustment in conjunction with credit rating downgrades or upgrades.
The Company is also obligated to pay an annual commitment fee on the daily undrawn balance of the Revolving Credit Facility, which ranges from 10 bps to 25 bps, subject to an adjustment in conjunction with changes to the Company’s credit rating.
As of September 30, 2018, the Company pays an annual commitment fee of 12.5 bps on the daily undrawn balance of the Revolving Credit Facility.
22

The Revolving Credit Facility requires the Company to maintain an interest expense coverage ratio as described in the Credit Agreement, on a quarterly basis, covering the trailing four consecutive fiscal quarters of no less than 3.50 to 1.00.
In addition, the Company is required to maintain the maximum leverage ratio as described in the Credit Agreement, on a quarterly basis of 3.00 to 1.00, covering the trailing four consecutive fiscal quarters for each fiscal quarter, which can be increased to 4.00 to 1.00 for a period of time in connection with a material acquisition or a series of material acquisitions.
The Company was in compliance with all covenants under the Credit Agreement as of September 30, 2018 and had no outstanding borrowings under the unfunded Revolving Credit Facility.
NOTE 9 – EQUITY AND LONG-TERM INCENTIVE COMPENSATION PLANS



Equity Incentive Program 



As of September 30, 2018, the Company had two equity incentive plans under which the Company was able to issue equity incentive awards, such as restricted stock units and stock options, to its employees, consultants and members of its Board of Directors: the 2004 Equity Incentive Plan (the “2004 Plan”) and the 1998 Director Plan (the “Outside Director Plan”) with 1.4 million and 1.7 million shares available for issuance, respectively.
Equity Incentive Plans - General Information



The following table summarizes the combined activity under the Company’s equity incentive plans for the indicated periods:



[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]



__________________ [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED][DATA_TABLE_REMOVED][DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]



The fair value of stock-based awards is measured at the grant date and is recognized as an expense over the employee’s requisite service period.
For restricted stock units granted without “dividend equivalent” rights, fair value is calculated using the closing price of the Company’s common stock on the grant date, adjusted to exclude the present value of dividends which are not accrued on those restricted stock units.
The fair value for restricted stock units granted with “dividend equivalent” rights is determined using the closing price of the Company’s common stock on the grant date.
As of September 30, 2018, the Company accrued $4.8 million of dividends payable, which included both a special cash dividend and regular quarterly cash dividends for the unvested restricted stock units outstanding as of the dividend record date.
The fair value for purchase rights under the Company’s Employee Stock Purchase Plan is determined using a Black-Scholes model.
23

The following table shows pre-tax stock-based compensation expense for the indicated periods:

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]



__________________ [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED][DATA_TABLE_REMOVED][DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]



The restricted stock units granted by the Company generally vest (a) with respect to awards with only service-based vesting criteria, in three or four equal installments and (b) with respect to awards with both performance-based and service-based vesting criteria, in two equal installments on the third and fourth anniversaries of the grant date, in each case subject to the recipient remaining employed by the Company as of the applicable vesting date.
The restricted stock units granted to the independent members of the Board of Directors' vest annually.
24

The following table shows the weighted-average grant date fair value per unit for the restricted stock units granted and the restricted stock units vested and tax benefits realized by the Company in connection with vested and released restricted stock units for the indicated periods: 



[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]



As of September 30, 2018, the unrecognized stock-based compensation expense balance related to restricted stock units was $128.4 million, excluding the impact of estimated forfeitures, and will be recognized over a weighted-average remaining contractual term and an estimated weighted-average amortization period of 1.7 years.
The intrinsic value of outstanding restricted stock units as of September 30, 2018 was $179.2 million.
Cash-Based Long-Term Incentive Compensation



The Company has adopted a cash-based long-term incentive (“Cash LTI Plan”) program for many of its employees as part of the Company’s employee compensation program.
During the three months ended September 30, 2018 and 2017, the Company approved Cash LTI awards of $2.8 million and $2.1 million, respectively.
Cash LTI awards issued to employees under the Cash LTI Plan will vest in three or four equal installments, with one-third or one-fourth of the aggregate amount of the Cash LTI award vesting on each anniversary of the grant date over a three or four-year period.
In order to receive payments under a Cash LTI award, participants must remain employed by the Company as of the applicable award vesting date.
Executives and non-employee Board of Directors' members are not participating in this program.
During the three months ended September 30, 2018 and 2017, the Company recognized $15.2 million and $14.8 million, respectively, in compensation expense under the Cash LTI Plan.
As of September 30, 2018, the unrecognized compensation balance (excluding the impact of estimated forfeitures) related to the Cash LTI Plan was $116.4 million.
Employee Stock Purchase Plan



KLA-Tencor’s Employee Stock Purchase Plan (“ESPP”) provides, effective January 2, 2018, that eligible employees may contribute up to 15% of their eligible earnings toward the semi-annual purchase of KLA-Tencor’s common stock.
Prior to January 2, 2018, eligible employees could contribute up to 10% of their eligible earnings.
The ESPP is qualified under Section 423 of the Internal Revenue Code.
The employee’s purchase price is derived from a formula based on the closing price of the common stock on the first day of the offering period versus the closing price on the date of purchase (or, if not a trading day, on the immediately preceding trading day).
The offering period (or length of the look-back period) under the ESPP has a duration of six months, and the purchase price with respect to each offering period beginning on or after such date is, until otherwise amended, equal to 85% of the lesser of (i) the fair market value of the Company’s common stock at the commencement of the applicable six-month offering period or (ii) the fair market value of the Company’s common stock on the purchase date.
The Company estimates the fair value of purchase rights under the ESPP using a Black-Scholes model.
The fair value of each purchase right under the ESPP was estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes model and the straight-line attribution approach with the following weighted-average assumptions: 



[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]



 25

The following table shows the tax benefits realized by the Company in connection with the disqualifying dispositions of shares purchased under the ESPP and the weighted-average fair value per share for the indicated periods: 



[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]



The ESPP shares are replenished annually on the first day of each fiscal year by virtue of an evergreen provision.
The provision allows for share replenishment equal to the lesser of 2.0 million shares or the number of shares which KLA-Tencor estimates will be required to be issued under the ESPP during the forthcoming fiscal year.
As of September 30, 2018, a total of 2.0 million shares were reserved and available for issuance under the ESPP.
Quarterly cash dividends



On August 2, 2018, the Company’s Board of Directors declared a regular quarterly cash dividend of $0.75 per share on the outstanding shares of the Company’s common stock, which was paid on August 31, 2018 to the stockholders of record as of the close of business on August 15, 2018.
The total amount of regular quarterly cash dividends and dividend equivalents paid by the Company during the three months ended September 30, 2018 and 2017 was $119.9 million and $94.1 million, respectively.
The amount of accrued dividends payable for regular quarterly cash dividends on unvested restricted stock units with dividend equivalent rights as of September 30, 2018 and June 30, 2018 was $4.8 million and $6.7 million, respectively.
These accrued cash dividends will be paid upon vesting of the underlying restricted stock units.
Special cash dividend



On November 19, 2014, the Company’s Board of Directors declared a special cash dividend of $16.50 per share on our outstanding common stock, which was paid on December 9, 2014 to the stockholders of record as of the close of business on December 1, 2014.
The declaration and payment of the special cash dividend was part of the Company’s leveraged recapitalization transaction under which the special cash dividend was financed through a combination of existing cash and proceeds from the debt financing disclosed in Note 8 “Debt” that was completed during the three months ended December 31, 2014.
As of the declaration date, the total amount of the special cash dividend accrued by the Company was approximately $2.76 billion, substantially all of which was paid out during the three months ended December 31, 2014, except for the aggregate special cash dividend of $43.0 million that was accrued for the unvested restricted stock units.
As of September 30, 2018 and June 30, 2018, the Company had a total of $37.5 thousand and $2.8 million, respectively, of accrued dividends payable for the special cash dividend with respect to outstanding unvested restricted stock units, which will be paid when such underlying unvested restricted stock units vest.
During the three months ended September 30, 2018 and 2017, the total special cash dividends paid with respect to vested restricted stock units were $2.8 million and $6.2 million, respectively.
NOTE 10 – STOCK REPURCHASE PROGRAM 



The Company’s Board of Directors has authorized a program which permits the Company to repurchase up to $1.00 billion of its common stock, or up to $2.00 billion if the Orbotech Merger closes.
The intent of this program is to offset the dilution from KLA-Tencor’s equity incentive plans, employee stock purchase plan, the issuance of shares in the merger involving Orbotech, as well as to return excess cash to the Company’s stockholders.
Subject to market conditions, applicable legal requirements and other factors, the repurchases were made in the open market in compliance with applicable securities laws, including the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and the rules promulgated thereunder, such as Rule 10b-18 and Rule 10b5-1.
This stock repurchase program has no expiration date and may be suspended at any time.
As of September 30, 2018, an aggregate of approximately $654.1 million was available for repurchase under the Company’s repurchase program.
Share repurchases for the indicated periods (based on the trade date of the applicable repurchase) were as follows:



[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]



 26

As of September 30, 2018, the Company had repurchased 0.1 million shares for $7.8 million, which repurchases had not settled prior to September 30, 2018.
The amount was recorded as a component of other current liabilities for the period presented.
NOTE 11 – NET INCOME PER SHARE



Basic net income per share is calculated by dividing net income available to common stockholders by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during the period.
Diluted net income per share is calculated by using the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during the period, increased to include the number of additional shares of common stock that would have been outstanding if the shares of common stock underlying the Company’s outstanding dilutive restricted stock units had been issued.
The dilutive effect of outstanding restricted stock units is reflected in diluted net income per share by application of the treasury stock method.
The following table sets forth the computation of basic and diluted net income per share:



[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]



NOTE 12 – INCOME TAXES



The following table provides details of income taxes: 



[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]



The Company’s effective tax rate during the three months ended September 30, 2018 was impacted by the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the “Act”), which was enacted into law on December 22, 2017.
The Company has not fully completed its accounting for the tax effects of the enactment of the Act.
As a result, the Company made an additional provision for income tax during the three months ended September 30, 2018 relating to the transaction tax due to enactment of the Act.
27

As of September 30, 2018, the Company had not fully completed its accounting for the tax effects of the enactment of the Act.
The Company’s provision for income taxes for the three months ended September 30, 2018 is based in part on a reasonable estimate of the effects on its transition tax and existing deferred tax balances.
For the amounts which the Company was able to reasonably estimate, the Company recognized a provisional tax benefit amount of $19.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2018.
The component of the provisional tax benefit amount is as follows:



•The Company recorded a provisional tax benefit adjustment of $19.8 million for the transition tax liability.
Further, the transition tax is based in part on the amount of those earnings held in cash and other specified assets.
This amount may change when the Company finalizes the calculation of post-1986 foreign E&P previously deferred from U.S. federal taxation and finalizes the amounts held in cash or other specified assets.
As a result, the Company’s deferred tax assets and liabilities were being evaluated if the deferred tax assets and liabilities should be recognized for the basis differences expected to reverse as a result of GILTI provisions that are effective for the Company after the fiscal year ending June 30, 2018, or should the tax on GILTI provisions be recognized in the period the Act was signed into law.
The Company has elected to account for GILTI as a component of current period tax expense for the fiscal year ending June 30, 2019.
The Company is subject to United States federal income tax examination for all years beginning from the fiscal year ended June 30, 2015.
The Company is subject to state income tax examinations for all years beginning from the fiscal year ended June 30, 2014.
The Company is also subject to examinations in other major foreign jurisdictions, including Singapore, for all years beginning from the fiscal year ended June 30, 2014.
It is possible that certain examinations may be concluded in the next twelve months.
NOTE 13 – LITIGATION AND OTHER LEGAL MATTERS



The Company is named from time to time as a party to lawsuits and other types of legal proceedings and claims in the normal course of its business.
Actions filed against the Company include commercial, intellectual property, customer, and labor and employment related claims, including complaints of alleged wrongful termination and potential class action lawsuits regarding alleged violations of federal and state wage and hour and other laws.
Moreover, the results of legal proceedings are difficult to predict, and the costs incurred in litigation can be substantial, regardless of outcome.
The Company believes the amounts provided in its condensed consolidated financial statements are adequate in light of the probable and estimated liabilities.
NOTE 14 – COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES



Factoring.
KLA-Tencor has agreements (referred to as “factoring agreements”) with financial institutions to sell certain of its trade receivables and promissory notes from customers without recourse.
The Company does not believe it is at risk for any material losses as a result of these agreements.
In addition, the Company periodically sells certain letters of credit (“LCs”), without recourse, received from customers in payment for goods and services.
Facilities.
KLA-Tencor leases certain of its facilities under arrangements that are accounted for as operating leases.
Rent expense was $2.3 million and $2.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively.
The following is a schedule of expected operating lease payments:



[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]



Purchase Commitments.
KLA-Tencor maintains commitments to purchase inventory from its suppliers as well as goods and services in the ordinary course of business.
The Company’s liability under these purchase commitments is generally restricted to a forecasted time-horizon as mutually agreed upon between the parties.
This forecasted time-horizon can vary among different suppliers.
The Company’s estimate of its significant purchase commitments is approximately $476.6 million as of September 30, 2018, which are primarily due within the next 12 months.
Actual expenditures will vary based upon the volume of the transactions and length of contractual service provided.
In addition, the amounts paid under these arrangements may be less in the event that the arrangements are renegotiated or canceled.
Certain agreements provide for potential cancellation penalties.
Cash Long-Term Incentive Plan.
As of September 30, 2018, the Company had committed $161.1 million for future payment obligations under its Cash LTI Plan.
The calculation of compensation expense related to the Cash LTI Plan includes estimated forfeiture rate assumptions.
Cash LTI awards issued to employees under the Cash LTI Plan vest in three or four equal installments, with one-third or one-fourth of the aggregate amount of the Cash LTI award vesting on each anniversary of the grant date over a three or four-year period.
In order to receive payments under a Cash LTI award, participants must remain employed by the Company as of the applicable award vesting date.
Guarantees and Contingencies.
The Company maintains guarantee arrangements available through various financial institutions for up to $22.0 million, of which $15.5 million had been issued as of September 30, 2018, primarily to fund guarantees to customs authorities for value-added tax (“VAT”) and other operating requirements of the Company’s subsidiaries in Europe and Asia.
KLA-Tencor is a party to a variety of agreements pursuant to which it may be obligated to indemnify the other party with respect to certain matters.
In each of these circumstances, payment by the Company is typically subject to the other party making a claim to and cooperating with the Company pursuant to the procedures specified in the particular contract.
Further, the Company’s obligations under these agreements may be limited in terms of amounts, activity (typically at the Company’s option to replace or correct the products or terminate the agreement with a refund to the other party), and duration.
In some instances, the Company may have recourse against third parties and/or insurance covering certain payments made by the Company.
Subject to certain limitations, the Company is obligated to indemnify its current and former directors, officers and employees with respect to certain litigation matters and investigations that arise in connection with their service to the Company.
These obligations arise under the terms of the Company’s certificate of incorporation, its bylaws, applicable contracts, and Delaware and California law.
In addition, the Company may in limited circumstances enter into agreements that contain customer-specific commitments on pricing, tool reliability, spare parts stocking levels, response time and other commitments.
Furthermore, the Company may give these customers limited audit or inspection rights to enable them to confirm that the Company is complying with these commitments.
If a customer elects to exercise its audit or inspection rights, the Company may be required to expend significant resources to support the audit or inspection, as well as to defend or settle any dispute with a customer that could potentially arise out of such audit or inspection.
To date, the Company has made no significant accruals in its condensed consolidated financial statements for this contingency.
While the Company has not in the past incurred significant expenses for resolving disputes regarding these types of commitments, the Company cannot make any assurance that it will not incur any such liabilities in the future.
It is not possible to predict the maximum potential amount of future payments under these or similar agreements due to the conditional nature of the Company’s obligations and the unique facts and circumstances involved in each particular agreement.
Historically, payments made by the Company under these agreements have not had a material effect on its business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.
NOTE 15 – DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS AND HEDGING ACTIVITIES



The authoritative guidance requires companies to recognize all derivative instruments and hedging activities, including foreign currency exchange contracts and interest rate lock agreements, as either assets or liabilities at fair value on the balance sheet.
Changes in the fair value of derivatives that do not qualify for hedge treatment, as well as the ineffective portion of any hedges, are recognized in other expense (income), net in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations.
In accordance with the guidance, the Company designates foreign currency exchange contracts and interest rate lock agreements as cash flow hedges of certain forecasted foreign currency denominated sales and purchase transactions, and the benchmark interest rate of the intended debt financing, respectively.
KLA-Tencor’s foreign subsidiaries operate and sell KLA-Tencor’s products in various global markets.
As a result, KLA-Tencor is exposed to risks relating to changes in foreign currency exchange rates.
KLA-Tencor utilizes foreign currency forward exchange contracts and option contracts to hedge against future movements in foreign exchange rates that affect certain existing and forecasted foreign currency denominated sales and purchase transactions, such as the Japanese yen, the euro, the New Taiwan dollar and the Israeli new shekel.
The Company routinely hedges its exposures to certain foreign currencies with various financial institutions in an effort to minimize the impact of certain currency exchange rate fluctuations.
These currency forward exchange contracts and options, designated as cash flow hedges, generally have maturities of less than 18 months.
Cash flow hedges are evaluated for effectiveness monthly, based on changes in total fair value of the derivatives.
If a financial counterparty to any of the Company’s hedging arrangements experiences financial difficulties or is otherwise unable to honor the terms of the foreign currency hedge, the Company may experience material losses.
For derivative instruments that are designated and qualify as cash flow hedges, the effective portion of the gains or losses on the derivative is reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) (“OCI”) and reclassified into earnings in the same period or periods during which the hedged transaction affects earnings.
Changes in the fair value of currency forward exchange and option contracts due to changes in time value are excluded from the assessment of effectiveness.
Gains and losses on the derivative representing either hedge ineffectiveness or hedge components excluded from the assessment of effectiveness are recognized in current earnings.
30

For derivative instruments that are not designated as accounting hedges, gains and losses are recognized in other expense (income), net.
The Company uses foreign currency forward contracts to hedge certain foreign currency denominated assets or liabilities.
The gains and losses on these derivatives are largely offset by the changes in the fair value of the assets or liabilities being hedged.
In October 2014, the Company entered into a series of forward contracts (“Rate Lock Agreements”) to lock the benchmark rate on a portion of the Senior Notes.
The Rate Lock Agreements had a notional amount of $1.00 billion in aggregate which matured in the second quarter of the fiscal year ended June 30, 2015.
The Rate Lock Agreements were terminated on the date of pricing of the $1.25 billion of 4.650% Senior Notes due in 2024 and the Company recorded the fair value of $7.5 million as a gain within accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) as of December 31, 2014.
The Company recognized $0.2 million for each of the three months ended September 30, 2018 and 2017 for the amortization of the gain recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), which amount reduced the interest expense.
As of September 30, 2018, the unamortized portion of the fair value of the forward contracts for the Rate Lock Agreements was $4.6 million.
During the three months ended June 30, 2018, the Company entered into a series of forward contracts (the “2018 Rate Lock Agreements”) to lock the benchmark interest rate prior to expected debt issuances.
The objective of the 2018 Rate Lock Agreements was to hedge the risk associated with the variability in interest rates due to the changes in the benchmark rate leading up to the closing of the intended financing, on the notional amount being hedged.
The 2018 Rate Lock Agreement had a notional amount of $500.0 million in aggregate with contract maturity dates in the first half of the fiscal year ending June 30, 2019.
Each forward contract will be closed on the earlier of the completion date of pricing of the portion of the intended debt being hedged or the expiration date.
The Company designated each of the 2018 Rate Lock Agreements as a qualifying hedging instrument to be accounted for as a cash flow hedge, under which the effective portion of the gain or loss on the derivative is reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), and subsequently amortized into earnings as a component of interest expense over the term of the underlying debt.
The ineffective portion, if any, will be recognized in earnings immediately.

ITEM 1.LEGAL PROCEEDINGS



The information set forth above under Note 12, “Litigation and Other Legal Matters,” to the condensed consolidated financial statements in Item 1 of Part 1 is incorporated herein by reference.
Risks Associated with Our Industry 



Ongoing changes in the technology industry, as well as the semiconductor industry in particular, could expose our business to significant risks.
The semiconductor equipment industry and other industries that we serve are constantly developing and changing over time.
In addition, we face a number of risks specific to ongoing changes in the semiconductor industry, as the significant majority of our sales are made to semiconductor manufacturers.
We are exposed to risks associated with a highly concentrated customer base.
Our customer base, particularly in the semiconductor industry, historically has been highly concentrated due to corporate consolidation, acquisitions and business closures.
•As a result of this consolidation, the customers that survive the consolidation represent a greater portion of our sales and, consequently, have greater commercial negotiating leverage.
•Certain customers have undergone significant ownership changes, created alliances with other companies, experienced management changes or have outsourced manufacturing activities, any of which may result in additional complexities in managing customer relationships and transactions.
•The highly concentrated business environment also increases our exposure to risks related to the financial condition of each of our customers.
For example, as a result of the challenging economic environment during fiscal year 2009, we were (and in some cases continue to be) exposed to additional risks related to the continued financial viability of certain of our customers.
To the extent our customers experience liquidity issues in the future, we may be required to incur additional bad debt expense with respect to receivables owed to us by those customers.
•Semiconductor manufacturers generally must commit significant resources to qualify, install and integrate process control and yield management equipment into a semiconductor production line.
We believe that once a semiconductor manufacturer selects a particular supplier’s process control and yield management equipment, the manufacturer generally relies upon that equipment for that specific production line application for an extended period of time.
In addition, when products are initially introduced, they tend to have higher costs because of initial development costs and lower production volumes relative to the previous product generation, which can impact gross margin.
52

The semiconductor equipment industry has been cyclical.
If we fail to respond to industry cycles, our business could be seriously harmed.
The timing, length and severity of the up-and-down cycles in the semiconductor equipment industry are difficult to predict.
Furthermore, any workforce reductions and cost reduction actions that we adopt in response to down cycles may result in additional restructuring charges, disruptions in our operations and loss of key personnel.
In addition, during periods of rapid growth, we must be able to increase manufacturing capacity and personnel to meet customer demand.
We can provide no assurance that these objectives can be met in a timely manner in response to industry cycles.
Success in the semiconductor equipment industry depends, in part, on continual improvement of existing technologies and rapid innovation of new solutions.
The primary driver of technology advancement in the semiconductor industry has been to shrink the lithography that prints the circuit design on semiconductor chips.
That driver appears to be slowing, which may cause semiconductor manufacturers to delay investments in equipment, investigate more complex device architectures, use new materials and develop innovative fabrication processes.
These and other evolving customer plans and needs require us to respond with continued development programs and cut back or discontinue older programs, which may no longer have industry-wide support.
Technical innovations are inherently complex and require long development cycles and appropriate staffing of highly qualified employees.
We must continue to make significant investments in research and development in order to enhance the performance, features and functionality of our products, to keep pace with competitive products and to satisfy customer demands.
Substantial research and development costs typically are incurred before we confirm the technical feasibility and commercial viability of a new product, and not all development activities result in commercially viable products.
There can be no assurance that revenues from future products or product enhancements will be sufficient to recover the development costs associated with such products or enhancements.
In addition, we cannot be sure that these products or enhancements will receive market acceptance or that we will be able to sell these products at prices that are favorable to us.
In addition, the complexity of our products exposes us to other risks.
However, our products are very technologically complex and rely on the interconnection of numerous subcomponents (all of which must perform to their respective specifications), so it is conceivable that a product for which we recognize revenue upon shipment may ultimately fail to meet the overall product’s required specifications.
We derive a substantial percentage of our revenues from sales of inspection products.
Our success is dependent in part on our technology and other proprietary rights.
Our success is dependent in part on our technology and other proprietary rights.
We own various United States and international patents and have additional pending patent applications relating to some of our products and technologies.
In addition, we at times engage in collaborative technology development efforts with our customers and suppliers, and these collaborations may constitute a key component of certain of our ongoing technology and product research and development projects.
54

We also maintain trademarks on certain of our products and services and claim copyright protection for certain proprietary software and documentation.
We attempt to protect our trade secrets and other proprietary information through confidentiality and other agreements with our customers, suppliers, employees and consultants and through other security measures.
However, these employees, consultants and third parties may breach these agreements, and we may not have adequate remedies for wrongdoing.
In any event, the extent to which we can protect our trade secrets through the use of confidentiality agreements is limited, and our success will depend to a significant extent on our ability to innovate ahead of our competitors.
Our industry includes large manufacturers with substantial resources to support customers worldwide.
Some of our competitors are diversified companies with greater financial resources and more extensive research, engineering, manufacturing, marketing, and customer service and support capabilities than we possess.
We face competition from companies whose strategy is to provide a broad array of products and services, some of which compete with the products and services that we offer.
In addition, we face competition from smaller emerging semiconductor equipment companies whose strategy is to provide a portion of the products and services that we offer, using innovative technology to sell products into specialized markets.
We use a wide range of materials in the production of our products, including custom electronic and mechanical components, and we use numerous suppliers to supply these materials.
We generally do not have guaranteed supply arrangements with our suppliers.
Because of the variability and uniqueness of customers’ orders, we do not maintain an extensive inventory of materials for manufacturing.
Through our business interruption planning, we seek to minimize the risk of production and service interruptions and/or shortages of key parts by, among other things, monitoring the financial stability of key suppliers, identifying (but not necessarily qualifying) possible alternative suppliers and maintaining appropriate inventories of key parts.
Although we make reasonable efforts to ensure that parts are available from multiple suppliers, certain key parts are available only from a single supplier or a limited group of suppliers.
We attempt to operate our business in accordance with a business plan that is established annually, revised frequently (generally quarterly), and reviewed by management even more frequently (at least monthly).
In addition, our management is constantly striving to balance the requirements and demands of our customers with the availability of resources, the need to manage our operating model and other factors.
In furtherance of those efforts, we often must exercise discretion and judgment as to the timing and prioritization of manufacturing, deliveries, installations and payment scheduling.
Our capital structure is highly leveraged.
As of September 30, 2018, we had $2.25 billion aggregate principal amount of senior, unsecured long-term notes.
Additionally, we have commitments for an unfunded Revolving Credit Facility of $750.0 million under the Credit Agreement.
We may incur additional indebtedness in the future by accessing the unfunded portion of our Revolving Credit Facility and/or entering into new financing arrangements.
For example, at the same time we announced our intention to acquire Orbotech, we also announced a new stock repurchase program authorizing the repurchase up to $2.00 billion of our common stock, a large portion of which would be financed with new indebtedness.
There can be no assurance that we will be able to manage any of these risks successfully.
In addition, the interest rates of the senior, unsecured long-term notes may be subject to adjustments from time to time if Moody’s Investors Service, Inc. (“Moody’s”), Standard & Poor’s Ratings Services (“S&P”) or, under certain circumstances, a substitute rating agency selected by us as a replacement for Moody’s or S&P, as the case may be (a “Substitute Rating Agency”), downgrades (or subsequently upgrades) its rating assigned to the respective series of notes such that the adjusted rating is below investment grade.
56

In certain circumstances involving a change of control followed by a downgrade of the rating of a series of notes by at least two of Moody’s, S&P and Fitch Inc., unless we have exercised our right to redeem the notes of such series, we will be required to make an offer to repurchase all or, at the holder’s option, any part, of each holder’s notes of that series pursuant to the offer described below (the “Change of Control Offer”).
In the Change of Control Offer, we will be required to offer payment in cash equal to 101% of the aggregate principal amount of notes repurchased plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, on the notes repurchased, up to, but not including, the date of repurchase.
We cannot make any assurance that we will have sufficient financial resources at such time or will be able to arrange financing to pay the repurchase price of that series of notes.
Our ability to repurchase that series of notes in such event may be limited by law, by the indenture associated with that series of notes, or by the terms of other agreements to which we may be party at such time.
If we fail to repurchase that series of notes as required by the terms of such notes, it would constitute an event of default under the indenture governing that series of notes which, in turn, may also constitute an event of default under other of our obligations.
Borrowings under our Revolving Credit Facility bear interest at a floating rate, and an increase in interest rates would require us to pay additional interest on any borrowings, which may have an adverse effect on the value and liquidity of our debt and the market price of our common stock could decline.
The interest rate under our Revolving Credit Facility is also subject to an adjustment in conjunction with our credit rating downgrades or upgrades.
Additionally, under our Revolving Credit Facility, we are required to comply with affirmative and negative covenants, which include the maintenance of certain financial ratios, the details of which can be found in Note 7, “Debt,” to our condensed consolidated financial statements.
If we fail to comply with these covenants, we will be in default and our borrowings will become immediately due and payable.
There can be no assurance that we will have sufficient financial resources or we will be able to arrange financing to repay our borrowings at such time.
In addition, certain of our domestic subsidiaries are required to guarantee our borrowings under our Revolving Credit Facility.
Furthermore, our future operations may not generate sufficient cash flows to enable us to meet our future expenses and service our new debt obligations, which may impact our ability to manage our capital structure to preserve and maintain our investment grade rating.
If our future operations do not generate sufficient cash flows, we may need to access the unfunded portion of our Revolving Credit Facility of $750.0 million or enter into new financing arrangements to obtain necessary funds.
If we determine it is necessary to seek additional funding for any reason, we may not be able to obtain such funding or, if funding is available, we may not be able to obtain it on acceptable terms.
Any additional borrowing under our Revolving Credit Facility will place further pressure on us to comply with the financial covenants.
If we fail to make a payment associated with our debt obligations, we could be in default on such debt, and such a default could cause us to be in default on our other obligations.
57

There can be no assurance that we will continue to declare cash dividends at all or in any particular amounts.
Our Board of Directors first instituted a quarterly dividend during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2005.
Since that time, we have announced a number of increases in the amount of our quarterly dividend level as well as payment of a special cash dividend that was declared and substantially paid in the second quarter of our fiscal year ended June 30, 2015.
We intend to continue to pay quarterly dividends subject to capital availability and periodic determinations by our Board of Directors that cash dividends are in the best interest of our stockholders and are in compliance with all laws and agreements applicable to the declaration and payment of cash dividends by us.
Our dividend payments may change from time to time, and we cannot provide assurance that we will continue to declare dividends at all or in any particular amounts.
In situations where we engage in business with a third party without an explicit master agreement regarding the applicable terms and conditions, or where the commercial documentation applicable to the transaction is subject to varying interpretations, we may have disputes with those third parties regarding the applicable terms and conditions of our business relationship with them.
In addition, in our commercial agreements, from time to time in the normal course of business we indemnify third parties with whom we enter into contractual relationships, including customers, suppliers and lessors, with respect to certain matters.
We are also exposed to potential costs associated with unexpected product performance issues.
Our products and production processes are extremely complex and thus could contain unexpected product defects, especially when products are first introduced.
58

Furthermore, we occasionally enter into volume purchase agreements with our larger customers, and these agreements may provide for certain volume purchase incentives, such as credits toward future purchases.
We believe that these arrangements are beneficial to our long-term business, as they are designed to encourage our customers to purchase higher volumes of our products.
However, these arrangements could require us to recognize a reduced level of revenue for the products that are initially purchased, to account for the potential future credits or other volume purchase incentives.
Our volume purchase agreements require significant estimation for the amounts to be accrued depending upon the estimate of volume of future purchases.
As such, we are required to update our estimates of the accruals on a periodic basis.
Until the earnings process is complete, our estimates could differ in comparison to actuals.
In addition, we may in limited circumstances enter into agreements that contain customer-specific commitments on pricing, tool reliability, spare parts stocking levels, response time and other commitments.
Furthermore, we may give these customers limited audit or inspection rights to enable them to confirm that we are complying with these commitments.
If a customer elects to exercise its audit or inspection rights, we may be required to expend significant resources to support the audit or inspection, as well as to defend or settle any dispute with a customer that could potentially arise out of such audit or inspection.
To date, we have made no significant accruals in our condensed consolidated financial statements for this contingency.
While we have not in the past incurred significant expenses for resolving disputes regarding these types of commitments, we cannot make any assurance that we will not incur any such liabilities in the future.
There are risks associated with our receipt of government funding for research and development.
We are exposed to additional risks related to our receipt of external funding for certain strategic development programs from various governments and government agencies, both domestically and internationally.
Governments and government agencies typically have the right to terminate funding programs at any time in their sole discretion, or a project may be terminated by mutual agreement if the parties determine that the project’s goals or milestones are not being achieved, so there is no assurance that these sources of external funding will continue to be available to us in the future.
In addition, under the terms of these government grants, the applicable granting agency typically has the right to audit the costs that we incur, directly and indirectly, in connection with such programs.
Any such audit could result in modifications to, or even termination of, the applicable government funding program.
For example, if an audit were to identify any costs as being improperly allocated to the applicable program, those costs would not be reimbursed, and any such costs that had already been reimbursed would have to be refunded.
Historically, we recorded material restructuring charges related to our prior global workforce reductions, large excess inventory write-offs, and material impairment charges related to our goodwill and purchased intangible assets.
Such additional write-offs could result in material charges.
59

In the past, we recorded a material charge related to the impairment of our goodwill and purchased intangible assets.
Goodwill represents the excess of costs over the net fair value of net assets acquired in a business combination.
Goodwill is not amortized, but is instead tested for impairment at least annually in accordance with authoritative guidance for goodwill.
Purchased intangible assets with estimable useful lives are amortized over their respective estimated useful lives based on economic benefit if known or using the straight-line method, and are reviewed for impairment in accordance with authoritative guidance for long-lived assets.
A substantial decline in our stock price, or any other adverse change in market conditions, particularly if such change has the effect of changing one of the critical assumptions or estimates we previously used to calculate the value of our goodwill or intangible assets (and, as applicable, the amount of any previous impairment charge), could result in a change to the estimation of fair value that could result in an additional impairment charge.
We are exposed to risks related to our financial arrangements with respect to receivables factoring and banking arrangements.
We enter into factoring arrangements with financial institutions to sell certain of our trade receivables and promissory notes from customers without recourse.
In addition, we maintain bank accounts with several domestic and foreign financial institutions, any of which may prove not to be financially viable.
However, by entering into these arrangements, and by engaging these financial institutions for banking services, we are exposed to additional risks.
We are subject to the risks of additional government actions in the event we were to breach the terms of any settlement arrangement into which we have entered.
In connection with the settlement of certain government actions and other legal proceedings related to our historical stock option practices, we have explicitly agreed as a condition to such settlements that we will comply with certain laws, such as the books and records provisions of the federal securities laws.
We expect that these conditions will continue in the foreseeable future.
Managing global operations and sites located throughout the world presents a number of challenges, including but not limited to:



•managing cultural diversity and organizational alignment;



•exposure to the unique characteristics of each region in the global semiconductor market, which can cause capital equipment investment patterns to vary significantly from period to period;



•periodic local or international economic downturns;



•potential adverse tax consequences, including withholding tax rules that may limit the repatriation of our earnings, and higher effective income tax rates in foreign countries where we do business;



•compliance with customs regulations in the countries in which we do business;



•tariffs or other trade barriers (including those applied to our products or to parts and supplies that we purchase);



•political instability, natural disasters, legal or regulatory changes, acts of war or terrorism in regions where we have operations or where we do business;



 60

•fluctuations in interest and currency exchange rates may adversely impact our ability to compete on price with local providers or the value of revenues we generate from our international business.
Although we attempt to manage some of our near-term currency risks through the use of hedging instruments, there can be no assurance that such efforts will be adequate;



•longer payment cycles and difficulties in collecting accounts receivable outside of the United States;



•difficulties in managing foreign distributors (including monitoring and ensuring our distributors’ compliance with applicable laws); and



•inadequate protection or enforcement of our intellectual property and other legal rights in foreign jurisdictions.
In addition, government controls, either by the United States or other countries, that restrict our business overseas or the import or export of semiconductor products or increase the cost of our operations through the imposition of tariffs or otherwise, could harm our business.
For example, effective on October 30, 2018, the United States Department of Commerce added Fujian Jinhua Integrated Circuit Company, Ltd. (“JHICC”) to its entity list, restricting exports of technology to JHICC without a license.
The markets for semiconductors, and therefore our business, are ultimately driven by the global demand for electronic devices by consumers and businesses.
In addition, the tightening of credit markets and concerns regarding the availability of credit that accompanied that slowdown made it more difficult for our customers to raise capital, whether debt or equity, to finance their purchases of capital equipment, including the products we sell.
Our investment portfolio includes corporate and government securities, money market funds and other types of debt and equity investments.
There can be no assurance regarding the outcome of future legal proceedings, claims or investigations.
We are exposed to various risks related to the legal, regulatory and tax environments in which we perform our operations and conduct our business.
We are subject to various risks related to compliance with new, existing, different, inconsistent or even conflicting laws, rules and regulations enacted by legislative bodies and/or regulatory agencies in the countries in which we operate and with which we must comply, including environmental, safety, antitrust, anti-corruption/anti-bribery, unclaimed property and export control regulations.
Our failure or inability to comply with existing or future laws, rules or regulations, or changes to existing laws, rules or regulations (including changes that result in inconsistent or conflicting laws, rules or regulations), in the countries in which we operate could result in violations of contractual or regulatory obligations that may adversely affect our operating results, financial condition and ability to conduct our business.
Our properties and many aspects of our business operations are subject to various domestic and international environmental laws and regulations, including those that control and restrict the use, transportation, emission, discharge, storage and disposal of certain chemicals, gases and other substances.
Any failure to comply with applicable environmental laws, regulations or requirements may subject us to a range of consequences, including fines, suspension of certain of our business activities, limitations on our ability to sell our products, obligations to remediate environmental contamination, and criminal and civil liabilities or other sanctions.
In addition, changes in environmental regulations (including regulations relating to climate change and greenhouse gas emissions) could require us to invest in potentially costly pollution control equipment, alter our manufacturing processes or use substitute (potentially more expensive and/or rarer) materials.
In addition, we may from time to time be involved in legal proceedings or claims regarding employment, immigration, contracts, product performance, product liability, antitrust, environmental regulations, securities, unfair competition and other matters.
Our employees are vital to our success, and our key management, engineering and other employees are difficult to replace.
Further, we do not maintain key person life insurance on any of our employees.
The expansion of high technology companies worldwide has increased demand and competition for qualified personnel.
62

We outsource a number of services to third-party service providers, which decreases our control over the performance of these functions.
We outsource a number of services, including our transportation, information systems management and logistics management of spare parts and certain accounting and procurement functions, to domestic and overseas third-party service providers.
While outsourcing arrangements may lower our cost of operations, they also reduce our direct control over the services rendered.
In addition, many of these outsourced service providers, including certain hosted software applications that we use for confidential data storage, employ cloud computing technology for such storage.
These providers’ cloud computing systems may be susceptible to “cyber incidents,” such as intentional cyber attacks aimed at theft of sensitive data or inadvertent cyber-security compromises, which are outside of our control.
We are exposed to risks related to cybersecurity threats and cyber incidents.
In the conduct of our business, we collect, use, transmit and store data on information systems.
This data includes confidential information, transactional information and intellectual property belonging to us, our customers and our business partners, as well as personally-identifiable information of individuals.
We allocate significant resources to network security, data encryption and other measures to protect our information systems and data from unauthorized access or misuse.
Despite our ongoing efforts to enhance our network security measures, our information systems are susceptible to computer viruses, cyber-related security breaches and similar disruptions from unauthorized intrusions, tampering, misuse, criminal acts, including phishing, or other events or developments that we may be unable to anticipate or fail to mitigate and are subject to the inherent vulnerabilities of network security measures.
We have experienced cyber-related attacks in the past, and may experience cyber-related attacks in the future.
Our security measures may also be breached due to employee errors, malfeasance, or otherwise.
Third parties may also attempt to influence employees, users, suppliers or customers to disclose sensitive information in order to gain access to our, our customers’ or business partners’ data.
Because the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access to the information systems change frequently, and may not be recognized until launched against a target, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventative measures.
We carry insurance that provides some protection against the potential losses arising from a cybersecurity incident but it will not likely cover all such losses, and the losses that it does not cover may be significant.
We rely upon certain critical information systems for our daily business operations.
Our global operations are dependent upon certain information systems, including telecommunications, the internet, our corporate intranet, network communications, email and various computer hardware and software applications.
Any disruptions or difficulties that may occur in connection with our ERP system or other systems (whether in connection with the regular operation, periodic enhancements, modifications or upgrades of such systems or the integration of our acquired businesses into such systems) could adversely affect our ability to complete important business processes, such as the evaluation of our internal control over financial reporting pursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002.
63

Acquisitions are an important element of our strategy but, because of the uncertainties involved, we may not find suitable acquisition candidates and we may not be able to successfully integrate and manage acquired businesses.
We are also exposed to risks in connection with strategic alliances into which we may enter.
In addition to our efforts to develop new technologies from internal sources, part of our growth strategy is to pursue acquisitions and acquire new technologies from external sources.
As part of this effort, in March 2018, we announced that we had entered into a definitive agreement to acquire Orbotech.
In addition, we may lose key employees of the acquired companies.
At times, we may also enter into strategic alliances with customers, suppliers or other business partners with respect to development of technology and intellectual property.
These alliances typically require significant investments of capital and exchange of proprietary, highly sensitive information.
The success of these alliances depends on various factors over which we may have limited or no control and requires ongoing and effective cooperation with our strategic partners.
We have significant manufacturing operations in the United States, Singapore, Israel, Germany and China.
In addition, our business is international in nature, with our sales, service and administrative personnel and our customers located in numerous countries throughout the world.
Operations at our manufacturing facilities and our assembly subcontractors, as well as our other operations and those of our customers, are subject to disruption for a variety of reasons, including work stoppages, acts of war, terrorism, health epidemics, fire, earthquake, volcanic eruptions, energy shortages, flooding or other natural disasters.
We cannot ensure that alternate means of conducting our operations (whether through alternate production capacity or service providers or otherwise) would be available if a major disruption were to occur or that, if such alternate means were available, they could be obtained on favorable terms.
