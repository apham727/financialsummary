New Accounting Pronouncements



In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued ASU No.
2014-09, “Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606)” (“ASU 2014-09”).
ASU 2014-09 requires an entity to recognize the amount of revenue to which it expects to be entitled for the transfer of promised goods or services to customers.
ASU 2014-09 will replace most existing revenue recognition guidance in U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles when it becomes effective and permits the use of either the retrospective or cumulative effect transition method.
In August 2015, the FASB issued ASU No 2015-14, “Deferral of the Effective Date” (“ASU 2015-14”), which defers the effective date for ASU 2014-09 by one year.
For public entities, the guidance in ASU 2014-09 will be effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017 (including interim reporting periods within those periods), which means it will be effective for our fiscal year beginning October 1, 2018.
Early adoption is permitted to the original effective date of December 15, 2016 (including interim reporting periods within those periods).
In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU No.
2016-08, “Principal versus Agent Considerations (Reporting Revenue versus Net)” (“ASU 2016-08”), which clarifies the implementation guidance on principal versus agent considerations in the new revenue recognition standard.
In April 2016, the FASB issued ASU No.
2016-10, “Identifying Performance Obligations and Licensing” (“ASU 2016-10”), which reduces the complexity when applying the guidance for identifying performance obligations and improves the operability and understandability of the license implementation guidance.
In May 2016, the FASB issued ASU No.
2016-12 “Narrow-Scope Improvements and Practical Expedients” (“ASU 2016-12”), which amends the guidance on transition, collectability, noncash consideration and the presentation of sales and other similar taxes.
In December 2016, the FASB further issued ASU 2016-20, “Technical Corrections and Improvements to Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers” (“ASU 2016-20”), which makes minor corrections or minor improvements to the Codification that are not expected to have a significant effect on current accounting practice or create a significant administrative cost to most entities.
The amendments are intended to address implementation issues that were raised by stakeholders and provide additional practical expedients to reduce the cost and complexity of applying the new revenue standard.
These amendments have the same effective date as the new revenue standard.
We have established a cross-functional implementation team consisting of representatives across the organization to address the scope of work required to implement the recognition and disclosure requirements under the new standard.
This cross-functional implementation team has developed a project plan, which includes evaluating customer contracts across the organization, developing policies, processes and tools to report financial results, and implementing and evaluating our internal controls over financial reporting that will be necessary under the new standard.
We currently plan to adopt Topic 606 in the first quarter of our fiscal 2019 using the retrospective transition method.
As we continue to assess the new standard along with industry trends and additional interpretive guidance, we may adjust our implementation plan accordingly.
Under the new standard, we expect to recognize revenue when control of the license is transferred to the customer, rather than at the date payments become due and payable or ratably over the term of the contract required under the current standard;



•Presentation of contract balances.
Under the new standard, when we enter into noncancellable contracts that provide unconditional rights to payment from our customers for services that we have not yet completed providing or services we will provide in the near future, we expect to present the unconditional rights as receivables, regardless of whether cash has been received from customers; 



•Required disclosures including information about remaining transaction price and when we expect to recognize revenue; and



•Accounting for commissions under the new standard will result in the deferral of incremental commission costs for obtaining contracts.

In October 2016, the FASB issued ASU No.
2016-16, “Income Taxes (Topic 740): Intra-Entity Transfers of Assets Other Than Inventory” (“ASU 2016-16”).
ASU 2016-16 requires an entity to recognize the income tax consequences of an intra-entity transfer of an asset, other than inventory, when the transfer occurs.
The guidance is effective for fiscal years and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2017, which means it will be effective for our fiscal year beginning October 1, 2018.
ASU 2016-16 should be applied on a modified retrospective basis through a cumulative-effect adjustment directly to retained earnings at the beginning of the period of adoption.
Early adoption is permitted as of the beginning of an annual reporting period for which financial statements (interim or annual) have not been issued.
In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No.
2016-02, “Leases (Topic 842)” (“ASU 2016-02”), which requires lessees to put most leases on their balance sheets but recognize the expenses on their income statements in a manner similar to current practice.
ASU 2016-02 states that a lessee would recognize a lease liability for the obligation to make lease payments and a right-to-use asset for the right to use the underlying asset for the lease term.
ASU 2016-02 is effective for fiscal years and interim periods within those fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, which means it will be effective for our fiscal year beginning October 1, 2019.
Early adoption is permitted.

Fair Value Measurements



Fair value is defined as the price that would be received from the sale of an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date.
The accounting guidance establishes a three-level hierarchy for disclosure that is based on the extent and level of judgment used to estimate the fair value of assets and liabilities.
•Level 1 - uses unadjusted quoted prices that are available in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
Our Level 1 assets are comprised of money market funds and certain equity securities.
[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED][DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]



The following tables represent financial assets that we measured at fair value on a recurring basis at March 31, 2018 and September 30, 2017:



7

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED][DATA_TABLE_REMOVED][DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]



Where applicable, we use quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities to determine fair value.
This methodology would apply to our Level 2 investments.
We have not changed our valuation techniques in measuring the fair value of any financial assets and liabilities during the period.
For the fair value of our derivative instruments and senior notes, see Note 3 and Note 7, respectively.

Derivative Financial Instruments



We use derivative instruments to manage risks caused by fluctuations in foreign exchange rates.
The primary objective of our derivative instruments is to protect the value of foreign-currency-denominated receivable and cash balances from the effects of volatility in foreign exchange rates that might occur prior to conversion to their respective functional currencies.
We routinely enter into contracts to offset exposures denominated in the British pound, Euro, and Singapore dollar.
Foreign-currency-denominated receivable and cash balances are remeasured at foreign exchange rates in effect on the balance sheet date with the effects of changes in foreign exchange rates reported in other income (expense), net.
The forward contracts are not designated as hedges and are marked to market through other income (expense), net.
The forward contracts are short-term in nature and typically have average maturities at inception of less than three months.
The following tables summarize our outstanding foreign currency forward contracts, by currency, at March 31, 2018 and September 30, 2017:

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]



[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]



The foreign currency forward contracts were entered into on March 31, 2018 and September 30, 2017, respectively; therefore, their fair value was $0 on each of these dates.
Intangible assets, gross were $111.5 million and $114.5 million as of March 31, 2018 and September 30, 2017, respectively.
Estimated future intangible asset amortization expense associated with intangible assets existing at March 31, 2018 was as follows (in thousands):

6.
Revolving Line of Credit



We have a $600 million unsecured revolving line of credit with a syndicate of banks that expires on December 30, 2019.
Proceeds from the credit facility can be used for working capital and general corporate purposes and may also be used for the refinancing of existing debt, acquisitions and the repurchase of our common stock.
Interest on amounts borrowed under the credit facility is based on (i) a base rate, which is the greater of (a) the prime rate, (b) the Federal Funds rate plus 0.500% and (c) the one-month LIBOR rate plus 1.000%, plus, in each case, an applicable margin, or (ii) an adjusted LIBOR rate plus an applicable margin.
The applicable margin for base rate borrowings ranges from 0% to 0.875% and for LIBOR borrowings ranges from 1.000% to 1.875%, and is determined based on our consolidated leverage ratio.
In addition, we must pay credit facility fees.
The credit facility contains certain restrictive covenants including maintaining a minimum fixed charge ratio of 2.5 and a maximum consolidated leverage ratio of 3.0, subject to a step up to 3.5 following certain permitted acquisitions.
The credit agreement also contains other covenants typical of unsecured facilities.
As of March 31, 2018, we had $460.0 million in borrowings outstanding at a weighted average interest rate of 2.973%, of which $400.0 million was classified as a long-term liability and recorded in long-term debt within the accompanying condensed consolidated balance sheets.
We were in compliance with all financial covenants under this credit facility as of March 31, 2018.
Depending on market conditions, we may refinance some of our debt in 2018.

Senior Notes



On May 7, 2008, we issued $275 million of senior notes in a private placement to a group of institutional investors (the “2008 Senior Notes”).
The 2008 Senior Notes were issued in four series with maturities ranging from 5 to 10 years.
The outstanding 2008 Senior Notes’ weighted average interest rate is 7.2% and the weighted average maturity is 10.0 years.
On July 14, 2010, we issued $245 million of senior notes in a private placement to a group of institutional investors (the “2010 Senior Notes” and, with the 2008 Senior Notes, the “Senior Notes”).
The 2010 Senior Notes were issued in four series with maturities ranging from 6 to 10 years.
The outstanding 2010 Senior Notes’ weighted average interest rate is 5.6% and the weighted average maturity is 9.8 years.
The Senior Notes require interest payments semi-annually and contain certain restrictive covenants, including the maintenance of consolidated net debt to consolidated EBITDA ratio and a fixed charge coverage ratio.
The purchase agreements for the Senior Notes also contain certain covenants typical of unsecured facilities.
As of March 31, 2018, we were in compliance with all financial covenants.
The following table presents the carrying amounts and fair values for the Senior Notes at March 31, 2018 and September 30, 2017:



[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]



We measure the fair value of the Senior Notes based on Level 2 inputs, which include quoted market prices and interest rate spreads of similar securities.

Restructuring Expenses



The following table summarizes our restructuring accruals related to facility closures and employee separation charges.
The balance for all the facilities charges will be paid by the end of fiscal 2020.
The balance for all the employee separation costs was paid before the end of the second quarter of fiscal 2018.

Income Taxes



Effective Tax Rate



The effective income tax rate was 20.9% and 24.3% during the quarters ended March 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively, and 20.3% and (1.9)% during the six months ended March 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively.
The effective tax rate in any quarter can also be affected positively or negatively by adjustments that are required to be reported in the specific quarter of resolution.
The Tax Act reduces the federal corporate tax rate to 21.0% effective January 1, 2018.
In accordance with Section 15 of the Internal Revenue Code, we will utilize a blended rate of 24.5% for our fiscal 2018 tax year, by applying a prorated percentage of the number of days prior to and subsequent to the January 1, 2018 effective date.
We recorded provisional charges for the re-measurement of the deferred tax assets of $5.6 million to our income tax expense related to long-term deferred tax assets and $3.0 million related to short-term deferred tax assets during the six months ended March 31, 2018.
As of March 31, 2018, we are able to make a reasonable estimate and recorded a provisional Transition Tax obligation of $4.9 million.
SAB 118 provides a measurement period that should not extend beyond one year from the Tax Act enactment date for companies to complete the accounting under ASC 740.
We are continuing to gather additional information to determine the final impact.
The total unrecognized tax benefit for uncertain tax positions is estimated to be $6.4 million and $6.5 million at March 31, 2018 and September 30, 2017, respectively.
We have accrued interest of $0.5 million and $0.4 million related to unrecognized tax benefits as of March 31, 2018 and September 30, 2017, respectively.
10.
There were approximately 19,000 and 34,000 options excluded for the quarters ended March 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively.
There were approximately 11,000 and 17,000 options excluded for the six months ended March 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively.

Segment Information



We are organized into the following three operating segments, each of which is a reportable segment, to align with internal management of our worldwide business operations based on product offerings.
•Applications.
This segment includes pre-configured decision management applications designed for a specific type of business problem or process — such as marketing, account origination, customer management, fraud, collections and insurance claims management — as well as associated professional services.
These applications are available to our customers as on-premises software, and many are available as hosted, software-as-a-service (“SaaS”) applications through the FICO® Analytic Cloud.
•Scores.
This segment includes our business-to-business scoring solutions, our myFICO® solutions for consumers and associated professional services.
Our scoring solutions give our clients access to analytics that can be easily integrated into their transaction streams and decision-making processes.
Our scoring solutions are distributed through major credit reporting agencies, as well as services through which we provide our scores to clients directly.
[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]



Our Chief Executive Officer evaluates segment financial performance based on segment revenues and segment operating income.
Indirect costs are allocated to the segments generally based on relative segment revenues, fixed rates established by management based upon estimated expense contribution levels and other assumptions that management considers reasonable.
These income and expense items are not allocated because they are not considered in evaluating the segment’s operating performance.
Our Chief Executive Officer does not evaluate the financial performance of each segment based on its respective assets, nor capital expenditures where depreciation amounts are allocated to the segments from their internal cost centers as described above.
The following tables summarize segment information for the quarters and six-month periods ended March 31, 2018 and 2017:
