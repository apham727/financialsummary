PART II.
OTHER INFORMATION



Item 1.
Legal Proceedings.
The semiconductor industry is characterized by vigorous protection and pursuit of intellectual property rights.
The outcome of any such litigation cannot be predicted with certainty and some such lawsuits, claims or proceedings may be disposed of unfavorably to the Company.
From time to time the Company may also be involved in legal proceedings in the ordinary course of business.
The Company monitors the status of legal proceedings and other contingencies on an ongoing basis to ensure loss contingencies are recognized and/or disclosed in its financial statements and footnotes.
The Company does not believe there are any pending legal proceedings that are reasonably possible to result in a material loss.
Item 1A.
Risk Factors.
Except as set forth below, there have been no material changes from the risk factors previously disclosed in the 2018 10-K.



We are subject to the risks of doing business internationally.
A substantial majority of our net revenue is derived from shipments to customers located outside the United States, primarily in countries located in the Asia-Pacific region and Europe.
In addition, we have suppliers located outside the United States, and third-party packaging, assembly and test facilities and foundries located in the Asia-Pacific region.
Finally, we maintain wafer fabrication facilities in Kadoma, Japan, and Osaka, Japan, as well as packaging, assembly and test facilities in Mexicali, Mexico, and in Singapore.
These include, but are not limited to, risks regarding:



•currency exchange rate fluctuations, including increases or decreases in commodities prices related to such fluctuations,



•local economic and political conditions, including, but not limited to, social, economic and political instability related to the uncertainty regarding the relationships between the United States and China, Russia, Mexico, North Korea, Middle Eastern countries, other foreign countries, and the international community at large, and related to the United Kingdom’s pending withdrawal from the European Union, 



•labor market conditions and workers’ rights,



•disruptions of capital and trading markets,



•inability to collect accounts receivable,



•restrictive governmental actions (such as restrictions on transfer of funds and trade protection measures, including export duties, quotas, customs duties, border taxes, increased import or export controls and tariffs) that could negatively impact trade between, or increase the cost of operating in, the countries in which we do business,



•changes in, or non-compliance with, legal or regulatory import/export requirements, including restrictions on selling to certain customers or into certain jurisdictions,



•natural disasters, acts of terrorism, widespread illness and war,



•unauthorized transfers of our electronic information and breaches of our information systems, as well as the potential lack of adequate remedies in certain jurisdictions,



•difficulty in obtaining distribution and support,



•cultural differences in the conduct of business,



•direct or indirect government actions, subsidies or policies aimed at supporting local industry,



•the laws and policies of the United States and other countries affecting trade, foreign investment and loans, foreign travel, and import or export licensing requirements,



•withdrawal from, or renegotiation of, existing trade agreements by the United States (or other jurisdictions) potentially affecting Mexico, China, and other countries in which we do business,



•changes in current or future tax law or regulations or new interpretations thereof, by federal or state agencies or foreign governments (including changes in certain countries in Europe and elsewhere regarding corporate taxes, transfer pricing, and tax treaty provisions),



•changes in the effective tax rate as a result of our overall profitability and mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates,



•results of audits and examination of previously filed tax returns, 



•the possibility of being exposed to legal proceedings and potential penalties in a foreign jurisdiction, and/or increased compliance expense, as a result of the numerous, and sometimes conflicting, legal regimes on matters as diverse as anti-corruption, anti-bribery, import/export controls, content requirements, trade restrictions, tariffs, taxation, sanctions, immigration, internal and disclosure control obligations, securities regulation, anti-competition, data privacy and protection (including, but not limited to, the European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation), employment and labor relations, 



•limitations on our ability under local laws to protect or enforce our intellectual property rights in a particular foreign jurisdiction, and



•restrictions on our ability to repatriate foreign earnings and/or funds and the unfavorable tax impactions related to the same.
Additionally, we are subject to risks in certain global markets in which wireless operators provide subsidies on handset sales to their customers.
Limitations or changes in policy on phone subsidies in the United States, South Korea, Japan, China, and other countries may have additional negative impacts on our revenues.
Some of the countries in which we operate and seek to expand are in emerging markets where legal systems may be less developed or familiar to us.
Other jurisdictions in which we conduct business may establish legal and regulatory regimes that differ materially from United States laws and regulations.
Compliance with diverse legal requirements is costly and time-consuming and requires significant resources.
We are particularly exposed to risks of doing business in China.
Although we intend to expand our business and operations in China, our success in the Chinese markets may be adversely affected by China’s continuously evolving laws and regulations, including those relating to taxation, import and export tariffs, currency controls, anti-corruption, environmental regulations, indigenous innovation, and intellectual property rights and enforcement of those rights.
Enforcement of existing laws or agreements may be inconsistent.
In particular, the imposition by the United States of tariffs on goods imported from China or deemed to be of Chinese origin and other government actions that restrict our ability to sell our products to Chinese customers or to manufacture or source components in China, and countermeasures imposed by China in response, could directly or indirectly adversely impact our manufacturing costs and the sales of our products in China and elsewhere.
For example, in May 2019, the U.S. Bureau of Industry and Security of the U.S. Department of Commerce placed Huawei Technologies Co., Ltd. and certain of its affiliates on the Bureau’s Entity List, which resulted in our temporarily suspending shipments to Huawei, and which is expected to adversely affect future demand for our products from this customer.
