For the six months ended June 29, 2019, our net sales increased 53% year-over-year to $297.8 million. The increase in our net sales was driven by the acquisition of Xcerra Corporation, completed on October 1, 2018, and our results in the first six months of 2019 included sales of $157.6 million contributed by this acquired business. Excluding the impact of the additional sales from Xcerra, our net sales decreased year over year. Current market weakness is being driven by lower smartphone unit shipments, weaker automotive semiconductor demand and ongoing softness in the China market that is in part related to trade tensions between the U.S. and China and the impact of export restrictions to Huawei on our customers. 
The global semiconductor market grew in 2018 reaching a peak in the second quarter with business conditions softening during the second half of 2018. This weakness has continued through the first six months of 2019 and customer test cell utilization remains below levels that have historically triggered the need for additional capacity. The current near term outlook for the semiconductor industry for 2019 assumes slower electronic equipment demand and slower growth for the global economy. Despite the near term weakness, we remain optimistic about the long-term prospects for our business due to increasing ubiquity of semiconductors, the future rollout of 5G networks, diminishing impact of parallel test, increasing semiconductor complexity, increasing quality demands from semiconductor customers, and continued proliferation of electronics in a variety of products across the automotive, mobility and industrial markets. We are focused on growing our market share with semiconductor and electronics manufacturers and test subcontractors.

Below, we discuss these policies further, as well as the estimates and judgments involved. We also have other policies that we consider key accounting policies; however, these policies typically do not require us to make estimates or judgments that are difficult or subjective. 
We conduct our annual impairment test as of October 1st of each year, and have determined there was no impairment as of October 1, 2018, as we determined that the estimated fair values of our reporting units exceeded their carrying values on that date. Other events and changes in circumstances may also require goodwill to be tested for impairment between annual measurement dates. As of June 29, 2019, we do not believe that circumstances have occurred that indicate impairment of our goodwill is more-likely-than-not. In the event we determine that an interim goodwill impairment review is required, in a future period, the review may result in an impairment charge, which would have a negative impact on our results of operations. 
Long-lived assets, other than goodwill, are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets might not be recoverable. Conditions that would necessitate an impairment assessment include a significant decline in the observable market value of an asset, a significant change in the extent or manner in which an asset is used, or any other significant adverse change that would indicate that the carrying amount of an asset or group of assets may not be recoverable. For long-lived assets, impairment losses are only recorded if the asset’s carrying amount is not recoverable through its undiscounted, probability-weighted future cash flows. We measure the impairment loss based on the difference between the carrying amount and estimated fair value. 
Our consolidated net sales increased 50.3% to $150.0 million in 2019, compared to $99.8 million in 2018. On October 1, 2018, we completed the acquisition of Xcerra and our net sales for the second fiscal quarter of 2019 include $75.1 million of net sales recognized by this business and is the driver of the increase in our net sales. Excluding the impact of the additional sales from Xcerra, net sales decreased year over year as a result of softer demand for smartphones, weaker automotive semiconductor demand, ongoing softness in the China market that is in part related to trade tensions between the U.S. and China and export restrictions. 
Our gross margin can be impacted by charges to cost of sales related to excess, obsolete and lower of cost or net realizable value inventory issues. We compute the majority of our excess and obsolete inventory reserve requirements using a one-year inventory usage forecast. In both the second quarter of 2019 and 2018, we recorded charges to cost of sales of $0.5 million for excess and obsolete inventory. Additionally, as part of the integration and restructuring activities related to Xcerra we recorded $19.1 million of inventory related charges related to the decision to end manufacturing of certain of Xcerra’s semiconductor test handler products in the fourth quarter of 2018 which included amounts associated with non-cancelable supplier commitments. During the second quarter of 2019, our gross margin benefitted by $1.3 million comprised of $2.1 million from the reversal of liabilities related to supplier commitments offset, in part, by $0.8 million of additional inventory related charges related to ending the manufacturing of these products. 
See Note 2, “Business Acquisitions, Goodwill and Purchased Intangible Assets” in Part I, Item 1 of this Form 10-Q for additional information with respect to intangible assets. 
Subsequent to the acquisition of Xcerra on October 1, 2018, during fourth quarter 2018, we began a strategic restructuring program designed to reposition our organization and improve our cost structure as part of our targeted integration plan regarding Xcerra and recorded restructuring charges, exclusive of the inventory related amounts described above, totaling $8.5 million in the second fiscal quarter of 2019. 
See Note 4, “Restructuring Charges” in Part I, Item 1 of this Form 10-Q for additional information with respect to restructuring charges. 
Interest income was $0.2 million and $0.3 million in the second fiscal quarter of 2019 and 2018, respectively. 
As a result of the factors set forth above, both loss from continuing operations and net loss was $19.4 million in 2019. Both income from continuing operations and net income was $11.6 million in 2018. 
Our consolidated net sales increased 52.8% to $297.8 million in 2019, compared to $195.0 million in 2018. On October 1, 2018, we completed the acquisition of Xcerra and our net sales for the first six months of 2019 include $157.6 million of net sales recognized by this business and is the driver of the increase in our net sales. Excluding the impact of the additional sales from Xcerra, net sales decreased year over year as a result of softer demand for smartphones, weaker automotive semiconductor demand, ongoing softness in the China market that is in part related to trade tensions between the U.S. and China and export restrictions. 
Our cost of sales was impacted by the amortization of inventory step-up related to fair value adjustments to inventory acquired in business combinations. During the first six months of 2019, we amortized $6.0 million of inventory step-up related to our acquisition of Xcerra. There was no inventory step-up amortized in the corresponding period of 2018. 
In the first six months of fiscal 2019 and 2018 we recorded charges to cost of sales of approximately $0.8 million and $0.6 million for excess and obsolete inventory, respectively. Additionally, as part of the integration and restructuring activities related to Xcerra we recorded $19.1 million of inventory related charges related to the decision to end manufacturing of certain of Xcerra’s semiconductor test handler products in the fourth quarter of 2018 which included amounts associated with non-cancelable supplier commitments. During the second quarter of 2019, our gross margin benefitted by $0.8 million comprised of $2.1 million from the reversal of liabilities related to supplier commitments offset, in part, by $1.3 million of additional inventory related charges related to ending the manufacturing of these products. While we believe our reserves for excess and obsolete inventory and lower of cost or market concerns are adequate to cover known exposures at June 29, 2019, reductions in customer forecasts or continued modifications to products, as a result of our failure to meet specifications or other customer requirements, may result in additional charges to operations that could negatively impact our results of operations and gross margin in future periods. 
The ETR on income or loss from continuing operations for the six months ended June 29, 2019 and June 30, 2018, was 2.6% and 18.9%, respectively. The tax provision on income or loss from continuing operations in 2019 and 2018 differs from the U.S. federal statutory rate primarily due to foreign income taxed at different rates, changes in our deferred tax asset valuation allowance, state taxes and interest related to unrecognized tax benefits.  
There was no material change to our unrecognized tax benefits and related accrued interest and penalties during the six-month periods ended June 29, 2019 and June 30, 2018. 
As a result of the factors set forth above, our loss from continuing operations and net loss was $42.2 million and $42.0 million in 2019, respectively, as compared to income from continuing operations and net income of $19.8 million in 2018. 
On October 1, 2018, we entered into a bank credit agreement which provides for a $350.0 million seven-year Term B Loan facility and borrowed the full amount. The Term B Loan facility matures on October 1, 2025. These proceeds were used on October 1, 2018, together with our cash and cash equivalents, to finance the acquisition of Xcerra. See Note 3 “Borrowings and Credit Agreements” included in Part I, Item 1 of this Form 10-Q. 
At June 29, 2019, our total indebtedness, net of discount and deferred financing costs, was $348.5 million, which included $339.4 million outstanding under the Term B Loan, $4.2 million outstanding under Kita’s term loans, $3.2 million outstanding under Kita’s lines of credit, and $1.7 million outstanding under Xcerra’s term loan. 
In addition to the bank credit agreement which provides for a $350.0 million seven-year Term B Loan facility as described above, we have access to other credit facilities to finance our operations if needed. 
As a result of our acquisition of Xcerra, we assumed a term loan related to the purchase of Xcerra’s facility in Rosenheim, Germany. The loan is payable over 10 years at an annual interest rate of 2.35%. Principal plus accrued interest is due quarterly over the duration of the term loan. At June 29, 2019, the outstanding loan balance was $1.7 million and $0.3 million of the outstanding balance is presented as current installments of long-term debt in our condensed consolidated balance sheets. The term loan is denominated in Euros and, as a result, amounts disclosed herein will fluctuate because of changes in currency exchange rates. 
In connection with the acquisition of Kita on January 4, 2017, we assumed a series of revolving credit agreements with various financial institutions in Japan. The credit facilities renew monthly and provide Kita with access to working capital totaling up to $6.5 million. At June 29, 2019, total borrowings outstanding under the revolving lines of credit were $3.2 million. As these credit facility agreements renew monthly, they have been included in short-term borrowings in our condensed consolidated balance sheet. We also have long-term term loans from a series of Japanese financial institutions totaling $4.2 million primarily related to the expansion of Kita’s facility in Osaka, Japan. The loans are collateralized by the facility and land. The loans carry interest rates ranging from 0.05% to 0.45% and expire at various dates through 2034. At June 29, 2019, $0.5 million of the term loans have been included in current installments of long-term debt in our condensed consolidated balance sheet. The revolving lines of credit and term loans are denominated in Japanese Yen and, as a result, amounts will fluctuate as a result of changes in currency exchange rates. 
We also have a credit agreement with a financial institution under which it administers a line of credit on behalf of our wholly owned Ismeca subsidiary. The agreement provides Ismeca with 2.0 million Swiss Francs of available credit and at June 29, 2019, no amounts were outstanding. 
We have a letter of credit facility (the “LC Facility”) under which Bank of America, N.A., has agreed to administer the issuance of letters of credit on our behalf. The LC Facility requires us to maintain deposits of cash or other approved investments in amounts that approximate our outstanding letters of credit and contains customary restrictive covenants. In addition, our wholly owned subsidiary, Xcerra, has arrangements with various financial institutions for the issuance of letters of credit and bank guarantees. As of June 29, 2019, $1.7 million was outstanding under standby letters of credit and bank guarantees. 
We expect that we will continue to make capital expenditures to support our business and we anticipate that present working capital will be sufficient to meet our operating requirements for at least the next twelve months.
