For the nine months ended September 28, 2019, our net sales increased 57% year-over-year to $441.3 million. The increase in our net sales was driven by the acquisition of Xcerra Corporation, completed on October 1, 2018, and our results in the first nine months of 2019 included sales of $238.9 million contributed by this acquired business. Current market weakness is being driven by lower smartphone unit shipments, weaker automotive semiconductor demand and ongoing softness in the China market that is in part related to trade tensions between the U.S. and China and the impact of export restrictions to Huawei on our customers. 
The global semiconductor market grew in 2018 reaching a peak in the second quarter with business conditions softening during the second half of 2018. This weakness has continued through the first nine months of 2019 and customer test cell utilization remains below levels that have historically triggered the need for additional capacity. The current near-term outlook for the semiconductor industry for the remainder of 2019 assumes slower electronic equipment demand and slower growth for the global economy. Despite the near-term weakness, we remain optimistic about the long-term prospects for our business due to increasing ubiquity of semiconductors, the future rollout of 5G networks, diminishing impact of parallel test, increasing semiconductor complexity, increasing quality demands from semiconductor customers, and continued proliferation of electronics in a variety of products across the automotive, mobility and industrial markets. We are focused on growing our market share with semiconductor and electronics manufacturers and test subcontractors. 
Application of Critical Accounting Estimates and Policies 
Table of Contents  
Cohu, Inc.
revenue recognition, including the deferral of revenue on sales to customers, which impacts our results of operations;    
estimation of valuation allowances and accrued liabilities, specifically product warranty, inventory reserves and allowance for bad debts, which impact gross margin or operating expenses;    
the assessment of recoverability of long-lived assets including goodwill and other intangible assets, which primarily impacts gross margin or operating expenses if we are required to record impairments of assets or accelerate their depreciation or amortization; and    
the valuation and recognition of share-based compensation, which impacts gross margin, research and development expense, and selling, general and administrative expense.    
Below, we discuss these policies further, as well as the estimates and judgments involved. We also have other policies that we consider key accounting policies; however, these policies typically do not require us to make estimates or judgments that are difficult or subjective.

Long-lived assets, other than goodwill, are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets might not be recoverable. Conditions that would necessitate an impairment assessment include a significant decline in the observable market value of an asset, a significant change in the extent or manner in which an asset is used, or any other significant adverse change that would indicate that the carrying amount of an asset or group of assets may not be recoverable. For long-lived assets, impairment losses are only recorded if the asset’s carrying amount is not recoverable through its undiscounted, probability-weighted future cash flows. We measure the impairment loss based on the difference between the carrying amount and estimated fair value.

Third Quarter of Fiscal 2019 Compared to Third Quarter of Fiscal 2018 
Net Sales 
Our consolidated net sales increased 66.5% to $143.5 million in 2019, compared to $86.2 million in 2018. On October 1, 2018, we completed the acquisition of Xcerra and our net sales for the third fiscal quarter of 2019 include $81.3 million of net sales recognized by this business and is the driver of the increase in our net sales. Excluding the impact of the additional sales from Xcerra, net sales decreased year over year as a result of softer demand for smartphones, weaker automotive semiconductor demand, ongoing softness in the China market that is in part related to trade tensions between the U.S. and China and export restrictions.

Gross Margin (exclusive of amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets described below) 
Our gross margin can be impacted by charges to cost of sales related to excess, obsolete and lower of cost or net realizable value inventory issues. We compute the majority of our excess and obsolete inventory reserve requirements using a one-year inventory usage forecast. During the third quarter of 2019 and 2018, we recorded charges to cost of sales of $1.5 million and $0.7 million for excess and obsolete inventory, respectively. Additionally, as part of the integration and restructuring activities related to Xcerra we recorded $19.1 million of inventory related charges related to the decision to end manufacturing of certain of Xcerra’s semiconductor test handler products in the fourth quarter of 2018 which included amounts associated with non-cancelable supplier commitments.

Interest Expense and Income 
Interest expense was $5.0 million in the third fiscal quarter of 2019 as compared to $11,000 in the corresponding period of 2018. The increase was driven primarily by interest associated with the Term B Loan obtained to finance part of the purchase price of Xcerra.

Net Sales 
Our consolidated net sales increased 57.0% to $441.3 million in 2019, compared to $281.1 million in 2018. On October 1, 2018, we completed the acquisition of Xcerra and our net sales for the first nine months of 2019 include $238.9 million of net sales recognized by this business and is the driver of the increase in our net sales. Excluding the impact of the additional sales from Xcerra, net sales decreased year over year as a result of softer demand for smartphones, weaker automotive semiconductor demand, ongoing softness in the China market that is in part related to trade tensions between the U.S. and China and export restrictions.

Interest income was $0.6 million and $0.9 million in the first nine months of 2019 and 2018, respectively. 
The ETR on income or loss from continuing operations for the nine months ended September 28, 2019 and September 29, 2018, was (0.3)% and 21.9%, respectively. The tax provision on income or loss from continuing operations in 2019 and 2018 differs from the U.S. federal statutory rate primarily due to foreign income taxed at different rates, changes in our deferred tax asset valuation allowance, withholding tax, state taxes and interest related to unrecognized tax benefits.  
There was no material change to our unrecognized tax benefits and related accrued interest and penalties during the nine-month periods ended September 28, 2019 and September 29, 2018. 
Income from Continuing Operations and Net Income 
As a result of the factors set forth above, our loss from continuing operations and net loss was $52.7 million and $52.4 million in 2019, respectively, as compared to income from continuing operations and net income of $24.6 million in 2018. 
Our primary historical source of liquidity and capital resources has been cash flow generated by our operations and we manage our businesses to maximize operating cash flows as our primary source of liquidity. We use cash to fund growth in our operating assets and to fund new products and product enhancements primarily through research and development. As of September 28, 2019, $82.5 million or 56.6% of our cash and cash equivalents was held by our foreign subsidiaries. If these funds are needed for our operations in the U.S., we may be required to accrue and pay foreign withholding taxes if we repatriate these funds. Except for working capital requirements in certain jurisdictions, we provide for all withholding and other residual taxes related to unremitted earnings of our foreign subsidiaries. Beginning in 2018, earnings realized in foreign jurisdictions will be subject to U.S. tax in accordance with the Tax Act. 
On October 1, 2018, we entered into a bank credit agreement which provides for a $350.0 million seven-year Term B Loan facility and borrowed the full amount. The Term B Loan facility matures on October 1, 2025. These proceeds were used on October 1, 2018, together with our cash and cash equivalents and newly issued Cohu common stock, to finance the acquisition of Xcerra. See Note 3 “Borrowings and Credit Agreements” included in Part I, Item 1 of this Form 10-Q.

In addition to the bank credit agreement which provides for a $350.0 million seven-year Term B Loan facility as described above, we have access to other credit facilities to finance our operations if needed. 
As a result of our acquisition of Xcerra, we assumed a term loan related to the purchase of Xcerra’s facility in Rosenheim, Germany. The loan is payable over 10 years at an annual interest rate of 2.35%. Principal plus accrued interest is due quarterly over the duration of the term loan. At September 28, 2019, the outstanding loan balance was $1.5 million and $0.3 million of the outstanding balance is presented as current installments of long-term debt in our condensed consolidated balance sheets. The term loan is denominated in Euros and, as a result, amounts disclosed herein will fluctuate because of changes in currency exchange rates. 
In connection with the acquisition of Kita on January 4, 2017, we assumed a series of revolving credit agreements with various financial institutions in Japan. The credit facilities renew monthly and provide Kita with access to working capital totaling up to $8.9 million. At September 28, 2019, total borrowings outstanding under the revolving lines of credit were $3.3 million. As these credit facility agreements renew monthly, they have been included in short-term borrowings in our condensed consolidated balance sheet. We also have long-term term loans from a series of Japanese financial institutions totaling $4.0 million primarily related to the expansion of Kita’s facility in Osaka, Japan. The loans are collateralized by the facility and land. The loans carry interest rates ranging from 0.05% to 0.44% and expire at various dates through 2034. At September 28, 2019, $0.5 million of the term loans have been included in current installments of long-term debt in our condensed consolidated balance sheet. The revolving lines of credit and term loans are denominated in Japanese Yen and, as a result, amounts will fluctuate as a result of changes in currency exchange rates. 
On July 26, 2019, our wholly owned subsidiary Rasco GmbH entered into a term loan agreement with a financial institution that provides it with €3.4 million (Euro) that is being used to finance the expansion of our facility in Kolbermoor, Germany. The facility expansion project will allow us to combine the operations of multiple subsidiaries in one location as part of our strategic restructuring program. The loan is secured by the land and the existing building on the site. Interest on the loan is payable quarterly and is fixed for 10 years at an annual interest rate of 0.8%. Principal repayments will be made over 8 years starting at the end of 2021. Only interest will be due each quarter starting in September 2019 and principal plus accrued interest will be due each quarter starting at the end of December, 2021. At September 28, 2019, the outstanding loan balance was $3.7 million with none of the outstanding balance being presented as current installments of long-term debt in our consolidated balance sheets based on contractual due dates. The term loan is denominated in Euros and, as a result, amounts disclosed herein will fluctuate because of changes in currency exchange rates.

We also have a credit agreement with a financial institution under which it administers a line of credit on behalf of our wholly owned Ismeca subsidiary. The agreement provides Ismeca with 2.0 million Swiss Francs of available credit and at September 28, 2019, no amounts were outstanding. 
We have a letter of credit facility (the “LC Facility”) under which Bank of America, N.A., has agreed to administer the issuance of letters of credit on our behalf. The LC Facility requires us to maintain deposits of cash or other approved investments in amounts that approximate our outstanding letters of credit and contains customary restrictive covenants. In addition, our wholly owned subsidiary, Xcerra, has arrangements with various financial institutions for the issuance of letters of credit and bank guarantees. As of September 28, 2019, $1.3 million was outstanding under standby letters of credit and bank guarantees. 
We expect that we will continue to make capital expenditures to support our business and we anticipate that present working capital will be sufficient to meet our operating requirements for at least the next twelve months.
