Our Company  
We are a leading provider of data storage technology and solutions. Our principal products are hard disk drives, commonly referred to as disk drives, hard drives or HDDs. In addition to HDDs, we produce a broad range of data storage products including solid state drives (SSD) and their related controllers, solid state hybrid drives (SSHD) and storage subsystems.  
Hard disk drives are devices that store digitally encoded data on rapidly rotating disks with magnetic surfaces. Disk drives continue to be the primary medium of mass data storage due to their performance attributes, high quality and cost effectiveness. Complementing existing data center storage architecture, solid-state storage devices use integrated circuit assemblies as memory to store data with most SSDs using NAND-based flash memory. In addition to HDDs and SSDs, SSHDs combine the features of SSDs and HDDs in the same unit, containing a large hard disk drive and an SSD cache to improve performance of frequently accessed data.  
Our cloud systems and solutions extend innovation from the device into the information infrastructure, onsite and in the cloud. Our portfolio includes modular original equipment manufacturer (OEM) storage systems and scale-out storage servers.  
Overview of the December 2017 Quarter  
Revenue  
Compared to the December 2016 quarter, revenue in the December 2017 quarter increased modestly primarily due to increase in exabytes shipped, offset by price erosion.  
Revenue for the six months ended December 2017 quarter decreased by $145 million from the six months ended December 2016 quarter as a result of price erosion, partially offset by an improved product mix.  
Cost of Revenue and Gross Margin  
Gross margin as a percentage of revenue for the December 2017 quarter increased by 200 basis points from the September 2017 quarter primarily driven by favorable product mix and improved absorption of factories due to higher demand for the Companys high capacity HDD product portfolio, partially offset by price erosion.  
Compared to the corresponding three and six months ended December 2016 quarter, gross margin as a percentage of revenue for the three and six months ended December 2017 quarter decreased by 100 basis points in both periods, primarily driven by price erosion, partially offset by favorable product mix and improved factory utilization resulting from cost savings due to our workforce reductions and manufacturing consolidation activities.  
In the December 2017 quarter, total warranty cost was within the historical range of 1% to 1.5% of revenue and included a favorable change in estimates of prior warranty accruals of less than 0.2% of revenue. Warranty cost related to new shipments was 1.4%, 1.3%, and 1.2% of revenue for each of the December 2017, September 2017 and December 2016 quarters, respectively.  
Operating Expenses  
Product development expense. Product development expense for the December 2017 quarter decreased by $13 million from the September 2017 quarter primarily due to a $4 million decrease in salaries and employee benefits as a result of the restructuring of our workforce in prior periods, a $13 million decrease due to related operational efficiencies, partially offset by an increase in variable compensation expense.  
Compared to corresponding six months ended December 2016 quarter, product development expense decreased by $107 million primarily due to a $47 million decrease in salaries and employee benefits as a result of the restructuring of our workforce in prior periods, a $36 million decrease due to related operational efficiencies and a $24 million decrease in variable compensation and share-based compensation expenses.  
Marketing and administrative expense. Marketing and administrative expense for the December 2017 quarter decreased by $3 million from the September 2017 quarter primarily due to a decrease in salaries and related benefits as a result of the restructuring of our workforce in prior periods, partially offset by an increase in variable compensation expense.

Amortization of intangibles. Amortization of intangibles for the three and six months ended December 2017 quarter decreased by $3 million, $9 million and $16 million respectively, from the three months ended September 2017 quarter and the three and six months ended December 2016 quarter due to certain intangible assets reaching the end of their useful life.  
Restructuring and other, net. Restructuring and other, net for the three and six months ended December 2017 quarter was comprised of restructuring charges to reduce our global workforce by 500 and 1100 employees, respectively.  
Other Expense, Net  
Other expense, net decreased by $5 million from the September 2017 quarter primarily due to a favorable $9 million change in foreign currency exchange rates, partially offset by a $2 million loss on repurchase of debt in the December 2017 quarter.  
Compared to December 2016 quarter, Other expense, net increased by $2 million in the December 2017 quarter primarily due to a $16 million of unfavorable change in foreign currency exchange rates and a $10 million increase in interest expense on the issuance of $750 million of 4.25% Senior Notes due 2022 and $500 million of 4.875% Senior Notes due 2024 in the quarter ended March 31, 2017, offset by the absence of a $25 million charge related to the impairment of a strategic investment in the December 2016 quarter.  
Other expense, net for the six months ended December 2017 quarter increased by $20 million from the corresponding period in the prior year, primarily due to a $22 million increase in interest expense on the issuance of $750 million of 4.25% Senior Notes due 2022 and $500 million of 4.875% Senior Notes due 2024, a $26 million unfavorable change in foreign currency exchange rates, offset by the absence of a $25 million charge related to the impairment of a strategic investment in the December 2016 quarter.
