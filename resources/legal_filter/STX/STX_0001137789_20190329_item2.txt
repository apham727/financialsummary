Our Company  
We are a leading provider of data storage technology and solutions. Our principal products are hard disk drives, commonly referred to as disk drives, hard drives or HDDs. In addition to HDDs, we produce a broad range of data storage products including solid state drives (SSD) and storage subsystems.  
Hard disk drives are devices that store digitally encoded data on rapidly rotating disks with magnetic surfaces. Disk drives continue to be the primary medium of mass data storage due to their performance attributes, high quality and cost effectiveness. Complementing existing data center storage architecture, solid-state storage devices use integrated circuit assemblies as memory to store data, and most SSDs use NAND flash memory.  
Our HDD products are designed for mission critical and nearline applications in enterprise servers and storage systems; edge compute applications, where our products are designed primarily for desktop and mobile computing; and edge non-compute applications, where our products are designed for a wide variety of end user devices such as portable external storage systems, surveillance systems, digital video recorders (DVRs), network-attached storage (NAS) and gaming consoles. Our SSD products mainly include serial attached SCSI (SAS) and Non-Volatile Memory Express (NVMe) SSDs.  
Our enterprise data solutions (formerly referred to as the cloud systems and solutions) portfolio includes modular original equipment manufacturer (OEM) storage systems and scale-out storage servers.  
Overview of the March 2019 quarter  
During the March 2019 quarter, we shipped 77 exabytes of HDD storage capacity. We generated revenue of approximately $2.3 billion, gross margin of 26% and our operating cash flow was $438 million. We repurchased approximately 7 million of our ordinary shares for $327 million and paid $178 million in dividends. We entered into a new senior unsecured revolving credit facility (the 2019 Revolving Credit Facility) and borrowed $200 million from the 2019 Revolving Credit Facility.

Revenue  
Revenue for the nine months ended March 29, 2019 decreased by $330 million from the nine months ended March 30, 2018 primarily due to price erosion, partially offset by an increase in exabytes shipped.  
Cost of Revenue and Gross Margin  
Compared to the March 2018 quarter, gross margin as a percentage of revenue for the March 2019 quarter decreased primarily driven by price erosion and factory underutilization.  
Compared to the nine months ended March 29, 2019, gross margin as a percentage of revenue for the nine months ended March 30, 2018 remained flat primarily driven by favorable product mix offset by price erosion.  
In the March 2019 quarter, total warranty cost was 0.6% of revenue and included a favorable change in estimates of prior warranty accruals of 0.5% of revenue due to improvements in return rates on newer generation products. Warranty cost related to new shipments was 1.1%, 1.1% and 1.3% of revenue for the March 2019, December 2018 and March 2018 quarters, respectively.  
Table of Contents 
Amortization of intangibles. Amortization of intangibles for the March 2019 quarter remained flat compared to the December 2018 quarter and March 2018 quarter. Amortization of intangibles for the nine months ended March 29, 2019 decreased by $30 million from the nine months ended March 30, 2018 due to certain intangible assets reaching the end of their useful lives.  
Restructuring and other, net. Restructuring and other, net for nine months ended March 29, 2019 was comprised of charges primarily related to a voluntary early exit program. There was no new restructuring plan in the March 2019 quarter.

Other Expense, Net  
Table of Contents 
Other expense, net. Other expense, net for the March 2019 quarter remained flat compared to the December 2018 quarter.  
Compared to the March 2018 quarter, Other expense, net for the March 2019 quarter decreased by $27 million primarily due to a $16 million increase in interest income on our investment in a debt security, a $9 million net increase in gains due to favorable changes in foreign currency exchange rates, a $6 million decrease in interest expense due to the repayment of certain senior notes, a $3 million decrease due to impairment charge of a strategic investment that did not recur in fiscal year 2019, offset by a $5 million decrease in interest income primarily due to lower average invested balances.  
Other expense, net for the nine months ended March 29, 2019 decreased by $103 million from the corresponding period in the prior year, primarily due to a $47 million increase in interest income on our investment in a debt security, a $43 million net increase in gains due to favorable changes in foreign currency exchange rates and a $14 million decrease in interest expense due to the repayment of certain senior notes.  
Table of Contents 
We recorded income tax provisions of $20 million and $52 million in the three and nine months ended March 29, 2019, respectively. The income tax provision for the three and nine months ended March 29, 2019 included approximately $9 million and $5 million of net discrete tax expense, respectively, primarily associated with a deferred withholding tax liability resulting from a change in indefinite reinvestment assertion for a foreign subsidiary. This was partially offset by the recognition of previously unrecognized tax benefits related to the expiration of certain statutes of limitation.  
Our income tax provision was $12 million and $231 million in the three and nine months ended March 30, 2018, respectively. The income tax provision for the three and nine months ended March 30, 2018 included approximately $2 million of net discrete tax benefit and approximately $195 million of net discrete tax expense, respectively. The discrete items for the nine months ended March 30, 2018 are primarily associated with the revaluation of U.S. deferred tax assets as a result of the enactment of the Tax Act on December 22, 2017, partially offset by the recognition of previously unrecognized tax benefits associated with the expiration of certain statutes of limitation.
