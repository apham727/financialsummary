We are a leading provider of data storage technology and solutions. Our principal products are hard disk drives, commonly referred to as disk drives, hard drives or HDDs. In addition to HDDs, we produce a broad range of data storage products including solid state drives (SSD) and storage subsystems.  
Hard disk drives are devices that store digitally encoded data on rapidly rotating disks with magnetic surfaces. Disk drives continue to be the primary medium of mass data storage due to their performance attributes, high quality and cost effectiveness. Complementing existing data center storage architecture, solid-state storage devices use integrated circuit assemblies as memory to store data, and most SSDs use NAND flash memory.  
Our HDD products are designed for mission critical and nearline applications in enterprise servers and storage systems; edge compute applications, where our products are designed primarily for desktop and mobile computing; and edge non-compute applications, where our products are designed for a wide variety of end user devices such as portable external storage systems, surveillance systems, digital video recorders (DVRs), network-attached storage (NAS) and gaming consoles. Our SSD products mainly include serial attached SCSI (SAS) and Non-Volatile Memory Express (NVMe) SSDs.  
Our enterprise data solutions (formerly referred to as the cloud systems and solutions) portfolio includes modular original equipment manufacturer (OEM) storage systems and scale-out storage servers.  
During the December 2018 quarter, we shipped 87 exabytes of HDD storage capacity. We generated revenue of approximately $2.7 billion, gross margin of 29% and our operating cash flow was $288 million. We paid $499 million towards the maturity of our 2018 Senior Notes, $180 million in dividends and repurchased approximately 3 million of our ordinary shares for $136 million.  
Revenue in the December 2018 quarter decreased by $199 million from the December 2017 quarter primarily due to price erosion.  
Revenue for the six months ended December 28, 2018 increased by $160 million from the six months ended December 29, 2017 as a result of an increase in exabytes shipped due to higher demand for our high capacity HDD product portfolio, partially offset by price erosion.  
Gross margin as a percentage of revenue for the December 2018 quarter decreased from the September 2018 quarter primarily driven by price erosion and unfavorable product mix.

Compared to the six months ended December 29, 2017, gross margin as a percentage of revenue for the six months ended December 28, 2018 increased primarily driven by favorable product mix and improved factory utilization as a result of increased revenue from our high capacity HDD product portfolio, partially offset by a decline in prices for NAND flash memory and general price erosion.  
In the December 2018 quarter, total warranty cost was 0.6% of revenue and included a favorable change in estimates of prior warranty accruals of 0.5% of revenue due to improvements in return rates on newer generation products. Warranty cost related to new shipments was 1.1%, 1.2% and 1.4% of revenue for the December 2018, September 2018 and December 2017 quarters, respectively.
