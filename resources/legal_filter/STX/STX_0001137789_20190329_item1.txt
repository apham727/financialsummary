Summary of Significant Accounting Policies  
Revenue Recognition  
Revenue from sales of products is generally recognized upon transfer of control to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration the Company expects to receive in exchange for those products, net of sales taxes. This typically occurs upon shipment from the Company. When applicable, the Company includes shipping charges billed to customers in Revenue and includes the related shipping costs in Cost of revenue on the Companys Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations.  
Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements  
In February 2016 and July 2018, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standard Update (ASU) 2016-02 (ASC Topic 842), Leases ASU 2018-10, Codification Improvements to Topic 842, and Leases, ASU 2018-11, Leases (ASC Topic 842), Target Improvements, respectively. These ASUs amend a number of aspects of lease accounting, including requiring lessees to recognize operating leases with a term greater than one year on their balance sheet as a right-of-use asset and corresponding lease liability, measured at the present value of the lease payments. The Company plans to adopt this guidance in the first quarter of fiscal year 2020. The Company is in the process of assessing the impact of these ASUs on its condensed consolidated financial statements.  
Table of Contents 
In August 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-15 (ASC Subtopic 350-40), Intangibles - Goodwill and Other - Internal-Use Software - Customers Accounting for Implementation Costs Incurred in a Cloud Computing Arrangement That is a Service Contract. This ASU aligns the accounting for capitalizing implementation costs incurred in a hosting arrangement that is a service contract with the accounting for implementation costs incurred to develop or obtain internal-use software. The Company is required to adopt the guidance in the first quarter of fiscal year 2021. Early adoption is permitted. The Company is in the process of assessing the impact of this ASU on its condensed consolidated financial statements.  
Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements  
In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-09 (ASC Topic 606), Revenue from Contracts with Customers, and FASB also issued certain interpretive clarifications on this new guidance which outlines a single comprehensive model for entities to use in accounting for revenue arising from contracts with customers and supersedes the revenue recognition guidance under ASC 605. It also requires entities to disclose both quantitative and qualitative information that enable financial statements users to understand the nature, amount, timing, and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from contracts with customers. This ASU became effective and was adopted by the Company in the September 2018 quarter retrospectively with a cumulative adjustment to accumulated deficit at the date of adoption (modified retrospective transition approach). The Company has completed the adoption and implemented policies, processes and controls to support the new standards measurement and disclosure requirements.  
The impact of applying the new accounting standard on the Companys condensed consolidated financial statements for the three and nine months ended March 29, 2019 was not material.

Investment in Debt Security  
As of March 29, 2019 and June 29, 2018, the Company had approximately $1.3 billion investment in non-convertible preferred stock of Toshiba Memory Corporation (TMC, formerly known as K.K. Pangea). The Company has the positive intent and ability to hold the investment until maturity. As such, the investment, with a contractual maturity of six years starting from May 31, 2018, is accounted for as a held-to-maturity debt security, carried at cost and adjusted for amortization of transaction costs into interest income. Additionally, the debt security has a contractual payment-in-kind (PIK) income which will be paid in cash upon redemption of the investment. PIK income computed at the contractual rate is accrued into Interest income in the Companys Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations and added to the carrying value of the Investment in debt security on its Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. For the three and nine months ended March 29, 2019, the PIK income earned was $16 million and $47 million, respectively. There was no other-than-temporary impairment identified for the three and nine months ended March 29, 2019. Please refer to Note 8 - Fair Value for more details.

An aggregate amount of up to $75 million of the facility is available for the issuance of letters of credit, and an aggregate amount of up to $50 million of the facility is also available for swing line loans.  
As of March 29, 2019, $200 million had been drawn and no letters of credit or swing line loans had been utilized under the 2019 Revolving Credit Facility.

The Company is exposed to foreign currency exchange rate, interest rate, and to a lesser extent, equity market risks relating to its ongoing business operations. From time to time, the Company enters into cash flow hedges in the form of foreign currency forward exchange contracts in order to manage the foreign currency exchange rate risk on forecasted expenses and investments denominated in foreign currencies. The Companys accounting policies for these instruments are based on whether the instruments are classified as designated or non-designated hedging instruments. The Company records all derivatives in its Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets at fair value. The changes in the fair value of highly effective designated cash flow hedges are recorded in Accumulated other comprehensive loss until the hedged item is recognized in earnings. Derivatives that are not designated as hedging instruments or are not assessed to be highly effective are adjusted to fair value through earnings. The amount of net unrealized loss on cash flow hedges was less than $1 million as of March 29, 2019 and the amount of net unrealized gain on cash flow hedges was less than $1 million as of June 29, 2018.  
Other derivatives not designated as hedging instruments consist of foreign currency forward exchange contracts that the Company uses to hedge the foreign currency exposure on the investment in debt security and forecasted expenditures denominated in currency other than the U.S. dollar. The Company recognizes gains and losses on these contracts, as well as the related costs in Other, net on its Condensed Consolidated Statement of Operations along with foreign currency gains and losses on investment in debt security, deferred gains of derivatives in Other current assets and deferred losses of derivatives in Accrued expenses on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets.

The Company is subject to equity market risks due to changes in the fair value of the notional investments selected by its employees as part of its Non-qualified Deferred Compensation Planthe Seagate Deferred Compensation Plan (the SDCP). In fiscal year 2014, the Company entered into a Total Return Swap (TRS) in order to manage the equity market risks associated with the SDCP liabilities. The Company pays a floating rate, based on LIBOR plus an interest rate spread, on the notional amount of the TRS. The TRS is designed to substantially offset changes in the SDCP liability due to changes in the value of the investment options made by employees. As of March 29, 2019, the notional investments underlying the TRS amounted to $114 million. The contract term of the TRS is through January 2020 and is settled on a monthly basis, therefore limiting counterparty performance risk. The Company does not designate the TRS as a hedge. Rather, the Company records all changes in the fair value of the TRS to earnings to offset the market value changes of the SDCP liabilities.  
Table of Contents 
As of March 30, 2018, the Company had no outstanding foreign currency forward exchange contracts and the gross fair value of the TRS reflected in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet was immaterial.

For the three and nine months ended March 30, 2018, the Company determined that a certain equity investment accounted for under the cost method was other-than-temporarily impaired and recorded a charge of $3 million in order to write down the carrying value of the investment to its fair value. For the three and nine months ended March 29, 2019, there were no upward or downward adjustments on equity investments as a result of adoption of the measurement alternative during the September 2018 quarter.  
As of March 29, 2019 and June 29, 2018, the Company had $52 million and $26 million, respectively, of held for sale land and building (collectively, the properties) included in Other current assets on its Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. Of the balance as of March 29, 2019, $24 million and $28 million are located in Asia and in the Americas, respectively. Depreciation related to the properties ceased as of the date these were determined to be held for sale. During the September 2018 quarter, the Company accepted an offer to sell the property in Asia to a third party and thereafter, recorded an impairment charge of approximately $2 million for the nine months ended March 29, 2019. The impairment charge was recorded in Restructuring and other, net in the Companys Condensed Consolidated Statement of Operations. No impairment was identified for the three months ended March 29, 2019 and for the three and nine months ended March 30, 2018.
