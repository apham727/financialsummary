 1. Basis of Presentation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies  
Seagate Technology plc (the Company) is a leading provider of data storage technology and solutions. Its principal products are hard disk drives, commonly referred to as disk drives, hard drives or HDDs. In addition to HDDs, the Company produces a broad range of data storage products including solid state drives (SSD) and their related controllers, solid state hybrid drives (SSHD) and storage subsystems.  
Hard disk drives are devices that store digitally encoded data on rapidly rotating disks with magnetic surfaces. Disk drives continue to be the primary medium of mass data storage due to their performance attributes, high quality and cost effectiveness. Complementing existing data center storage architecture, solid-state storage devices use integrated circuit assemblies as memory to store data with most SSDs using NAND-based flash memory. In addition to HDDs and SSDs, SSHDs combine the features of SSDs and HDDs in the same unit, containing a large hard disk drive and an SSD cache to improve performance of frequently accessed data.  
The Companys cloud systems and solutions extend innovation from the device into the information infrastructure, onsite and in the cloud. Its portfolio includes modular original equipment manufacturers (OEM) storage systems and scale-out storage servers.  
Basis of Presentation and Consolidation  
The unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and all its wholly-owned and majority-owned subsidiaries, after elimination of intercompany transactions and balances.  
The results of operations for the three and six months ended December 29, 2017, are not necessarily indicative of the results of operations to be expected for any subsequent interim period in the Companys fiscal year ending June 29, 2018.

Summary of Significant Accounting Policies  
Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements  
In May 2014, August 2015, April 2016, May 2016 and December 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued ASU 2014-09 (ASC Topic 606), Revenue from Contracts with Customers, ASU 2015-14 (ASC Topic 606) Revenue from Contracts with Customers, Deferral of the Effective Date, ASU 2016-10 (ASC Topic 606) Revenue from Contracts with Customers, Identifying Performance Obligations and Licensing, ASU 2016-12 (ASC Topic 606) Revenue from Contracts with Customers, Narrow-Scope Improvements and Practical Expedients, and ASU 2016-20 (ASC Topic 606) Technical Corrections and Improvements to Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, respectively. ASC Topic 606 outlines a single comprehensive model for entities to use in accounting for revenue arising from contracts with customers and supersedes most current revenue recognition guidance, including industry-specific guidance. It also requires entities to disclose both quantitative and qualitative information that enable financial statements users to understand the nature, amount, timing, and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from contracts with customers. The Company is required to adopt the guidance in the first quarter of fiscal 2019. This standard may be applied retrospectively to all prior periods presented, or retrospectively with a cumulative adjustment to retained earnings in the year of adoption (modified retrospective transition approach). Based on its assessment, the Company plans to adopt the new revenue standard in the first quarter of fiscal 2019, utilizing the modified retrospective method of transition. While management has not yet completed its assessment of the impact of adopting this new standard on the Companys consolidated financial statements, the Company expects the adoption of the new standard will result in the recognition of revenues generally upon shipment (sell-in basis) for sales of products to certain direct retail customers and customers in certain indirect retail channels which are currently being recognized on a sell-through basis. Accordingly, the Company will need to estimate variable consideration (e.g. rebates) related to customer incentives on these arrangements. These changes are not expected to have a material impact on the Companys condensed consolidated financial statements.  
In January 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-01 (ASC Subtopic 825-10), Financial InstrumentsOverall Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities. The amendments in this ASU require entities to measure all investments in equity securities at fair value with changes recognized through net income. This requirement does not apply to investments that qualify for the equity method of accounting, to those that result in consolidation of the investee, or for which the entity meets a practicability exception to fair value measurement. Additionally, the amendments eliminate certain disclosure requirements related to financial instruments measured at amortized cost and add disclosures related to the measurement categories of financial assets and financial liabilities. The Company is required to adopt the guidance in the first quarter of fiscal 2019. Early adoption is permitted for only certain portions of the ASU. The Company expects to elect the measurement alternative for measurement of equity investments, defined as cost, less impairments, if any, plus or minus changes resulting from observable price changes in orderly transactions for an identical or similar investment in the same issuer (the Price Changes) until the equity investments fair value becomes readily determinable. The amount of the impact to equity investments will depend on any Price Changes observed after adoption in the first quarter of fiscal 2019.  
In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02 (ASC Topic 842), Leases. The ASU amends a number of aspects of lease accounting, including requiring lessees to recognize operating leases with a term greater than one year on their balance sheet as a right-of-use asset and corresponding lease liability, measured at the present value of the lease payments. The Company is required to adopt the guidance in the first quarter of fiscal 2020. Early adoption is permitted. The Company is in the process of assessing the impact of this ASU on its condensed consolidated financial statements.

The Company is exposed to foreign currency exchange rate, interest rate, and to a lesser extent, equity market risks relating to its ongoing business operations. The Company enters into foreign currency forward exchange contracts in order to manage the foreign currency exchange rate risk on forecasted expenses denominated in foreign currencies. The Companys accounting policies for these instruments are based on whether the instruments are classified as designated or non-designated hedging instruments. The Company records all derivatives in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets at fair value. The changes in the fair value of the effective portions of designated cash flow hedges are recorded in Accumulated other comprehensive loss until the hedged item is recognized in earnings. Derivatives that are not designated as hedging instruments and the ineffective portions of cash flow hedges are adjusted to fair value through earnings. The Company had no outstanding cash flow hedges as of December 29, 2017 and June 30, 2017.  
As of December 29, 2017 and June 30, 2017, the Company does not have outstanding foreign currency forward exchange contracts.  
The Company is subject to equity market risks due to changes in the fair value of the notional investments selected by its employees as part of its Non-qualified Deferred Compensation Planthe Seagate Deferred Compensation Plan (the SDCP). In fiscal year 2014, the Company entered into a Total Return Swap (TRS) in order to manage the equity market risks associated with the SDCP liabilities. The Company pays a floating rate, based on LIBOR plus an interest rate spread, on the notional amount of the TRS. The TRS is designed to substantially offset changes in the SDCP liability due to changes in the value of the investment options made by employees. As of December 29, 2017, the notional investments underlying the TRS amounted to $117 million. The contract term of the TRS is through January 2019 and is settled on a monthly basis, therefore limiting counterparty performance risk. The Company did not designate the TRS as a hedge. Rather, the Company records all changes in the fair value of the TRS to earnings to offset the market value changes of the SDCP liabilities.

For the three and six months ended December 29, 2017, the Company did not have any equity investments accounted for under the cost method that were other-than-temporarily impaired and did not record any impairment charges. For the six months ended December 30, 2016, the Company determined that a certain equity investment accounted for under the cost method was other-than-temporarily impaired, and recognized a charge of $25 million in order to write down the carrying amount of the investment to zero. Since there was no active market for the equity securities of the investee, the Company estimated fair value of the investee by analyzing the underlying cash flows and future prospects of the investee. These amounts were recorded in Other, net in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations. The Company did not record any impairment charges in the three months ended December 30, 2016.  
As of December 29, 2017 and June 30, 2017, the Company had $77 million held for sale assets included in Other current assets on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets, which primarily consisted of $37 million of land and building in Korea and $26 million of land and building in China, with the remainder of the balance comprised of property at other locations (collectively, the properties). The respective properties to be sold met the criteria to be classified as held for sale during the quarters ended March 31, 2017 and June 30, 2017. Depreciation related to the properties ceased as of the date these were determined to be held for sale. During fiscal year 2017, the Company recorded impairment charges of $35 million to write down the carrying amount of such properties to their estimated fair values less costs to sell. The impairment charges were recorded in Operating expenses in the Condensed Consolidated Statement of Operations. No additional impairment charges related to these properties were recorded during the three and six months period ended December 29, 2017. The fair values were measured with the assistance of third-party valuation models which used inputs such as comparable market data for similar land sale transactions adjusted for differences in comparable properties to derive the estimated fair value of the subject properties and the cost approach valuation techniques for buildings as part of the analysis. The fair value measurement was categorized as Level 3 as significant unobservable inputs were used in the valuation analysis.  
Other Fair Value Disclosures

Enova Technology Corporation v. Seagate Technology (US) Holdings, Inc., et al. On June 5, 2013, Enova Technology Corporation (Enova) filed a complaint against Seagate Technology (US) Holdings, Inc. and Seagate Technology LLC in the U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware alleging infringement of U.S. Patent No. 7,136,995 (the 995 patent), Cryptographic Device, and U.S. Patent No. 7,900,057 (the 057 patent), Cryptographic Serial ATA Apparatus and Method. The Company believes the claims are without merit and intends to vigorously defend this case. On April 27, 2015, the district court ordered a stay of the case, in view of proceedings regarding the 995 and 057 patents before the Patent Trial and Appeal Board (PTAB) of the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office. On September 2, 2015, PTAB issued its final written decision that claims 1-15 of the 995 patent are held unpatentable. On December 18, 2015, PTAB issued its final written decisions that claims 1-32 and 40-53 of the 057 patent are held unpatentable. On February 4, 2016, PTAB issued its final written decision that claims 33-39 of the 057 patent are held unpatentable. Enova appealed PTABs decisions on the 995 patent and the 057 patent to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit. On March 20, 2017, the court of appeals issued its judgment affirming PTABs decision on the 995 patent. On September 6, 2017, the court of appeals issued its judgment affirming PTABs decision on the 057 patent. On November 27, 2017, Enova filed a petition for writ of certiorari with the U.S. Supreme Court challenging the court of appeals decision on the 057 Patent. The Supreme Court has not yet ruled on this petition. The district court case remains stayed. In view of the uncertainty regarding the amount of damages, if any, that could be awarded in this matter, the Company does not believe that it is currently possible to determine a reasonable estimate of the possible range of loss related to this matter.  
The Companys operations are subject to U.S. and foreign laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment, including those governing discharges of pollutants into the air and water, the management and disposal of hazardous substances and wastes and the cleanup of contaminated sites. Some of the Companys operations require environmental permits and controls to prevent and reduce air and water pollution, and these permits are subject to modification, renewal and revocation by issuing authorities.
