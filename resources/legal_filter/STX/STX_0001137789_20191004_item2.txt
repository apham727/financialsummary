Overview of the September 2019 quarter
During the September 2019 quarter, we shipped 98 exabytes of HDD storage capacity. We generated revenue of approximately $2.6 billion, gross margin of 26% and our operating cash flow was $456 million. We repurchased an aggregate principal amount of $620 million of certain outstanding senior notes in connection with the Tender Offers and borrowed $500 million under the Term Loan. We repurchased approximately 9 million of our ordinary shares for $450 million and paid $170 million in dividends. Additionally, we changed our estimate of the useful lives of our manufacturing equipment from a range of three to five years to a range of three to seven years. The effect of this change in estimate increased the September 2019 quarter net income by $23 million. 
Revenue
Revenue in the September 2019 quarter increased by $207 million from the June 2019 quarter primarily due to an increase in exabytes shipped and improved product mix, partially offset by price erosion.
Revenue in the September 2019 quarter decreased by $413 million from the September 2018 quarter primarily due to less favorable market conditions and price erosion.
We maintain various sales incentive programs such as channel rebates and price masking. Sales incentive programs were approximately 13%, 11% and 11% of gross HDD revenue for the September 2019 quarter, June 2019 quarter and September 2018 quarter, respectively. Adjustments to revenues due to under or over accruals for sales incentive programs related to revenues reported in prior quarterly periods were less than 1% of quarterly gross revenue in all periods presented.

Compared to the September 2018 quarter, gross margin as a percentage of revenue for the September 2019 quarter decreased primarily driven by price erosion and factory under-utilization.
In the September 2019 quarter, total warranty cost was 0.5% of revenue and included a favorable change in estimates of prior warranty accruals of 0.4% of revenue due to improvements in return rates on newer generation products.
