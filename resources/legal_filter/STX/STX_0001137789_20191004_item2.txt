During the September 2019 quarter, we shipped 98 exabytes of HDD storage capacity. We generated revenue of approximately $2.6 billion, gross margin of 26% and our operating cash flow was $456 million. We repurchased an aggregate principal amount of $620 million of certain outstanding senior notes in connection with the Tender Offers and borrowed $500 million under the Term Loan. We repurchased approximately 9 million of our ordinary shares for $450 million and paid $170 million in dividends. Additionally, we changed our estimate of the useful lives of our manufacturing equipment from a range of three to five years to a range of three to seven years. The effect of this change in estimate increased the September 2019 quarter net income by $23 million. 
Revenue in the September 2019 quarter increased by $207 million from the June 2019 quarter primarily due to an increase in exabytes shipped and improved product mix, partially offset by price erosion.
Revenue in the September 2019 quarter decreased by $413 million from the September 2018 quarter primarily due to less favorable market conditions and price erosion.
We maintain various sales incentive programs such as channel rebates and price masking. Sales incentive programs were approximately 13%, 11% and 11% of gross HDD revenue for the September 2019 quarter, June 2019 quarter and September 2018 quarter, respectively. Adjustments to revenues due to under or over accruals for sales incentive programs related to revenues reported in prior quarterly periods were less than 1% of quarterly gross revenue in all periods presented.
Gross margin as a percentage of revenue for the September 2019 quarter remained relatively flat compared to the June 2019 quarter.
Compared to the September 2018 quarter, gross margin as a percentage of revenue for the September 2019 quarter decreased primarily driven by price erosion and factory under-utilization.
In the September 2019 quarter, total warranty cost was 0.5% of revenue and included a favorable change in estimates of prior warranty accruals of 0.4% of revenue due to improvements in return rates on newer generation products. Warranty cost related to new shipments was 0.9%, 0.9% and 1.2% of revenue for the September 2019 quarter, June 2019 quarter and September 2018 quarter, respectively.
Product development expense. Product development expense for the September 2019 quarter increased by $14 million compared to the June 2019 quarter due to a $14 million increase in compensation and other employee benefits resulting primarily from the additional fourteenth week in the September 2019 quarter. 
Compared to the September 2018 quarter, Product development expense for the September 2019 quarter decreased by $11 million primarily due to a $10 million decrease in other general expenses as a result of timing of materials purchases and a $5 million decrease in variable compensation expense, partially offset by an increase in expense from the additional fourteenth week in the September 2019 quarter. 
Marketing and administrative expense. Marketing and administrative expense for the September 2019 quarter increased by $14 million from the June 2019 quarter, primarily due to a $9 million increase in other general expenses as a result of increased outside services, a $2 million increase in variable compensation expense and a $2 million increase in compensation and other employee benefits mainly resulting from the additional fourteenth week in the September 2019 quarter. 
Compared to the September 2018 quarter, Marketing and administrative expense for the September 2019 quarter increased by $7 million, primarily due to a $4 million increase in share-based compensation expense and a $4 million increase in other general expenses mainly as a result of increased outside services and increase in expense from the additional fourteenth week in the September 2019 quarter.
Restructuring and other, net. Restructuring and other, net for the September 2019 quarter was comprised of charges primarily related to a new voluntary early exit program.

Other expense, net. Other expense, net for the September 2019 quarter increased by $34 million from the June 2019 quarter, primarily due to a $30 million loss resulting from the repurchase of certain long-term debt and a $5 million decrease in interest income mainly resulting from the redemption of our investment in Toshiba Memory Holdings Corporation (“TMHC”) in the June 2019 quarter.
Compared to the September 2018 quarter, Other expense, net for the September 2019 quarter increased by $40 million primarily due to a $30 million loss resulting from the repurchase of certain long-term debt and an $11 million decrease in interest income mainly resulting from the redemption of our investment in TMHC in the June 2019 quarter.
Our income tax benefit of $2 million for the three months ended October 4, 2019 included approximately $11 million of net discrete tax benefit of which $8 million was associated with net excess tax benefits related to share-based compensation expense. 
Our income tax provision of $18 million for the three months ended September 28, 2018 included approximately $1 million of net discrete tax expense.
Our cash and cash equivalents as of October 4, 2019 decreased by $436 million from June 28, 2019 primarily as a result of the repurchase of certain senior notes of $645 million for $620 million in aggregate principal amount, repurchases of our ordinary shares of $450 million, dividends to our shareholders of $170 million, and payments for capital expenditures of $147 million, partially offset by net proceeds of $498 million from borrowings under our Term Loan and net cash of $456 million provided by operating activities.
•a decrease of $20 million in accrued employee compensation primarily due to cash paid to our employees as part of our discretionary spending plans.
•$39 million in proceeds from the issuance of ordinary shares under employee stock plans.
As of October 4, 2019, no borrowings had been drawn and no borrowings had been utilized for letters of credit or swing line loans issued under the Revolving Credit Facility. The Revolving Credit Facility is available for borrowings, subject to compliance with financial covenants and other customary conditions to borrowing. 
Our liquidity requirements are primarily to meet our working capital, product development and capital expenditure needs, to fund scheduled payments of principal and interest on our indebtedness, and to fund our quarterly dividend and any future strategic investments. Our ability to fund these requirements will depend on our future cash flows, which are determined by future operating performance, and therefore, subject to prevailing global macroeconomic conditions and financial, business and other factors, some of which are beyond our control.
For fiscal year 2020, we expect capital expenditures to remain within our long-term targeted range of 6% to 8% of revenue.
From time to time we may repurchase any of our outstanding notes in open market or privately negotiated purchases or otherwise, or we may repurchase outstanding notes pursuant to the terms of the applicable indenture. 
Dividends declared in the September 2019 quarter of $165 million were subsequently paid on October 9, 2019. Our Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.65 per share on October 28, 2019, which is payable on January 8, 2020 to shareholders of record at the close of business on December 26, 2019. 
All repurchases of our outstanding ordinary shares are effected as redemptions in accordance with STX’s Articles of Association.
