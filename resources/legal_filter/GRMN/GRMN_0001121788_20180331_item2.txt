The Company is a leading worldwide provider of navigation, communications and information devices, most of which are enabled by Global Positioning System, or GPS, technology. We operate in five reportable segments, the outdoor, fitness, marine, auto and aviation markets. The Company’s segments offer products through its network of independent dealers and distributors. However, the nature of products and types of customers for the five segments may vary significantly. As such, the segments are managed separately. 
The Company adopted the new accounting standard for revenue recognition, as discussed in Note 1 – Accounting Policies of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements, effective beginning with the Company’s first quarter of 2018. Adoption of the new revenue recognition standard was applied using the full retrospective method, and information for prior periods within Results of Operations have been restated accordingly. 
Allocation of certain research and development expenses, and selling, general, and administrative expenses are made to each segment on a percent of revenue basis. The segment table located in Note 4 to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements sets forth the Company’s results of operations (in thousands) including net sales, gross profit, and operating income for each of the Company’s five segments during the periods shown. For each line item in the table, the total of the outdoor, fitness, marine, auto, and aviation segments' amounts equals the amount in the condensed consolidated statements of income included in Item 1. 
Comparison of 13-weeks ended March 31, 2018 and April 1, 2017  
Net Sales 
Net sales increased 11% for the 13-week period ended March 31, 2018 when compared to the year-ago quarter. The outdoor, aviation, marine, and fitness segments collectively increased by 18%, contributing 80% of total revenue. Fitness was the largest portion of our revenue mix at 23% in the first quarter of 2018 compared to 22% in the first quarter of 2017. Auto revenue represented the largest portion of our revenue mix in the first quarter of 2017 at 25% and declined to 20% in the first quarter of 2018. 
Total unit sales decreased to 2,956 in the first quarter of 2018 from 3,099 in the same period of 2017. 
Cost of Goods Sold  
Cost of goods sold increased 6% in absolute dollars compared to the prior year quarter. The increase in revenues outpaced the increase in cost of goods sold, which resulted in a 190 basis point decrease in cost of goods sold as a percent of revenues compared to the year-ago quarter. 
Advertising Expense 
Advertising expense decreased 20% in absolute dollars compared to the year-ago quarter. The overall decrease in absolute dollars was driven primarily by decreased cooperative advertising associated with customer mix and fitness media, partially offset by an increase in outdoor media. 
Selling, General and Administrative Expense 
Selling, general and administrative expense increased 15% in absolute dollars and was relatively flat as a percent of revenues compared to the year-ago quarter. The absolute dollar increase was primarily attributable to personnel costs and expenses from prior year acquisitions in the first quarter of 2018. All segments, except for marine, were relatively flat as a percent of revenues. The marine segment increase as a percent of revenues was primarily due to expenses resulting from prior year acquisitions in the first quarter of 2018. 
Research and Development Expense 
Operating Income  
Operating income increased 22% in absolute dollars and increased 180 basis points as a percent of revenue when compared to the first quarter of 2017. The growth in operating income on an absolute dollar and percent of revenue basis resulted from revenue growth and an increase in gross margin percent, while operating expenses as a percent of revenue remained relatively flat, as discussed above 
Foreign currency gains and losses for the Company are typically driven by movements in the Taiwan Dollar, Euro, and British Pound Sterling in relation to the U.S. Dollar. The Taiwan Dollar is the functional currency of Garmin Corporation, the U.S. Dollar is the functional currency of Garmin (Europe) Ltd., and the Euro is the functional currency of most of our other European subsidiaries, although some transactions and balances are denominated in British Pounds. The majority of the Company’s consolidated foreign currency gain or loss is typically driven by the significant cash and marketable securities, receivables and payables held in a currency other than the functional currency at a given legal entity. Due to the relative size of the entities using a functional currency other than the Taiwan Dollar, Euro, and British Pound Sterling, currency fluctuations related to these entities are not expected to have a material impact on the Company’s financial statements. 
The $0.8 million currency gain recognized in the first quarter of 2018 was primarily due to the weakening of the U.S. Dollar against the Taiwan Dollar, Euro, and British Pound Sterling within the 13-weeks ended March 31, 2018. During this period, the U.S. Dollar weakened 2.7% against the Euro and 3.7% against the British Pound Sterling, resulting in gains of $8.8 million and $2.0 million, respectively, while the U.S. Dollar weakened 2.0% against the Taiwan Dollar, resulting in a loss of $12.7 million. The remaining net currency gain of $2.7 million was related to other currencies and timing of transactions. 
The $37.5 million currency loss recognized in the first quarter of 2017 was primarily due to the weakening of the U.S. Dollar against the Taiwan Dollar, Euro, and British Pound Sterling within the 13-weeks ended April 1, 2017. During this period, the U.S. Dollar weakened 7.1% against the Taiwan Dollar, resulting in a loss of $42.9 million, while the U.S. Dollar weakened 1.3% against the Euro and 1.7% against the British Pound Sterling, resulting in gains of $2.7 million and $0.8 million, respectively. The remaining net currency gain of $1.9 million was related to other currencies and timing of transactions.  
Net Income  
As a result of the above, net income for the 13-weeks ended March 31, 2018 was $129.4 million compared to $238.4 million for the 13-week period ended April 1, 2017, a decrease of $109 million. 
As of March 31, 2018, we had $2,375.9 million of cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities. We primarily use cash flow from operations, and expect that future cash requirements may be used to fund our capital expenditures, support our working capital requirements, pay dividends, fund strategic acquisitions, and fund share repurchases. We believe that our existing cash balances and cash flow from operations will be sufficient to meet our long-term projected capital expenditures, working capital and other cash requirements. 
It is management’s goal to invest the on-hand cash in accordance with the investment policy, which has been approved by the Board of Directors of each applicable Garmin entity holding the cash. The investment policy’s primary purpose is to preserve capital, maintain an acceptable degree of liquidity, and maximize yield within the constraint of low credit risk. Garmin’s average interest rate returns on cash and investments during first quarter 2018 and 2017 were approximately 1.7% and 1.5%, respectively. The fair value of our securities varies from period to period due to changes in interest rates, in the performance of the underlying collateral and in the credit performance of the underlying issuer, among other factors. See Note 8 for additional information regarding marketable securities. 
Operating Activities 
The $93.8 million increase in cash provided by operating activities in the first quarter of 2018 compared to the first quarter of 2017 was primarily due to the increase in cash provided by working capital of $57.4 million (which included an increase of $52.8 million in net receipts of accounts receivable and a decrease of $11.7 million in cash paid for inventory) and income taxes payable of $10.1 million. Additionally, the year over year decrease in net income of $109.0 million was offset by other non-cash adjustments to net income of $135.3 million, including an income tax benefit of $168.8 million recognized in the first quarter of 2017 related to the revaluation of certain Switzerland deferred tax assets. 
Investing Activities 
The $99.3 million increase in cash used in investing activities in the first quarter of 2018 compared to the first quarter of 2017 was primarily due to increased net purchases of marketable securities of $88.8M and cash payments for acquisitions of $9.4 million. 
The $26.6 million decrease in cash used in financing activities in the first quarter of 2018 compared to the first quarter of 2017 was primarily due to decreased purchases of treasury stock under our share repurchase authorization of $27.9M. 
We do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements.
