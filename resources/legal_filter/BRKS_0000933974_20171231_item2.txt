OVERVIEW  



 We are a leading global provider of automation and cryogenic solutions for multiple applications and markets.
We primarily serve the semiconductor capital equipment market and sample management market for life sciences.
Our leadership position and global support structure in each of these markets makes us a valued business partner to the some of the world’s largest semiconductor capital equipment and device makers, as well as pharmaceutical and life science research institutions in the world.
In the semiconductor capital equipment market, equipment productivity and availability are critical factors for our customers who typically operate equipment under demanding temperature and/or pressure environments.
Although the demand for semiconductors and semiconductor manufacturing equipment is cyclical, resulting in periodic expansions and contractions of this market, we expect the semiconductor equipment market to remain one of our principal markets as we continue making investments to maintain and grow our semiconductor product and service offerings.
We invest in research and development initiatives within the Brooks Semiconductor Solutions Group segment to maintain continued leadership positions in the markets we serve.
In the life sciences sample management market, we utilize our core competencies and capabilities in automation and cryogenics to provide comprehensive bio-sample management solutions to a broad range of end markets within the life sciences industry.
Our offerings include automated ultra-cold storage freezers, consumable sample storage containers, instruments which assist in the workflow of sample management, and both complete on-site and off-site full sample management services.
Over the past several years, we have acquired and developed essential capabilities required to strategically address the sample management needs across multiple end markets within the life sciences industry.
In October 2017, we acquired all of the outstanding capital stock of 4titude Limited, or 4titude, a U.K.-based manufacturer of scientific consumables for biological sample materials used in a variety of genomic and DNA analytical applications, for a total purchase price of $65.2 million, net of cash acquired.
The acquisition will expand our existing offerings of consumables and instruments within the Brooks Life Sciences segment.
Please refer to Note 4, “Acquisitions” in the Notes to the unaudited consolidated financial statements included in Item 1 "Consolidated Financial Statements" of this Quarterly Report on Form 10‑Q for further information on this transaction.
Since entering the life sciences industry, we have also strengthened and broadened our product portfolio and market reach by investing in internal product development.
During fiscal years 2017 and 2016, more than 23% of our cumulative research and development spending was focused on innovating and advancing solutions in the life sciences sample management market.
In fiscal year 2016, we commercialized the internally developed Biostore III Cryo, an automated system which incorporates sample retrieval, archiving, monitoring, tracking, inventory control, and related enterprise systems connectivity with the industry’s leading cryogenic sample storage freezers.
In fiscal year 2017, we launched BioStudies, a bioinformatics sample intelligence software platform that enables customers to manage their global samples.
We report our financial results for two operating and reportable segments which consist of Brooks Semiconductor Solutions Group segment and the Brooks Life Sciences segment.

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  



 Three Months Ended December 31, 2017 Compared to Three Months Ended December 31, 2016  



 Revenue   



 We reported revenue of $189.3 million for the three months ended December 31, 2017, compared to $160.0 million for the corresponding period of the prior fiscal year, an increase of $29.4 million, or 18%.
We reported revenue growth in both the Brooks Semiconductor Solutions Group segment and the Brooks Life Sciences segment.
The impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates favorably affected revenue by $2.4 million during the three months ended December 31, 2017 when compared to the corresponding period of the prior fiscal year.
Our Brooks Semiconductor Solutions Group segment reported revenue of $141.9 million for the three months ended December 31, 2017 compared to $126.6 million for the corresponding period of the prior fiscal year.
The increase of $15.3 million, or 12%, reflects increases in sales of cryogenic pump products, robotic automation products and services and related spare parts, partially offset by a decline in sales of contamination controls systems.
The increase in revenue includes the favorable impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates of $1.9 million during the three months ended December 31, 2017.
The semiconductor markets are cyclical, and often fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter.
Our Brooks Life Sciences segment reported revenue of $47.4 million for the three months ended December 31, 2017 compared to $33.3 million for the corresponding period of the prior fiscal year.
The increase of $14.1 million, or 42%, was primarily from internal growth of $7.7 million, principally in sample storage services, automated storage systems, consumables and instruments, and software.
Brooks’ Life Sciences internal revenue growth was favorably affected by foreign currency exchange rates which increased revenue by $0.5 million during the three months ended December 31, 2017 as compared to the corresponding period of the prior fiscal year.
Revenue generated outside the United States amounted to $117.2 million, or 62% of total revenue, for the three months ended December 31, 2017 compared to $106.8 million, or 67% of total revenue, for the corresponding period of the prior fiscal year.
We have one customer within the Brooks Semiconductor Solutions Group segment that accounted for approximately 11% of our consolidated revenue during each of the three months ended December 31, 2017 and 2016.
Gross Margin   



 We reported gross margins of 39.7% for the three months ended December 31, 2017 compared to 35.6% for the corresponding period of the prior fiscal year.
Gross margin increased in the Brooks Semiconductor Solutions Group segment by 6.0 percentage points and declined in the Brooks Life Sciences segment by 1.2 percentage points.
Cost of revenue for the three months ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 included $0.9 million and $1.0 million, respectively, of charges for amortization related to completed technology, as well as $1.2 million and $0.1 million, respectively, of charges related to the sale of inventories obtained in acquisitions to which a step-up in value was applied in purchase accounting.

 Table of Contents  



 Our Brooks Semiconductor Solutions Group segment reported gross margins of 41.9% for the three months ended December 31, 2017 as compared to 35.9% for the corresponding period of the prior fiscal year.
Cost of revenue during the three months ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 included $0.5 million and $0.6 million, respectively, of amortization related to completed technology.
Excluding the amortization of completed technology, margins expanded 5.9 percentage points.
Our Brooks Life Sciences segment reported gross margins of 33.2% for the three months ended December 31, 2017 as compared to 34.4% for the corresponding period of the prior fiscal year.
The decrease was a result of higher production costs and higher charges related to the sale of inventories obtained in acquisitions to which a step-up in value was applied in purchase accounting.
Such charges were $1.2 million during the three months ended December 31, 2017 compared to $0.1 million during the corresponding period of the prior fiscal year.
These increases were partially offset by a more favorable mix of products and services, volume leverage and higher margins on automated storage systems, consumables, and sample storage services.
Cost of revenue during each of the three months ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 also included $0.4 million of amortization related to completed technology.
Research and Development   



 Research and development expenses were $13.2 million during the three months ended December 31, 2017 as compared to $10.8 million during the corresponding period of the prior fiscal year.
Selling, General and Administrative   



 Selling, general and administrative expenses were $41.2 million for the three months ended December 31, 2017 as compared to $32.0 million for the corresponding period of the prior fiscal year.
The increase of $9.2 million was primarily attributable to: (i) higher employee-related costs driven by increased incentive bonuses and higher salaries resulting from hiring additional personnel to support the growth of our business, (ii) higher stock-based compensation expense driven mostly by higher estimates of the expected payout related to the achievement of performance goals for our performance-based awards, as well as (iii) higher expenses related to the acquisitions of PBMMI and 4titude.
Amortization expense related primarily to customer relationships was $4.6 million during the first quarter of fiscal year 2018 as compared to $3.1 million during the corresponding period of the prior fiscal year.
Merger-related costs were $0.6 million and $0.2 million, respectively, during the three months ended December 31, 2017 and 2016.

Non-Operating Income (Expenses)  



 Gain on Settlement of Equity Method Investment- During the three months ended December 31, 2016, we recognized a gain of $1.8 million on the settlement of the equity method investment in BioCision which was included as a part of the non-cash consideration for an acquisition of Cool Lab in November 2016.
Please refer to Note 3, “Acquisitions” to our consolidated financial statements included in our 2017 Annual Report on Form 10-K for further information on this transaction.
Interest Expense- During the three months ended December 31, 2017, we recorded interest expense of $2.2 million which was primarily related to the term loan originated on October 4, 2017.
Please refer to the “Liquidity and Capital Resources” section below for further information on the term loan.
Other expenses, net.
During the three months ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, we recorded other expenses, net of $1.7 million and $0.3 million respectively.
The increase of $1.4 million was primarily attributable to an increase in foreign currency exchange losses during the three months ended December 31, 2017 as compared to the corresponding period of the prior fiscal year.
Please refer to Item 3.
“Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk – Currency Rate Exposure” in this Quartely Report on Form 10-Q for additional information about these currency exchange losses.

Please refer to Note 3, “Acquisitions” to our consolidated financial statements included on the 2017 Annual Report in the Form 10-K for further information on this transaction.
Income Tax Provision   



 During the three months ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, we recorded an income tax provision of $2.9 million and $2.8 million, respectively.
The tax provision for the three months ended December 31, 2017 was primarily driven by the foreign income generated during the current quarter.
The income tax provision for the three months ended December 31, 2016 was primarily driven by foreign income generated during the quarter, partially offset by $0.7 million of tax benefits related to the reduction of reserves for unrecognized tax benefits.
The SEC has issued Staff Accounting Bulletin 118 (“SAB 118”), which has provided guidance for companies that have not completed the accounting for the income tax effects of Tax Reform.
Under SAB 118, a company may report provisional amounts based on reasonable estimates where the accounting is incomplete.
These amounts are subject to adjustments during a measurement period of up to one year beginning in the reporting period of the enactment date.
Any taxes due associated with the toll charge will be payable over an eight year period.
We have estimated that our accumulated foreign earnings are $120 million, which is a provisional amount subject to the measurement period described in Staff Accounting Bulletin 118.
There are still incomplete components related to the accumulated foreign earnings calculations for older tax years that require additional time to complete the calculations.
The Company recorded a discrete benefit of $0.7 million in the three months ended December 31, 2017 due to the impact of the U.S. rate change on its net U.S. deferred tax liabilities.
Equity in Earnings of Equity Method Investments  



 During the three months ended December 31, 2017, we recorded income of $2.2 million from our equity method investments as compared to $1.9 million during the corresponding period of the prior fiscal year.
The increase of $0.2 million was primarily attributable to higher income generated from ULVAC Cryogenics, Inc., or UCI, during the first quarter of fiscal year 2018 as compared to the corresponding period of the prior fiscal year.
During the three months ended December 31, 2016, we incurred losses of $0.5 million from our investment in BioCision which was settled during the first quarter of fiscal year 2017 as a part of the non-cash consideration for the acquisition of Cool Lab in November 2016.
LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES   



 A considerable portion of our revenue is dependent on the demand for semiconductor capital equipment which historically has experienced periodic downturns.
We believe that we have adequate resources to fund our currently planned working capital and capital expenditure requirements, as well as to service debt and pay interest for the next twelve months.
As of December 31, 2017, we had cash and cash equivalents of $202.3 million, of which $81.2 million was held outside of the United States.
Our intent is to permanently reinvest these funds outside of the United States and our current operating plans do not demonstrate a need to repatriate these funds for our U.S. operations.
At December 31, 2017 and September 30, 2017, we had marketable securities of $29.5 million and $2.7 million, respectively, which were held in the United States.
We believe that our current cash balance, marketable securities portfolio, access to the revolving line of credit, as well as to debt and capital markets along with cash flows from operations will satisfy working capital, financing activities, debt service and capital expenditure requirements for the next twelve months.

and Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, or collectively, the lenders.
The term loan was issued at $197.6 million, or 98.8% of its par value, resulting in a discount of $2.4 million, or 1.2%, which represented loan origination fees paid at the closing.
We incurred additional deferred financing costs of $0.4 million during the three months ended December 31, 2017.
At December 31, 2017, the outstanding term loan principal balance was $200.0 million, net of unamortized deferred financing costs of $2.7 million.
The loan proceeds will be used for acquisitions and general corporate purposes.
As of December 31, 2017, we had approximately $51.1 million available for borrowing under the line of credit.
There were no amounts outstanding pursuant to the line of credit as of December 31, 2017 and September 30, 2017.
