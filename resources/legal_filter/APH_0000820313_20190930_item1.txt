Note 2—New Accounting Pronouncements



​



Recently Adopted Accounting Standards



​



Leases



​



In February 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (the “FASB”) issued Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) No.
2016-02, Leases (Topic 842) (“Topic 842”), which amended, among other things, the existing guidance by requiring lessees to recognize lease right-of-use assets (“ROU assets”) and liabilities arising from operating leases on the balance sheet.
Since issuing Topic 842, the FASB has issued various subsequent ASU’s, including but not limited to, ASU 2018-10, Codification Improvements to Topic 842, Leases, which clarified various aspects of the guidance under Topic 842, as well as ASU 2018-11, Leases (Topic 842): Targeted Improvements, which allows entities the option of recognizing the cumulative effect of applying Topic 842 as an adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings in the year of adoption while continuing to present all prior periods under previous lease accounting guidance.
​



Prior to adoption, the Company evaluated Topic 842, including the initial review of any necessary changes to existing processes and systems that would be required to implement this standard, in order to determine its impact on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.
In 2018, the Company implemented a new lease management system that facilitated the adoption of this standard and enabled the Company to fulfill its requirements for both reporting and disclosure purposes, as well as to better manage and monitor the Company’s ongoing lease portfolio.
​



On January 1, 2019, we adopted Topic 842 using the updated modified retrospective transition approach allowed under ASU 2018-11 and did not restate prior periods.
The adoption of Topic 842 provided various optional practical expedients in transition, some of which we have elected.
Going forward, the impact of Topic 842 on the Company’s consolidated financial statements will be dependent upon the Company’s lease portfolio.
The accounting for finance leases (formerly referred to as “capital leases”) remains substantially unchanged.
​



Accounting Standards Issued But Not Yet Adopted



​



In August 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-13, Fair Value Measurement (Topic 820): Disclosure Framework—Changes to the Disclosure Requirements for Fair Value Measurement (“ASU 2018-13”), which adds, amends and removes certain disclosure requirements related to fair value measurements.
ASU 2018-13 is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2019.
Certain amended or eliminated disclosures in this standard may be adopted early, while certain additional disclosure requirements in this standard can be adopted on its effective date.
In addition, certain changes in the standard require retrospective adoption, while other changes must be adopted prospectively.

​



On April 24, 2018, the Company’s Board of Directors authorized a stock repurchase program under which the Company may purchase up to $2,000.0 of the Company’s Common Stock during the three-year period ending April 24, 2021 (the “2018 Stock Repurchase Program”) in accordance with the requirements of Rule 10b-18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”).
During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2019, the Company repurchased 1.7 million and 6.1 million shares of its Common Stock for $150.0 and $558.7, respectively, under the 2018 Stock Repurchase Program.
Of the total repurchases during the first nine months of 2019, 1.0 million shares, or $87.6, have been retained in Treasury stock; the remaining 5.1 million shares, or $471.1, have been retired by the Company.
The Company has not repurchased any additional shares of its Common Stock from October 1, 2019 to October 22, 2019, and has remaining authorization to purchase up to $888.1 of its Common Stock under the 2018 Stock Repurchase Program.
​



On January 24, 2017, the Company’s Board of Directors authorized a stock repurchase program under which the Company could purchase up to $1,000.0 of the Company’s Common Stock during the two-year period ending 



11 

January 24, 2019 (the “2017 Stock Repurchase Program”) in accordance with the requirements of Rule 10b-18 of the Exchange Act.
During the three months ended March 31, 2018, the Company repurchased 4.2 million shares of its Common Stock for $382.0 under the 2017 Stock Repurchase Program, bringing total repurchases under this program to 12.6 million shares or $1,000.0, thus completing the 2017 Stock Repurchase Program.
These repurchases in the first quarter of 2018, coupled with the Company’s repurchase of 3.5 million shares of its Common Stock for $298.2 under the 2018 Stock Repurchase Program during the six months ended September 30, 2018, resulted in total repurchases of 7.7 million shares for $680.2 during the nine months ended September 30, 2018.
​



Contingent upon declaration by the Board of Directors, the Company generally pays a quarterly dividend on shares of its Common Stock.
The following table summarizes the dividends declared and paid for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2019 and 2018: 



​[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

​



​



​



​



​



Note 7—Earnings Per Share



​



Basic earnings per share (“EPS”) is computed by dividing net income attributable to Amphenol Corporation by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding.
Diluted EPS is computed by dividing net income attributable to Amphenol Corporation by the weighted average number of common shares and dilutive common shares outstanding, which relates to stock options.
A reconciliation of the basic weighted average common shares outstanding to diluted weighted average common shares outstanding for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2019 and 2018 is as follows:



​[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]



​



Excluded from the computations above were anti-dilutive common shares of 12.2 million and 6.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2019 and 2018, respectively.
Excluded from the computations above were anti-dilutive common shares of 8.6 million and 2.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2019 and 2018, respectively.
​



Note 8—Commitments and Contingencies



​



The Company has been named as a defendant in several legal actions arising from normal business activities.
​



12 

In August 2018, the Company received a subpoena from the U.S. Department of Defense, Office of the Inspector General, requesting documents pertaining to certain products manufactured by the Company’s Military and Aerospace Group that are purchased or used by the U.S. government.
The Company is cooperating with the request.
​



Certain operations of the Company are subject to environmental laws and regulations which govern the discharge of pollutants into the air and water, as well as the handling and disposal of solid and hazardous wastes.
​



Note 9—Stock-Based Compensation



​



For the three months ended September 30, 2019 and 2018, the Company’s income before income taxes was reduced for stock-based compensation expense of $16.6 and $14.4, respectively.
​



For the nine months ended September 30, 2019 and 2018, the Company’s income before income taxes was reduced for stock-based compensation expense of $46.4 and $40.4, respectively.
​



Stock-based compensation expense includes the estimated effects of forfeitures, which are adjusted over the requisite service period to the extent actual forfeitures differ or are expected to differ from such estimates.
​



Stock Options



​



In May 2017, the Company adopted the 2017 Stock Purchase and Option Plan for Key Employees of Amphenol and Subsidiaries (the “2017 Employee Option Plan”).
A committee of the Company’s Board of Directors has been authorized to grant stock options pursuant to the 2017 Employee Option Plan.
As of September 30, 2019, there were 10,943,910 shares of Common Stock available for the granting of additional stock options under the 2017 Employee Option Plan.
The Company also continues to maintain the 2009 Stock Purchase and Option Plan for Key Employees of Amphenol and Subsidiaries, as amended (the “2009 Employee Option Plan”).
No additional stock options will be granted under the 2009 Employee Option Plan.
Options granted under the 2017 Employee Option Plan and the 2009 Employee Option Plan generally vest ratably over a period of five years from the date of grant and are generally exercisable over a period of ten years from the date of grant.
​



In 2004, the Company adopted the 2004 Stock Option Plan for Directors of Amphenol Corporation (the “2004 Directors Option Plan”).
The 2004 Directors Option Plan is administered by the Company’s Board of Directors.
The 2004 Directors Option Plan expired in May 2014, except that its terms continue with respect to any outstanding options granted thereunder.
Options were last granted under the 2004 Directors Option Plan in May 2011.
Options granted 



13 

under the 2004 Directors Option Plan are fully vested and are generally exercisable over a period of ten years from the date of grant.
​



Stock option activity for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2019 was as follows:



​



​[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]



​



A summary of the status of the Company’s non-vested options as of September 30, 2019 and changes during the three and nine months then ended is as follows:



​



​[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]



​



14 

During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2019 and 2018, the following activity occurred under the Company’s option plans:



​[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]



​



As of September 30, 2019, the total compensation cost related to non-vested options not yet recognized was approximately $167.0 with a weighted average expected amortization period of 3.54 years.
​



The grant-date fair value of each option grant under the 2009 Employee Option Plan, the 2017 Employee Option Plan and the 2004 Directors Option Plan is estimated using the Black-Scholes option pricing model.
The grant-date fair value of each share grant is determined based on the closing share price of the Company’s Common Stock on the date of the grant.
The fair value is then amortized on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period of the awards, which is generally the vesting period.
Use of a valuation model for option grants requires management to make certain assumptions with respect to selected model inputs.
The average expected life is based on the contractual term of the option and expected exercise and historical experience.
The risk-free interest rate is based on U.S. Treasury zero-coupon issuances with a remaining term equal to the expected life assumed at the date of grant.
The expected annual dividend per share is based on the Company’s dividend rate.
​



Restricted Shares



​



In 2012, the Company adopted the 2012 Restricted Stock Plan for Directors of Amphenol Corporation (the “2012 Directors Restricted Stock Plan”).
The 2012 Directors Restricted Stock Plan is administered by the Company’s Board of Directors.
As of September 30, 2019, the number of restricted shares available for grant under the 2012 Directors Restricted Stock Plan was 94,846.
Restricted shares granted under the 2012 Directors Restricted Stock Plan generally vest on the first anniversary of the grant date.
Grants under the 2012 Directors Restricted Stock Plan entitle the holder to receive shares of the Company’s Common Stock without payment.
​



Restricted share activity for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2019 was as follows:



​[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]



​



As of September 30, 2019, the total compensation cost related to non-vested restricted shares not yet recognized was approximately $0.8 with a weighted average expected amortization period of 0.64 years.
The U.S. Plans’ benefits are generally based on years of service and 



15 

compensation and are generally noncontributory.
The following is a summary, based on the most recent actuarial valuations of the Company’s net cost for pension benefits, of the Plans for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2019 and 2018: 



​[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]



​



In January 2018, the Company made a voluntary cash contribution of approximately $81.0 to fund the U.S. Plans.
This voluntary cash contribution made in the first quarter of 2018 was reflected as cash used in operating activities within Net change in accrued pension and postretirement benefits in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Cash Flow.
Participation in these plans is based on certain eligibility requirements.
Through 2018, the Company matched the majority of employee contributions to the U.S. defined contribution plans with cash contributions up to a maximum of 5% of eligible compensation.
Effective January 1, 2019, the Company increased its matching of employee contributions to the U.S. defined contribution plans to a maximum of 6% of eligible compensation.
During the nine months ended September 30, 2019 and 2018, the Company provided matching contributions to the U.S. defined contribution plans of approximately $9.8 and $6.2, respectively.
​



Note 11—Acquisitions



​



In January 2019, pursuant to a definitive agreement entered into on November 27, 2018, the Company acquired SSI Controls Technologies (“SSI”), the sensor manufacturing division of SSI Technologies, Inc., for approximately $397, net of cash acquired (subject to customary post-closing adjustments), plus a performance-related contingent payment.
SSI, which is headquartered in the United States (Wisconsin), is a leading designer and manufacturer of sensors and sensing solutions for the global automotive and industrial markets.
The acquisition of SSI is not material to the Company.
The contingent consideration payment is based on certain 2019 revenue and profitability levels of SSI.
The Company determined the fair value of this liability using Level 3 unobservable inputs, such as probability weighted payout projections, and is classified as Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy (Note 16).
The contingent consideration is payable in 2020 and recorded in Other accrued expenses on the accompanying Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets as of September 30, 2019.
​



During the first nine months of 2019, the Company completed eight acquisitions (including SSI) for $891.2, net of cash acquired.
All but one of the acquisitions are included in the Interconnect Products and Assemblies segment.
The Company is in the process of completing its analyses of the fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed.
The 



16 

Company anticipates that the final assessments of values will not differ materially from the preliminary assessments.
​



During the nine months ended September 30, 2019, the Company incurred approximately $25.4 ($21.0 after-tax) of acquisition-related expenses, primarily comprised of the amortization of $15.7 related to the value associated with acquired backlog (of which $12.5 related to the SSI acquisition), with the remainder representing external transaction costs.
​



Note 12—Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets



​



The changes in the carrying amount of goodwill by segment were as follows:



​[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]



​



The increase in goodwill, net of foreign currency translation, during the first nine months of 2019 is due to the Company’s acquisitions during this period.
The Company has defined its reporting units as the two reportable business segments “Interconnect Products and Assemblies” and “Cable Products and Solutions”, as the components of these reportable business segments have similar economic characteristics.
In 2019, as part of our annual evaluation, the Company utilized the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is necessary to perform the quantitative goodwill impairment assessment.
In accordance with applicable guidance, an entity is not required to calculate the fair value of a reporting unit if, after assessing these qualitative factors, the Company determines that it is more likely than not that its reporting unit’s fair value is greater than its carrying amount.
During the third quarter of 2019, the Company determined that it was more likely than not that the fair value of its reporting units exceeded their respective carrying amounts and therefore, a quantitative assessment was not required.
​



Other than goodwill noted above, the Company’s intangible assets as of September 30, 2019 and December 31, 2018 were as follows:



​[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]



​



Intangible assets are included in Intangibles, net and other long-term assets in the accompanying Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets.
The increase in the carrying amounts of intangible assets during the first nine months of 2019 was primarily due to intangible assets acquired as a result of the SSI acquisition, along with the other acquisitions 



17 

closed during the period.
The amortization expense for the three months ended September 30, 2019 and 2018 was approximately $13.6 and $11.6, respectively.
The amortization expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2019 and 2018 was approximately $54.0 and $35.4, respectively.
Amortization expense during the nine months ended September 30, 2019 includes $15.7 related to the amortization of acquired backlog, primarily associated with the SSI acquisition.
As of September 30, 2019, amortization expense relating to the Company’s current intangible assets estimated for the remainder of 2019 is approximately $13.1 and for each of the next five fiscal years is approximately $48.4 in 2020, $43.8 in 2021, $36.6 in 2022, $33.9 in 2023 and $28.8 in 2024.
​



The Company reviews its identifiable intangible assets subject to amortization whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount may not be recoverable, while any indefinite-lived intangible assets that are not subject to amortization are reviewed at least annually for impairment.
In the third quarter of 2019, the Company performed its annual assessment of these identifiable indefinite-lived intangible assets.
Based on our qualitative assessment, the Company determined that it was more likely than not that the fair value of the indefinite-lived intangible assets exceeded their respective carrying amounts.
There has been no impairment in 2019, 2018 or 2017 as a result of such reviews.
​



Note 13—Debt



​



The Company’s debt (net of any unamortized discount) consists of the following:



​



​[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]



​



Revolving Credit Facility



​



On January 15, 2019, the Company amended its $2,000.0 unsecured credit facility (the “2016 Revolving Credit Facility”) with a $2,500.0 unsecured credit facility (“2019 Revolving Credit Facility”).
The 2019 Revolving Credit Facility, which matures January 2024, increases the lenders’ aggregate commitments by $500.0 and, consistent with the previous 2016 Revolving Credit Facility, gives the Company the ability to borrow at a spread over LIBOR.
The Company may utilize the 2019 Revolving Credit Facility for general corporate purposes.
At September 30, 2019 and December 31, 2018, there were no borrowings under the 2019 Revolving Credit Facility.
The carrying value of any borrowings under the 2019 Revolving Credit Facility would approximate their fair value due primarily to their market interest rates and would be classified as Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy (Note 16).
The 2019 Revolving Credit Facility requires payment of certain annual agency and commitment fees and requires that the Company satisfy certain financial covenants.
At September 30, 2019, the Company was in compliance with the financial covenants under the 2019 Revolving Credit Facility.
​



18 

Commercial Paper Programs



​



The Company has a commercial paper program pursuant to which the Company issues short-term unsecured commercial paper notes (“U.S.
Commercial Paper” or “USCP Notes”) in one or more private placements in the United States (the “U.S.
Commercial Paper Program”).
The maturities of the USCP Notes vary, but may not exceed 397 days from the date of issue.
The USCP Notes are sold under customary terms in the commercial paper market and may be issued at par or a discount therefrom, and bear varying interest rates on a fixed or floating basis.
The average interest rate on the U.S. Commercial Paper as of September 30, 2019 was 2.29%.
​



The Company and one of its wholly owned European subsidiaries (the “Euro Issuer”) also has a euro-commercial paper program (the “Euro Commercial Paper Program” and, together with the U.S. Commercial Paper Program, the “Commercial Paper Programs”) pursuant to which the Euro Issuer may issue short-term unsecured commercial paper notes (the “ECP Notes” and, together with the USCP Notes, “Commercial Paper”), which are guaranteed by the Company and are to be issued outside of the United States.
The maturities of the ECP Notes will vary, but may not exceed 183 days from the date of issue.
The ECP Notes are sold under customary terms in the euro-commercial paper market and may be issued at par or a discount therefrom or a premium thereto and bear varying interest rates on a fixed or floating basis.
The ECP Notes may be issued in Euros, Sterling, U.S.
Dollars or other currencies.
As of September 30, 2019, the amount of ECP Notes outstanding was €255.0 (approximately $277.9), with an average interest rate of (0.12)%.
​



Amounts available under the Commercial Paper Programs may be borrowed, repaid and re-borrowed from time to time.
In conjunction with the 2019 Revolving Credit Facility, the authorization from the Company’s Board of Directors limits the maximum aggregate principal amount outstanding of USCP Notes, ECP Notes, and any other commercial paper, euro-commercial paper or similar programs at any time to $2,500.0.
In addition, the maximum aggregate principal amount outstanding of USCP Notes at any time was also increased to $2,500.0.
The maximum aggregate principal amount outstanding of ECP Notes at any time remains at $2,000.0.
The Commercial Paper Programs are rated A-2 by Standard & Poor’s and P-2 by Moody’s and are currently backstopped by the 2019 Revolving Credit Facility, as amounts undrawn under the Company’s 2019 Revolving Credit Facility are available to repay Commercial Paper, if necessary.
Net proceeds of the issuances of the Commercial Paper are expected to be used for general corporate purposes.
The Commercial Paper is classified as long-term debt in the accompanying Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets since the Company has the intent and ability to refinance the Commercial Paper on a long-term basis using the Company’s 2019 Revolving Credit Facility.
The Commercial Paper is actively traded and is therefore classified as Level 1 in the fair value hierarchy (Note 16).
The carrying value of Commercial Paper borrowings approximates their fair value.
​



U.S. Senior Notes



​



On January 9, 2019, the Company issued $500.0 principal amount of unsecured 4.350% Senior Notes due June 1, 2029 at 99.904% of face value (the “2029 Senior Notes”).
The 2029 Senior Notes are unsecured and rank equally in right of payment with the Company’s other unsecured senior indebtedness.
Interest on the 2029 Senior Notes is payable semiannually on June 1 and December 1 of each year, commencing on June 1, 2019.
Prior to March 1, 2029, the Company may, at its option, redeem some or all of the 2029 Senior Notes at any time by paying a redemption price equal to the greater of 100% of the principal amount thereof or a make-whole premium, plus, in each case, accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but not including, the date of redemption, and if redeemed on or after March 1, 2029, the Company may, at its option, redeem some or all of the 2029 Senior Notes at any time by paying a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount thereof plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but not including, the date of redemption.
In January 2019, the Company used the net proceeds from the 2029 Senior Notes, along with borrowings under the U.S. Commercial Paper Program, to repay $750.0 of 2.55% Senior Notes due in January 2019.
​



On September 4, 2019, the Company commenced tender offers (“Tender Offers”) to purchase for cash any and all of the Company’s outstanding (i) $375.0 principal amount of its 3.125% Senior Notes due September 2021 (“2021 Senior Notes”) and (ii) $500.0 principal amount of its 4.00% Senior Notes due February 2022 (“2022 Senior Notes”).
On September 11, 2019, as a result of the Tender Offers, the Company accepted for payment $147.3 aggregate principal amount of the 2021 Senior Notes and $205.0 aggregate principal amount of the 2022 Senior Notes for 101.9% and 104.5% of par value, respectively (collectively, the “Tendered Notes”), plus accrued and unpaid interest to, but not 



19 

including, the settlement date of the Tender Offers.
The total consideration for the Tendered Notes was $368.8, which in addition to the Tendered Notes, included $13.4 of premiums and fees paid related to the early extinguishment of debt and $3.1 of accrued interest.
For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2019, the Company recorded a loss on early debt extinguishment of $14.3 ($12.5 after-tax, or $0.04 per diluted share) within Loss on early extinguishment of debt on the accompanying Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income.
This charge is primarily comprised of the premiums and fees incurred related to the Tendered Notes, along with the non-cash charge associated with the write-off of the remaining unamortized deferred debt issuance costs associated with the Tendered Notes.
The remaining principal amounts associated with the 2021 Senior Notes and 2022 Senior Notes, which were not redeemed as a result of the Tender Offers, remain outstanding as of September 30, 2019, as noted in the table above.
​



On September 10, 2019, the Company issued $900.0 principal amount of unsecured 2.800% Senior Notes due February 15, 2030 at 99.920% of face value (the “2030 Senior Notes”).
The 2030 Senior Notes are unsecured and rank equally in right of payment with the Company’s other unsecured senior indebtedness.
Interest on the 2030 Senior Notes is payable semiannually on February 15 and August 15 of each year, commencing on February 15, 2020.
Prior to November 15, 2029, the Company may, at its option, redeem some or all of the 2030 Senior Notes at any time by paying a redemption price equal to the greater of 100% of the principal amount thereof or a make-whole premium, plus, in each case, accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but not including, the date of redemption, and if redeemed on or after November 15, 2029, the Company may, at its option, redeem some or all of the 2030 Senior Notes at any time by paying a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount thereof plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but not including, the date of redemption.
In September 2019, the Company used the net proceeds from the 2030 Senior Notes to fund the cash consideration payable in the Tender Offers, with the remaining net proceeds being used for general corporate purposes, including to partially reduce outstanding borrowings related to the U.S. Commercial Paper Program.
​



All of the Company’s outstanding senior notes in the United States (“U.S.
Senior Notes”) are unsecured and rank equally in right of payment with the Company’s other unsecured senior indebtedness.
Interest on each series of U.S. Senior Notes is payable semiannually.
The Company may, at its option, redeem some or all of any series of U.S. Senior Notes at any time subject to certain terms and conditions, which include paying 100% of the principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the date of repurchase and, with certain exceptions, a make-whole premium.
The fair value of each series of U.S. Senior Notes is based on recent bid prices in an active market and is therefore classified as Level 1 in the fair value hierarchy (Note 16).
The Company’s 2.20% Senior Notes are due in April 2020 and are therefore recorded, net of the related unamortized discount and debt issuance costs, within Current portion of long-term debt in the accompanying Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets as of September 30, 2019.
The U.S. Senior Notes contain certain financial and non-financial covenants.
At September 30, 2019, the Company was in compliance with the financial covenants under its U.S. Senior Notes.
​



Euro Senior Notes



​



On October 8, 2018, the Euro Issuer issued €500.0 (approximately $574.6 at date of issuance) principal amount of unsecured 2.000% Senior Notes due October 8, 2028 at 99.498% of face value (the “2028 Euro Notes” or “2.000% Euro Senior Notes”) and collectively with the U.S. Senior Notes, “Senior Notes”).
The 2028 Euro Notes are unsecured and rank equally in right of payment with the Euro Issuer’s other unsecured senior indebtedness, and are guaranteed on a senior unsecured basis by the Company.
Interest on the 2028 Euro Notes is payable annually on October 8 of each year, commencing on October 8, 2019.
The Company may, at its option, redeem some or all of the 2028 Euro Notes at any time by paying 100% of the principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the date of repurchase, and if redeemed prior to July 8, 2028, a make-whole premium.
The fair value of the 2028 Euro Notes is based on recent bid prices in an active market and is therefore classified as Level 1 in the fair value hierarchy (Note 16).
The Company used a portion of the net proceeds from the 2028 Euro Notes to repay a portion of the outstanding amounts under its Commercial Paper Programs, with the remainder of the net proceeds being used for general corporate purposes.
The 2028 Euro Notes contain certain financial and non-financial covenants.
At September 30, 2019, the Company was in compliance with the financial covenants under its 2028 Euro Notes.
For the nine months ended September 30, 2019 and 2018, stock option exercise activity had the impact of lowering our Provision for income taxes by approximately $21.3 and $14.1, respectively, and lowering our effective tax rate by approximately 190 basis points and 120 basis points, respectively.
In addition, during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2019, the loss on early extinguishment of debt also had the effect of increasing the effective tax rate by approximately 40 basis points and 10 basis points, respectively.
The Company finalized its accounting of the Tax Act in the fourth quarter of 2018.
The Company paid its second annual installment of the Transition Tax, net of applicable tax credits and deductions, in the second quarter of 2019, and will pay the balance of the Transition Tax over the remainder of the eight-year period ending 2025, as permitted under the Tax Act.
The Company is generally not able to precisely estimate the ultimate settlement amounts or timing until the close of an audit.

Note 15—Leases



​



Amphenol is a lessee of buildings, office space, automobiles and equipment throughout the world, nearly all of which are classified as operating leases expiring at various dates.
The Company determines if an arrangement qualifies as a lease at lease inception.
The Company adopted Topic 842 effective January 1, 2019.
Operating lease liabilities are recorded based on the present value of the future lease payments over the lease term, assessed as of the commencement date.
The Company’s real estate leases, which are comprised primarily of manufacturing facilities, warehouses and sales offices, represent the vast majority of our operating lease liabilities and generally have a lease term between 2 and 12 years.
The remaining leases consist primarily of machinery and equipment used in production, office equipment and vehicles, each with various lease terms.
The vast majority of our leases are comprised of fixed lease payments, with a small percentage of the Company’s real estate leases including lease payments tied to a rate or index which may be subject to variability.
Certain real estate leases also include executory costs such as common area maintenance (non-lease component), as well as property insurance and property taxes (non-components).
Lease payments, which may include lease components, non-lease components and non-components, are included in the measurement of the Company’s lease liabilities to the extent that such payments are either fixed amounts or variable amounts based on a rate or index (fixed in substance) as stipulated in the lease contract.
​



Substantially all of our lease agreements do not specify an implicit borrowing rate, and as such, the Company utilizes its incremental borrowing rate by lease term, in order to calculate the present value of our future lease payments.
The discount rate represents a risk-adjusted rate on a secured basis, and is the rate at which the Company would borrow funds to satisfy the scheduled lease liability payment streams commensurate with the lease term.
On January 1, 2019, the discount rate used on existing leases at adoption was determined based on the remaining lease term using available data as of that date.
For new or renewed leases starting in 2019, the discount rate is determined using available data at lease commencement and based on the lease term including any reasonably certain renewal periods.
Leases with renewal options allow the Company to extend the lease term typically between 1 and 6 years.
Renewal options are reviewed at lease commencement to determine if such options are reasonably certain of being exercised, which could impact the lease term.
Other than variable lease cost, operating lease cost is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
​



Prior to January 1, 2019, the Company accounted for its leases in accordance with Topic 840, Leases.
At December 31, 2018, the Company was committed under operating leases for buildings, office space, automobiles and equipment, which expired at various dates.
As previously disclosed in our 2018 Annual Report and under previous lease accounting guidance, future minimum lease payments under non-cancelable operating leases as of December 31, 2018 totaled $197.3, comprised of $70.5 for 2019, $39.0 for 2020, $25.9 for 2021, $16.5 for 2022, $11.9 for 2023, and $33.5 for the years beyond 2023.
​



Finance Leases



​



In rare circumstances, the Company may enter into finance leases for specific equipment used in manufacturing, in which the Company takes ownership of the asset upon the end of the lease.
The Company records its finance leases within Property, plant and equipment, Current portion of long-term debt and Long-term debt on the accompanying Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets.
The Company’s finance leases and related depreciation and interest expense, cash flows and impact on the Company’s condensed consolidated financial statements were not material individually or in the aggregate as of and for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2019.
​



Note 16—Fair Value Measurements



​



Fair value is determined based on the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants.
These requirements establish market or observable inputs as the preferred source of values.
Assumptions based on hypothetical transactions are used in the absence of market inputs.
The Company does not have any non-financial instruments accounted for at fair value on a recurring basis.
​



23 

The valuation techniques required are based upon observable and unobservable inputs.
Observable inputs reflect market data obtained from independent sources, while unobservable inputs reflect the Company’s market assumptions.
These two types of inputs create the following fair value hierarchy:



​



Level 1 Quoted prices for identical instruments in active markets.
​



Level 3 Significant inputs to the valuation model are unobservable.
​



The Company believes that the assets or liabilities subject to such standards with fair value disclosure requirements are short-term investments, derivative instruments and contingent consideration payments.
Substantially all of the Company’s short-term investments consist of certificates of deposit with original maturities of twelve months or less and as such, are considered as Level 1 in the fair value hierarchy as they are traded in active markets for identical assets.
The carrying amounts of these instruments, the majority of which are in non-U.S. bank accounts, approximate their fair value.
The Company’s derivative instruments represent foreign exchange rate forward contracts, which are valued using bank quotations based on market observable inputs such as forward and spot rates and are therefore classified as Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy.
The contingent consideration payment related to the SSI acquisition is valued using Level 3 unobservable inputs, such as probability weighted payout projections, within the fair value hierarchy.
​



The amounts recognized in Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) associated with foreign exchange rate forward contracts and the amount reclassified from Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) to foreign exchange gain (loss) in the accompanying Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2019 and 2018 were not material.
GAAP”).
For purposes of the following discussion, the terms “constant currencies” and “organically” have the same meaning, respectively, as these aforementioned non-GAAP financial measures.
The Company obtained, prepared and analyzed all of the information it believes necessary in order to complete its accounting of the Tax Act in the fourth quarter of 2018 based on the regulatory guidance issued at that time.
The Company undertakes no obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements except as required by law.

Results of Operations



​



Three and nine months ended September 30, 2019 compared to the three and nine months ended September 30, 2018



​



Net sales were $2,100.6 in the third quarter of 2019 compared to $2,129.0 in the third quarter of 2018, which represented a decrease of 1% in U.S. dollars and 6% organically, and flat in constant currencies over the same respective prior year period.
Net sales were $6,074.4 in the first nine months of 2019 compared to $5,977.3 in the first nine months of 2018, which represented an increase of 2% in U.S. dollars and 4% in constant currencies, while decreasing 1% organically over the same respective prior year period.
Net sales in the Interconnect Products and Assemblies segment (approximately 95% of net sales) in the third quarter of 2019 decreased 1% in U.S. dollars and 6% organically, and were flat in constant currencies compared to the third quarter of 2018.
The decline in sales for the third quarter of 2019 relative to the same period of 2018 was driven by moderations in mobile devices, information technology and data communications, broadband communications, and mobile networks markets, offset in part by growth in the military, commercial aerospace, industrial and automotive markets, including contributions from the Company’s acquisition program.
Net sales in the Interconnect Products and Assemblies segment (approximately 95% of net sales) in the first nine months of 2019 increased 2% in U.S. dollars and 4% in constant currencies, while decreasing 1% organically, compared to the first nine months of 2018.
The sales growth in the first nine months of 2019 relative to the same period of 2018 was driven by growth in the military, commercial aerospace, mobile networks, industrial and automotive markets, including contributions from the Company’s acquisition program, offset in part by moderations in the mobile devices, broadband communications, and information technology and data communications markets.
Net sales in the Cable Products and Solutions segment (approximately 5% of net sales) in the third quarter of 2019, which primarily serves the broadband communications market, decreased 9% in U.S. dollars, 8% in constant currencies and 10%

organically, compared to the third quarter of 2018.
Net sales in the Cable Products and Solutions segment (approximately 5% of net sales) in the first nine months of 2019 decreased 10% in U.S. dollars, 8% in constant currencies and 9% organically, compared to the first nine months of 2018.
​



The table below reconciles Constant Currency Net Sales Growth and Organic Net Sales Growth to the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP financial measures for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2019 compared to the three and nine months ended September 30, 2018:



​[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]



(1)Net sales growth in U.S. dollars is calculated based on Net sales as reported in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income and Note 5 of the accompanying financial statements.
While the term “net sales growth in U.S. dollars” is not considered a U.S. GAAP financial measure, for purposes of this table, we derive the reported (GAAP) measure based on GAAP results, which serves as the basis for the reconciliation to its comparable non-GAAP financial measures.
(2)Foreign currency translation impact, a non-GAAP measure, represents the impact on net sales resulting from foreign currency exchange rate changes in the current year period(s) compared to the same period(s) in the prior year.
Such amount is calculated by subtracting current year net sales translated at average foreign currency exchange rates for the respective prior periods from current year reported net sales, taken as a percentage of the respective prior period net sales.
(3)Constant Currency Net Sales Growth and Organic Net Sales Growth are non-GAAP financial measures as defined in the "Non-GAAP Financial Measures" section.
(4)Acquisition impact, a non-GAAP measure, represents the impact on net sales resulting from acquisitions closed since the beginning of the prior calendar year, which were not included in the Company’s results as of the comparable prior year periods and which do not reflect the underlying growth of the Company on a comparative basis.
​



Geographically, sales in the United States in the third quarter of 2019 increased approximately 17% in U.S. dollars ($667.9 in 2019 versus $572.0 in 2018) and 5% organically, compared to the third quarter of 2018, and increased approximately 12% in U.S. dollars ($1,879.6 in 2019 versus $1,675.3 in 2018) and 4% organically in the first nine months of 2019, compared to the first nine months of 2018.
Foreign sales in the third quarter of 2019 decreased approximately 8% in U.S. dollars ($1,432.7 in 2019 versus $1,557.0 in 2018), 7% in constant currencies and 10% organically, compared to the third quarter of 2018, and decreased approximately 2% in U.S. dollars ($4,194.8 in 2019 versus $4,302.0 in 2018) and 3% organically, while remaining flat in constant currencies in the first nine months of 2019, compared to the first nine months of 2018.
​



Selling, general and administrative expenses increased to $248.3 or 11.8% of net sales and $722.5 or 11.9% of net sales for the third quarter and first nine months of 2019, respectively, compared to $244.0 or 11.5% of net sales and $710.6 or 11.9% of net sales for the third quarter and first nine months of 2018, respectively.
Administrative expenses represented approximately 4.8% and 4.7% of net sales for the third quarter and first nine months of 2019, respectively, and represented approximately 4.6% and 4.8% of net sales for the third quarter and first nine months of 2018, respectively.
Research and development expenses represented approximately 2.8% and 2.9% of net sales for the third quarter and first nine months of 2019, respectively, and represented approximately 2.6% and 2.7% of net sales for the third quarter and first nine months of 2018, respectively.
Selling and marketing expenses represented approximately 4.2% and 4.4% of net sales for the third quarter and first nine months of 2019, respectively, and represented approximately 4.2% and 4.4% of net sales for the third quarter and first nine months of 2018, respectively.
​



27 

Operating income was $413.6 or 19.7% of net sales and $1,189.4 or 19.6% of net sales for the third quarter and first nine months of 2019, respectively, compared to $444.2 or 20.9% of net sales and $1,229.3 or 20.6% of net sales for the third quarter and first nine months of 2018, respectively.
For the nine months ended September 30, 2019, these acquisition-related expenses had the effect of decreasing net income by $21.0 or $0.07 per share.
Operating income for the Interconnect Products and Assemblies segment for the third quarter and first nine months of 2019 was $433.9 or 21.7% of net sales and $1,272.4 or 22.0% of net sales, respectively, compared to $458.1 or 22.7% and $1,268.9 or 22.4% of net sales for the third quarter and first nine months of 2018, respectively.
Operating income for the Cable Products and Solutions segment for the third quarter and first nine months of 2019 was $10.2 or 10.2% of net sales and $29.3 or 10.3% of net sales, respectively, compared to $14.4 or 13.1% of net sales and $40.4 or 12.7% of net sales for the third quarter and first nine months of 2018, respectively.
​



Interest expense for the third quarter and first nine months of 2019 was $29.7 and $89.5, respectively, compared to $24.8 and $75.3 for the third quarter and first nine months of 2018, respectively.
The increase in interest expense is primarily due to higher average interest rates on the Company’s U.S. commercial paper borrowings and the 4.350% U.S. Senior Notes issuance in January 2019, along with higher average debt levels.
Certain borrowings under the U.S. Commercial Paper Program and net proceeds from the 4.350% U.S. Senior Notes were used to repay the Company’s 2.55% U.S. Senior Notes in January 2019.
​



Loss on early extinguishment of debt for the third quarter and first nine months of 2019 was $14.3.
The loss on early extinguishment of debt incurred during the third quarter of 2019 was related to refinancing-related costs, specifically premiums and fees incurred associated with the early extinguishment of certain redeemed principal amounts of the 3.125% Senior Notes and 4.00% Senior Notes (collectively, the “Tendered Notes”) as a result of the tender offers in September 2019.
Refer to Note 13 of the accompanying Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements and the Liquidity and Capital Resources section within this Item 2 for further information related to the Tendered Notes.
​



Provision for income taxes for the third quarter and first nine months of 2019 was at an effective tax rate of 24.5% and 22.9%, respectively.
Provision for income taxes for the third quarter and first nine months of 2018 was at an effective tax rate of 23.8% and 24.3%, respectively.
For the third quarter and first nine months of 2019 and 2018, the excess tax benefits resulting from stock option exercise activity had the impact of lowering the effective tax rate and increasing earnings per share by the amounts noted in the tables below.
The effective tax rate for the third quarter of 2019 was further impacted by the tax effect of the refinancing-related costs associated with the early extinguishment of debt, while the effective tax rate for the first nine months of 2019 was further impacted by the tax effects of both the acquisition-related expenses and the refinancing-related costs associated with the early extinguishment of debt, all as noted in the tables below.
Excluding the effect of these items, the Adjusted Effective Tax Rate, a non-GAAP financial measure as defined in the “Non-GAAP Financial Measures” section below within this Item 2, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2019 was 24.5%, and for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2018 was 25.5%, as reconciled in the tables below to the comparable effective tax rate based on GAAP results.
​



Net income attributable to Amphenol Corporation and Net income per common share-Diluted (“Diluted EPS”) were $280.3 and $0.92, respectively, for the third quarter of 2019, compared to $316.6 and $1.01, respectively, for the third quarter of 2018.
Excluding the effect of the excess tax benefits related to stock-based compensation and the refinancing-related costs associated with the early extinguishment of debt in the third quarter of 2019, Adjusted Net Income 



28 

attributable to Amphenol Corporation and Adjusted Diluted EPS, non-GAAP financial measures as defined in the “Non-GAAP Financial Measures” section below within this Item 2, were $291.2 and $0.95, respectively, for the third quarter of 2019, compared to $309.6 and $0.99, respectively, for the third quarter of 2018.
Net income attributable to Amphenol Corporation and Diluted EPS were $836.3 and $2.72, respectively, for the first nine months of 2019, compared to $866.9 and $2.76, respectively, for the first nine months of 2018.
Excluding the effect of the excess tax benefits related to stock-based compensation, the refinancing-related costs associated with the early extinguishment of debt, and acquisition-related expenses, Adjusted Net Income attributable to Amphenol Corporation and Adjusted Diluted EPS were $848.5 and $2.76, respectively, for the first nine months of 2019, compared to $852.8 and $2.72, respectively, for the first nine months of 2018.
​



The following tables reconcile Adjusted Operating Income, Adjusted Operating Margin, Adjusted Net Income attributable to Amphenol Corporation, Adjusted Effective Tax Rate and Adjusted Diluted EPS (all defined in the “Non-GAAP Financial Measures” section below) to the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP financial measures for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2019 and 2018:

(1)While the terms “operating margin” and “effective tax rate” are not considered U.S. GAAP financial measures, for purposes of this table, we derive the reported (GAAP) measures based on GAAP results, which serve as the basis for the reconciliation to their comparable non-GAAP financial measure.
​



Liquidity and Capital Resources



​



At September 30, 2019 and December 31, 2018, the Company had cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments of $986.7 and $1,291.7, respectively.
The majority of the Company’s cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments on hand as of September 30, 2019 and December 31, 2018 is located outside of the United States.
The Company 



29 

intends to evaluate future earnings for distribution, and accrue for those distributions where appropriate, and to indefinitely reinvest all other foreign earnings.
​



The Company’s primary sources of liquidity are internally generated cash flow, our cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments on hand, the Commercial Paper Programs, and the 2019 Revolving Credit Facility.
The Company believes that its cash, cash equivalents and short-term investment position on hand, ability to generate future cash flow from operations, availability under its credit facilities, and access to capital markets (including the issuances of the 2029 Senior Notes in January 2019 and the 2030 Senior Notes in September 2019, discussed further within this Item 2) provide adequate liquidity to meet its obligations for at least the next twelve months.
The Company’s debt service requirements consist primarily of principal and interest on the Company’s Senior Notes, the 2019 Revolving Credit Facility and the Commercial Paper Programs (all as defined below).
The Company may also use cash to fund all or part of the cost of acquisitions.
​



Cash Flow Summary



​



The following table summarizes the Company’s cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2019 and 2018, as reflected in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Cash Flow:



​[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]



​



Operating Activities



​



The ability to generate cash from operating activities is one of the Company’s fundamental financial strengths.
Cash flow provided by operating activities was $1,078.2 in the first nine months of 2019 compared to $734.5 in the first nine months of 2018.
The increase in cash flow provided by operating activities (“Operating Cash Flow”) for the first nine months of 2019 compared to the first nine months of 2018 is primarily related to a lower usage of cash related to the change in working capital.
In addition, Operating Cash Flow for the first nine months of 2018 included the Company’s voluntary cash contribution of approximately $81.0 during that period to fund its U.S. defined benefit pension plans (“U.S.
Plans”, and together with its foreign plans, the “Plans”), while no such voluntary cash contributions to the U.S. Plans were made in the first nine months of 2019.
​



In the first nine months of 2019, the components of working capital as presented on the accompanying Condensed Consolidated Statements of Cash Flow increased $27.1, excluding the impact of acquisitions and foreign currency translation, primarily due to decreases in accounts payable of $75.9 and accrued liabilities, including income taxes, of $74.4, partially offset by a decrease in accounts receivable of $129.6.
In the first nine months of 2018, the components of working capital as presented on the accompanying Condensed Consolidated Statements of Cash Flow increased $246.4, excluding the impact of acquisitions and foreign currency translation, primarily due to an increase in inventories of $184.2, accounts receivable of $182.5 and other current assets of $61.3, partially offset by increases in accounts payable of $150.8 and accrued liabilities, including income taxes, of $30.8.
​



30 

The following describes the significant changes in the amounts as presented on the accompanying Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets at September 30, 2019 as compared to December 31, 2018.
Days sales outstanding at September 30, 2019 and December 31, 2018 were approximately 72 and 73 days, respectively.
Inventory days at September 30, 2019 and December 31, 2018 were 79 and 74 days, respectively.
Goodwill increased $646.8 to $4,750.0, primarily as a result of goodwill recognized related to acquisitions that closed during the first nine months of 2019, which was partially offset by Translation.
Intangibles, net and other long-term assets increased $241.9 to $736.2, primarily due to (i) the adoption of the new lease standard (“Topic 842”) described in Note 15 of the accompanying Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements, which resulted in the recognition of $185.5 of operating lease right-of-use assets as of September 30, 2019 and (ii) the recognition of certain intangible assets related to the SSI acquisition and other 2019 acquisitions, partially offset by (iii) the amortization of $54.0 related to the Company’s intangible assets during the nine months ended September 30, 2019.
Payable days at September 30, 2019 and December 31, 2018 were approximately 52 and 53 days, respectively.
In the first quarter of 2018, the Company made a voluntary cash contribution to fund the Company’s U.S. Plans of approximately $81.0.
​



In addition to cash flow from operating activities, the Company also considers Free Cash Flow, a non-GAAP financial measure defined in the “Non-GAAP Financial Measures” section below, as a key metric in measuring the Company’s ability to generate cash.
The following table reconciles Free Cash Flow to its most directly comparable U.S. GAAP financial measure for the nine months ended September 30, 2019 and 2018.
The increase in Free Cash Flow is driven by an increase in Operating Cash Flow, as described above.
​[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]



​



Investing Activities



​



Cash flows from investing activities consist primarily of cash flows associated with capital expenditures, proceeds from disposals of property, plant and equipment, net sales and maturities (purchases) of short-term investments, and acquisitions.
​



Net cash used in investing activities was $1,111.0 in the first nine months of 2019, compared to $350.3 in the first nine months of 2018.
In the first nine months of 2019, net cash used in investing activities was driven primarily by the use of $891.2 in cash to fund acquisitions, capital expenditures (net of disposals) of $215.9, and net purchases of short-term investments of $3.9.
In the first nine months of 2018, net cash used in investing activities was driven primarily by the use of $158.9 in cash to fund acquisitions, along with capital expenditures (net of disposals) of $204.4, partially offset by net sales and maturities of short-term investments of $13.0.
31 

​



Financing Activities



​



Cash flows from financing activities consist primarily of cash flows associated with borrowings and repayments of the Company’s credit facilities and other long-term debt, repurchases of common stock, proceeds from stock option exercises, dividend payments, and distributions to and purchases of noncontrolling interests.
​



Net cash used in financing activities was $246.4 in the first nine months of 2019, compared to $1,068.6 in the first nine months of 2018.
For the first nine months of 2019, net cash used in financing activities was driven primarily by the aggregate repayments of certain of the Company’s senior notes and other long-term debt (primarily the 2.55% U.S. Senior Notes due January 2019 and the early extinguishment of the Tendered Notes in September 2019) of $1,111.2, repurchases of the Company’s common stock of $558.7, dividend payments of $205.5, distributions to and purchases of noncontrolling interests of $25.0, payments of costs of $14.9 related to debt financing primarily associated with the 2029 Senior Notes, the 2019 Revolving Credit Facility, and the 2030 Senior Notes (each as defined below), and premiums and fees paid of $13.4 related to the early extinguishment of the Tendered Notes, partially offset by aggregate net cash proceeds from the issuances of the 2029 Senior Notes and the 2030 Senior Notes of $1,398.8, cash proceeds from the exercise of stock options of $146.3, and net borrowings related to the Company’s commercial paper programs of $137.2.
For the first nine months of 2018, net cash used in financing activities was driven primarily by repurchases of the Company’s common stock of $680.2, net repayments related to the Company’s commercial paper programs of $300.1, dividend payments of $184.4, distributions to and purchases of noncontrolling interests of $17.9 and repayments of other long-term debt of $8.7, partially offset by cash proceeds from the exercise of stock options of $123.0.
​



The Company has significant flexibility to meet its financial commitments.
The Company uses debt financing to lower the overall cost of capital and increase return on stockholders’ equity.
The Company’s debt financing includes the use of commercial paper programs, revolving credit facility and senior notes as part of its overall cash management strategy.
​



On January 15, 2019, the Company amended its $2,000.0 unsecured credit facility (the “2016 Revolving Credit Facility”) with a $2,500.0 unsecured credit facility (“2019 Revolving Credit Facility”).
The 2019 Revolving Credit Facility, which matures January 2024, increases the lenders’ aggregate commitments by $500.0 and, consistent with the previous 2016 Revolving Credit Facility, gives the Company the ability to borrow at a spread over LIBOR.
The Company may utilize the 2019 Revolving Credit Facility for general corporate purposes.
At September 30, 2019, there were no borrowings under the 2019 Revolving Credit Facility.
The 2019 Revolving Credit Facility requires payment of certain annual agency and commitment fees and requires that the Company satisfy certain financial covenants.
At September 30, 2019, the Company was in compliance with the financial covenants under the Revolving Credit Facility.
​



Pursuant to the terms of the U.S. commercial paper program, the Company issues short-term unsecured commercial paper notes in one or more private placements in the United States (the “U.S.
Commercial Paper Program”).
The amount of U.S. commercial paper notes outstanding (“USCP Notes”) as of September 30, 2019 was $475.8.
​



Pursuant to the terms of the euro-commercial paper program (the “Euro Commercial Paper Program” and, together with the U.S. Commercial Paper Program, the “Commercial Paper Programs”), the Company and one of its wholly owned European subsidiaries (the “Euro Issuer”) issues short-term unsecured commercial paper notes (the “ECP Notes” and, together with the USCP Notes, the “Commercial Paper”), which are guaranteed by the Company and are to be issued outside of the United States.
The ECP Notes may be issued in Euros, Sterling, U.S.
Dollars or other currencies.
The amount of ECP Notes outstanding as of September 30, 2019 was €255.0 (approximately $277.9).
​



Amounts available under the Commercial Paper Programs may be borrowed, repaid and re-borrowed from time to time.
In conjunction with the 2019 Revolving Credit Facility, the authorization from the Company’s Board of Directors limits the maximum aggregate principal amount outstanding of USCP Notes, ECP Notes, and any other commercial paper, euro-commercial paper or similar programs at any time to $2,500.0.
In addition, the maximum aggregate principal amount outstanding of USCP Notes at any time was also increased to $2,500.0.
The maximum aggregate principal amount outstanding of ECP Notes at any time remains at $2,000.0.
The Commercial Paper Programs are rated A-2 by Standard & Poor’s and P-2 by Moody’s and are currently backstopped by the 2019 Revolving Credit Facility, as

amounts undrawn under the Company’s 2019 Revolving Credit Facility are available to repay Commercial Paper, if necessary.
Net proceeds of the issuances of Commercial Paper are expected to be used for general corporate purposes.

​



On September 4, 2019, the Company commenced tender offers (“Tender Offers”) to purchase for cash any and all of the Company’s outstanding (i) $375.0 principal amount of its 3.125% Senior Notes due September 2021 (“2021 Senior Notes”) and (ii) $500.0 principal amount of its 4.00% Senior Notes due February 2022 (“2022 Senior Notes”).
On September 11, 2019, as a result of the Tender Offers, the Company accepted for payment $147.3 aggregate principal amount of the 2021 Senior Notes and $205.0 aggregate principal amount of the 2022 Senior Notes for 101.9% and 104.5% of par value, respectively (collectively, the “Tendered Notes”), plus accrued and unpaid interest to, but not including, the settlement date of the Tender Offers.
The total consideration for the Tendered Notes was $368.8, which in addition to the Tendered Notes, included $13.4 of premiums and fees paid related to the early extinguishment of debt and $3.1 of accrued interest.
The remaining principal amounts associated with the 2021 Senior Notes and 2022 Senior Notes, which were not redeemed as a result of the Tender Offers, remain outstanding as of September 30, 2019.

​



In January 2019, the Company issued $500.0 principal amount of unsecured 4.350% Senior Notes due June 1, 2029 at 99.904% of face value (the “2029 Senior Notes”), the net proceeds of which were used, along with proceeds from borrowings under the U.S. Commercial Paper Program, to repay the $750.0 of the Company’s 2.55% Senior Notes due in January 2019.
​



On October 8, 2018, the Euro Issuer issued €500.0 (approximately $574.6 at date of issuance) principal amount of unsecured 2.000% Senior Notes due October 8, 2028 at 99.498% of face value (the “2028 Euro Notes”).
The 2028 Euro Notes are unsecured and rank equally in right of payment with the Euro Issuer’s other unsecured senior indebtedness, and are guaranteed on a senior unsecured basis by the Company.
Interest on the 2028 Euro Notes is payable annually on October 8 of each year, commencing on October 8, 2019.
The Company may, at its option, redeem some or all of the 2028 Euro Notes at any time by paying 100% of the principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the date of repurchase, and if redeemed prior to July 8, 2028, a make-whole premium.

​



On January 24, 2017, the Company’s Board of Directors authorized a stock repurchase program under which the Company could purchase up to $1,000.0 of the Company’s Common Stock during the two-year period ending January 24, 2019 (the “2017 Stock Repurchase Program”) in accordance with the requirements of Rule 10b-18 of the Exchange Act.
During the three months ended March 31, 2018, the Company repurchased 4.2 million shares of its Common Stock for $382.0 under the 2017 Stock Repurchase Program, bringing total repurchases under this program to 12.6 million shares or $1,000.0, thus completing the 2017 Stock Repurchase Program.
These repurchases in the first quarter of 2018, coupled with the Company’s repurchase of 3.5 million shares of its Common Stock for $298.2 under the 2018 Stock Repurchase Program during the six months ended September 30, 2018, resulted in total repurchases of 7.7 million shares for $680.2 during the nine months ended September 30, 2018.

​



Certain operations of the Company are subject to environmental laws and regulations which govern the discharge of pollutants into the air and water, as well as the handling and disposal of solid and hazardous wastes.
Non-GAAP financial measures related to net sales exclude the impact related to foreign currency exchange and acquisitions.
The non-GAAP financial information contained herein is included for supplemental purposes only and should not be considered in isolation, as a substitute for or superior to the related U.S. GAAP financial measures.
​



The non-GAAP financial measures defined below should be read in conjunction with the Company’s financial statements presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP.
Adjusted Diluted EPS is calculated as Adjusted Net Income attributable to Amphenol Corporation, as defined below, divided by the weighted average outstanding diluted shares as reported in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income.
​



●Adjusted Operating Margin is defined as Adjusted Operating Income (as defined above) expressed as a percentage of Net sales (as reported in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income).
Amphenol’s results are subject to volatility related to foreign currency translation fluctuations.
​



●Free Cash Flow is defined as Net cash provided by operating activities (“Operating Cash Flow” - as reported in accordance with U.S. GAAP) less capital expenditures (as reported in accordance with U.S. GAAP), both of which are derived from the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Cash Flow.

Item 3.
The Company does not have any significant concentration with any one counterparty.
There has been no material change in the Company’s assessment of its sensitivity to foreign currency exchange rate risk since its presentation set forth in Part II, Item 7A “Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk” in its 2018 Annual Report.
The Company may borrow under its Revolving Credit Facility and Commercial Paper Programs.
In addition, any borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility either bear interest at or trade at rates that fluctuate with a spread over LIBOR, while any borrowings under the Commercial Paper Programs are subject to floating interest rates.
Therefore, when the Company borrows under these debt instruments, the Company is exposed to market risk from exposure to changes in interest rates.
As of September 30, 2019, there were no outstanding borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility, while borrowings under the U.S. Commercial Paper Program and Euro Commercial Paper Program were at an average floating rate of 2.29% and (0.12)%, respectively.
The Company does not expect changes in interest rates to have a material effect on income or cash flows in 2019, although there can be no assurances that interest rates will not change significantly.
