Note 2.Recent Accounting Pronouncements



Accounting Pronouncements Recently Adopted



On August 29, 2018, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) No.
2018-15, “Customer’s Accounting for Implementation Costs Incurred in a Cloud Computing Arrangement That Is a Service Contract” (“ASU 2018-15”), to reduce diversity in practice in accounting for the costs of implementing cloud computing arrangements that are service contracts.
ASU 2018-15 allows entities to apply the guidance in the FASB Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) 350-40 to determine which implementation costs are eligible to be capitalized as assets in a cloud computing arrangement that is considered a service contract.
The Company adopted this standard on a prospective basis effective June 30, 2018, the beginning of fiscal year 2019, as allowed by the standard.
This standard did not have a material impact on the Company’s Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements upon adoption or for the three months ended September 28, 2018.
In February 2018, the FASB issued ASU No.
The adoption of this standard did not have a material impact on the Company’s Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements.
In August 2017, the FASB issued ASU No.
2017-12, “Derivatives and Hedging (Topic 815): Targeted Improvements to Accounting for Hedging Activities” (“ASU 2017-12”).
ASU 2017-12 simplifies hedge accounting through changes to both designation and measurement requirements.
For hedges that qualify as highly effective, the new standard eliminates the requirement to separately measure and record hedge ineffectiveness with the entire change in fair value of designated hedge reported in the results of operations in the same line item as the hedged item.
The Company early adopted this standard effective June 30, 2018, using the modified retrospective approach.
The adoption of this standard did not have a material impact on the Company’s Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements.
In May 2017, the FASB issued ASU No.
2017-09, “Compensation-Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Scope of Modification Accounting” (“ASU 2017-09”).
ASU 2017-09 provides clarification when a change to the terms or conditions of a share-based payment award must be accounted for as a modification.
The new guidance requires modification accounting if the fair value, vesting condition or the classification of the award is not the same immediately before and after a change to the terms and conditions of the award.
The Company adopted this standard on a prospective basis effective June 30, 2018.
The adoption of this standard did not have a material impact on the Company’s Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements.
In March 2017, the FASB issued ASU No.
2017-07, “Compensation-Retirement Benefits (Topic 715): Improving the Presentation of Net Periodic Pension Cost and Net Periodic Postretirement Benefit Cost” (“ASU 2017-07”).
ASU 2017-07 requires that the Company report the service cost component in the same line item or items as other compensation costs arising from services rendered by the pertinent employees during the period.
In addition, the other components of net benefit cost are now presented in Other expense, net in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations.
The Company adopted this standard effective June 30, 2018.
The adoption of this standard did not have a material impact on the Company’s Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements.
In January 2017, the FASB issued ASU No.
2017-01, “Business Combinations (Topic 805): Clarifying the Definition of a Business” (“ASU 2017-01”).
ASU 2017-01 narrows the definition of a “business.” This standard provides guidance to assist entities with evaluating when a set of transferred assets and activities is a business.
The Company adopted this standard effective June 30, 2018, and will apply it prospectively to transactions occurring thereafter.
The adoption of this standard did not have a material impact on the Company’s Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements.

In October 2016, the FASB issued ASU No.
2016-16, “Income Taxes (Topic 740): Intra-Entity Transfers of Assets Other Than Inventory” (“ASU 2016-16”).
ASU 2016-16 removes the prohibition in the FASB ASC Topic 740 against the immediate recognition of the current and deferred income tax effects of intra-entity transfers of assets other than inventory.
The new standard is intended to reduce the complexity and diversity in practice related to the tax consequences of certain types of intra-entity asset transfers, particularly those involving IP.
The Company adopted this standard effective June 30, 2018.
The adoption of this standard did not have a material impact on the Company’s Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements.
In January 2016, the FASB issued ASU No.
2016-01, “Financial Instruments — Overall (Subtopic 825-10): Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities” (“ASU 2016-01”).
ASU 2016-01 provides guidance related to accounting for equity investments, financial liabilities under the fair value option and the presentation and disclosure requirements for financial instruments.
Marketable equity securities previously classified as available-for-sale equity investments are now measured and recorded at fair value with changes in fair value recorded within Other expense, net in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations rather than as a component of Other comprehensive income as in prior years.
The Company adopted this standard effective June 30, 2018.
The adoption of this standard did not have a material impact on the Company’s Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements.
In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU No.
2014-09, “Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606),” which superseded the requirements in ASC 605 “Revenue Recognition” (Topic 605).
Topic 606 outlines a comprehensive five-step revenue recognition model based on the principle that an entity should recognize revenue when control of the promised goods or services is transferred to customers at an amount that reflects the consideration to which the Company expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services.
The Company adopted Topic 606 effective June 30, 2018, using the modified retrospective method to all contracts that were not completed contracts as of the beginning of the fiscal year.
The cumulative effect of adopting Topic 606 was a post-tax increase to the opening retained earnings of $56 million as of June 30, 2018, which was primarily related to our license and royalty revenue arrangements.
These arrangements had no remaining performance obligation but were previously recognized under Topic 605 when they were reported to the Company by its licensees, which was generally one quarter in arrears from the licensees’ sales of the licensed products.
See Note 3, Revenues, for additional disclosures related to this standard.
Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet Adopted



In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU No.
2016-13, “Financial Instruments-Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments” (“ASU 2016-13”).
ASU 2016-13 seeks to provide financial statement users with more decision-useful information about the expected credit losses on financial instruments, including trade receivables, and other commitments to extend credit held by a reporting entity at each reporting date.
The amendments require an entity to replace the incurred loss impairment methodology in current U.S. GAAP with a methodology that reflects current expected credit losses and requires consideration of a broader range of reasonable and supportable information to inform credit loss estimates.
The amendments are effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2019, which for the Company is the first quarter of fiscal 2021.
The Company is currently evaluating the impact this update will have on its Consolidated Financial Statements.

In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No.
2016-02, “Leases (Topic 842)” (“ASU 2016-02”).
ASU 2016-02 supersedes ASC 840 “Leases”.
The amendments in this update require, among other things, that lessees recognize the following for all leases (unless a policy election is made by class of underlying asset to exclude short-term leases) at the commencement date: (1) a lease liability, which is a lessee’s obligation to make lease payments arising from a lease, measured on a discounted basis; and (2) a right-of-use asset, which is an asset that represents the lessee’s right to use, or the direct use of, a specified asset for the lease term.
The FASB issued ASU 2018-11 on July 30, 2018, which allows entities to apply the provisions of ASC 842 at the effective date without adjusting comparative periods.
The standard is effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2018, with early adoption permitted.
As the Company plans for the adoption of this standard, the Company has completed its first phase of identifying its leases including the identification of embedded leases.
The Company is in the process of identifying changes to its processes, internal controls and system requirements and configurations for a new lease accounting system to address the new lease standard.
The Company’s implementation efforts are progressing as planned.
The Company expects to adopt this standard in the first quarter of fiscal 2020 and expects to elect the practical expedient to not present historical comparative information.
The Company continues to evaluate the impact ASU 2016-02 will have on its Consolidated Financial Statements.

Note 3.Revenues 



The Company offers a broad range of data storage products that include Client Devices, Data Center Devices and Solutions, and Client Solutions.
Client Devices consist of hard disk drives (“HDDs”) and solid state drives (“SSDs”) for computing devices; flash-based embedded storage products; and flash-based memory wafers.
Data Center Devices and Solutions consist of high-capacity enterprise HDDs and high-performance enterprise SSDs, data center software and system solutions.
Client Solutions consist of HDDs and SSDs embedded into external storage products and removable flash-based products.
The Company recognizes revenue when it satisfies a performance obligation by transferring control over a product or service to the customer.
The Company’s services revenue mainly includes post contract customer support, warranty as a service and maintenance contracts.
The performance obligations for the Company’s services are generally satisfied ratably over the service period based on the nature of the service provided and contract terms.
Revenue for a right to access arrangement is recognized over the contract period using the time lapse method.
For the sales-based royalty arrangements, the Company estimates and recognizes revenue in the period in which customers’ licensable sales occur.
The Company’s customer payment terms are typically less than three months from the date control over the product or service is transferred to the customer.
The Company uses the practical expedient and does not recognize a significant financing component for payment considerations of less than one year.
The financing components of contracts with payment terms were not material.
The Company provides distributors and retailers (collectively referred to as “resellers”) with limited price protection for inventories held by resellers at the time of published list price reductions and/or a right of return.
The Company also provides resellers and original equipment manufacturers (“OEMs”) with other sales incentive programs.
The Company uses judgment in its assessment of variable consideration in contracts to be included in the transaction price.
The Company uses the expected value method to arrive at the amount of variable consideration.
The Company believes the estimate of variable consideration is not constrained and that the expected value method is the appropriate estimate of the amount of variable consideration based on the fact that the Company has a large number of contracts with similar characteristics.
Some of the Company’s revenue arrangements include more than one performance obligation, which are typically comprised of tangible products, software and support services for multiple distinct licenses.
For these multiple-element arrangements, the Company evaluates whether each deliverable is a distinct promise and should be accounted for as a separate performance obligation.
If a promised good or service is not distinct in accordance with the revenue guidance, the Company combines that good or service with the other promised goods or services in the arrangement until a distinct bundle of goods is identified.
The Company allocates the transaction price to the performance obligations of each distinct product or service, or distinct bundle, based on their relative standalone selling prices.
Where a separate standalone selling price is not available, the transaction price is based on the Company’s best estimate of the selling price.
The Company uses one or a combination of more than one of the following methods to estimate the standalone selling price: the adjusted market assessment approach, the expected cost plus a margin approach, or another suitable method based on the facts and circumstances.

Contract assets represent the Company’s rights to consideration where performance obligations are completed but the customer payments are not due until another performance obligation is satisfied.
The Company did not have any contract assets as of either September 28, 2018 or the date of adoption of Topic 606.
The Company incurs sales commissions and other direct incremental costs to obtain sales contracts.
Prior to the adoption of the new revenue standard, the Company’s policy was to expense all contract acquisition costs as incurred.
Total capitalized contract costs and the related amortization as of and for the three months ended September 28, 2018 were not material.
Contract liabilities relate to customers’ payments in advance of performance under the contract and primarily relate to remaining performance obligations under support and maintenance contracts.
As of September 28, 2018 and the date of adoption of Topic 606, contract liabilities were $86 million and $120 million, respectively, and were reflected in Accrued expenses.
Changes in the contract liability balance during the three months ended September 28, 2018 were primarily the result of $41 million of revenue recognized during the period that was deferred at June 29, 2018, partially offset by payments received and billings in advance of satisfying performance obligations.
The Company applies the practical expedients and does not disclose transaction price allocated to the remaining performance obligations for (i) arrangements that have an original expected duration of one year or less, which mainly consist of the support and maintenance contracts, and (ii) variable consideration amounts for sale-based or usage-based royalties for IP license arrangements, which typically range longer than one year.
Remaining performance obligations are mainly attributed to unearned revenue and multi-year contracts with future installment payments at the end of any given period.
The transaction price allocated to the other remaining performance obligations as of September 28, 2018 was $263 million, which is mainly attributable to the functional IP license and service arrangements.
The Company expects to recognize this amount as revenue as follows: $87 million during the remainder of fiscal 2019, $58 million in fiscal 2020, $45 million in fiscal 2021 and $73 million thereafter.
The impact of the adoption of Topic 606 was not material.
For the three months ended September 28, 2018 and September 29, 2017, two customers accounted for 11% and 10%, respectively, of the Company’s net revenue.
For the three months ended September 28, 2018 and September 29, 2017, the Company’s top 10 customers accounted for 48% and 42% of the Company’s net revenue, respectively.

The Company is committed to purchase its provided three-month forecast of Flash Ventures’ flash-based wafer supply, which generally equals 50% of Flash Ventures’ output.
The Company is not able to estimate its total wafer purchase commitment obligation beyond its rolling three-month purchase commitment because the price is determined by reference to the future cost of producing the semiconductor wafers.
The Company is obligated to pay for half of Flash Ventures’ fixed costs regardless of the output the Company chooses to purchase.
In addition, the Company is committed to fund 49.9% to 50.0% of each Flash Ventures entity’s investments to the extent that each Flash Ventures entity’s operating cash flow is insufficient to fund these investments.
Off-Balance Sheet Liabilities

Re-measurement of deferred taxes



The Company recorded a provisional income tax benefit of $65 million for the year ended June 29, 2018, which related to the re-measurements of the Company’s deferred tax balances and is based primarily on the rates at which the deferred tax assets and liabilities are expected to reverse in the current and future fiscal years, which are generally 29% and 22%, respectively.
The Company did not make any material refinements to the provisional estimate for the three months ended September 28, 2018.
For the year ended June 29, 2018, the Company recorded a provisional amount for the mandatory deemed repatriation tax liability of $1.57 billion for foreign subsidiaries.
On August 1, 2018, the U.S. Treasury issued proposed regulations as guidance for the mandatory deemed repatriation tax.
The Company will continue to evaluate the impact of this guidance through the end of the one-year measurement period.
As such, the provisional amount may change during the one-year measurement period when the Company finalizes the calculation of post-1986 foreign earnings and profits and the amount of foreign earnings held in cash or other specified assets.
During the three months ended September 28, 2018, the Company reduced its mandatory deemed repatriation tax liability by $302 million, of which $250 million was for the utilization of recorded deferred tax assets related to existing tax attributes.
The utilization of the deferred tax assets is a reclassification that did not have an impact on the Company’s income tax provision for the three months ended September 28, 2018.
The remaining $52 million reduction to the mandatory deemed repatriation tax primarily relates to the Company’s decision to no longer carry forward its 2018 operating loss and, instead, apply it against the mandatory deemed repatriation tax.
The Company’s provisional estimate of the mandatory repatriation tax liability after these refinements is $1.26 billion.
The provisional tax expense recorded by the Company as of June 28, 2018 was based upon an assumption that foreign undistributed earnings are indefinitely reinvested.
The Company will continue to evaluate whether or not to assert indefinite reinvestment on its remaining foreign undistributed earnings upon the completion of the calculation of the incremental tax effects on the repatriation of foreign undistributed earnings.
This provision is effective for tax years beginning on or after January 1, 2018, which for the Company would be the fiscal year beginning on June 30, 2018 (fiscal year 2019).
The primary drivers for the difference between the effective tax rate for the three months ended September 29, 2017 and the U.S. Federal statutory rate of 35% are windfall benefits related to vesting and exercises of stock-based awards, the generation of tax credits and tax holidays in Malaysia, Philippines, Singapore and Thailand.
During the three months ended September 28, 2018, the Company recorded an increase of $6 million in its liability for unrecognized tax benefits (excluding accrued interest and penalties).
As of September 28, 2018, the Company’s liability for unrecognized tax benefits (excluding accrued interest and penalties) was approximately $557 million.
Accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as of September 28, 2018 was $112 million.
The Company and the IRS Appeals Office did not reach a settlement on the disputed matters.
The Company filed a petition with the U.S. Tax Court in September 2018.
As of September 28, 2018, it was not possible to estimate the amount of change, if any, in the unrecognized tax benefits that is reasonably possible within the next twelve months.
The Company computes basic income per common share using net income and the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period.
Diluted income per common share is computed using net income and the weighted average number of common shares and potentially dilutive common shares outstanding during the period.
Potentially dilutive common shares include dilutive outstanding employee stock options, RSUs and PSUs, and rights to purchase shares of common stock under the Company’s ESPP.
The Company expects the closure to be substantially completed by the end of the calendar year 2019 and to result in total pre-tax charges of approximately $160 million.
These charges are expected to consist of approximately $85 million in employee termination benefits and $75 million in asset-related, contract termination and other charges.
During the three months ended September 28, 2018, the Company recognized $4 million in employee termination benefits.
The following table presents an analysis of the components of the restructuring charges, payments and adjustments made against the reserve during the three months ended September 28, 2018:

Securities



Beginning in March 2015, SanDisk and two of its officers, Sanjay Mehrotra and Judy Bruner, were named in three putative class action lawsuits filed with the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California.
Two complaints are brought on behalf of a purported class of purchasers of SanDisk’s securities between October 2014 and March 2015, and one is brought on behalf of a purported class of purchasers of SanDisk’s securities between April 2014 and April 2015.
The complaints seek, among other things, damages and fees and costs.
In July 2015, the District Court consolidated the cases and appointed Union Asset Management Holding AG and KBC Asset Management NV as lead plaintiffs.
The lead plaintiffs filed an amended complaint in August 2015.
In January 2016, the District Court granted the defendants’ motion to dismiss and dismissed the amended complaint with leave to amend.
In February 2016, the District Court issued an order appointing as new lead plaintiffs Bristol Pension Fund; City of Milford, Connecticut Pension & Retirement Board; Pavers and Road Builders Pension, Annuity and Welfare Funds; the Newport News Employees’ Retirement Fund; and Massachusetts Laborers’ Pension Fund (collectively, the “Institutional Investor Group”).

In June 2016, the District Court granted the defendants’ motion to dismiss and dismissed the amended complaint with leave to amend.
In July 2016, the Institutional Investor Group filed a further amended complaint.

The Institutional Investor Group alleges artificial inflation in the price of SanDisk’s publicly traded common stock of $9.04 per share from October 16, 2014 through March 25, 2015, $2.26 per share on March 26, 2015, and $1.35 per share from March 27, 2015 through April 15, 2015.
The Company believes the allegations to be without merit and intends to defend itself vigorously in this matter.
Copyright



In December 2011, the German Central Organization for Private Copying Rights (Zentralstelle für private Überspielungsrechte) (“ZPÜ”), an organization consisting of several copyright collecting societies, instituted arbitration proceedings against WD’s German subsidiary (“WD Germany”) before the Copyright Arbitration Board (“CAB”) claiming copyright levies for multimedia hard drives, external hard drives and network hard drives sold or introduced into commerce in Germany by WD Germany from January 2008 through December 2010.
In February 2013, WD Germany filed a declaratory relief action against ZPÜ in the Higher Regional Court of Munich (the “Higher Court”), seeking an order from the Higher Court to determine the copyright levy issue.
In May 2013, ZPÜ filed a counter-claim against WD Germany with the Higher Court, seeking copyright levies for multimedia hard drives, external hard drives and network hard drives sold or introduced into commerce from January 2008 through December 2010 based on tariffs published by ZPÜ in November 2011.
In January 2015, the Higher Court ruled in favor of ZPÜ.
In its ruling, the Higher Court declared that WD Germany must pay certain levies on certain products that it sold in Germany between January 2008 and December 2010.
The judgment specified levy amounts on certain products sold from January 2008 through December 2010 and directed WD Germany to disclose applicable sales data to ZPÜ.
The exact amount of the judgment had not been determined.
ZPÜ and WD Germany filed appeals with the German Federal Court of Justice in February 2015.
In March 2017, the German Federal Court of Justice rendered a judgment affirming ZPÜ’s claim concerning the disclosure of WD Germany’s sales data regarding HDDs sold between January 2008 and December 2010.
The German Federal Court of Justice also set aside the Higher Court’s decision on the levy amounts and referred the case back to the Higher Court for further fact finding and decision on the levy amounts.
In December 2014, ZPÜ submitted a pleading to the CAB seeking copyright levies for multimedia hard drives, external hard drives and network hard drives sold or introduced into commerce in Germany by WD Germany between January 2012 and December 2013.
On or around June 29, 2018, the Company elected to join the agreement.
Pursuant to the agreement, the Company and ZPÜ intend to dismiss the actions against each other following an accounting and payment of past liabilities.
Other Matters



In the normal course of business, the Company is subject to other legal proceedings, lawsuits and other claims.
