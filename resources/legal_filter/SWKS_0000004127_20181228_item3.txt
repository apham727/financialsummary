Item 3.
Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk.
We are subject to overall financial market risks, such as changes in market liquidity, credit quality, investment risk, interest rate risk, and foreign exchange rate risk as described below.
Investment and Interest Rate Risk



Our exposure to interest rate and general market risks relates principally to our investment portfolio, which consists of cash and cash equivalents (money market funds and marketable securities purchased with less than ninety days until maturity) that total approximately $1,085.7 million and marketable securities (U.S. Treasury and government securities, corporate bonds and notes, 



 19

municipal bonds, other government securities) that total approximately $13.4 million and $2.7 million within short-term and long-term marketable securities, respectively, as of December 28, 2018.
The main objectives of our investment activities are liquidity and preservation of capital.
Our cash equivalent investments have short-term maturity periods that dampen the impact of market or interest rate risk.
Our marketable securities consist of short-term and long-term maturity periods between 90 days and two years.
Credit risk associated with our investments is not material because our investments are diversified across several types of securities with high credit ratings, which reduces the amount of credit exposure to any one investment.
Based on our results of operations for the three months ended December 28, 2018, a hypothetical reduction in the interest rates on our cash, cash equivalents, and other investments to zero would result in an immaterial reduction of interest income with a de minimis impact on income before taxes.
A percentage of our international operational expenses are denominated in foreign currencies and exchange rate volatility could positively or negatively impact those operating costs.
Conversely, decreases in the value of the United States dollar relative to other currencies could result in our suppliers raising their prices to continue doing business with us.
We may enter into foreign currency forward and option contracts with financial institutions to protect against foreign exchange risks associated with certain existing assets and liabilities, certain firmly committed transactions, forecasted future cash flows and net investments in foreign subsidiaries.
However, we may choose not to hedge certain foreign exchange exposures for a variety of reasons, including, but not limited to, accounting considerations and the prohibitive economic cost of hedging particular exposures.
For the three months ended December 28, 2018, we had no outstanding foreign currency forward or option contracts with financial institutions.
