ITEM 1A.
Part I, Item 1A of our Annual Report is incorporated herein by reference.
We are subject to risks in connection with the announcement and pendency of the Merger including the following:



•the uncertainty of the pending Merger may cause our existing customers to investigate alternatives and/or switch to alternate suppliers;



•other parties with whom we have business relationships may experience uncertainty as to the future of those relationships and may delay or defer certain business decisions, seek alternative relationships with third parties, or seek to alter their present business relationships with us; 



•parties with whom we otherwise may have sought to establish business relationships may seek alternative relationships with third parties instead of us;



•current and prospective employees may experience uncertainty about their roles following the Merger and we might not be able to attract, recruit, retain, and motivate key talent, including senior leaders, to the same extent that we have previously been able to attract, recruit, retain, and motivate employees; 



•legal proceedings challenging the Merger may divert management time and attention, may require us to incur significant attorneys fees and other expenses, and may result in unfavorable outcomes that could delay or prevent the Merger from being completed; 



•restrictions in the Agreement and Plan of Merger dated June 3, 2019, by and among Infineon, its subsidiary IFX Merger Sub, Inc., and the Company (the "Merger Agreement") may prevent us from pursuing opportunities without Infineon’s approval or taking other actions that we might have undertaken in the absence of the Merger, and may affect our ability to execute our business strategies, respond effectively to competitive pressures and industry developments, and attain our financial and other goals (including with respect to our current and prospective employees and parties with whom we have or seek to establish business relationships);



•restrictions in the Merger Agreement on our ability to pursue alternative transactions to the Merger could, in specified circumstances, require us to pay Infineon a termination fee of $330 million, and could otherwise discourage or deter a third party from considering or proposing an alternative transaction with us; and



•we have diverted, and will continue to divert, significant management and other internal resources towards the completion of the Merger.
Each of our and Infineon’s obligations to complete the Merger is subject to a number of conditions specified in the Merger Agreement, including, among others: (i) the adoption of the Merger Agreement by the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of Cypress common stock; (ii) the absence of any law prohibiting or order preventing the completion of the Merger; (iii) the receipt of clearance from the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, the expiration or termination of any applicable waiting period under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended (the "HSR Waiting Period"), the receipt of any applicable clearance or affirmative approval by the Anti-Monopoly Bureau of the State Administration for Market Regulation in the People’s Republic of China, approval from the European Commission under the European Merger Regulation, and the expiration of any applicable waiting periods or any applicable authorizations or affirmative approvals of certain other non-U.S. governmental authorities under antitrust laws; (iv) the absence of a material adverse effect with respect to Cypress; and (v) compliance in all material respects on the part of each of Cypress and Infineon with such party’s covenants under the Merger Agreement.
As of October 30, 2019, stockholder approval for the Merger has been obtained, the applicable HSR Waiting Period has been terminated, and the Merger has received clearance from the European Commission and from antitrust regulators in the Philippines and South Korea.
However, there can be no assurance that the other conditions to the completion of the Merger will be satisfied in a timely manner or at all.
If the Merger is not completed, Cypress's stockholders will not receive the proposed Merger consideration.
Regulatory and governmental entities may impose conditions on the granting of the required regulatory clearances and approvals described above.
In that case, lengthy negotiations may ensue among these regulatory or governmental entities, Infineon and us, which could delay the closing (and any receipt of Merger consideration) and increase the risk that the merger might not be completed.
Our joint venture for NAND flash memory products might not be successful.
On April 1, 2019, we launched a joint venture in Hong Kong with SK hynix system ic Inc. ("SKHS"), which is a wholly-owned subsidiary of SK hynix Inc. ("SKH"), a South Korean company.
The joint venture entity, SkyHigh Memory Limited ("SkyHigh"), is controlled by SKHS.
We contributed our NAND flash memory business to the joint venture.
Upon launch, SkyHigh entered into a wafer supply agreement with SKH, and back-end manufacturing and transition services agreements with Cypress.
Any failure by SkyHigh to satisfy customer expectations could adversely impact our own relationships with such customers and/or the reputation of our brand.
Any failure by SkyHigh to meet its commitments to Cypress under our back-end manufacturing agreement could cause Cypress's assembly and testing facilities to be underutilized and could adversely affect Cypress's operating margins.
In addition, there can be no assurance that the joint venture will be profitable.
We therefore face a risk that our investment might not generate meaningful cash flows to re-invest, for example, in higher-margin areas of our business.
Such risks could be exacerbated by unfavorable financial market and macroeconomic conditions, causing the value of this joint venture investment to decline and leading to impairment charges.
We have invested in certain privately-held companies.
There can be no guarantee that such businesses will perform as initially expected, launch new products and solutions as initially expected, or gain or maintain market acceptance.
When the value of a privately-held investment declines, we may be required to record an impairment of the investment's carrying value on our books.
For example:



•During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017, we determined that our investment in Enovix Corporation, which is accounted for as an equity method investment, was other-than temporarily impaired as Enovix did not achieve key planned product development milestones.
Consequently, we recognized an impairment charge of $51.2 million related to our investment in Enovix, reducing the carrying value of such investment on our books to zero.
•During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018, we determined that our investment in Deca Technologies Inc. ("Deca") was other-than temporarily impaired due to significant delays in Deca's commercialization and achievement of scalable production of certain key products, and consequently we recognized an impairment charge of $41.5 million to write down the carrying value of our investment in Deca to $65.1 million (the estimated fair value of our investment as of the end of fiscal 2018).
•During the second quarter of fiscal 2019, we determined that our investment in Deca had become further impaired due to a significant reduction in orders from Deca's key customers, and based on other objective indicators of enterprise value.
Consequently, we recognized an additional impairment charge of $29.5 million to write down the carrying value of our investment in Deca to $28.6 million (the estimated fair value of our investment as of June 30, 2019).
In particular, there is a substantial risk that the carrying value of our investment in Deca may become further impaired.
Deca’s current and future revenues are dependent on a small number of significant customers.
On October 1, 2019 Deca reached a definitive agreement with nepes Corporation (“nepes”) to sell Deca’s Philippines manufacturing facility to nepes, subject to completion of regulatory approvals and other customary closing conditions.
As part of the agreement, nepes has licensed certain Deca technologies, and nepes will purchase a limited number of Deca’s shares from certain existing shareholders which may include Cypress.
The agreement provides for milestone-based payments from nepes to Deca both for the Philippines manufacturing facility purchase and the technology license, which milestones are currently expected to be achieved in 2020.
Upon closing the agreement with nepes, Deca's remaining assets will primarily consist of intellectual property.
As of September 29, 2019, we held 52.5% of Deca's outstanding voting shares and the carrying value of our investment in Deca was $25.6 million.
The exchange or conversion, as applicable, of the Spansion Notes and the 2022 Notes could dilute the ownership interest of our existing stockholders and negatively impact our financial position.
The exchange or conversion, as applicable, of some or all of Spansion's 2% Exchangeable Senior Notes due 2020 (the "Spansion Notes") or our 4.5% Convertible Senior Notes due 2022 (the "2022 Notes") could dilute the ownership interest of our existing stockholders and negatively impact our financial position.
The Spansion Notes and the 2022 Notes are each exchangeable or convertible, as applicable, into shares of the Company’s common stock at the election of the holders of such series of notes upon the occurrence of certain conditions specified in the indenture governing such series of notes, including during any fiscal quarter (and only during such fiscal quarter), if the last reported sale price of the Company’s common stock for at least 20 trading days (whether or not consecutive) during a period of 30 consecutive trading days ending on the last trading day of the immediately preceding fiscal quarter is greater than or equal to 130% of the exchange or conversion price of the applicable series of notes on each applicable trading day (the "sales price condition").
Any exchange or conversion, as applicable, of the Spansion Notes or 2022 Notes may be settled in cash, shares of the Company’s common stock or a combination of cash and shares of the Company’s common stock, in each case at our election.
The sales price condition for the Spansion Notes and the 2022 Notes was met on the last trading day of the Company’s fiscal quarter ended September 29, 2019 and, as a result, holders of the Spansion Notes and the 2022 Notes, as applicable, may, at their option, exchange or convert, as applicable, their notes during the Company’s fiscal quarter ending December 29, 2019.
Additionally, if we elect to settle all or any portion of such exchanges or conversions of Spansion Notes or 2022 Notes, as applicable, in cash, such payments of cash would reduce our available cash and negatively impact our liquidity.
Borrowings under our revolving credit facility (our "Revolving Credit Facility") may, at our option, bear interest at a floating rate based on the London Inter-bank Offered Rate ("LIBOR").
We also have entered into fixed-for-floating interest rate forward swap agreements to manage our exposure to fluctuations in the LIBOR benchmark interest rate.
As described in Note 14 (Foreign Currency and Interest Rate Derivatives) to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements in Part I of this Quarterly Report, we pay the counterparties to these swap agreements a fixed rate in return for a LIBOR-based floating rate, which we use to fund payments under our Revolving Credit Facility.
The aggregate notional amount of these swap agreements is $300 million.
In July 2017, the United Kingdom’s Financial Conduct Authority (the "FCA"), which regulates LIBOR, announced that after December 31, 2021, it would no longer compel banks to submit the rates required to calculate LIBOR.
We cannot predict the effect of the FCA’s decision not to sustain LIBOR or, if changes ultimately are made to LIBOR, the effect those changes may have on the interest we pay on our Revolving Credit Facility and the payments we receive under our interest rate forward swap agreements.
In anticipation of LIBOR’s discontinuation, our Revolving Credit Facility agreement, as amended on July 31, 2019, provides a transition mechanism to a LIBOR-replacement rate to be mutually agreed upon by us and our lenders.
There can be no assurance, however, that we will be able to reach an agreement with our lenders on any such replacement benchmark before experiencing adverse effects due to changes in interest rates, if at all.
In addition, any such changes under the Revolving Credit Facility may result in interest rates and/or payments that are higher or lower than payments we presently are obligated to make under our revolving credit facility.
We also may seek to amend our swap agreements to replace the benchmark rate.
There can be no assurance, however, that the counterparties to those agreements will agree to a replacement rate, and any such changes to the swap agreements may result in us receiving payments that are higher or lower than the payments we are entitled to receive under our existing swap agreements.
