Item 4.Controls and Procedures



Disclosure controls and procedures are controls and other procedures that are designed to reasonably ensure that information required to be disclosed in the reports filed or submitted by us under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”), is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) rules and forms.
Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to reasonably ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports filed under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to management, including the principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.
As required by SEC rules, we have evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of November 30, 2018.
This evaluation was carried out under the supervision and with the participation of management, including the principal executive officer and principal financial officer.
Based on this evaluation, these officers have concluded that the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures are effective at a reasonable assurance level as of November 30, 2018.
Because of these limitations, misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and may not be detected.
