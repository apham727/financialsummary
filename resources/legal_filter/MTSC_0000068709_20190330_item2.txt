Acquisition



On November 21, 2018, we acquired E2M Technologies B.V. (E2M) for a cash purchase price of $80,287.
We funded the acquisition of E2M through borrowings on our Revolving Credit Facility.
See Note 18 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 1 of Part I of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for further discussion of the acquisition of E2M.
Financing



On November 21, 2018, we amended the Credit Agreement to increase the size of our Revolving Credit Facility from $120,000 to $150,000 and to extend the expiration date to July 5, 2022.
The size of the Revolving Credit Facility was increased to finance the purchase of E2M.
See Note 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 1 of Part I of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for further discussion of the amendment to the Credit Agreement.
Foreign Currency



Approximately 70% of our revenue has historically been derived from customers outside of the U.S. Our financial results are principally exposed to changes in exchange rates between the U.S. dollar and the Euro, the Japanese yen and the Chinese yuan.
The discussion below quantifies the impact of foreign currency translation on our financial results for the periods discussed.
Adoption of New Revenue Recognition Standard



In fiscal year 2019, we adopted Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No.
2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606), followed by related amendments (collectively, "the new revenue standard" or "ASC 606").
See Note 2 and Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 1 of Part I of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the impact of this adoption on our Consolidated Income Statements and Consolidated Balance Sheets.

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 



Revenue for the three and six months ended March 30, 2019 increased 21.8% and 13.2%, respectively, primarily driven by growth in both the Test & Simulation and Sensors businesses, partially offset by the unfavorable impact of currency translation.
Test & Simulation revenue for the three and six months ended March 30, 2019 increased $40,794 and $48,151, respectively, primarily driven by growth in equipment volume from conversion of robust beginning-of-year backlog across all sectors and strong current-year order volume and the acquisition of E2M in the first quarter of fiscal year 2019.
The increase was partially offset by the unfavorable impact of currency translation.
Sensors revenue for the three and six months ended March 30, 2019 increased $833 and $2,824, respectively, primarily driven by continued growth in the Sensors position sector from ongoing strength in industrial and mobile hydraulics markets and growth in the Sensors test sector from a multi-year contract with the U.S. Department of Defense, partially offset by the unfavorable impact of currency translation.
Excluding the impact of currency translation and the E2M acquisition, revenue increased 19.5% and 11.7%, respectively.
[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 



Gross profit for the three and six months ended March 30, 2019 increased 16.7% and 8.4%, respectively, primarily driven by revenue growth in Test & Simulation and the gross profit contribution from the E2M acquisition.
This increase was partially offset by increased compensation expense, revenue mix between Test & Simulation and Sensors, the E2M inventory acquisition adjustment of $539 and $984, respectively, and the unfavorable impact of currency translation.
Gross margin rate declined 1.6 percentage points in both periods primarily due to increased compensation expense, revenue mix between Test & Simulation and Sensors, and the E2M inventory acquisition adjustment.
Excluding the impact of currency translation, the E2M acquisition, and restructuring costs incurred in both fiscal years, gross profit increased 14.8% and 7.4% and the gross margin rate declined 1.6 and 1.5 percentage points, respectively.
[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 



Selling and marketing expense for the three and six months ended March 30, 2019 increased 9.1% and 4.6%, respectively, primarily due to increased compensation and commissions expense to support sales growth and the addition of E2M expenses, partially offset by the favorable impact of currency translation.
36

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 



General and administrative expense for the three and six months ended March 30, 2019 increased 16.4% and 9.2%, respectively, primarily due to the addition of E2M expenses, acquisition-related expenses, higher compensation expense in Sensors and increased professional fees, partially offset by lower compensation expense in Test & Simulation.
[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 



Research and development (R&D) expense for the three months ended March 30, 2019 declined 11.0% primarily due to lower compensation expense in Test & Simulation, partially offset by the addition of E2M expenses.

Excluding the impact of currency translation and E2M expenses, R&D expense decreased 17.7%.
[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 



Income from operations for the three and six months ended March 30, 2019 increased 45.5% and 27.3%, respectively, primarily due to increased gross profit on higher revenue volume and the impact of the E2M acquisition, partially offset by higher compensation expense and acquisition-related expenses.
[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 



Interest expense, net for the three and six months ended March 30, 2019 increased primarily due to an increase in interest expense on the revolving credit facility, which was partially offset by a reduction in interest expense related to lower balances on the tranche B term loan, as well as current year gains on interest rate swaps.
37

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 



Other income (expense), net remained flat for the three months ended March 30, 2019.
The increase in other income (expense), net for the six months ended March 30, 2019 was primarily driven by a relative decrease in losses on foreign currency transactions.
[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]



The effective tax rate for the three months ended March 30, 2019 was flat.
The effective tax rate for the six months ended March 30, 2019 increased primarily due to certain discrete benefits of $25,378 in the prior year for the estimated impact of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the Tax Act).
Excluding the impact of these discrete benefits, the effective tax rate for the six months ended March 30, 2019 and March 31, 2018 would have been 17.3% and 17.5%, respectively.
[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]



Net income and diluted earnings per share for the three months ended March 30, 2019 increased primarily due to higher income from operations.
Net income and diluted earnings per share for the six months ended March 30, 2019 decreased primarily due to an increase in the effective tax rate, partially offset by higher income from operations.

Cash Flow Comparison



The following table summarizes our cash flows from total operations:



[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]



Operating Activities



The decrease in cash provided by operating activities was primarily due to an increase in cash used by working capital associated with timing fluctuations from accounts receivable payments received and unbilled accounts receivable accruals, accounts payable payments, inventory purchases, and advanced payments received from customers, as well as a decrease in net income due to the remeasurement of our estimated deferred tax liabilities as a result of the Tax Act in fiscal year 2018.
This decrease was partially offset by a decrease in cash used by deferred income taxes, an increase in cash provided by other assets and liabilities related to accrued project costs, and a decrease in cash used by payroll-related accruals.
Investing Activities



The increase in cash used in investing activities was primarily due to the acquisition of E2M in the first quarter of fiscal year 2019. 



Financing Activities



The increase in cash provided by financing activities was primarily due to borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility used to fund the acquisition of E2M and a decrease in cash used for long-term debt payments.
Liquidity and Capital Resources



We had cash and cash equivalents of $74,122 as of March 30, 2019.
Of this amount, $10,597 was located in North America, $28,847 in Europe and $34,678 in Asia.
The North American cash balance was primarily invested in bank deposits.
The cash balances in Europe and Asia were primarily invested in money market funds and bank deposits.
In accordance with our investment policy, we place cash equivalent investments with issuers who have high-quality investment credit ratings.
Our investment objectives are to preserve principal, maintain liquidity and achieve the best available return consistent with our primary objectives of safety and liquidity.
As of March 30, 2019, we held no short-term investments.
We plan to continue to repatriate certain amounts of our existing offshore cash and future earnings back to the U.S. 



As of March 30, 2019, our capital structure was comprised of $31,632 in short-term debt, $443,206 in long-term debt and $485,054 in shareholders' equity.
Long-term debt included $80,391 on our Revolving Credit Facility used to finance the acquisition of E2M.
The Consolidated Balance Sheets also included $10,418 of unamortized debt issuance costs as of 



44

March 30, 2019.
Total interest-bearing debt as of March 30, 2019 was $474,838.
We have a credit agreement with a consortium of financial institutions (the Credit Agreement) that provides for senior secured credit facilities consisting of a Revolving Credit Facility and a Term Facility.
The maturity date of the Revolving Credit Facility is July 5, 2022 and the maturity date of the loans under the Term Facility is July 5, 2023, unless a term loan lender agrees to extend the maturity date pursuant to a loan modification agreement made in accordance with the terms of the Credit Agreement.
The Credit Agreement also requires mandatory prepayments on our Term Facility in certain circumstances, including the potential for an annual required prepayment of a certain percentage of our excess cash flow.
Under the Credit Agreement, we are subject to customary affirmative and negative covenants, including, among others, restrictions on our ability to incur debt, create liens, dispose of assets, make investments, loans, advances, guarantees and acquisitions, enter into transactions with affiliates and enter into any restrictive agreements and customary events of default (including payment defaults, covenant defaults, change of control defaults and bankruptcy defaults).
The Credit Agreement also contains financial covenants, including the ratio of consolidated total indebtedness to adjusted consolidated earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (Adjusted EBITDA), as defined in the Credit Agreement, as well as the ratio of Adjusted EBITDA to consolidated interest expense.
These covenants restrict our ability to pay dividends and purchase outstanding shares of common stock.
As of March 30, 2019, we were in compliance with these financial covenants.
See Note 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item I of Part I of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for additional information on our financing arrangements.
Shareholders' equity increased by $7,122 during the six months ended March 30, 2019 primarily due to $24,661 net income and $5,219 stock-based compensation.
The increase was partially offset by $10,740 dividends declared and $6,094 other comprehensive loss.
Also contributing to the decrease was a cumulative effect of accounting change reduction to our opening retained earnings balance of $6,227 related to the adoption of the new revenue recognition standard, ASU No.
2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606).
As of March 30, 2019, we believe our current capital resources will be sufficient to fund working capital requirements, capital expenditures and operations for the foreseeable future, including at least the next twelve months.
For further information, see "Summary of Significant Accounting Policies" under Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended September 29, 2018.
The following critical accounting policy has been updated since our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended September 29, 2018.
Revenue Recognition (Over Time)



Revenue is recognized either over time as work progresses or at a point-in-time, dependent upon contract-specific terms and the pattern of transfer of control of the product or service to the customer.
Contracts with equipment revenue recognized over time use costs incurred to date relative to total estimated costs at completion to measure progress toward satisfying the performance obligation.
Incurred cost represents work performed, which corresponds with, and thereby best depicts, the transfer of control to the customer.
Equipment contract costs include materials, component parts, labor and overhead costs.
For contracts recognized over time, we estimate the profit on a contract as the difference between the total estimated revenue and expected costs to complete a contract and recognize that profit over the life of the contract.
These assumptions include labor productivity and availability, the complexity of the work to be performed, the cost and availability of materials, and internal and subcontractor performance.
We recognize adjustments in estimated profit on contracts under the cumulative catch-up method.
Under this method, the impact of the adjustment on profit recorded to date is recognized in the period the adjustment is identified.
Revenue and profit in future periods of contract performance is recognized using the adjusted estimate.
If at any time the estimate of contract profitability indicates an anticipated loss on the contract, we recognize the total loss in the period it is identified.
Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements



Information regarding new accounting pronouncements is included in Note 2 and Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 1 of Part I of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.
Other Matters



Dividends



Our dividend policy is to maintain a payout ratio that allows dividends to increase in conjunction with the long-term growth of earnings per share, while sustaining dividends through economic cycles.
Our dividend practice is to target, over time, a payout ratio of approximately 25% of net earnings per share.
The declaration and payment of future dividends will depend on many factors, including, but not limited to, our earnings, financial condition, debt repayment obligations, business development needs and regulatory considerations and are at the discretion of our Board of Directors.
Forward-looking statements are qualified by some or all of these risk factors.
