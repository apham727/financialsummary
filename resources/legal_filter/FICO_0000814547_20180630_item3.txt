We have a $400 million unsecured revolving line of credit with a syndicate of banks that expires on May 8, 2023.
Proceeds from the credit facility can be used for working capital and general corporate purposes and may also be used for the refinancing of existing debt, acquisitions, and the repurchase of our common stock.
Interest on amounts borrowed under the credit facility is based on (i) a base rate, which is the greater of (a) the prime rate, (b) the Federal Funds rate plus 0.500% and (c) the one-month LIBOR rate plus 1.000%, plus, in each case, an applicable margin, or (ii) an adjusted LIBOR rate plus an applicable margin.
The applicable margin for base rate borrowings ranges from 0% to 0.875% and for LIBOR borrowings ranges from 1.000% to 1.875%, and is determined based on our consolidated leverage ratio.
A change in interest rates on this variable rate debt impacts the interest incurred and cash flows, but does not impact the fair value of the instrument.
We had $252.0 million in borrowings outstanding at a weighted average interest rate of 3.201% under the credit facility as of June 30, 2018.
Foreign Currency Forward Contracts



We maintain a program to manage our foreign exchange rate risk on existing foreign-currency-denominated receivable and cash balances by entering into forward contracts to sell or buy foreign currencies.
At period end, foreign-currency-denominated receivable and cash balances held by our various reporting entities are remeasured into their respective functional currencies at current market rates.
All of our foreign currency forward contracts have maturity periods of less than three months.
Such derivative financial instruments are subject to market risk.
