Key factors affecting our financial performance
â€¢Changes in spending policies, budget priorities and funding levels are a key factor influencing the purchasing levels of government, healthcare and education customers. 
We monitor a number of financial and non-financial measures and ratios on a regular basis in order to track the progress of our business and make adjustments as necessary. We believe that the most important of these measures and ratios include average daily sales, gross margin, operating margin, Net income, Non-GAAP income before income taxes, Non-GAAP net income, Net income per common share, Non-GAAP net income per diluted share, EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA margin, free cash flow, return on working capital, Cash and cash equivalents, net working capital, cash conversion cycle (defined to be days of sales outstanding in Accounts receivable plus days of supply in Inventory minus days of purchases outstanding in Accounts payable, based on a rolling three-month average), debt levels including available credit and leverage ratios, sales per coworker and coworker turnover. These measures and ratios are compared to standards or objectives set by management, so that actions can be taken, as necessary, in order to achieve the standards and objectives.
In this Form 10-Q, we discuss Non-GAAP income before income taxes, Non-GAAP net income, Non-GAAP net income per diluted share, EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin, which are non-GAAP financial measures.
Three Months Ended June 30, 2018 Compared to Three Months Ended June 30, 2017 
Net sales
Total Net sales for the three months ended June 30, 2018 increased $294 million, or 7.6%, to $4,186 million, compared to $3,892 million for the three months ended June 30, 2017. Excluding the impact of foreign currency fluctuations, constant currency Net sales growth was 7.0%. See "Non-GAAP Financial Measure Reconciliations" below for additional information regarding constant currency Net sales growth.
Corporate segment Net sales for the three months ended June 30, 2018 increased $154 million, or 9.7%, compared to the three months ended June 30, 2017. Growth was primarily driven by client device refresh, as well as ongoing success helping customers with solutions, including data center and software.
Small Business segment Net sales for the three months ended June 30, 2018 increased by $15 million, or 4.6%, between periods. Sales growth was primarily driven by client device refresh.
Gross profit
Gross profit increased $55 million, or 8.6%, to $696 million for the three months ended June 30, 2018, compared to $641 million for the three months ended June 30, 2017. As a percentage of Net sales, Gross profit margin increased 10 basis points to 16.6% for the three months ended June 30, 2018. Gross profit margin improvement primarily reflected the positive impact on product margin due to customer mix.
Selling and administrative expenses
Selling and administrative expenses increased $17 million, or 4.9%, to $381 million for the three months ended June 30, 2018, compared to $364 million for the three months ended June 30, 2017. This was driven by higher sales payroll costs, including sales commissions primarily due to higher Gross profit dollars, partially offset by lower equity-based compensation expense and the associated payroll taxes due to the vesting in the prior year of an equity grant made at the time of our initial public offering. Total coworker count was 8,917, up 130 from 8,787 at June 30, 2017. Total coworker count was 8,726 at December 31, 2017.
As a percentage of total Net sales, Selling and administrative expenses decreased 20 basis points to 9.1% during the three months ended June 30, 2018, down from 9.3% in the three months ended June 30, 2017.

Total operating margin percentage increased 40 basis points to 6.3% for the three months ended June 30, 2018, from 5.9% for the three months ended June 30, 2017. Operating margin was positively impacted by the increase in Gross profit margin, driven by improved product margin. Also contributing to the increased operating margin percentage were lower equity-based compensation expenses and the associated payroll taxes, the non-recurrence of integration expenses in the current year and intangible asset amortization expenses as a percentage of Net sales, which do not trend in line with sales movement. 
Small Business segment income from operations was $25 million for the three months ended June 30, 2018, an increase of $6 million, or 26.8%, compared to $19 million for the three months ended June 30, 2017.

Small Business segment operating margin percentage increased 130 basis points to 7.5% for the three months ended June 30, 2018, from 6.2% for the three months ended June 30, 2017. This increase in operating margin percentage was primarily driven by higher product margin and the benefit of lower sales payroll expenses as a percentage of Net sales.
Public segment income from operations was $113 million for the three months ended June 30, 2018, an increase of $8 million, or 8.0%, compared to $105 million for the three months ended June 30, 2017.

We have included reconciliations of Non-GAAP income before income taxes, Non-GAAP net income, EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA margin and consolidated Net sales growth on a constant currency basis for the three months ended June 30, 2018 and 2017 below. 
Non-GAAP income before income taxes and Non-GAAP net income exclude, among other things, charges related to the amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets, equity-based compensation and associated taxes, gains and losses from the extinguishment of debt and integration expenses. EBITDA is defined as consolidated net income before interest expense, net, income tax expense, depreciation and amortization. Adjusted EBITDA, which is a measure defined in our credit agreements, means EBITDA adjusted for certain items which are described in the table below. Adjusted EBITDA margin is defined as Adjusted EBITDA as a percentage of Net sales. Consolidated Net sales growth on a constant currency basis is defined as consolidated Net sales growth excluding the impact of foreign currency translation on net sales compared to the prior period.
Non-GAAP income before income taxes, Non-GAAP net income, EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA margin and consolidated Net sales growth on a constant currency basis are considered non-GAAP financial measures. Generally, a non-GAAP financial measure is a numerical measure of a company's performance or financial position that either excludes or includes amounts that are not normally included or excluded in the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP. Non-GAAP measures used by management may differ from similar measures used by other companies, even when similar terms are used to identify such measures.

Dividends
Operating Activities  
The cash conversion cycle increased to 17 days at June 30, 2018 compared to 16 days at June 30, 2017 as DSO, DIO and DPO each increased 1 day compared to June 30, 2017.

These sales have an unfavorable impact

The decrease was primarily driven by fewer share repurchases during the six months ended June 30, 2018, which resulted in a $183 million decrease in cash used in financing activities.
