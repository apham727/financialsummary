Trends and Key Factors Affecting our Financial Performance
â€¢Changes in spending policies, budget priorities and funding levels are a key factor influencing the purchasing levels of government, healthcare and education customers.
We monitor a number of financial and non-financial measures and ratios on a regular basis in order to track the progress of our business and make adjustments as necessary. Effective January 1, 2019, we made a change to the Non-GAAP financial measures that we use to provide meaningful methods of evaluating our financial performance and have replaced EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin with Non-GAAP operating income and Non-GAAP operating income margin. We made this change due to the continuing evolution of the IT consumption model. We believe Non-GAAP operating income will be more reflective of the costs of providing services to our customers and our own costs as the consumption model continues to evolve. Non-GAAP operating income is also being used for the first time in 2019 as a key business metric for our annual incentive compensation programs.
In addition to Non-GAAP operating income and Non-GAAP operating income margin, we believe that the most important financial and non-financial measures and ratios include average daily sales, gross margin, operating margin, Net income, Non-GAAP income before income taxes, Non-GAAP net income, Net income per common share, Non-GAAP net income per diluted share, free cash flow, return on working capital, Cash and cash equivalents, net working capital, cash conversion cycle (defined to be days of sales outstanding in Accounts receivable plus days of supply in Inventory minus days of purchases outstanding in Accounts payable, based on a rolling three-month average), debt levels including available credit, sales per coworker and coworker turnover. These measures and ratios are compared to standards or objectives set by management, so that actions can be taken, as necessary, in order to achieve the standards and objectives.
Three Months Ended March 31, 2019 Compared to Three Months Ended March 31, 2018
Net sales
Total Net sales for the three months ended March 31, 2019 increased $352 million, or 9.7%, to $3,958 million, compared to $3,606 million for the three months ended March 31, 2018. Excluding the impact of foreign currency fluctuations, constant currency Net sales growth was 10.6%. There was one fewer selling day in the three months ended March 31, 2019 compared to the same period of 2018, and Net sales on an average daily sales basis increased 11.5%. See "Non-GAAP Financial Measure Reconciliations" below for additional detail regarding constant currency Net sales growth.
For the three months ended March 31, 2019, Net sales growth reflected growth across most major product categories, particularly client devices, software, servers and enterprise storage. Additionally, strong results from our international operations, including two months of Net sales from Scalar Decisions Inc. ("Scalar"), which was acquired on February 1, 2019, contributed to our Net sales growth.
Corporate segment Net sales for the three months ended March 31, 2019 increased $170 million, or 10.9%, compared to the three months ended March 31, 2018. On an average daily sales basis, Corporate segment Net sales increased 12.6%. Growth was primarily driven by client devices, software, networking and servers.
Small Business segment Net sales for the three months ended March 31, 2019 increased by $28 million, or 8.5%, compared to the three months ended March 31, 2018. On an average daily sales basis, Small Business segment Net sales increased 10.3%. Growth was primarily driven by client devices.

On an average daily sales basis, Public segment Net sales increased 9.9%. The increase was primarily driven by growth in Government and Healthcare. On an average daily sales basis, Net sales to Government and Healthcare customers increased 18.6% and 8.4%, respectively, both primarily driven by customers modernizing their infrastructure, including servers and enterprise storage. Net sales in Education increased 2.4% on an average daily sales basis, primarily driven by client device growth.
Gross profit increased $68 million, or 11.3%, to $672 million for the three months ended March 31, 2019, compared to $604 million for the three months ended March 31, 2018. As a percentage of Net sales, Gross profit margin increased 30 basis points to 17.0% for the three months ended March 31, 2019. Gross profit margin was positively impacted by product margin improvement. 
Selling and administrative expenses
Selling and administrative expenses increased $41 million, or 11.4%, to $404 million for the three months ended March 31, 2019, compared to $363 million for the three months ended March 31, 2018. The increase was driven by higher payroll expenses due to increased coworkers and higher sales payroll expenses, including sales commissions, which are primarily driven by higher gross profit, two months of Scalar expenses and increased stock compensation expense. Total coworker count was 9,434, including an incremental 342 coworkers from Scalar, up 684 from 8,750 at March 31, 2018. Total coworker count was 9,019 at December 31, 2018.
As a percentage of total Net sales, Selling and administrative expenses increased 10 basis points to 10.2% for the three months ended March 31, 2019.
Operating income
During the first quarter of 2019, we evaluated our methodology for allocating certain depreciation and amortization expenses to each of our segments. The evaluation resulted in a revision to the allocation of depreciation and amortization expenses from Headquarters to our reportable segments, effective January 1, 2019. The prior period results have been recast to reflect these changes and present comparable information.
Operating income was $229 million for the three months ended March 31, 2019, an increase of $25 million, or 12.2%, compared to $204 million for the three months ended March 31, 2018. Operating income increased primarily due to higher gross profit dollars, partially offset by higher payroll expenses and higher stock compensation expense. Total operating margin percentage increased 10 basis points to 5.8% for the three months ended March 31, 2019, from 5.7% for the three months ended March 31, 2018.
Corporate segment Operating income was $135 million for the three months ended March 31, 2019, an increase of $12 million, or 9.5%, compared to $123 million for the three months ended March 31, 2018. Corporate segment Operating income increased primarily due to higher gross profit dollars, partially offset by higher payroll expenses and higher stock compensation expense. 
Corporate segment operating margin percentage decreased 10 basis points to 7.8% for the three months ended March 31, 2019, from 7.9% for the three months ended March 31, 2018.
Small Business segment Operating income was $24 million for the three months ended March 31, 2019, an increase of $2 million, or 11.2%, compared to $22 million for the three months ended March 31, 2018. Small Business segment Operating income increased primarily due to higher gross profit dollars partially offset by higher payroll expenses. Small Business segment operating margin percentage increased 20 basis points to 6.9% for the three months ended March 31, 2019, from 6.7% for the three months ended March 31, 2018. This increase in operating margin percentage was primarily driven by higher product margin.
Public segment Operating income was $76 million for the three months ended March 31, 2019, an increase of $6 million, or 8.3%, compared to $70 million for the three months ended March 31, 2018. Public segment Operating income increased primarily due to higher gross profit dollars, partially offset by higher sales payroll expenses. Public segment operating margin percentage remained flat at 5.7% for the three months ended March 31, 2019 and 2018.
Other Operating income was $26 million for the three months ended March 31, 2019, an increase of $6 million, or 29.6%, compared to $20 million for the three months ended March 31, 2018. Other Operating income increased primarily due to higher gross profit dollars, partially offset by higher payroll expenses. Other operating margin percentage increased 70 basis points to 4.8% for the three months ended March 31, 2019, from 4.1% for the three months ended March 31, 2018. This increase was primarily driven by higher product margin and lower intangible asset amortization as a percentage of Net sales partially offset by higher payroll expenses consistent with increased coworker count.
The lower effective tax rate for the three months ended March 31, 2019 as compared to the same period of the prior year was primarily attributable to higher excess tax benefits on equity-based compensation and a discrete tax benefit of $3 million related to CDW Canada's acquisition of Scalar.
We have included reconciliations of Non-GAAP operating income, Non-GAAP income before income taxes, Non-GAAP net income and Net sales growth on a constant currency basis for the three months ended March 31, 2019 and 2018 below.
Non-GAAP operating income excludes, among other things, charges related to the amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets, equity-based compensation and the associated payroll taxes, and acquisition and integration expenses. Non-GAAP operating income margin is defined as Non-GAAP operating income as a percentage of Net sales. Non-GAAP income before income taxes, and Non-GAAP net income exclude, among other things, charges related to acquisition-related intangible asset amortization, equity-based compensation, acquisition and integration expenses, and the associated tax effects of each. Net sales growth on a constant currency basis is defined as Net sales growth excluding the impact of foreign currency translation on net sales compared to the prior period.
Non-GAAP operating income, Non-GAAP operating income margin, Non-GAAP income before income taxes, Non-GAAP net income and Net sales growth on a constant currency basis are considered non-GAAP financial measures. Generally, a non-GAAP financial measure is a numerical measure of a company's performance or financial position that either excludes or includes amounts that are not normally included or excluded in the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP. Non-GAAP measures used by management may differ from similar measures used by other companies, even when similar terms are used to identify such measures.

Seasonality
Overview
As of March 31, 2019, we had total indebtedness of $3.3 billion, of which $1.6 billion was secured indebtedness. At March 31, 2019, we were in compliance with the covenants under our various credit agreements and indentures. For additional details, see Note 7 (Long-Term Debt) to the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements.
Inventory Financing Agreements
We have entered into agreements with certain financial intermediaries to facilitate the purchase of inventory from various suppliers under certain terms and conditions. These amounts are classified separately as Accounts payable-inventory financing on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. We do not incur any interest expense associated with these agreements as balances are paid when they are due. For additional details, see Note 4 (Inventory Financing Agreements) to the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements.
During the three months ended March 31, 2019, we repurchased 1.9 million shares of our common stock for $177 million under the previously announced share repurchase program. For more information on our share repurchase program, see Part II, Item 2, Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds.
Dividends
On May 1, 2019, we announced that our Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.295 per common share. The dividend will be paid on June 11, 2019 to all stockholders of record as of the close of business on May 24, 2019.
Operating Activities
Investing Activities
Net cash used in investing activities increased by $72 million in the three months ended March 31, 2019 compared to the same period of the prior year. The increase was primarily due to the completion of our acquisition of Scalar on February 1, 2019. Additionally, Capital expenditures were $19 million and $16 million for the three months ended March 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. The increase in capital expenditures is primarily due to the timing of investments for improvements to our information technology systems.
Financing Activities
Net cash used in financing activities decreased by $51 million in the three months ended March 31, 2019 compared to the same period of the prior year. The decrease was primarily driven by borrowings under our revolving credit facilities and further leveraging our inventory financing arrangements, which were partially offset by our share repurchases during the three months ended March 31, 2019. For additional details regarding our debt activities, see Note 7 (Long-Term Debt) to the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements.
There have been no material changes to our contractual obligations from those reported in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018.
