Effective January 1, 2018, we adopted the requirements of ASU 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, as amended ("Topic 606"), utilizing the full retrospective method as discussed in Note 2 (Recent Accounting Pronouncements) to the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements. Prior period amounts have been adjusted accordingly.
Trends and key factors affecting our financial performance
•Changes in spending policies, budget priorities and funding levels are a key factor influencing government, healthcare and education purchasing levels. 
•Customer focus on security has been, and we expect will continue to be, an ongoing trend. Customers are seeking solutions to protect their internal systems against threats and are implementing solutions that provide enterprise-wide visibility, detection expertise and investigation workflows. They are also implementing endpoint security, firewall segmentation and user authentication tools. 
We monitor a number of financial and non-financial measures and ratios on a regular basis in order to track the progress of our business and make adjustments as necessary. We believe that the most important of these measures and ratios include average daily sales, gross margin, operating margin, Net income, Non-GAAP income before income taxes, Non-GAAP net income, Net income per common share, Non-GAAP net income per diluted share, EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA margin, free cash flow, return on working capital, Cash and cash equivalents, net working capital, cash conversion cycle (defined to be days of sales outstanding in Accounts receivable plus days of supply in Inventory minus days of purchases outstanding in Accounts payable, based on a rolling three-month average), debt levels including available credit and leverage ratios, sales per coworker and coworker turnover. These measures and ratios are compared to standards or objectives set by management, so that actions can be taken, as necessary, in order to achieve the standards and objectives.
In this Form 10-Q, we discuss Non-GAAP income before income taxes, Non-GAAP net income, Non-GAAP net income per diluted share, EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin, which are non-GAAP financial measures.
Three Months Ended March 31, 2018 Compared to Three Months Ended March 31, 2017 
Net sales
Total Net sales for the three months ended March 31, 2018 increased $350 million, or 10.8%, to $3,606 million, compared to $3,256 million for the three months ended March 31, 2017. Excluding the impact of foreign currency fluctuations, constant currency Net sales growth was 9.6%. See “Non-GAAP Financial Measure Reconciliations” below for additional information regarding constant currency Net Sales growth.
For the three months ended March 31, 2018, ongoing focus on client refresh drove growth within transactional products and we saw an increase in solution-based sales, led by software. Increases in software reflected the continuing trend of greater integration of software into solutions, as well as continued customer focus on security. Services increases were driven by warranties and field services. Sales of solutions-based hardware reflected both underlying demand as well as the impact of the reversal associated with supply chain issues experienced at the end of 2017.
Corporate segment Net sales for the three months ended March 31, 2018 increased $125 million, or 8.7%, compared to the three months ended March 31, 2017. Growth was primarily driven by client devices, as well as solutions categories, including software and netcomm products.
Public segment Net sales for the three months ended March 31, 2018 increased $76 million, or 6.6%, compared to the three months ended March 31, 2017. The growth was primarily driven by Government and Healthcare customers. Net sales to Government customers increased $44 million. Sales to State and Local government customers were driven by a continued focus on public safety and the success executing against recently added contracts. Federal sales benefited from the sale of client devices to the Department of Defense to meet a cybersecurity mandate deadline of January 31, 2018. Education Net sales increased 1.0%. Ongoing success addressing networking and client device needs in Higher Ed was partially offset by K-12 performance as success addressing collaborative learning implementations was offset by reduced focus on client devices as customers focus on extending lives and maintaining existing equipment. Net sales in Healthcare increased 7.3%, primarily driven by performance in desktops, video and software. 
Gross profit
Selling and administrative expenses
Selling and administrative expenses increased $16 million, or 4.4%, to $363 million for the three months ended March 31, 2018, compared to $347 million for the three months ended March 31, 2017. This was driven by higher sales payroll costs, including sales commissions primarily due to higher Gross profit dollars. Total coworker count was 8,750, up 138 from 8,612 at March 31, 2017. Total coworker count was 8,726 at December 31, 2017. This was partially offset by lower equity-based compensation expense and the associated payroll taxes. 
As a percentage of total Net sales, Selling and administrative expenses decreased 60 basis points to 10.1% during the three months ended March 31, 2018, down from 10.7% in the three months ended March 31, 2017.
Income from operations
Income from operations was $204 million for the three months ended March 31, 2018, an increase of $33 million, or 19.6%, compared to $171 million for the three months ended March 31, 2017. Income from operations increased primarily due to higher gross profit dollars, partially offset by higher sales payroll expenses. Total operating margin percentage increased 50 basis points to 5.7% for the three months ended March 31, 2018, from 5.2% for the three months ended March 31, 2017. The 
Corporate segment income from operations was $125 million for the three months ended March 31, 2018, an increase of $13 million, or 11.3%, compared to $112 million for the three months ended March 31, 2017. Corporate segment income from operations increased primarily due to higher gross profit dollars, partially offset by higher sales payroll expenses. Corporate segment operating margin percentage increased 20 basis points to 8.0% for the three months ended March 31, 2018, from 7.8% for the three months ended March 31, 2017. This increase in operating margin percentage was primarily driven by the benefit of lower Selling and administrative expenses as a percentage of Net sales. This was partially offset by product margin compression due to increased hardware sales.
Small Business segment income from operations was $22 million for the three months ended March 31, 2018, an increase of $5 million, or 33.9%, compared to $17 million for the three months ended March 31, 2017. Small business segment income from operations increased primarily due to higher gross profit dollars as a result of sales volume. Small Business segment operating margin percentage increased 110 basis points to 6.8% for the three months ended March 31, 2018, from 5.7% for the three months ended March 31, 2017. This increase in operating margin percentage was primarily driven by the benefit of lower sales payroll expenses and intangible asset amortization as a percentage of Net sales.
Public segment income from operations was $72 million for the three months ended March 31, 2018, an increase of $11 million, or 18.1%, compared to $61 million for the three months ended March 31, 2017. Public segment income from operations increased primarily due to higher Gross profit dollars as a result of sales volume. Public segment operating margin percentage increased 50 basis points to 5.8% for the three months ended March 31, 2018, from 5.3% for the three months ended March 31, 2017. This increase in operating margin percentage was primarily driven by the benefit of lower sales payroll expenses as a percentage of Net sales and a higher mix of net service contract revenue.
Other income from operations was $20 million for the three months ended March 31, 2018, an increase of $7 million, or 56.1%, compared to $13 million for the three months ended March 31, 2017. Other income from operations increased primarily due to higher sales volumes and Gross profit as we continue to take share in the local markets, and favorable foreign exchange. Other operating margin percentage increased 70 basis points to 4.1% for the three months ended March 31, 2018, from 3.4% for the three months ended March 31, 2017. This increase was primarily driven by the benefit of lower sales payroll expenses and lower intangible asset amortization as a percentage of Net sales. 
Net loss on extinguishments of long-term debt 
During the three months ended March 31, 2018, there were no extinguishments of long-term debt compared to the same period in 2017 when we incurred a net loss on extinguishment of long-term debt of $57 million. For information regarding our debt, see Note 6 (Long-Term Debt) to the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements.
the same period of the prior year was 21.9% and differed from the US federal statutory rate of 35.0% primarily due to excess tax benefits on equity-based compensation. The higher effective tax rate for the three months ended March 31, 2018 as compared to the same period of the prior year was primarily attributable to lower excess tax benefits on equity-based compensation and a higher effective net state income tax rate, primarily due to the reduced US federal benefit partially offset by the reduction in the US federal statutory rate. 
We have included reconciliations of Non-GAAP income before income taxes, Non-GAAP net income, EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA margin and consolidated Net sales growth on a constant currency basis for the three months ended March 31, 2018 and 2017 below. 
Non-GAAP income before income taxes and Non-GAAP net income exclude, among other things, charges related to the amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets, equity-based compensation and associated taxes, gains and losses from the extinguishment of debt and integration expenses. EBITDA is defined as consolidated net income before interest expense, net, income tax expense, depreciation and amortization. Adjusted EBITDA, which is a measure defined in our credit agreements, means EBITDA adjusted for certain items which are described in the table below. Adjusted EBITDA margin is defined as Adjusted EBITDA as a percentage of Net sales. Consolidated Net sales growth on a constant currency basis is defined as consolidated Net sales growth excluding the impact of foreign currency translation on net sales compared to the prior period.
Non-GAAP income before income taxes, Non-GAAP net income, EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA margin and consolidated Net sales growth on a constant currency basis are considered non-GAAP financial measures. Generally, a non-GAAP financial measure is a numerical measure of a company's performance or financial position that either excludes or includes amounts that are not normally included or excluded in the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP. Non-GAAP measures used by management may differ from similar measures used by other companies, even when similar terms are used to identify such measures.
Non-GAAP net income
Non-GAAP net income was $163 million for the three months ended March 31, 2018, an increase of $41 million, or 33.6%, compared to $122 million for the three months ended March 31, 2017.
of global intangible low tax income (“GILTI”) on equity-based compensation and amortization of intangibles.
Adjusted EBITDA was $280 million for the three months ended March 31, 2018, an increase of $30 million, or 11.9%, compared to $250 million for the three months ended March 31, 2017. As a percentage of Net sales, Adjusted EBITDA was 7.8% for the three months ended March 31, 2018 and 7.7% for the three months ended March 31, 2017.
Consolidated net sales growth on constant currency basis
Consolidated Net sales increased $350 million, or 10.8%, to $3,606 million for the three months ended March 31, 2018, compared to $3,256 million for the three months ended March 31, 2017. Consolidated Net sales on a constant currency basis, which excludes the impact of foreign currency translation, increased $315 million, or 9.6%.
Seasonality
Overview
During the three months ended March 31, 2018, we repurchased 2 million shares of our common stock for $109 million under the previously announced share repurchase program. For more information on our share repurchase program, see Part II, Item 2, Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds.
Dividends
On May 2, 2018, we announced that our Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.21 per common share. The dividend will be paid on June 11, 2018 to all stockholders of record as of the close of business on May 25, 2018. 
Operating Activities  
The cash conversion cycle decreased to 17 days at March 31, 2018 compared to 19 days at March 31, 2017 as DSO and DPO each increased 3 days compared to March 31, 2017 and DIO decreased 2 days. The increase in DSO was primarily driven by higher Net sales and related Accounts receivable for third-party services such as software as a service, software assurance and warranties. These services have an unfavorable impact on DSO as the receivable is recognized on the Consolidated Balance Sheet on a gross basis while the corresponding sales amount in the Consolidated Statement of Operations is recorded on a net basis. This also results in a favorable impact on DPO as the payable is recognized on the Consolidated Balance Sheet without a corresponding Cost of sales in the Statement of Operations because the cost paid to the vendor or third-party service provider is recorded as a reduction to Net sales. Additionally, average inventory balances decreased slightly, which coupled with higher Cost of sales, led to a favorable impact on DIO.
Investing Activities
Net cash used in investing activities decreased by $4 million in the three months ended March 31, 2018 compared to the same period of the prior year. Capital expenditures were $16 million and $20 million for the three months ended March 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. The decrease in capital expenditures is primarily due to the timing of investments for improvements to our information technology systems. 
Financing Activities
Net cash used in financing activities decreased by $231 million in the three months ended March 31, 2018 compared to the same period of the prior year. The decrease was primarily driven by changes in Accounts payable-inventory financing, which resulted in a decrease in cash used in financing activities of $161 million, and by share repurchases during the three months ended March 31, 2018, which resulted in a decrease in cash used in financing activities of $66 million. For more information on our share repurchase program, see Part II, Item 2, Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds. The decrease in cash used in Accounts payable-inventory financing was primarily driven by the termination of one of our inventory financing agreements in the fourth quarter of 2016, with amounts owed subsequently reported as Accounts payable - trade on the Consolidated Balance Sheet beginning in 2017.
As of March 31, 2018, we had total indebtedness of $3.2 billion, of which $1.5 billion was secured indebtedness. At March 31, 2018, we were in compliance with the covenants under our various credit agreements and indentures. The amount of CDW’s restricted payment capacity under the Senior Secured Term Loan Facility was $1.2 billion at March 31, 2018. The amount of restricted payment capacity for the CDW UK Term Loan was $139 million at March 31, 2018. 
For additional details regarding our debt and refinancing activities, refer to Note 6 (Long-Term Debt) to the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements.
Inventory Financing Agreements
We have entered into agreements with certain financial intermediaries to facilitate the purchase of inventory from various suppliers under certain terms and conditions. These amounts are classified separately as Accounts payable-inventory financing on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. We do not incur any interest expense associated with these agreements as balances are paid when they are due. For further details, see Note 3 (Inventory Financing Agreements) to the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements.
