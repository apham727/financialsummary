Item 3.
In February 2018, we entered into interest rate swap agreements to hedge the cash flows of $250 million of our variable rate senior secured term loans (see "Note 13â€“Derivative Instruments").
The objective of these instruments is to reduce variability in the forecasted interest payments of our variable rate senior secured term loans.
