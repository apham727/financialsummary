Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements



In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No.
2016-02, “Leases (Topic 842)”, which sets out the principles for the recognition, measurement, presentation and disclosure of leases for both parties to a contract (i.e.
lessees and lessors).
This update requires lessees to apply a dual approach, classifying leases as either finance or operating leases based on the principle of whether or not the lease is effectively a financed purchase of the leased asset by the lessee.
This classification will determine whether the lease expense is recognized based on an effective interest method or on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease.
A lessee is also required to record a right-of-use asset and a lease liability for all leases with a term of greater than 12 months regardless of their classification.
The new standard requires lessors to account for leases using an approach that is substantially equivalent to existing guidance for sales-type leases, direct financing leases and operating leases.
Effective April 1, 2019, the Company adopted the new standard under the modified retrospective approach, which resulted in no adjustment to the April 1, 2019 beginning Retained Earnings.
There are optional practical expedients and policy elections made available to simplify the transition to the new standard.
The Company has elected the following: 



•to adopt the optional transition method defined within ASU 2018-11 and not restate comparative prior periods but instead recognize a cumulative effect adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings in the period of adoption;



•the package of three practical expedients addressing whether a contract contains a lease, lease classification and initial direct costs;



•to combine lease and non-lease components as a single component for all asset classes;



•to use a portfolio approach to determine the incremental borrowing rate; and 



•to apply the short-term lease exception to leases that, at the commencement date, has a lease term of 12 months or less and does not include an option to purchase the underlying asset that the lessee is reasonably certain to exercise.
Upon adoption, the Company recorded Right-of-use (“ROU”) assets and lease liabilities of approximately $84,878 and $87,248, respectively.
In addition, capital lease assets and liabilities are now classified as finance lease right-of-use assets and liabilities.
The difference between the operating lease assets and lease liabilities primarily relates to unamortized lease incentives and deferred rent recorded in accordance with the previous lease guidance.
The discount rates used to calculate the ROU assets and lease liabilities as of the effective date were based on the remaining lease terms as of the effective date.
See Note 3, Leases for additional information.
In August 2017, the FASB issued ASU No.
The guidance eliminates the requirement to separately measure and report hedge ineffectiveness and generally requires the entire change in the fair value of a hedging instrument to be presented in the same income statement line as the hedged item.
7

In February 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-02, "Income Statement - Reporting Comprehensive Income (Topic 220)".
Accounting Pronouncements Issued But Not Adopted as of June 30, 2019



In June 2016, the FASB, issued ASU No.
2016-13, “Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326)”: Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments, which changes the recognition model for the impairment of financial instruments, including accounts receivable, loans and held-to-maturity debt securities, among others.
The guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019, including interim periods within those fiscal years.
In contrast to current guidance, which considers current information and events and utilizes a probable threshold, (an “incurred loss” model), ASU 2016–13 mandates an “expected loss” model.
2.
Revenue Recognition



The Company adopted ASU No.
2014-09, “Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606)” on April 1, 2018 using the modified retrospective transition method.
There was no cumulative effect of adopting the standard at the date of initial application in retained earnings.
The Company's revenues by reportable segments are presented in Note 17.
Service revenues related to the work performed for the Company’s customers by its maintenance technicians generally represent a separate and distinct performance obligation.
Control for these services passes to the customer as the services are performed.
Service revenues for the first quarter of fiscal 2020 and fiscal 2019 amounted to $60,718 and $35,482, respectively.
A small portion of the Company's customer arrangements oblige the Company to create customized products for its customers that require the bundling of both products and services into a single performance obligation because the individual products and services that are required to fulfill the customer requirements do not meet the definition for a distinct performance obligation.
These customized products generally have no alternative use to the Company and the terms and conditions of these arrangements give the Company the enforceable right to payment for performance completed to date, including a reasonable profit margin.
For these arrangements, control transfers over time and the Company measures progress towards completion by selecting the input or output method that best depicts the transfer of control of the underlying goods and services to the customer for each respective arrangement.
Methods used by the Company to measure progress toward completion include labor hours, costs incurred and units of production.
As of June 30, 2019, the current and non-current portion of contract liabilities were $14,289 and $6,821, respectively.
As of March 31, 2019, the current and non-current portion of contract liabilities were $15,162 and $6,360, respectively.
Revenues recognized during the first quarter of fiscal 2020 and fiscal 2019, that were included in the contract liability at the beginning of the quarter, amounted to $4,467 and $1,936, respectively.
Amounts representing work completed and not billed to customers represent contract assets and were $42,520 and $38,778 as of June 30, 2019 and March 31, 2019, respectively.
At June 30, 2019, the right of return asset related to the value of inventory anticipated to be returned from customers was $2,667 and refund liability representing amounts estimated to be refunded to customers was $5,183.

3.
Leases



The Company leases manufacturing facilities, distribution centers, office space, vehicles and other equipment under non-cancellable leases with initial terms typically ranging from 1 to 17 years.
At contract inception, the Company reviews the terms of the arrangement to determine if the contract is or contains a lease.
Guidance in Topic 842 is used to evaluate whether the contract has an identified asset; if the Company has the right to obtain substantially all economic benefits from the asset; and if it has the right to direct the use of the underlying asset.
When determining if the Company has the right to obtain substantially all economic benefits from the asset, the Company considers the primary outputs of the identified asset throughout the period of use and determines if it receives greater than 90% of those benefits.
When determining if it has the right to direct the use of an underlying asset, the Company considers if it has the right to direct how and for what purpose the asset is used throughout the period of use and if it controls the decision-making rights over the asset.
Lease terms may include options to extend or terminate the lease.
The Company exercises its judgment to determine the term of those leases when extension or termination options are present and include such options in the calculation of the lease term when it is reasonably certain that the Company will exercise those options.
The Company has elected to include both lease and non-lease components in the determination of lease payments for all asset classes.
Payments made to a lessor for items such as taxes, insurance, common area maintenance, or other costs commonly referred to as executory costs, are also included in lease payments if they are fixed.
The fixed portion of these payments are included in the calculation of the lease liability, while any variable portion would be recognized as variable lease expenses, when incurred.
Variable payments made to third parties for these, or similar costs, such as utilities, are not included in the calculation of lease payments.
Both finance and operating leases are reflected as liabilities on the commencement date of the lease based on the present value of the lease payments to be made over the lease term.
As most of the leases do not provide an implicit rate, the Company has exercised judgment in electing the incremental borrowing rate based on the information available when the lease commences to determine the present value of future payments.
Right-of-use assets are valued at the initial measurement of the lease liability, plus any initial direct costs or rent prepayments and reduced by any lease incentives and any deferred lease payments.
Operating lease expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
Finance lease expense includes depreciation, which is recognized on a straight-line basis over the expected life of the leased asset, and interest expense, which is recognized following an effective interest rate method.
The following table presents lease assets and liabilities and their balance sheet classification:

Acquisition



On December 7, 2018, the Company completed the acquisition of all of the issued and outstanding common stock of Alpha Technologies Services, Inc. (“ATS”) and Alpha Technologies Ltd. (“ATL”), resulting in ATS and ATL becoming wholly-owned subsidiaries of the Company (the “share purchase”).
Additionally, the Company acquired substantially all of the assets of Alpha Technologies Inc. and certain assets of Altair Advanced Industries, Inc. and other affiliates of ATS and ATL (all such sellers, together with ATS and ATL, “Alpha”), in each case in accordance with the terms and conditions of certain restructuring agreements (collectively, the “asset acquisition” and together with the share purchase, the “acquisition”).
Based in Bellingham, Washington, Alpha is a global industry leader in comprehensive commercial-grade energy solutions for broadband, telecom, renewable, industrial and traffic customers around the world.
The initial purchase consideration for the acquisition was $750,000, of which $650,000 was paid in cash and the balance was settled by issuing 1,177,630 shares of EnerSys common stock.
The 1,177,630 shares had a closing date fair value of $93,268, based upon the December 7, 2018, closing date spot rate of $79.20.
The total purchase consideration, consisting of cash paid of $650,000, shares valued at $93,268 and an adjustment for working capital (due from seller of $766) was $742,502.
The Company funded the cash portion of the acquisition with borrowings from the Amended Credit Facility as defined in Note 12.
See Note 12 for additional information.
The acquisition expands the Company's footprint in broadband and telecom markets.
The goodwill recognized in connection with this transaction reflects the benefits the Company expects to realize from being able to provide a one-stop, fully integrated power solutions offering to its customers, as well as the benefit of cost synergies from alignment of the Alpha group within its own organizational structure.
The results of operations of Alpha have been included in the Company’s Americas segment.
The following table represents the fair values assigned to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed and resulting goodwill.
The amounts recognized will be finalized as the information necessary to complete the analysis is obtained, but no later than one year from the acquisition date (“the measurement period”).
The acquired assets and assumed liabilities include the following:



[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

The following table summarizes the estimated fair value of Alpha's identifiable intangible assets and the initial assessment of their respective estimated lives:



[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]



The Company recorded the acquisition using the acquisition method of accounting and recognized the assets acquired and liabilities assumed at their fair values as of the date of the acquisition.
The excess of the purchase price over the net tangible and intangible assets is recorded to goodwill.
The measurement of the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed is substantially complete.
The Company continues to gather necessary information to finalize the accounting for income taxes associated with the acquisition, and as such the Company could record additional adjustments to the provisional amount recognized as this additional information is obtained.
The expected amortization expense based on the finite-lived intangible assets as of June 30, 2019, is $22,175 for the remainder of fiscal 2020, $29,237 in fiscal 2021, $28,993 in fiscal 2022, $27,694 in fiscal 2023 and $24,287 in fiscal 2024.

Fair Value of Financial Instruments



Recurring Fair Value Measurements



The following tables represent the financial assets and (liabilities) measured at fair value on a recurring basis as of June 30, 2019 and March 31, 2019, and the basis for that measurement:



[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]



[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]



The fair values of lead forward contracts are calculated using observable prices for lead as quoted on the London Metal Exchange (“LME”) and, therefore, were classified as Level 2 within the fair value hierarchy, as described in Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies to the Company's consolidated financial statements included in its 2019 Annual Report.
The fair values for foreign currency forward contracts are based upon current quoted market prices and are classified as Level 2 based on the nature of the underlying market in which these derivatives are traded.
Financial Instruments



The fair values of the Company’s cash and cash equivalents approximate carrying value due to their short maturities.
The fair value of the Company’s short-term debt and borrowings under the Amended Credit Facility (as defined in Note 12), approximate their respective carrying value, as they are variable rate debt and the terms are comparable to market terms as of the balance sheet dates and are classified as Level 2.
The Company's 5.00% Senior Notes due 2023 (the “Notes”), with an original face value of $300,000, were issued in April 2015.
The fair value of the Notes represent the trading values based upon quoted market prices and are classified as Level 2.
The Notes were trading at approximately 102% and 99% of face value on June 30, 2019 and March 31, 2019, respectively.

The Company does not enter into derivative contracts for speculative purposes.
Derivatives in Cash Flow Hedging Relationships



Lead Forward Contracts



The Company enters into lead forward contracts to fix the price for a portion of its lead purchases.
Management considers the lead forward contracts to be effective against changes in the cash flows of the underlying lead purchases.
The vast majority of such contracts are for a period not extending beyond one year.
At June 30, 2019 and March 31, 2019, the Company has hedged the price to purchase approximately 38.0 million pounds and 42.0 million pounds of lead, respectively, for a total purchase price of $33,012 and $39,218, respectively.
Foreign Currency Forward Contracts



The Company uses foreign currency forward contracts and options to hedge a portion of the Company’s foreign currency exposures for lead, as well as other foreign currency exposures so that gains and losses on these contracts offset changes in the underlying foreign currency denominated exposures.
The vast majority of such contracts are for a period not extending beyond one year.
As of June 30, 2019 and March 31, 2019, the Company had entered into a total of $29,891 and $42,318, respectively, of such contracts.
In the coming twelve months, the Company anticipates that $3,097 of pretax loss relating to lead and foreign currency forward contracts will be reclassified from AOCI as part of cost of goods sold.
Derivatives not Designated in Hedging Relationships



Foreign Currency Forward Contracts



The Company also enters into foreign currency forward contracts to economically hedge foreign currency fluctuations on intercompany loans and foreign currency denominated receivables and payables.
As of June 30, 2019 and March 31, 2019, the notional amount of these contracts was $21,339 and $22,201, respectively.
The tax provision for the first quarter of fiscal 2020 and 2019 was based on the estimated effective tax rates applicable for the full years ending March 31, 2020 and March 31, 2019, respectively, after giving effect to items specifically related to the interim periods.
On June 14, 2019 final regulations were issued for items relating to the Tax Act.
The consolidated effective income tax rates for the first quarter of fiscal 2020 and 2019 were 17.0% and 19.7%, respectively.
The rate decrease in the first quarter of fiscal 2020 compared to the first quarter of fiscal 2019 is primarily due to changes in the mix of earnings among tax jurisdictions.
Foreign income as a percentage of worldwide income is estimated to be 64% for fiscal 2020 compared to 66% for fiscal 2019.
The rate decrease compared to the prior year period is primarily due to changes in the mix of earnings among tax jurisdictions.

These actions and proceedings are generally based on alleged violations of environmental, anticompetition, employment, contract and other laws.
In the ordinary course of business, the Company and its subsidiaries are also subject to regulatory and governmental examinations, information gathering requests, inquiries, investigations, and threatened legal actions and proceedings.
European Competition Investigations 



Certain of the Company’s European subsidiaries had received subpoenas and requests for documents and, in some cases, interviews from, and have had on-site inspections conducted by, the competition authorities of Belgium, Germany and the Netherlands relating to conduct and anticompetitive practices of certain industrial battery participants.
The Company settled the Belgian regulatory proceeding in February 2016 by acknowledging certain anticompetitive practices and conduct and agreeing to pay a fine of $1,962, which was paid in March 2016.
During the first quarter of fiscal 2019, the Company paid $1,272 towards certain aspects of this matter, which are under appeal.
As of June 30, 2019 and March 31, 2019, the Company did not have a reserve balance.
In June 2017, the Company settled a portion of its previously disclosed proceeding involving the German competition authority relating to conduct involving the Company's motive power battery business and agreed to pay a fine of $14,811, which was paid in July 2017.
Also, in June 2017, the German competition authority issued a fining decision related to the Company's reserve power battery business, which constituted the remaining portion of the previously disclosed German proceeding.
The Company appealed this decision.
In March 2019, the Company settled this matter by agreeing to pay $7,258, which was paid in April 2019.
As of June 30, 2019 and March 31, 2019, the Company had a reserve balance of $0 and $7,258, respectively.
The foregoing estimate of losses is based upon currently available information for these proceedings.
Environmental Issues



As a result of its operations, the Company is subject to various federal, state, and local, as well as international environmental laws and regulations and is exposed to the costs and risks of registering, handling, processing, storing, transporting, and disposing of hazardous substances, especially lead and acid.
The Company’s operations are also subject to federal, state, local and international occupational safety and health regulations, including laws and regulations relating to exposure to lead in the workplace.
The Company is responsible for certain cleanup obligations at the former Yuasa battery facility in Sumter, South Carolina, that predates its ownership of this facility.
This manufacturing facility was closed in 2001 and the Company established a reserve for this facility, which was $1,060 and $1,081 as of June 30, 2019 and March 31, 2019, respectively.
Based on current information, the Company’s management believes this reserve is adequate to satisfy the Company’s environmental liabilities at this facility.
This facility is separate from the Company’s current metal fabrication facility in Sumter.
Lead and Foreign Currency Forward Contracts



To stabilize its lead costs and reduce volatility from currency movements, the Company enters into contracts with financial institutions.
The vast majority of such contracts are for a period not extending beyond one year.
Please refer to Note 7 - Derivative Financial Instruments for more details.

The amendment resulted in an increase of the 2017 Term Loan and the 2017 Revolver by $299,105 and $100,000, respectively.
As of June 30, 2019, the Company had $249,000 outstanding under the Amended 2017 Revolver and $434,813 under the Amended 2017 Term Loan.
Subsequent to the amendment, the quarterly installments payable on the Amended 2017 Term Loan are $5,645 beginning December 31, 2018, $8,468 beginning December 31, 2019 and $11,290 beginning December 31, 2020 with a final payment of $320,000 on September 30, 2022.
