As of March 31, 2018, our outstanding variable-rate debt included $123.0 on our revolving credit facility in the U.S. and $185.0 on our term loan.
Assuming a one-percent increase in the applicable interest rates, annual interest expense on these variable-rate debt instruments would increase by approximately $3.1.
