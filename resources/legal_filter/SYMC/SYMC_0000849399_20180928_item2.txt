Liquidity
We have historically relied on cash generated from operations, borrowings under credit facilities, issuances of debt, and proceeds from divestitures for our liquidity needs.
We also have an undrawn credit facility of $1.0 billion which expires in May 2021.
Our principal cash requirements are primarily to meet our working capital needs, support on-going business activities, including the payment of taxes, fund capital expenditures, service existing debt, and invest in business acquisitions. As a part of our plan to deleverage our balance sheet, we may from time to time make optional repayments of our debt obligations, which may include repurchases of our outstanding debt, depending on various factors such as market conditions.
Our capital allocation strategy is to balance driving stockholder returns, managing financial risk, and preserving our flexibility to pursue strategic options, including acquisitions. Historically this has included a quarterly cash dividend, the repayment of debt and the repurchase of our common stock.
Cash from operating activities
Our cash flows for the first six months of fiscal 2019 reflected a net loss of $68 million adjusted by non-cash items, including amortization and depreciation of $305 million, and stock-based compensation of $210 million. Our cash flows in the first six months of fiscal 2018 reflected a net loss of $145 million, adjusted by non-cash items, including amortization and depreciation of $328 million, stock-based compensation of $323 million, and a deferred tax benefit of $189 million. 
Changes in operating assets and liabilities consisted primarily of a decrease of $286 million in accounts receivable in the first six months of fiscal 2019, reflecting higher collections versus billings.
Cash from investing activities
Our investing activities in the first six months of fiscal 2019 included capital expenditures of $95 million and payments for acquisitions of $17 million, net of cash acquired, partially offset by cash proceeds from maturities and sales of short-term investments of $99 million, while our investing activities in the first six months of fiscal 2018 consisted of capital expenditures of $72 million and net cash payments of $361 million for acquisitions, primarily related to the acquisitions of Fireglass Ltd. and Skycure Ltd., and purchases of short-term investments of $201 million. 
Our financing activities in the first six months of fiscal 2019 primarily consisted of payment of dividends and dividend equivalents of $110 million and tax withholding payments related to RSUs of $53 million, compared to $114 million and $83 million, respectively, in the first six months of fiscal 2018. In addition, we repaid debt of $2.0 billion in the first quarter of fiscal 2018.
Debt - As of September 28, 2018, our total outstanding principal amount of indebtedness was $5.1 billion, of which $600 million in principal is payable in the next twelve months, summarized as follows. See Note 8 to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on our debt.
Debt covenant compliance. The Senior Term Loan agreements A-2, A-5 and our revolving credit facility contain customary representations and warranties, affirmative and negative covenants, including compliance with specified financial ratios, non-financial covenants for financial reporting, and restrictions on subsidiary indebtedness, liens, stock repurchases and dividends (with exceptions permitting our regular quarterly dividend). Our Convertible Senior Notes agreements and the agreement for our 5.0% Senior Note due April 15, 2025 also require us to file periodic reports with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) by specified deadlines.
As of September 28, 2018, we had not met the requirements in the Senior Term Loan agreements A-2, A-5, the revolving credit facility agreement, the Convertible Senior Notes agreements and the agreement for our 5.0% Senior Note due April 15, 2025 to deliver audited financial statements for our fiscal year ended March 30, 2018 and file our Annual Report on Form 10-K for such period with the SEC. In addition, we subsequently did not meet the requirements under the Convertible Senior Notes agreements and the agreement for our 5.0% Senior Note due April 15, 2025 to file our quarterly report on Form 10-Q for our fiscal quarter ended June 29, 2018 with the SEC by the specified deadline. 
On June 22, 2018, we reached an agreement with lenders to waive the financial reporting requirements under the Senior Term Loan agreements A-2, A-5 and the revolving credit facility agreement through October 27, 2018. On October 26, 2018 we satisfied these requirements for our fiscal year ended March 30, 2018 by filing our Form 10-K for such period with the SEC.
The filing of our Form 10-K on October 26, 2018 and the simultaneous filing herewith of the Form 10-Q for the first quarter ended June 29, 2018 also satisfied our SEC reporting requirements for our year ended March 30, 2018 and our quarter ended June 29, 2018, respectively, under the Convertible Senior Notes agreements and the agreement for our 5.0% Senior Note due April 15, 2025. 
Because we expected as of September 28, 2018 that we would comply with all of our debt covenants before any applicable grace periods as defined in the associated indentures for the 5% Notes and the Convertible Senior Notes passed and waivers expired, we have classified all of the associated outstanding debt as long-term debt in our Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets except for the portion that is due in the twelve months following September 28, 2018.
Dividends. On November 1, 2018, we announced a cash dividend of $0.075 per share of common stock to be paid in December 2018. Any future dividends will be subject to the approval of our Board of Directors.
