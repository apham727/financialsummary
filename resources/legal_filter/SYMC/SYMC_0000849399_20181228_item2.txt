Fiscal calendar
Key financial metrics
•Net revenues were relatively flat compared to the corresponding period in fiscal 2018, as increases in revenue from our identity and information protection solutions and from the impact of the adoption of the new revenue recognition standard were partially offset by a decrease as a result of the divestiture of our website security (“WSS”) and public key infrastructure (“PKI”) solutions in October 2017.
•Net revenues decreased 2% primarily as a result of the divestiture of our WSS and PKI solutions, partially offset by an increase in revenue from our identity and information protection solutions.
•Net income and diluted net income per share decreased primarily due to the absence of a gain on the divestiture of WSS and PKI solutions and a net income tax benefit as a result of the Act, which both were recorded during the third quarter of fiscal 2018.
•Cash flow from operating activities increased $264 million due to higher net income adjusted for non-cash items, partially offset by unfavorable net changes in operating assets and liabilities. 
•Cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments increased by $417 million compared to March 30, 2018, primarily due to cash provided by operations, partially offset by investing and financing activities, consisting primarily of additions to property and equipment, tax payments related to restricted stock units and payments of dividend and dividend equivalents.
•Contract liabilities decreased $188 million compared to March 30, 2018, primarily due to a decrease of $169 million in the March 30, 2018 balances as a result of the adoption of the new revenue recognition standard.
Revenue recognition
We recognize revenue primarily pursuant to the requirements under the authoritative guidance on contracts with customers. Revenue recognition requirements are very complex and require us to make estimates and assumptions.

Liquidity
We have historically relied on cash generated from operations, borrowings under credit facilities, issuances of debt, and proceeds from divestitures for our liquidity needs.
We also have an undrawn credit facility of $1.0 billion which expires in May 2021.
Our principal cash requirements are primarily to meet our working capital needs, support on-going business activities, including the payment of taxes, fund capital expenditures, service existing debt, and invest in business acquisitions. As a part of our plan to deleverage our balance sheet, we may from time to time make optional repayments of our debt obligations, which may include repurchases of our outstanding debt, depending on various factors such as market conditions.
Our capital allocation strategy is to balance driving stockholder returns, managing financial risk, and preserving our flexibility to pursue strategic options, including acquisitions. Historically this has included a quarterly cash dividend, the repayment of debt and the repurchase of our common stock.
Cash from operating activities
Our cash flows for the first nine months of fiscal 2019 reflected a net loss of $3 million adjusted by non-cash items, including amortization and depreciation of $457 million, and stock-based compensation of $265 million, compared to a net income of $1.2 billion adjusted by non-cash items, including amortization and depreciation of $485 million, and stock-based compensation of $448 million for the first nine months of fiscal 2018. Our cash flows in the first nine months of fiscal 2018 also reflected $1.6 billion of discrete deferred income tax benefit related to adjustments of deferred taxes as a result of the enactment of the Act in December 2017 and $821 million in taxes payable as a result of transition taxes. 
Changes in operating assets and liabilities consisted primarily of a decrease of $97 million in accounts receivable in the first nine months of fiscal 2019, reflecting higher collections versus billings.
Cash from investing activities
Our investing activities in the first nine months of fiscal 2019 included capital expenditures of $153 million and payments for acquisitions of $41 million, net of cash acquired, partially offset by cash proceeds from maturities and sales of short-term investments of $119 million, while our investing activities in the first nine months of fiscal 2018 consisted of net cash proceeds of $946 million from the divestiture of our WSS and PKI solutions in the third quarter of fiscal 2018, partially offset by purchases of short-term investments of $408 million, net cash payments of $402 million for acquisitions, primarily related to the acquisitions of Fireglass Ltd. and Skycure Ltd. and capital expenditures of $105 million.
Our financing activities in the first nine months of fiscal 2019 primarily consisted of tax withholding payments related to RSUs of $168 million and payment of dividends and dividend equivalents of $169 million, compared to $97 million and $163 million, respectively, in the first nine months of fiscal 2018. In addition, we repaid debt of $2.6 billion and received net proceeds from sales of common stock under employee stock incentive plans of $83 million in the first nine months of fiscal 2018.
Debt - As of December 28, 2018, our total outstanding principal amount of indebtedness was $5.1 billion, of which $600 million in principal is payable in the next twelve months, summarized as follows. See Note 8 to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on our debt. 
Prior to the end of fiscal 2019, we plan to prepay our $600 million Senior Term Loan A-2 due August 1, 2019.
Debt covenant compliance. The Senior Term Loan agreements A-2, A-5 and our revolving credit facility contain customary representations and warranties, affirmative and negative covenants, including compliance with specified financial ratios, non-financial covenants for financial reporting, and restrictions on subsidiary indebtedness, liens, stock repurchases and dividends (with exceptions permitting our regular quarterly dividend). Our Convertible Senior Notes agreements and the agreement for our 5.0% Senior Note due April 15, 2025 also require us to file periodic reports with the SEC by specified deadlines. As of December 28, 2018, we were in compliance with all debt covenants.
Dividends. On January 31, 2019, we announced a cash dividend of $0.075 per share of common stock to be paid in March 2019. Any future dividends will be subject to the approval of our Board of Directors. 
Due to the uncertainty with respect to the timing of future cash flows associated with our unrecognized tax benefits and other long-term taxes as of December 28, 2018 we are unable to make reasonably reliable estimates of the period of cash settlement
