Business Highlights 



In March 2019, TransAct announced the launch of its BOHA!
SaaS-based software and hardware ecosystem, and in May 2019, at the National Restaurant Association show in Chicago TransAct announced the debut of BOHA!
Timer, its latest addition to the BOHA!™ ecosystem.
BOHA!
is a comprehensive ecosystem of cloud-based SaaS apps and hardware designed to help restaurant and food service companies automate their back-of-house operations.
BOHA!
represents the first single-vendor solution to allow customers to choose from any combination of applications for Inventory Management, Temperature Monitoring of Food and Equipment, Food Safety Labeling, Food Recalls, Checklists & Procedures, Equipment Service Management, Timers and Delivery Management.
In April 2019, TransAct announced that it secured commitments from 10 distinct restaurant or foodservice operators representing a broad mix of customers to deploy BOHA!
solutions in their operations, and that it expects to roll out approximately 240 BOHA!
Terminals over the balance of 2019 relating to these commitments.
In June 2019, TransAct announced an agreement with a large, international foodservice brand that includes the deployment of BOHA!
hardware and software across an initial 1,000 locations that will roll out by the end of 2019.
Based on additional expansions of this customer’s stores and a successful roll out of BOHA!, the potential for additional deployments of BOHA!
hardware and software could include 2,000 to 3,000 more locations over the next two to three years.
In June 2019, TransAct also announced that the Company’s Epic Edge and Epic 950 ticket-in/ticket-out printers are installed in all of the more than 3,150 gaming machines at the new Encore Boston Harbor in Everett, Massachusetts, with more than 60% of the installed printers represented by TransAct’s next-generation Epic Edge.
In July 2019, TransAct announced that it secured a new agreement with a large U.S. foodservice provider for the deployment of BOHA!
terminals and one of the BOHA!
SaaS-based apps at more than 400 locations by 2021 year end.
TransAct expects approximately 175 customer locations will be live with the BOHA!
hardware and software solutions by 2019 year end with an additional approximately 250 locations expected to go live over the following two years.

In July 2019, TransAct also announced its first ever agreement to deploy the Company’s BOHA!
solution in the Asia-Pacific market as well as the first BOHA!
agreement with an operator in the casino and gaming industry.
The new agreement, with a leading Macau casino resort, will include 100 BOHA!
terminals and one of the BOHA!
SaaS based apps.
We completed the sale during the third quarter of 2019.
In September 2019, TransAct announced a new agreement with a regional foodservice operator to deploy the BOHA!
Terminal and one of the Company’s BOHA!
SaaS-based apps across 45 locations in the U.S. TransAct expects approximately 30 customer locations to go live with the BOHA!
Terminal, the BOHA!
Labeling SaaS-based app and TransAct Enterprise Management System (TEMS) over the next 12 months, with an additional 15 locations to follow over time.
This new BOHA!
customer will also purchase TransAct labels, which are specifically designed to work with the thermal printers featured in the BOHA!
Terminal.
We have reviewed those policies and determined that they remain our critical accounting policies for the nine months ended September 30, 2019.

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 



 *  International sales do not include sales of printers and terminals made to domestic distributors or other domestic customers who may, in turn, ship those printers and terminals to international destinations.

In addition to sales of hardware, revenue includes sales of cloud-based software applications, labels and other recurring revenue items such extended warranty and service contracts, and technical support services.
In 2019, we launched our BOHA!

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 



The increase in restaurant solutions sales in the third quarter of 2019 compared to the third quarter of 2018 was driven primarily by sales of our BOHA!
software, labels and other recurring revenue.
Sales of BOHA!
software recognized on a SaaS subscription basis, labels and other recurring revenue increased by 267%, including an over 250% increase in label sales and a ten-fold increase in software sales (though off of a low base in the third quarter of 2018) in the third quarter of 2019 compared to the third quarter of 2018.

terminals to encourage customers to adopt our total BOHA!
solution, which includes hardware as well as recurring software subscription revenue, service and label sales.
POS automation and banking.
Revenue from the POS automation and banking market includes sales of thermal printers used primarily by quick serve restaurants located either at the checkout counter or within self-service kiosks to print receipts for consumers or to print on linerless labels.
In addition, revenue includes sales of inkjet printers used by banks, credit unions and other financial institutions to print deposit or withdrawal receipts and/or validate checks at bank teller stations.
Sales of our worldwide POS automation and banking products for the three months ended September 30, 2019 and 2018 were as follows (in thousands, except percentages): 



  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 



The decrease in both domestic and international POS automation and banking product revenue for the third quarter of 2019 compared to the third quarter of 2018 was primarily driven by a 26% decrease in sales of our Ithaca® 9000 printer, largely to McDonald’s.
We expect sales of our Ithaca® 9000 printer to McDonald’s to be lower for the full year 2019 compared to the full year 2018.
15 



Casino and gaming.
Revenue from the casino and gaming market includes sales of thermal ticket printers used in slot machines, video lottery terminals, and other gaming machines that print tickets or receipts instead of issuing coins at casinos and racetracks and other gaming venues worldwide.
Revenue from this market also includes sales of thermal roll-fed printers used in the international off-premise gaming market in gaming machines such as Amusement with Prizes, Skills with Prizes and Fixed Odds Betting Terminals at non-casino gaming establishments.
In addition, casino and gaming market revenue includes sales of the EPICENTRAL™ print system, our software solution (including annual software maintenance), that enables casino operators to create promotional coupons and marketing messages and to print them real-time at the slot machine.
Sales of our worldwide casino and gaming products for the three months ended September 30, 2019 and 2018 were as follows (in thousands, except percentages): 



  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 



The decrease in domestic sales of our casino and gaming products was due to a 50% decline in domestic sales of our thermal casino printers in the third quarter of 2019 compared to the third quarter of 2018, driven primarily by a large order of replacement printers from a domestic casino operator during the third quarter of 2018 that did not reoccur in the third quarter of 2019, as well as decreased sales to our OEMs.
These decreases were partially offset by slightly higher revenue from recurring EPICENTRALTM annual software maintenance fees during the third quarter of 2019 compared to the third quarter of 2018.
We did not complete any new installations of our EPICENTRAL™ software systems in the third quarter of 2019 or 2018.
The decrease was partially offset by 37% higher international sales of our off-premise gaming printers during the third quarter of 2019 compared to the third quarter of 2018, primarily to an OEM in Europe for sports betting, as well as stronger sales in Australia.
Lottery.
Revenue from the lottery market includes sales of thermal on-line and other lottery printers primarily to International Game Technology and its subsidiaries (“IGT”) and, to a lesser extent, other lottery system companies for various lottery applications.
Printrex.
Printrex branded printers are sold into markets that include wide format, desktop and rack mounted and vehicle mounted black/white thermal printers used by customers to log and plot oil field, seismic and down hole well drilling data in the oil and gas exploration industry.
It also includes high-speed color inkjet desktop printers used to print logs at the data centers of the oil and gas field service companies.
Prior to 2019, revenue in this market also included sales of vehicle mounted printers used to print schematics and certain other critical information in emergency services vehicles and other mobile printing applications.
Sales of our worldwide Printrex printers for the three months ended September 30, 2019 and 2018 were as follows (in thousands, except percentages): 



  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 



16 



The decrease in sales of Printrex printers for the third quarter of 2019 compared to the third quarter of 2018 resulted from a 43% decrease in domestic and international sales in the oil and gas market, as sales for the third quarter of 2018 were unusually high.
TSG.
Revenue generated by our TSG includes sales of consumable products (inkjet cartridges, ribbons, receipt paper, color thermal paper, and other printing supplies), replacement parts, maintenance and repair services, testing services, refurbished printers, and shipping and handling charges.
Note that TSG sales exclude the sales of labels, extended warranty and service contracts, and technical support services related to our Restaurant Solutions market.
These sales, which we previously included in TSG, have been reclassified to Restaurant Solutions for all periods presented in this Report.
Sales in our worldwide TSG market for the three months ended September 30, 2019 and 2018 were as follows (in thousands, except percentages): 



  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 



The decrease in domestic revenue from TSG for the third quarter of 2019 as compared to the prior year period was due primarily to lower sales of replacement parts including lower sales of lottery printer spare parts to IGT.
This decrease was partially offset by increased service revenue of 48% resulting largely from increased repairs of POS printers for McDonald’s.
Gross Profit.
software solutions.
For the third quarter of 2019, gross profit decreased $2.5 million, or 31%, due primarily to a 26% decline in sales during the third quarter of 2019 compared to the third quarter of 2018.
Such expenses decreased $58 thousand, or 5% in the third quarter of 2019 compared to the third quarter of 2018, primarily due to lower expenses related to product development for the restaurant solutions and casino and gaming markets.
Operating Expenses - Selling and Marketing.
Such expenses increased $149 thousand, or 8%, for the third quarter of 2019 compared to the third quarter of 2018.
During the third quarter of 2019, we incurred higher compensation expenses related to the hiring of additional outside and technical sales and marketing staff as well as higher promotional marketing expenses to support the expected growth in our restaurant solutions market.
software and hardware solutions.
Operating Expenses - General and Administrative.
General and administrative expense information for the three months ended September 30, 2019 and 2018 is summarized below (in thousands, except percentages): 



  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 



General and administrative expenses primarily include salaries, incentive compensation, and other payroll related expenses for our executive, accounting, human resources and information technology staff, expenses for our corporate headquarters, professional and legal expenses, telecommunication expenses, and other expenses related to being a publicly-traded company.
We expect general and administrative expense to be higher in the full year 2019 compared to the full year 2018 due to additional investment to support restaurant solutions.
Operating Income.
Operating income information for the three months ended September 30, 2019 and 2018 is summarized below (in thousands, except percentages): 



  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 



Our operating income decreased $2.9 million, or 90%, in the third quarter of 2019 compared to the third quarter of 2018, and our operating margin decreased to 2.7% of net sales due to a decline in sales of 26% and a 300 basis point decline in gross margin during the third quarter of 2019 compared to the prior year period.
Additionally, operating expenses increased 9% during the third quarter of 2019 compared to the third quarter of 2018.
Interest.
We recorded no net interest income or expense in the third quarter of 2019 compared to $7 thousand of net interest expense in the third quarter of 2018.
We expect that net interest expense will be slightly lower in the full year 2019 compared to the full year 2018, as interest income earned on the note receivable will largely offset interest expense incurred on unused borrowings under our revolving credit line.
18 



Other, net.
We recorded other expense of $71 thousand in the third quarter of 2019 compared to $50 thousand in the third quarter of 2018 due to higher foreign exchange losses recorded by our U.K. entity in the third quarter of 2019.
Going forward, we may continue to experience more foreign exchange gains or losses depending on the level of sales to Europe through our U.K. subsidiary and the change in exchange rates of the Euro and Pound Sterling against the U.S. dollar.
The FDII deduction was not included in the effective tax rate for the third quarter of 2018 as the interpretive guidance for the deduction was not yet released.
Net Income.
We reported net income for the third quarter of 2019 of $384 thousand, or $0.05 per diluted share, compared to $2.6 million, or $0.33 per diluted share, for the third quarter of 2018.

The average selling price of our printers, terminals and other hardware increased 2% during the first nine months of 2019 compared to the first nine months of 2018. 



International sales decreased $0.6 million, or 8%, primarily driven by an 11% decrease of international casino and gaming sales.

During the first nine months of 2019: 



  ●  We reported net income of $1.3 million.
●  We recorded depreciation and amortization of $0.7 million, and share-based compensation expense of $0.6 million.
●  Accounts receivable increased $0.4 million, or 5%, due to sales for the third quarter 2019 occurring late in the quarter.
●  Other current and long term assets increased $0.6 million, or 81% due primarily to an advanced payment of royalty fees to a technology partner for restaurant solutions.
●  Accrued liabilities and other liabilities decreased $0.1 million, or 3%.
During the first nine months of 2018: 



  ●  We reported net income of $4.5 million.
●  We recorded depreciation and amortization of $0.7 million, and share-based compensation expense of $0.5 million.
●  Inventories increased $4.2 million, or 47%, due to the buildup of inventory on hand to support future anticipated sales in the casino and gaming and restaurant solutions markets.
●  Prepaid income taxes decreased $0.5 million during the first nine months of 2018.
●  Accounts payable increased $2.5 million, or 65%, due to increased inventory purchases made during the third quarter of 2018.
●  Accrued liabilities and other liabilities decreased $0.3 million, or 8%, due primarily to the payment of 2017 annual bonuses in March 2018, partially offset by increased deferred revenue.
Investing activities: Our capital expenditures, including capitalized software costs, were $1.1 million and $1.2 million for the first nine months of 2019 and 2018, respectively.
Expenditures for the first nine months of 2019 were primarily for new product tooling equipment and, to a lesser extent, computer and networking equipment.
Expenditures for the first nine months of 2018 were primarily for computer and networking equipment and furniture and fixtures purchases related to investments made in our U.K. facility to support the build-out of our internal sales infrastructure to sell directly to slot machine manufacturers and end user casino and gaming customers.
To a lesser extent, expenditures in the first nine months of 2018 included computer and networking equipment for our U.S. operations and leasehold improvements made at our Las Vegas facility.
Additionally, during the third quarter of 2019, we loaned $1 million to an unrelated party that we expect to be repaid within the next 12 months.
products, new product tooling, new computer software and equipment purchases.
Financing activities: We used $2.2 million of cash from financing activities during the first nine months of 2019 to pay dividends of $2 million and $0.2 million related to the relinquishment of shares to pay for withholding taxes on stock issued from our stock compensation plan.
During the first nine months of 2018, we used $4 million of cash from financing activities to purchase $2 million of common stock for treasury, to pay dividends of $2 million to common shareholders, and $0.3 million related to the relinquishment of shares to pay for withholding taxes on stock issued from our stock compensation plan, partially offset by proceeds from stock option exercises of $0.2 million.
Credit Facility and Borrowings 



We maintain a credit facility (the “TD Bank Credit Facility”) with TD Bank N.A.
(“TD Bank”), which provides for a $20 million revolving credit line.
On November 21, 2017, we signed an amendment to the TD Bank Credit Facility through November 28, 2022.
Borrowings under the revolving credit line bear a floating rate of interest at the prime rate minus one percent and are secured by a lien on all our assets.
We also pay a fee of 0.125% on unused borrowings under the revolving credit line.
The amendment increased the amount of revolving credit loans we may use to fund future cash dividend payments or treasury share buybacks to $12.5 million from $10 million.
The TD Bank Credit Facility imposes certain quarterly financial covenants on us and restricts, among other things, our ability to incur additional indebtedness and the creation of other liens.
We were not in compliance with one of our financial covenants of the TD Bank Credit Facility at September 30, 2019.
On November 6, 2019, we obtained a waiver from TD Bank for compliance with this financial covenant, which pertains to operating cash flow to total debt service (the “OCF”) at September 30, 2019, and amended the definition of interest expense to exclude fees paid on unused borrowings under the revolving credit line which is used to calculate total debt service in the OCF.
The following table lists the financial covenants and the performance measurements at September 30, 2019: 



  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 



At September 30, 2019, we had no outstanding borrowings under the TD Bank Credit facility.
Following the waiver, we had borrowings available under the TD Bank Credit Facility of $20 million.
Shareholder Dividend Payments 



In 2012, our Board of Directors initiated a quarterly cash dividend program which is subject to the Board’s approval each quarter.

Resource Sufficiency 



We believe that our cash and cash equivalents on hand, our expected cash flows generated from operating activities and borrowings available under our TD Bank Credit Facility will provide sufficient resources to meet our working capital needs, finance our capital expenditures and additions to capitalized software, and dividend payments, and meet our liquidity requirements through at least the next 12 months.
Contractual Obligations / Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 



The disclosure of payments we have committed to make under our contractual obligations is set forth under Part II, Item 7, “Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Contractual Obligations” of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018.
There have been no material changes in our contractual obligations since December 31, 2018.
