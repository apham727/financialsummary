Item 1A. Risk Factors
We are subject to laws and regulations regarding privacy, data protection and information security, and our actual or perceived failure to comply with such legal obligations could adversely affect our business.
 The European Union ("EU") adopted the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) which took effect on May 25, 2018 harmonizing data protection laws across the EU. The GDPR strengthens individual privacy rights and enhances data protection obligations for processors and controllers of personal data. This includes expanded disclosures about how personal information is to be used, limitations on retention of information and mandatory data breach notification requirements. Non-compliance with the GDPR can trigger fines of up to â‚¬20 million or 4% of total worldwide annual revenue, whichever is greater. 
Also, U.S. federal, state and other foreign governments and agencies have adopted or are considering adopting laws and regulations regarding the collection, storage, use, processing and disclosure personal data. Because the interpretation and application of privacy and data protection laws are still uncertain, it is possible that these laws may be interpreted and applied in a manner that is inconsistent with our existing practices or the features of our products, services and software.
In addition, some countries are considering legislation requiring local storage and processing of data that, if enacted, could increase the cost and complexity of offering our product, services and software or maintaining our business operations in those jurisdictions.
