The reorganization of business accruals at September 29, 2018 were $61 million, of which $39 million relate to employee separation costs that are expected to be paid within one year and $22 million of accruals related primarily to lease termination obligations that are expected to be paid over a number of years.
At September 29, 2018, $290 million of the $851 million cash and cash equivalents balance was held in the U.S. and $561 million was held by us or our subsidiaries in other countries, with approximately $200 million held in the United Kingdom. Restricted cash was $12 million at September 29, 2018 and $63 million at December 31, 2017. During the three months ended September 29, 2018, restricted cash decreased from $63 million to $12 million due to the completion of a settlement related to our legacy Networks business. 
Operating Activities
Net cash provided by operating activities in the first nine months of 2018 decreased $322 million, compared to the first nine months of 2017. Operating cash flows in the first nine months of 2018, as compared to the first nine months of 2017, were negatively impacted by a $500 million contribution to our U.S. pension plan in February 2018, a settlement payment related to our legacy Networks business, higher incentive payments, and the recovery of financial receivables owed to us by a former customer in the first quarter of 2017, partially offset by improved working capital. The contribution to our U.S. pension plan moves the next anticipated required contribution to 2024, or beyond.
Investing Activities
Net cash used by investing activities increased $781 million in the first nine months of 2018, compared to the first nine months of 2017. The $1.2 billion of cash used in the first nine months of 2018 included $1.2 billion used for acquisitions and investments and $128 million in capital expenditures, partially offset by $90 million of proceeds from sales of investments and businesses. The cash usage of $415 million in the first nine months of 2017 consisted primarily of $383 million cash used for acquisitions and investments and $206 million in capital expenditures, partially offset by $174 million of proceeds from the sale of investments and businesses.
Financing Activities
To complete the acquisition of Avigilon during the quarter ended March 31, 2018, we entered into a term loan for $400 million with a maturity date of March 26, 2021 (the “Term Loan”). Interest on the Term Loan is variable, indexed to LIBOR, and paid monthly. The weighted average borrowing rate for amounts outstanding during the three and nine months ended September 29, 2018 were 3.33% and 3.43%, respectively. No additional borrowings are permitted and amounts borrowed and repaid or prepaid may not be re-borrowed. 
In February of 2018, we issued $500 million of 4.60% Senior notes due 2028. After debt issuance costs and debt discounts, we recognized net proceeds of $497 million. These proceeds were then used to make a $500 million contribution to our U.S. pension plan in the first quarter of 2018.
On August 25, 2015, we entered into an agreement with Silver Lake Partners to issue $1.0 billion of 2.00% Senior Convertible Notes which mature in September 2020. The notes became fully convertible as of August 25, 2017. The notes are convertible based on a conversion rate of 14.8252, as may be adjusted for dividends declared, per $1,000 principal amount (which is currently equal to a conversion price of $67.45 per share). The exercise price adjusts automatically for dividends. On September 5, 2018, we agreed with Silver Lake Partners to repurchase $200 million in principal amount of the Senior Convertible Notes for aggregate consideration of $369 million in cash, inclusive of the conversion premium. As of September 29, 2018, we paid $169 million of cash to Silver Lake Partners and recorded a gain of $6 million from the extinguishment of the convertible debt. The principal amount of $200 million was reclassified to short term debt. In the event of an additional conversion, the notes may be settled in either cash or stock, at our discretion. We intend to settle the principal amount of the Senior Convertible Notes in cash.
On September 28, 2018, we issued an additional $200 million on the outstanding 4.60% Senior notes due 2028 bringing the outstanding total to $700 million. We settled the issuance on October 5, 2018 and recognized net proceeds of $196 million, subsequent to quarter end, which was then used to pay the $200 million principal due to Silver Lake Partners on October 15, 2018. 
As of September 29, 2018, we had a $2.2 billion syndicated, unsecured revolving credit facility scheduled to mature in April 2022 (the "2017 Motorola Solutions Credit Agreement"). As of March 31, 2018, we borrowed $400 million under the facility to complete the Avigilon acquisition. As of September 29, 2018, the outstanding loan amount under the facility was $100 million, with $200 million paid during the third quarter. Subsequent to the quarter, we paid the remaining $100 million. The 2017 Motorola Solutions Credit Agreement includes a $500 million letter of credit sub-limit with $450 million of fronting commitments. Borrowings under the facility bear interest at the prime rate plus the applicable margin, or at a spread above the London Interbank Offered Rate ("LIBOR"), at our option. The weighted average borrowing rate on outstanding amounts for the three and nine months ended September 29, 2018 was 3.58%. An annual facility fee is payable on the undrawn amount of the credit line. The interest rate and facility fee are subject to adjustment if our credit rating changes. We must comply with certain customary covenants including a maximum leverage ratio, as defined in the 2017 Motorola Solutions Credit Agreement. We were in compliance with our financial covenants as of September 29, 2018. 
Long-Term Customer Financing Commitments
Sales of Receivables
At September 29, 2018, the Company had retained servicing obligations for $879 million of long-term receivables, compared to $873 million at December 31, 2017. Servicing obligations are limited to collection activities related to the sales of accounts receivables and long-term receivables. 
Other Contingencies
Recent Accounting Pronouncements
In February 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued Accounting Standards Update ("ASU") No. 2016-02, "Leases," which amends existing guidance to require lessees to recognize assets and liabilities on the balance sheet for the rights and obligations created by long-term leases and to disclose additional quantitative and qualitative information about leasing arrangements. The ASU is effective for us on January 1, 2019 and interim periods within that reporting period, with early adoption permitted. In July 2018 the FASB issued ASU 2018-11 that amended the ASU to include an additional (and optional) transition relief. The additional transition relief provides entities the option to adopt the ASU by applying the new ASU at the adoption date and recognizing a cumulative-effect adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings in the period of adoption without restatement of comparative periods. The new ASU must be adopted utilizing the modified retrospective method as of the earliest comparative period presented if the optional adoption method is not selected. We will adopt the ASU on January 1, 2019, utilizing the modified retrospective method as of the adoption date. We are continuing to assess the impact of the ASU on our financial statements, including the package of available practical expedients, required disclosures, and changes to internal controls. Based on the preliminary work completed, we expect a material impact to our balance sheet through the recording of right-of-use assets and lease obligations that are not required to be recorded within the balance sheet under current accounting standards.
In August 2018, the FASB issued ASU No. 2018-14, “Compensation - Retirement Benefits - Defined Benefit Plans - General (Subtopic 715-20) - Changes to the Disclosure Requirements for Defined Benefit Plans,” which modifies the disclosure requirements for the defined benefit pension plans and other postretirement plans. The ASU is effective for us on January 1, 2020 with early adoption permitted. The ASU requires a retrospective adoption method. We do not believe the ASU will have a material impact on our financial statement disclosures.
We adopted ASU No. 2017-07, “Compensation - Retirement Benefits (Topic 715) - Improving the Presentation of Net Periodic Pension Cost and Net Periodic Postretirement Benefit Cost” on January 1, 2018 using the retrospective method of adoption. The amendments in the ASU require that an employer disaggregate the service cost component from the other components of net periodic cost (benefit) and report that component in the same line item as other compensation costs arising from services rendered by employees during the period. The other components of net periodic cost (benefit) are required to be presented in the statement of operations separately from the service cost component and outside of operating earnings. We have restated our comparative period results to reflect the application of the presentation guidance of the ASU. As a result of the ASU, the presentation of net periodic cost (benefit) has been updated to classify all components of our net periodic benefit, with the exception of the service cost component, within Other in Other income (expense) on the statement of operations. We reclassified $18 million and $10 million in the three months ended September 29, 2018 and September 30, 2017, respectively, and $58 million and $10 million in the nine months ended September 29, 2018 and September 30, 2017, respectively.
We adopted ASU No. 2014-09, "Revenue from Contracts with Customers," and all the related amendments (collectively “ASC 606”) on January 1, 2018 using the modified retrospective method. We recognized the cumulative effect of initially applying the new revenue standard as an adjustment to our opening retained earnings. The comparative information has not been restated and continues to be reported under the accounting standards in effect in those periods.
