Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk
As of June 30, 2018, we had outstanding foreign exchange contracts with notional amounts totaling $681 million, compared to $507 million outstanding as of December 31, 2017. Management believes that these financial instruments should not subject us to undue risk due to foreign exchange movements because gains and losses on these contracts should generally offset gains and losses on the underlying assets, liabilities and transactions.
