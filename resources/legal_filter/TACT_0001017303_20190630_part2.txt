RISK FACTORS      



Information regarding risk factors appears under Part I, Item 1A, “Risk Factors,” of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended  December 31, 2018.
In 2016, the United Kingdom voted to depart from the European Union, known as Brexit and subsequently notified the European Council of its intention to leave the E.U.
and began to negotiate the terms of the future relationship between the U.K. and the E.U.
upon exit.
We have taken certain actions in response to Brexit and in anticipation of E.U.
legal requirements and the U.K.’s separation from the E.U.
The actual effects of Brexit will depend upon many factors, including the final results of the Brexit negotiations.
