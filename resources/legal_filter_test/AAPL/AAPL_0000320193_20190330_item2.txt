The Company repurchased $24.0 billion of its common stock and paid dividends and dividend equivalents of $3.4 billion during the second quarter of 2019.
Beginning in the first quarter of 2019, the Company classified the amortization of the deferred value of Maps, Siri and free iCloud services, which are bundled in the sales price of iPhone, Mac, iPad and certain other products, in services net sales.
Historically, the Company classified the amortization of these amounts in products net sales consistent with its management reporting framework.
As a result, products and services net sales information for the second quarter and first six months of 2018 was reclassified to conform to the 2019 presentation.
iPhone net sales decreased during the second quarter and first six months of 2019 compared to the same periods in 2018 due primarily to lower iPhone unit sales in all the reportable geographic segments.
Mac net sales decreased during the second quarter of 2019 compared to the same quarter in 2018 due primarily to lower net sales of iMac.
Year-over-year Mac net sales increased during the first six months of 2019 due primarily to higher net sales of MacBook Air, partially offset by lower net sales of iMac.
iPad net sales increased during the second quarter and first six months of 2019 compared to the same periods in 2018 due primarily to higher net sales of iPad Pro®.
Wearables, Home and Accessories net sales increased during the second quarter and first six months of 2019 compared to the same periods in 2018 due primarily to higher net sales of Apple Watch and AirPods.
Services net sales increased during the second quarter and first six months of 2019 compared to the same periods in 2018 due primarily to the App Store, licensing and AppleCare.
The Company’s reportable segments consist of the Americas, Europe, Greater China, Japan and Rest of Asia Pacific.
Greater China includes China, Hong Kong and Taiwan.
Rest of Asia Pacific includes Australia and those Asian countries not included in the Company’s other reportable segments.
Although the reportable segments provide similar hardware and software products and similar services, each one is managed separately to better align with the location of the Company’s customers and distribution partners and the unique market dynamics of each geographic region.
Further information regarding the Company’s reportable segments can be found in Part I, Item 1 of this Form 10-Q in the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements in Note 11, “Segment Information and Geographic Data.”

Japan net sales during the second quarter of 2019 were relatively flat compared to the same quarter in 2018, as higher Services and iPad net sales were primarily offset by lower iPhone net sales.
Year-over-year Japan net sales decreased during the first six months of 2019 due primarily to lower iPhone net sales, partially offset by higher Services and iPad net sales.
The value of the Japanese Yen relative to the U.S. dollar had a favorable impact on Japan net sales during the second quarter of 2019.

Services gross margin increased during the second quarter and first six months of 2019 compared to the same periods in 2018 due primarily to a different services mix.
Year-over-year services gross margin percentage increased during the second quarter and first six months of 2019 due primarily to a different services mix and leverage of the Company’s services fixed cost structure from higher services net sales, partially offset by the weakness in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar.
The Company anticipates total gross margin percentage during the third quarter of 2019 to be between 37.0% and 38.0%.
The foregoing statement regarding the Company’s expected total gross margin percentage in the third quarter of 2019 is forward-looking and could differ from actual results.
The growth in selling, general and administrative expense during the second quarter of 2019 compared to the same quarter in 2018 was driven primarily by higher spending on marketing and advertising and increases in headcount-related expenses.
The Company’s effective tax rate for the second quarter of 2019 was lower than the statutory federal income tax rate due primarily to the lower tax rate on foreign earnings.

While the Company is currently evaluating the impact of adopting ASU 2016-02, based on the lease portfolio as of March 30, 2019, the Company anticipates recording lease assets and liabilities of approximately $9 billion on its Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets, with no material impact to its Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations.
However, the ultimate impact of adopting ASU 2016-02 will depend on the Company’s lease portfolio as of the adoption date.

The Company’s marketable securities investment portfolio is primarily invested in highly rated securities, with the primary objective of minimizing the potential risk of principal loss.
The Company’s investment policy generally requires securities to be investment grade and limits the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer.
During the six months ended March 30, 2019, cash generated by operating activities of $37.8 billion was a result of $31.5 billion of net income and non-cash adjustments to net income of $9.2 billion, partially offset by a decrease in the net change in operating assets and liabilities of $2.9 billion.

The Company’s capital expenditures were $3.3 billion during the first six months of 2019.
The Company anticipates utilizing approximately $12.0 billion for capital expenditures during 2019, which includes product tooling and manufacturing process equipment; data centers; corporate facilities and infrastructure, including information systems hardware, software and enhancements; and retail store facilities.
The Company issues unsecured short-term promissory notes (“Commercial Paper”) pursuant to a commercial paper program.
The Company uses the net proceeds from the commercial paper program for general corporate purposes, including dividends and share repurchases.

On April 30, 2019, the Company also announced the Board of Directors raised the Company’s quarterly cash dividend from $0.73 to $0.77 per share, beginning with the dividend to be paid during the third quarter of 2019.
The Company intends to increase its dividend on an annual basis, subject to declaration by the Board of Directors.
As of March 30, 2019, the Company’s total future minimum lease payments under noncancelable operating leases were $10.4 billion.
The Company’s retail store and other facility leases typically have original terms not exceeding 10 years and generally contain multi-year renewal options.
The Company utilizes several outsourcing partners to manufacture sub-assemblies for the Company’s products and to perform final assembly and testing of finished products.
These outsourcing partners acquire components and build product based on demand information supplied by the Company, which typically covers periods up to 150 days.
As of March 30, 2019, the Company expects to pay $26.2 billion under manufacturing-related supplier arrangements, which are primarily noncancelable.
As of March 30, 2019, a significant portion of the other non-current liabilities in the Company’s Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet consisted of the $30.9 billion deemed repatriation tax payable imposed by the Act.
The Company plans to pay the deemed repatriation tax payable in installments in accordance with the Act.
The Company’s remaining other non-current liabilities primarily consist of items for which the Company is unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate of the timing of payments.
Except as disclosed in Part I, Item 1 of this Form 10-Q in the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements in Note 10, “Commitments and Contingencies” under the heading “Contingencies,” in the opinion of management, there was not at least a reasonable possibility the Company may have incurred a material loss, or a material loss in excess of a recorded accrual, with respect to indemnification of third parties.
The Company offers an iPhone Upgrade Program, which is available to customers who purchase a qualifying iPhone in the U.S., the U.K. and mainland China.
The iPhone Upgrade Program provides customers the right to trade in that iPhone for a specified amount when purchasing a new iPhone, provided certain conditions are met.
The Company accounts for the trade-in right as a guarantee liability and recognizes arrangement revenue net of the fair value of such right, with subsequent changes to the guarantee liability recognized within net sales.
Under these agreements, the Company has agreed to indemnify such individuals to the fullest extent permitted by law against liabilities that arise by reason of their status as directors or officers of the Company, and to advance expenses incurred by such individuals in connection with related legal proceedings.
It is not possible to determine the maximum potential amount of payments the Company could be required to make under these agreements due to the limited history of prior indemnification claims and the unique facts and circumstances involved in each claim.
While the Company maintains directors and officers liability insurance coverage, such insurance coverage may be insufficient to cover all losses or all types of claims that may arise.
With the exception of Revenue Recognition and Impairment of Marketable Debt Securities, there have been no material changes to the Company’s critical accounting policies and estimates since the 2018 Form 10-K.
The Company has identified up to three performance obligations regularly included in arrangements involving the sale of iPhone, Mac, iPad and certain other products.
The first performance obligation, which represents the substantial portion of the allocated sales price, is the hardware and bundled software delivered at the time of sale.
The third performance obligation is the right to receive, on a when-and-if-available basis, future unspecified software upgrades relating to the software bundled with each device.
Because the Company lacks observable prices for the undelivered performance obligations, the allocation of revenue is based on the Company’s estimated SSPs.
Factors subject to change include the nature of the unspecified software upgrade rights and product-related bundled services offered, their estimated value and the estimated period they are expected to be provided.
The Company’s investments in marketable debt securities are classified as available-for-sale and reported at fair value.
The Company regularly reviews its investment portfolio to determine if any security is other-than-temporarily impaired, which would require the Company to record an impairment charge in the period any such determination is made.
