This section and other parts of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q (“Form 10-Q”) contain forward-looking statements, within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, that involve risks and uncertainties.
The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended September 30, 2017 (the “2017 Form 10-K”) filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) and the condensed consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in Part I, Item 1 of this Form 10-Q.
All information presented herein is based on the Company’s fiscal calendar.
The Company assumes no obligation to revise or update any forward-looking statements for any reason, except as required by law.
The Company anticipates gross margin percentage during the second quarter of 2018 to be between 38.0% and 38.5%.
The foregoing statement regarding the Company’s expected gross margin percentage in the second quarter of 2018 is forward-looking and could differ from actual results.
In general, the Company believes gross margins will remain under downward pressure due to a variety of factors, including: continued industry-wide global product pricing pressures; increased competition; the Company’s ability to effectively stimulate demand for certain of its products; compressed product life cycles; product transitions; potential increases in the cost of components and outside manufacturing services; the Company’s ability to manage product quality and warranty costs effectively; and a potential shift in the Company’s sales mix towards products with lower gross margins.
In response to competitive pressures, the Company expects it will continue to take product pricing actions, which would adversely affect gross margins.
Due to the Company’s significant international operations, its financial condition and operating results, including gross margins, could be significantly affected by fluctuations in exchange rates.
The foregoing statement regarding the Company’s expected effective tax rate during 2018 is forward-looking and could differ from actual results.
The following discussion of risk factors contains forward-looking statements.
These risk factors may be important to understanding other statements in this Form 10-Q.
The following information should be read in conjunction with the condensed consolidated financial statements and related notes in Part I, Item 1, “Financial Statements” and Part I, Item 2, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” of this Form 10-Q.
