Apple Inc. and its wholly-owned subsidiaries (collectively “Apple” or the “Company”) designs, manufactures and markets mobile communication and media devices and personal computers, and sells a variety of related software, services, accessories and third-party digital content and applications.
The Company’s products and services include iPhone®, Mac®, iPad®, Apple Watch®, AirPods®, Apple TV®, HomePod™, a portfolio of consumer and professional software applications, iOS, macOS®, watchOS® and tvOS® operating systems, iCloud®, Apple Pay® and a variety of accessory, service and support offerings.
The Company sells its products worldwide through its retail stores, online stores and direct sales force, as well as through third-party cellular network carriers, wholesalers, retailers and resellers.
In addition, the Company sells a variety of third-party Apple-compatible products, including application software and various accessories, through its retail and online stores.
The accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company.
Intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated.
In the opinion of the Company’s management, the condensed consolidated financial statements reflect all adjustments, which are normal and recurring in nature, necessary for fair financial statement presentation.
Certain prior period amounts in the condensed consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes have been reclassified to conform to the current period’s presentation.
These condensed consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes should be read in conjunction with the Company’s annual consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto included in its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended September 29, 2018 (the “2018 Form 10-K”).
A 14th week is included in the first fiscal quarter every five or six years to realign the Company’s fiscal quarters with calendar quarters.
Unless otherwise stated, references to particular years, quarters, months and periods refer to the Company’s fiscal years ended in September and the associated quarters, months and periods of those fiscal years.
2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606) (“ASU 2014-09”), and additional ASUs issued to clarify the guidance in ASU 2014-09 (collectively the “new revenue standard”), which amends the existing accounting standards for revenue recognition.
The Company did not restate total net sales in the prior periods presented, as adoption of the new revenue standard did not have a material impact on previously reported amounts.
Additionally, beginning in the first quarter of 2019, the Company classified the amortization of the deferred value of Maps, Siri® and free iCloud services, which are bundled in the sales price of iPhone, Mac, iPad and certain other products, in Services net sales.
Historically, the Company classified the amortization of these amounts in Products net sales consistent with its management reporting framework.
As a result, Products and Services net sales information for the first quarter of 2018 was reclassified to conform to the 2019 presentation.
Net sales consist of revenue from the sale of iPhone, Mac, iPad, services and other products.
The Company recognizes revenue at the amount to which it expects to be entitled when control of the products or services is transferred to its customers.
Control is generally transferred when the Company has a present right to payment and title and the significant risks and rewards of ownership of products or services are transferred to its customers.
For most of the Company’s products net sales, control transfers when products are shipped.
For the Company’s services net sales, control transfers over time as services are delivered.
Payment for products and services net sales is collected within a short period of time following transfer of control or commencement of delivery of services, as applicable.
For arrangements with multiple performance obligations, which represent promises within an arrangement that are capable of being distinct, the Company allocates revenue to all distinct performance obligations based on their relative stand-alone selling prices (“SSP”).
When available, the Company uses observable prices to determine the SSP.
When observable prices are not available, SSPs are established that reflect the Company’s best estimates of what the selling prices of the performance obligations would be if they were sold regularly on a stand-alone basis.
The Company has identified up to three performance obligations regularly included in arrangements involving the sale of iPhone, Mac, iPad and certain other products.
The first performance obligation, which represents the substantial portion of the allocated sales price, is the hardware and bundled software delivered at the time of sale.
The Company allocates revenue and any related discounts to these performance obligations based on their relative SSPs.
Because the Company lacks observable prices for the undelivered performance obligations, the allocation of revenue is based on the Company’s estimated SSPs.
Revenue allocated to the delivered hardware and bundled software is recognized when control has transferred to the customer, which generally occurs when the product is shipped.
Revenue allocated to the product-related bundled services and unspecified software upgrade rights is deferred and recognized on a straight-line basis over the estimated period they are expected to be provided.
Cost of sales related to delivered hardware and bundled software, including estimated warranty costs, are recognized at the time of sale.
For certain long-term service arrangements, the Company has performance obligations for services it has not yet delivered.
The Company has determined that any unbilled consideration relates entirely to the value of the undelivered services.
Accordingly, the Company has not recognized revenue, and has elected not to disclose amounts, related to these undelivered services.
For the sale of third-party products where the Company obtains control of the product before transferring it to the customer, the Company recognizes revenue based on the gross amount billed to customers.
The Company considers multiple factors when determining whether it obtains control of third-party products including, but not limited to, evaluating if it has the ability to establish the price of the product, retains inventory risk for tangible products or has the responsibility for ensuring acceptability of the product.
For third-party applications sold through the App Store, Mac App Store and TV App Store and certain digital content sold through the iTunes Store, the Company does not obtain control of the product before transferring it to the customer.
Therefore, the Company accounts for such sales on a net basis by recognizing in services net sales only the commission it retains.
The Company has elected to record revenue net of taxes collected from customers that are remitted to governmental authorities, with the collected taxes recorded within other current liabilities until remitted to the relevant government authority.
As of December 29, 2018 and September 29, 2018, the Company had total deferred revenue of $8.4 billion and $8.8 billion, respectively.
As of December 29, 2018, the Company expects 66% of total deferred revenue to be realized in less than a year, 27% within one-to-two years, 6% within two-to-three years and 1% in greater than three years.
The Company’s proportion of net sales by disaggregated revenue source was generally consistent for each reportable segment in Note 11, “Segment Information and Geographic Data” for the three months ended December 29, 2018 and December 30, 2017.
The Company may sell certain of its marketable debt securities prior to their stated maturities for reasons including, but not limited to, managing liquidity, credit risk, duration and asset allocation.
The Company typically invests in highly rated securities, with the primary objective of minimizing the potential risk of principal loss.
The Company’s investment policy generally requires securities to be investment grade and limits the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer.
Fair values were determined for each individual security in the investment portfolio.
When evaluating a marketable debt security for other-than-temporary impairment, the Company reviews factors such as the length of time and extent to which fair value has been below its cost basis, the financial condition of the issuer and any changes thereto, changes in market interest rates and the Company’s intent to sell, or whether it is more likely than not it will be required to sell the security before recovery of the security’s cost basis.
As of December 29, 2018, the Company does not consider any of its marketable debt securities to be other-than-temporarily impaired.
The Company holds a non-marketable debt security that is classified and accounted for as held-to-maturity.
As of December 29, 2018, the Company’s non-marketable debt security had an amortized cost basis and carrying value of $1.5 billion.
The Company may use derivatives to partially offset its business exposure to foreign currency and interest rate risk on expected future cash flows, net investments in certain foreign subsidiaries, and certain existing assets and liabilities.
However, the Company may choose not to hedge certain exposures for a variety of reasons including, but not limited to, accounting considerations or the prohibitive economic cost of hedging particular exposures.
There can be no assurance the hedges will offset more than a portion of the financial impact resulting from movements in foreign currency exchange or interest rates.
To protect gross margins from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, certain of the Company’s subsidiaries whose functional currency is the U.S. dollar may hedge a portion of forecasted foreign currency revenue, and subsidiaries whose functional currency is not the U.S. dollar may hedge a portion of forecasted inventory purchases not denominated in the subsidiaries’ functional currencies.
The Company may enter into forward contracts, option contracts or other instruments to manage this risk and may designate these instruments as cash flow hedges.
The Company generally hedges portions of its forecasted foreign currency exposure associated with revenue and inventory purchases, typically for up to 12 months.
To protect the net investment in a foreign operation from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, the Company may enter into foreign currency forward and option contracts to offset a portion of the changes in the carrying amounts of these investments due to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates.
In addition, the Company may use non-derivative financial instruments, such as its foreign currency–denominated debt, as hedges of its net investments in certain foreign subsidiaries.
In both of these cases, the Company designates these instruments as net investment hedges.
To protect the Company’s foreign currency–denominated term debt or marketable securities from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, the Company may enter into forward contracts, cross-currency swaps or other instruments.
These instruments may offset a portion of the foreign currency remeasurement gains or losses, or changes in fair value.
As of December 29, 2018, the Company’s hedged term debt– and marketable securities–related foreign currency transactions are expected to be recognized within 24 years.
The Company may also enter into non-designated foreign currency contracts to offset a portion of the foreign currency exchange gains and losses generated by the remeasurement of certain assets and liabilities denominated in non-functional currencies.
To protect the Company’s foreign currency–denominated term debt or marketable securities from fluctuations in interest rates, the Company may enter into interest rate swaps, options or other instruments.
These instruments may offset a portion of the changes in interest income or expense, or changes in fair value.
As of December 29, 2018, the Company’s hedged interest rate transactions are expected to be recognized within 9 years.
Gains and losses related to changes in fair value hedges are recognized in earnings along with a corresponding loss or gain related to the change in value of the underlying hedged item in the same line in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations.
The notional amounts for outstanding derivative instruments provide one measure of the transaction volume outstanding and do not represent the amount of the Company’s exposure to credit or market loss.
The credit risk amounts represent the Company’s gross exposure to potential accounting loss on derivative instruments that are outstanding or unsettled if all counterparties failed to perform according to the terms of the contract, based on then-current currency or interest rates at each respective date.
Although the table above reflects the notional and credit risk amounts of the Company’s derivative instruments, it does not reflect the gains or losses associated with the exposures and transactions that the instruments are intended to hedge.
The amounts ultimately realized upon settlement of these financial instruments, together with the gains and losses on the underlying exposures, will depend on actual market conditions during the remaining life of the instruments.
To further limit credit risk, the Company generally enters into collateral security arrangements that provide for collateral to be received or posted when the net fair value of certain financial instruments fluctuates from contractually established thresholds.
The Company presents its derivative assets and derivative liabilities at their gross fair values in its Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets.
The net cash collateral posted by the Company related to derivative instruments under its collateral security arrangements was $56 million and $1.0 billion as of December 29, 2018 and September 29, 2018, respectively, which were recorded as other current assets in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets.
As of December 29, 2018 and September 29, 2018, the potential effects of these rights of set-off associated with the Company’s derivative contracts, including the effects of collateral, would be a reduction to both derivative assets and derivative liabilities of $1.9 billion and $2.1 billion, respectively, resulting in a net derivative liability of $260 million and a net derivative asset of $138 million, respectively.
The Company has considerable trade receivables outstanding with its third-party cellular network carriers, wholesalers, retailers, resellers, small and mid-sized businesses and education, enterprise and government customers.
The Company generally does not require collateral from its customers; however, the Company will require collateral or third-party credit support in certain instances to limit credit risk.
In addition, when possible, the Company attempts to limit credit risk on trade receivables with credit insurance for certain customers or by requiring third-party financing, loans or leases to support credit exposure.
These credit-financing arrangements are directly between the third-party financing company and the end customer.
As such, the Company generally does not assume any recourse or credit risk sharing related to any of these arrangements.
As of December 29, 2018, the Company had no customers that individually represented 10% or more of total trade receivables.
As of September 29, 2018, the Company had one customer that represented 10% or more of total trade receivables, which accounted for 10%.
The Company’s cellular network carriers accounted for 45% and 59% of total trade receivables as of December 29, 2018 and September 29, 2018, respectively.
The Company has non-trade receivables from certain of its manufacturing vendors resulting from the sale of components to these vendors who manufacture sub-assemblies or assemble final products for the Company.
The Company purchases these components directly from suppliers.
As of December 29, 2018, the Company had two vendors that individually represented 10% or more of total vendor non-trade receivables, which accounted for 56% and 15%.
As of September 29, 2018, the Company had two vendors that individually represented 10% or more of total vendor non-trade receivables, which accounted for 62% and 12%.
U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act
The Company completed its accounting for the income tax effects of the Act during the first quarter of 2019, in accordance with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission Staff Accounting Bulletin No.
As of December 29, 2018, the total amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits was $14.7 billion, of which $8.2 billion, if recognized, would impact the Company’s effective tax rate.
The Company had accrued $1.2 billion of gross interest and penalties as of December 29, 2018.
Both the unrecognized tax benefits and the associated interest and penalties that are not expected to result in payment or receipt of cash within one year are classified as other non-current liabilities in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet.
On August 30, 2016, the European Commission announced its decision that Ireland granted state aid to the Company by providing tax opinions in 1991 and 2007 concerning the tax allocation of profits of the Irish branches of two subsidiaries of the Company (the “State Aid Decision”).
Irish legislative changes, effective as of January 2015, eliminated the application of the tax opinions from that date forward.
Ireland has also appealed the State Aid Decision.
As of December 29, 2018, the entire recovery amount plus interest was funded into escrow, where it will remain restricted from general use pending conclusion of all appeals.
As of December 29, 2018, the Company had outstanding floating- and fixed-rate notes with varying maturities for an aggregate principal amount of $103.8 billion (collectively the “Notes”).
The Notes are senior unsecured obligations, and interest is payable in arrears, quarterly for the U.S. dollar–denominated and Australian dollar–denominated floating-rate notes, semi-annually for the U.S. dollar–denominated, Australian dollar–denominated, British pound–denominated, Japanese yen–denominated and Canadian dollar–denominated fixed-rate notes and annually for the euro-denominated and Swiss franc–denominated fixed-rate notes.
To manage interest rate risk on certain of its U.S. dollar–denominated fixed- or floating-rate notes, the Company has entered into interest rate swaps to effectively convert the fixed interest rates to floating interest rates or the floating interest rates to fixed interest rates on a portion of these notes.
Additionally, to manage foreign currency risk on certain of its foreign currency–denominated notes, the Company has entered into foreign currency swaps to effectively convert these notes to U.S. dollar–denominated notes.
A portion of the Company’s Japanese yen–denominated notes is designated as a hedge of the foreign currency exposure of the Company’s net investment in a foreign operation.
As of December 29, 2018 and September 29, 2018, the carrying value of the debt designated as a net investment hedge was $1.0 billion and $811 million, respectively.
The Company recognized $809 million and $695 million of interest expense on its term debt for the three months ended December 29, 2018 and December 30, 2017, respectively.
As of December 29, 2018 and September 29, 2018, the fair value of the Company’s Notes, based on Level 2 inputs, was $102.6 billion and $103.2 billion, respectively.
The Company’s OCI consists of foreign currency translation adjustments from those subsidiaries not using the U.S. dollar as their functional currency, net deferred gains and losses on certain derivative instruments accounted for as cash flow hedges and unrealized gains and losses on marketable debt securities classified as available-for-sale.
The Company had 237.9 million shares reserved for future issuance under its stock plans as of December 29, 2018.
Restricted stock units (“RSUs”) granted under the Company’s stock plans generally vest over four years, based on continued employment, and are settled upon vesting in shares of the Company’s common stock on a one-for-one basis.
Each share issued with respect to RSUs granted under the Company’s stock plans reduces the number of shares available for grant under the plans by two shares.
RSUs canceled and shares withheld to satisfy tax withholding obligations increase the number of shares available for grant under the plans utilizing a factor of two times the number of RSUs canceled or shares withheld.
During the three months ended December 29, 2018, Section 16 officers Angela Ahrendts, Timothy D. Cook, Chris Kondo, Luca Maestri and Jeffrey Williams had equity trading plans in place in accordance with Rule 10b5-1(c)(1) under the Exchange Act.
The fair value as of the respective vesting dates of RSUs was $4.1 billion and $3.1 billion for the three months ended December 29, 2018 and December 30, 2017, respectively.
As of December 29, 2018, the total unrecognized compensation cost related to outstanding RSUs and stock options was $14.0 billion, which the Company expects to recognize over a weighted-average period of 2.9 years.
Agreements entered into by the Company may include indemnification provisions, which may subject the Company to costs and damages in the event of a claim against an indemnified third party.
Except as disclosed under the heading “Contingencies” below, in the opinion of management, there was not at least a reasonable possibility the Company may have incurred a material loss, or a material loss in excess of a recorded accrual, with respect to indemnification of third parties.
The iPhone Upgrade Program provides customers the right to trade in that iPhone for a specified amount when purchasing a new iPhone, provided certain conditions are met.
The Company accounts for the trade-in right as a guarantee liability and recognizes arrangement revenue net of the fair value of such right, with subsequent changes to the guarantee liability recognized within net sales.
Under these agreements, the Company has agreed to indemnify such individuals to the fullest extent permitted by law against liabilities that arise by reason of their status as directors or officers of the Company, and to advance expenses incurred by such individuals in connection with related legal proceedings.
It is not possible to determine the maximum potential amount of payments the Company could be required to make under these agreements due to the limited history of prior indemnification claims and the unique facts and circumstances involved in each claim.
While the Company maintains directors and officers liability insurance coverage, such insurance coverage may be insufficient to cover all losses or all types of claims that may arise.
Although most components essential to the Company’s business are generally available from multiple sources, certain components are currently obtained from single or limited sources.
In addition, the Company competes for various components with other participants in the markets for mobile communication and media devices and personal computers.
The Company uses some custom components that are not commonly used by its competitors, and new products introduced by the Company often utilize custom components available from only one source.
The Company’s business and financial performance could also be materially adversely affected depending on the time required to obtain sufficient quantities from the original source, or to identify and obtain sufficient quantities from an alternative source.
Continued availability of these components at acceptable prices, or at all, may be affected if suppliers decide to concentrate on the production of common components instead of components customized to meet the Company’s requirements.
The Company has entered into agreements for the supply of many components; however, there can be no guarantee that the Company will be able to extend or renew these agreements on similar terms, or at all.
Substantially all of the Company’s hardware products are manufactured by outsourcing partners that are located primarily in Asia, with some Mac computers manufactured in the U.S. and Ireland.
Certain of these outsourcing partners are single-sourced suppliers of components and manufacturers for many of the Company’s products.
Although the Company works closely with its outsourcing partners on manufacturing schedules, the Company’s financial condition and operating results could be materially adversely affected if its outsourcing partners were unable to meet their production commitments.
The Company’s manufacturing purchase obligations typically cover its requirements for periods up to 150 days.
The Company does not currently utilize any other off–balance sheet financing arrangements.
As of December 29, 2018, the Company’s total future minimum lease payments under noncancelable operating leases were $9.9 billion.
The Company’s retail store and other facility leases typically have original terms not exceeding 10 years and generally contain multi-year renewal options.
The Company has entered into certain off–balance sheet commitments that require the future purchase of goods or services (“unconditional purchase obligations”).
The Company’s unconditional purchase obligations primarily consist of payments for supplier arrangements, internet and telecommunication services, intellectual property licenses and content creation.
As of December 29, 2018, the Company’s total future payments under noncancelable unconditional purchase obligations having a remaining term in excess of one year were $7.4 billion.
VirnetX, Inc. filed two lawsuits in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Texas (the “Eastern Texas District Court”) against the Company alleging that certain Company products infringe four patents (the “VirnetX Patents”) relating to network communications technology (“VirnetX I” and “VirnetX II”).
On September 30, 2016, a jury returned a verdict in VirnetX I against the Company and awarded damages of $302 million, which later increased to $440 million in post-trial proceedings.
The Company appealed the VirnetX I verdict to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit (the “Federal Circuit”).
On April 11, 2018, a jury returned a verdict in VirnetX II against the Company and awarded damages of $503 million.
In response, the PTO has declared the VirnetX Patents invalid.
On January 15, 2019, the Federal Circuit affirmed the VirnetX I verdict, which the Company intends to further appeal.
In one matter pending in China, on November 30, 2018, a court issued an order enjoining the sale in China of certain iPhone models running iOS 10 or iOS 11.
The Company has sought reconsideration and a declaration of compliance with the order and has appealed the decision.
In another matter pending in Germany, on December 20, 2018, a court issued an order enjoining the sale in Germany by the Company and certain of its subsidiaries of iPhone 7, 7 Plus, 8, 8 Plus and X.
Various civil litigation matters have been filed in state and federal courts in the U.S. and in various international jurisdictions alleging violation of consumer protection laws, fraud, computer intrusion and other causes of action related to the Company’s performance management feature used in its iPhone operating systems, introduced to certain iPhones in iOS updates 10.2.1 and 11.2.
The claims seek monetary damages and other non-monetary relief.
On April 5, 2018, several U.S. federal actions were consolidated through a Multidistrict Litigation process into a single action in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California.
The Company believes that its iPhones were not defective, that the performance management feature introduced with iOS updates 10.2.1 and 11.2 was intended to, and did, improve customers’ user experience, and that the Company did not make any misleading statements or fail to disclose any material information.
The Company has accrued its best estimate for the ultimate resolution of these matters.
The Company reports segment information based on the “management” approach.
The management approach designates the internal reporting used by management for making decisions and assessing performance as the source of the Company’s reportable segments.
The Company’s reportable segments consist of the Americas, Europe, Greater China, Japan and Rest of Asia Pacific.
Greater China includes China, Hong Kong and Taiwan.
Rest of Asia Pacific includes Australia and those Asian countries not included in the Company’s other reportable segments.
Although the reportable segments provide similar hardware and software products and similar services, each one is managed separately to better align with the location of the Company’s customers and distribution partners and the unique market dynamics of each geographic region.
The accounting policies of the various segments are the same as those described in Note 1, “Summary of Significant Accounting Policies” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of the 2018 Form 10-K.
The Company evaluates the performance of its reportable segments based on net sales and operating income.
Net sales for geographic segments are generally based on the location of customers and sales through the Company’s retail stores located in those geographic locations.
Operating income for each segment includes net sales to third parties, related cost of sales and operating expenses directly attributable to the segment.
Advertising expenses are generally included in the geographic segment in which the expenditures are incurred.
The Company is subject to legal proceedings and claims that have not been fully resolved and that have arisen in the ordinary course of business.
Except as described in Part I, Item 1 of this Form 10-Q in the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements in Note 10, “Commitments and Contingencies” under the heading “Contingencies,” in the opinion of management, there was not at least a reasonable possibility the Company may have incurred a material loss, or a material loss in excess of a recorded accrual, with respect to loss contingencies for asserted legal and other claims.
The outcome of litigation is inherently uncertain.
The Company has international operations with sales outside the U.S. representing a majority of the Company’s total net sales.
Potential effects include financial instability; inability to obtain credit to finance operations and purchases of the Company’s products; and insolvency.
A downturn in the economic environment could also lead to increased credit and collectibility risk on the Company’s trade receivables; the failure of derivative counterparties and other financial institutions; limitations on the Company’s ability to issue new debt; reduced liquidity; and declines in the fair value of the Company’s financial instruments.
Global markets for the Company’s products and services are highly competitive and subject to rapid technological change, and the Company may be unable to compete effectively in these markets.
The Company currently holds a significant number of patents, trademarks and copyrights and has registered, and applied to register, numerous patents, trademarks and copyrights.
In contrast, many of the Company’s competitors seek to compete primarily through aggressive pricing and very low cost structures, and emulating the Company’s products and infringing on its intellectual property.
The Company has a minority market share in the global smartphone, tablet and personal computer markets.
The Company faces substantial competition in these markets from companies that have significant technical, marketing, distribution and other resources, as well as established hardware, software and digital content supplier relationships.
Certain competitors may have the resources, experience or cost structures to provide products at little or no profit or even at a loss.
The Company also expects competition to intensify as competitors attempt to imitate the Company’s approach to providing components seamlessly within their individual offerings or work collaboratively to offer integrated solutions.
In addition, an increasing number of internet-enabled devices that include software applications and are smaller, simpler and cheaper than traditional personal computers compete with some of the Company’s existing products.
The Company’s services also face substantial competition, including from companies that have significant resources and experience and have established service offerings with large customer bases.
The Company competes with business models that provide content to users for free.
The Company also competes with illegitimate means to obtain third-party digital content and applications.
The Company’s financial condition and operating results depend substantially on the Company’s ability to continually improve its products and services in order to maintain their functional and design advantages.
There can be no assurance the Company will be able to continue to provide products and services that compete effectively.
To remain competitive and stimulate customer demand, the Company must successfully manage frequent introductions and transitions of products and services.
Due to the highly volatile and competitive nature of the industries in which the Company competes, the Company must continually introduce new products, services and technologies, enhance existing products and services, effectively stimulate customer demand for new and upgraded products and services and successfully manage the transition to these new and upgraded products and services.
Accordingly, the Company cannot determine in advance the ultimate effect of new product and service introductions and transitions.
The Company depends on the performance of carriers, wholesalers, retailers and other resellers.
The Company distributes its products through cellular network carriers, wholesalers, retailers and resellers, many of whom distribute products from competing manufacturers.
The Company also sells its products and third-party products in most of its major markets directly to education, enterprise and government customers and consumers and small and mid-sized businesses through its retail and online stores.
There is no assurance that such offers will be continued at all or in the same amounts upon renewal of the Company’s agreements with these carriers or in agreements the Company enters into with new carriers.
The Company has invested and will continue to invest in programs to enhance reseller sales, including staffing selected resellers’ stores with Company employees and contractors, and improving product placement displays.
These programs could require a substantial investment while providing no assurance of return or incremental sales.
The financial condition of these resellers could weaken, these resellers could stop distributing the Company’s products, or uncertainty regarding demand for some or all of the Company’s products could cause resellers to reduce their ordering and marketing of the Company’s products.
The Company faces substantial inventory and other asset risk in addition to purchase commitment cancellation risk.
The Company records a write-down for product and component inventories that have become obsolete or exceed anticipated demand, or for which cost exceeds net realizable value.
The Company also accrues necessary cancellation fee reserves for orders of excess products and components.
The Company reviews long-lived assets, including capital assets held at its suppliers’ facilities and inventory prepayments, for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate the assets may not be recoverable.
If the Company determines that an impairment has occurred, it records a write-down equal to the amount by which the carrying value of the asset exceeds its fair value.
Although the Company believes its inventory, capital assets, inventory prepayments and other assets and purchase commitments are currently recoverable, no assurance can be given that the Company will not incur write-downs, fees, impairments and other charges given the rapid and unpredictable pace of product obsolescence in the industries in which the Company competes.
The Company orders components for its products and builds inventory in advance of product announcements and shipments.
Manufacturing purchase obligations cover the Company’s forecasted component and manufacturing requirements, typically for periods up to 150 days.
Future operating results depend upon the Company’s ability to obtain components in sufficient quantities on commercially reasonable terms.
Because the Company currently obtains certain components from single or limited sources, the Company is subject to significant supply and pricing risks.
While the Company has entered into agreements for the supply of many components, there can be no assurance that the Company will be able to extend or renew these agreements on similar terms, or at all.
Component suppliers may suffer from poor financial conditions, which can lead to business failure for the supplier or consolidation within a particular industry, further limiting the Company’s ability to obtain sufficient quantities of components on commercially reasonable terms.
The Company’s new products often utilize custom components available from only one source.
Continued availability of these components at acceptable prices, or at all, may be affected for any number of reasons, including if suppliers decide to concentrate on the production of common components instead of components customized to meet the Company’s requirements.
The Company’s business and financial performance could also be materially adversely affected depending on the time required to obtain sufficient quantities from the original source, or to identify and obtain sufficient quantities from an alternative source.
The Company depends on component and product manufacturing and logistical services provided by outsourcing partners, many of which are located outside of the U.S.
The Company has also outsourced much of its transportation and logistics management.
While these arrangements may lower operating costs, they also reduce the Company’s direct control over production and distribution.
Such diminished control may have an adverse effect on the quality or quantity of products or services, or the Company’s flexibility to respond to changing conditions.
Although arrangements with these partners may contain provisions for warranty expense reimbursement, the Company may remain responsible to the consumer for warranty service in the event of product defects and could experience an unanticipated product defect or warranty liability.
While the Company relies on its partners to adhere to its supplier code of conduct, material violations of the supplier code of conduct could occur.
The Company relies on single-sourced outsourcing partners in the U.S., Asia and Europe to supply and manufacture many components, and on outsourcing partners primarily located in Asia, for final assembly of substantially all of the Company’s hardware products.
Any failure of these partners to perform may have a negative impact on the Company’s cost or supply of components or finished goods.
In addition, manufacturing or logistics in these locations or transit to final destinations may be disrupted for a variety of reasons including, but not limited to, natural and man-made disasters, information technology system failures, commercial disputes, military actions, economic, business, labor, environmental, public health or political issues, or international trade disputes.
The Company has invested in manufacturing process equipment, much of which is held at certain of its outsourcing partners, and has made prepayments to certain of its suppliers associated with long-term supply agreements.
The Company relies on access to third-party digital content, which may not be available to the Company on commercially reasonable terms or at all.
The Company contracts with numerous third parties to offer their digital content to customers.
This includes the right to sell currently available music, movies, TV shows and books.
The licensing or other distribution arrangements with these third parties are for relatively short terms and do not guarantee the continuation or renewal of these arrangements on reasonable terms, if at all.
Other content owners, providers or distributors may seek to limit the Company’s access to, or increase the cost of, such content.
The Company may be unable to continue to offer a wide variety of content at reasonable prices with acceptable usage rules, or continue to expand its geographic reach.
Some third-party digital content providers require the Company to provide digital rights management and other security solutions.
The Company’s future performance depends in part on support from third-party software developers.
The Company believes decisions by customers to purchase its hardware products depend in part on the availability of third-party software applications and services.
There is no assurance that third-party developers will continue to develop and maintain software applications and services for the Company’s products.
If third-party software applications and services cease to be developed and maintained for the Company’s products, customers may choose not to buy the Company’s products.
The Company believes the availability of third-party software applications and services for its products depends in part on the developers’ perception and analysis of the relative benefits of developing, maintaining and upgrading such software and services for the Company’s products compared to competitors’ platforms, such as Android for smartphones and tablets and Windows for personal computers.
The Company’s minority market share in the global smartphone, tablet and personal computer markets could make developers less inclined to develop or upgrade software for the Company’s products and more inclined to devote their resources to developing and upgrading software for competitors’ products with larger market share.
If developers focus their efforts on these competing platforms, the availability and quality of applications for the Company’s devices may suffer.
The Company relies on the continued availability and development of compelling and innovative software applications for its products.
Based on past experience and industry practice, the Company believes such licenses generally can be obtained on reasonable terms.
In addition, agreements entered into by the Company sometimes include indemnification provisions which may subject the Company to costs and damages in the event of a claim against an indemnified third party.
The plaintiffs in these actions frequently seek injunctions and substantial damages.
In recognition of these considerations, the Company may enter into licensing agreements or other arrangements to settle litigation and resolve such disputes.
No assurance can be given that such agreements can be obtained on acceptable terms or that litigation will not occur.
Except as described in Part I, Item 1 of this Form 10-Q in the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements in Note 10, “Commitments and Contingencies” under the heading “Contingencies,” in the opinion of management, there was not at least a reasonable possibility the Company may have incurred a material loss, or a material loss in excess of a recorded accrual, with respect to loss contingencies for asserted legal and other claims, including matters related to infringement of intellectual property rights.
The outcome of litigation is inherently uncertain.
While the Company maintains insurance coverage for certain types of claims, such insurance coverage may be insufficient to cover all losses or all types of claims that may arise.
The Company is subject to laws and regulations worldwide, changes to which could increase the Company’s costs and individually or in the aggregate adversely affect the Company’s business.
These U.S. and foreign laws and regulations affect the Company’s activities in areas including, but not limited to, labor, advertising, digital content, consumer protection, real estate, billing, e-commerce, promotions, quality of services, telecommunications, mobile communications and media, television, intellectual property ownership and infringement, tax, import and export requirements, anti-corruption, foreign exchange controls and cash repatriation restrictions, data privacy and data localization requirements, anti-competition, environmental, health and safety.
By way of example, laws and regulations related to mobile communications and media devices in the many jurisdictions in which the Company operates are extensive and subject to change.
Such changes could include, among others, restrictions on the production, manufacture, distribution and use of devices, locking devices to a carrier’s network, or mandating the use of devices on more than one carrier’s network.
These devices are also subject to certification and regulation by governmental and standardization bodies, as well as by cellular network carriers for use on their networks.
Compliance with these laws, regulations and similar requirements may be onerous and expensive, and they may be inconsistent from jurisdiction to jurisdiction, further increasing the cost of compliance and doing business.
The Company has implemented policies and procedures designed to ensure compliance with applicable laws and regulations, but there can be no assurance that the Company’s employees, contractors, or agents will not violate such laws and regulations or the Company’s policies and procedures.
The Company’s business is subject to the risks of international operations.
The Company derives a majority of its net sales and earnings from its international operations.
Compliance with applicable U.S. and foreign laws and regulations, such as import and export requirements, anti-corruption laws, tax laws, foreign exchange controls and cash repatriation restrictions, data privacy and data localization requirements, environmental laws, labor laws and anti-competition regulations, increases the costs of doing business in foreign jurisdictions.
Although the Company has implemented policies and procedures to comply with these laws and regulations, a violation by the Company’s employees, contractors or agents could nevertheless occur.
In some cases, compliance with the laws and regulations of one country could violate the laws and regulations of another country.
Violations of these laws and regulations could materially adversely affect the Company’s brand, international growth efforts and business.
The Company also could be significantly affected by other risks associated with international activities including, but not limited to, economic and labor conditions, increased duties, taxes and other costs, political instability and international trade disputes.
The Company is also exposed to credit and collectibility risk on its trade receivables with customers in certain international markets.
There can be no assurance the Company can effectively limit its credit risk and avoid losses.
The Company also has entered into substantial operating lease commitments for retail space.
Certain stores have been designed and built to serve as high-profile venues to promote brand awareness.
Because of their unique design elements, locations and size, these stores require substantially more investment than the Company’s more typical retail stores.
Other factors include, but are not limited to, the Company’s ability to manage costs associated with retail store construction and operation; manage relationships with existing retail partners; manage costs associated with fluctuations in the value of retail inventory; and obtain and renew leases in quality retail locations at a reasonable cost.
These new ventures are inherently risky and may not be successful.
The Company’s business and reputation may be impacted by information technology system failures or network disruptions.
The Company may be subject to information technology system failures or network disruptions caused by natural disasters, accidents, power disruptions, telecommunications failures, acts of terrorism or war, computer viruses, physical or electronic break-ins, or other events or disruptions.
The Company’s business requires it to use and store confidential information including, among other things, personally identifiable information (“PII”) with respect to the Company’s customers and employees.
The Company devotes significant resources to network and data security, including through the use of encryption and other security measures intended to protect its systems and data.
The Company’s business also requires it to share confidential information with suppliers and other third parties.
For example, the Company may experience a security breach impacting the Company’s information technology systems that compromises the confidentiality, integrity or availability of confidential information.
Although malicious attacks perpetrated to gain access to confidential information, including PII, affect many companies across various industries, the Company is at a relatively greater risk of being targeted because of its high profile and the value of the confidential information it creates, owns, manages, stores and processes.
The Company has implemented systems and processes intended to secure its information technology systems and prevent unauthorized access to or loss of sensitive data, including through the use of encryption and authentication technologies.
As with all companies, these security measures may not be sufficient for all eventualities and may be vulnerable to hacking, employee error, malfeasance, system error, faulty password management or other irregularities.
For example, third parties attempt to fraudulently induce employees or customers into disclosing user names, passwords or other sensitive information, which may in turn be used to access the Company’s information technology systems.
To help protect customers and the Company, the Company monitors its services and systems for unusual activity and may freeze accounts under suspicious circumstances, which, among other things, may result in the delay or loss of customer orders or impede customer access to the Company’s products and services.
In addition to the risks relating to general confidential information described above, the Company may also be subject to specific obligations relating to health data and payment card data.
Health data may be subject to additional privacy, security and breach notification requirements, and the Company may be subject to audit by governmental authorities regarding the Company’s compliance with these obligations.
If the Company fails to adequately comply with these rules and requirements, or if health data is handled in a manner not permitted by law or under the Company’s agreements with healthcare institutions, the Company could be subject to litigation or government investigations, may be liable for associated investigatory expenses, and could also incur significant fees or fines.
Under payment card rules and obligations, if cardholder information is potentially compromised, the Company could be liable for associated investigatory expenses and could also incur significant fees or fines if the Company fails to follow payment card industry data security standards.
While the Company maintains insurance coverage that is intended to address certain aspects of data security risks, such insurance coverage may be insufficient to cover all losses or all types of claims that may arise.
The Company’s business is subject to a variety of U.S. and international laws, rules, policies and other obligations regarding data protection.
The Company is subject to federal, state and international laws relating to the collection, use, retention, security and transfer of PII.
In many cases, these laws apply not only to third-party transactions, but also may restrict transfers of PII among the Company and its international subsidiaries.
Several jurisdictions have passed laws in this area, and other jurisdictions are considering imposing additional restrictions.
These laws continue to develop and may be inconsistent from jurisdiction to jurisdiction.
Complying with emerging and changing international requirements may cause the Company to incur substantial costs or require the Company to change its business practices.
Noncompliance could result in significant penalties or legal liability.
The Company makes statements about its use and disclosure of PII through its privacy policy, information provided on its website and press statements.
Any failure by the Company to comply with these public statements or with other federal, state or international privacy-related or data protection laws and regulations could result in proceedings against the Company by governmental entities or others.
In addition to reputational impacts, penalties could include ongoing audit requirements and significant legal liability.
The Company’s success depends largely on the continued service and availability of key personnel.
Much of the Company’s future success depends on the continued availability and service of key personnel, including its Chief Executive Officer, executive team and other highly skilled employees.
Experienced personnel in the technology industry are in high demand and competition for their talents is intense, especially in Silicon Valley, where most of the Company’s key personnel are located.
The Company’s business may be impacted by political events, international trade disputes, war, terrorism, natural disasters, public health issues, industrial accidents and other business interruptions.
Political events, international trade disputes, war, terrorism, natural disasters, public health issues, industrial accidents and other business interruptions could harm or disrupt international commerce and the global economy, and could have a material adverse effect on the Company and its customers, suppliers, contract manufacturers, logistics providers, distributors, cellular network carriers and other channel partners.
International trade disputes could result in tariffs and other protectionist measures that could adversely affect the Company’s business.
Tariffs could increase the cost of the Company’s products and the components and raw materials that go into making them.
Many of the Company’s operations and facilities as well as critical business operations of the Company’s suppliers and contract manufacturers are in locations that are prone to earthquakes and other natural disasters.
In addition, such operations and facilities are subject to the risk of interruption by fire, power shortages, nuclear power plant accidents and other industrial accidents, terrorist attacks and other hostile acts, labor disputes, public health issues and other events beyond the Company’s control.
Global climate change could result in certain types of natural disasters occurring more frequently or with more intense effects.
Such events could make it difficult or impossible for the Company to manufacture and deliver products to its customers, create delays and inefficiencies in the Company’s supply and manufacturing chain, and result in slowdowns and outages to the Company’s service offerings.
Following an interruption to its business, the Company could require substantial recovery time, experience significant expenditures in order to resume operations, and lose significant sales.
Because the Company relies on single or limited sources for the supply and manufacture of many critical components, a business interruption affecting such sources would exacerbate any negative consequences to the Company.
The Company’s operations are also subject to the risks of industrial accidents at its suppliers and contract manufacturers.
While the Company’s suppliers are required to maintain safe working environments and operations, an industrial accident could occur and could result in disruption to the Company’s business and harm to the Company’s reputation.
Should major public health issues, including pandemics, arise, the Company could be adversely affected by more stringent employee travel restrictions, additional limitations in freight services, governmental actions limiting the movement of products between regions, delays in production ramps of new products and disruptions in the operations of the Company’s suppliers and contract manufacturers.
The Company’s profit margins vary across its products, services, geographic segments and distribution channels.
Price volatility over a given period may cause the average price at which the Company repurchases its own stock to exceed the stock’s price at a given point in time.
Future dividends are subject to declaration by the Company’s Board of Directors, and the Company’s share repurchase program does not obligate it to acquire any specific number of shares.
The Company’s financial performance is subject to risks associated with changes in the value of the U.S. dollar relative to local currencies.
The Company’s primary exposure to movements in foreign currency exchange rates relates to non–U.S.
The Company uses derivative instruments, such as foreign currency forward and option contracts, to hedge certain exposures to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates.
The use of such hedging activities may not be effective to offset any, or more than a portion, of the adverse financial effects of unfavorable movements in foreign exchange rates over the limited time the hedges are in place.
The Company is exposed to credit risk and fluctuations in the values of its investment portfolio.
As a result, the value and liquidity of the Company’s cash, cash equivalents, and marketable and non-marketable securities may fluctuate substantially.
The Company is exposed to credit risk on its trade accounts receivable, vendor non-trade receivables and prepayments related to long-term supply agreements, and this risk is heightened during periods when economic conditions worsen.
The Company also sells its products directly to small and mid-sized businesses and education, enterprise and government customers.
A substantial majority of the Company’s outstanding trade receivables are not covered by collateral, third-party bank support or financing arrangements, or credit insurance.
The Company also has unsecured vendor non-trade receivables resulting from purchases of components by outsourcing partners and other vendors that manufacture sub-assemblies or assemble final products for the Company.
In addition, the Company has made prepayments associated with long-term supply agreements to secure supply of inventory components.
As of December 29, 2018, a significant portion of the Company’s trade receivables was concentrated within cellular network carriers, and its vendor non-trade receivables and prepayments related to long-term supply agreements were concentrated among a few individual vendors located primarily in Asia.
While the Company has procedures to monitor and limit exposure to credit risk on its trade and vendor non-trade receivables, as well as long-term prepayments, there can be no assurance such procedures will effectively limit its credit risk and avoid losses.
The Company regularly assesses the likelihood of an adverse outcome resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of its provision for taxes.
There can be no assurance as to the outcome of these examinations.
