The third performance obligation is the right to receive, on a when-and-if-available basis, future unspecified software upgrades relating to the software bundled with each device.
The Company allocates revenue and any related discounts to these performance obligations based on their relative stand-alone selling prices (“SSP”).

The Company’s process for determining estimated SSPs involves management’s judgment and considers multiple factors that may vary over time depending upon the unique facts and circumstances related to each deliverable.
Factors subject to change include the nature of the unspecified software upgrade rights and product-related bundled services offered, their estimated value and the estimated period they are expected to be provided.
The Company’s investments in marketable debt securities are classified as available-for-sale and reported at fair value.
