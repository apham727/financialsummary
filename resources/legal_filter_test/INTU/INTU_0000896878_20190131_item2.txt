Please see the section entitled “Forward-Looking Statements” immediately preceding Part 1 for important information to consider when evaluating such statements.
We adopted the new accounting standards for revenue recognition effective August 1, 2018.
Beginning with the first quarter of our fiscal 2019, our financial results reflect the adoption of the standards with the prior periods restated accordingly.
See Note 1 to the financial statements in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report for more information.
This summary is not intended to be exhaustive, nor is it a substitute for the detailed discussion and analysis provided elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.
The rapid expansion of cloud-based services is creating a more dynamic and highly competitive software industry.
High availability and speed of service are reshaping customer expectations around the world.
These shifts are accelerating product introductions and enhancements.
Among cloud-based service companies, free business models and micro-job solutions are also becoming more prevalent within the industry.
This seasonal pattern results in higher net revenues during our second and third quarters ending January 31 and April 30, respectively.
As we offer more online services, the ongoing operation and availability of our platforms and systems and those of our external service providers is becoming increasingly important.
Because we help customers manage their financial lives, we face risks associated with the hosting, collection, use, and retention of personal customer information and data.
We are investing significant management attention and resources in our information technology infrastructure and in our privacy and security capabilities, and we expect to continue to do so in the future.
We continue to invest in security measures and to work with the broader industry and government to protect our customers against this type of fraud.
These non-financial drivers include, for example, customer growth and retention for all of our businesses.
Online service offerings are a significant part of our business.
Below, we have updated our revenue recognition critical accounting policy for the adoption of the new revenue recognition standard.
Senior management has reviewed the development and selection of our critical accounting policies and estimates and their disclosure in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q with the Audit and Risk Committee of our Board of Directors.
We derive revenue from the sale of packaged software products, software subscriptions, hosted services, payroll services, merchant payment processing services, financial supplies and hardware.
Our contracts with customers often include promises to transfer multiple products and services to a customer.
In determining how revenue should be recognized, a five-step process is used, which requires judgment and estimates within the revenue recognition process.
These judgments and estimates include (1) identifying performance obligations in the contract; (2) determining whether the performance obligations are distinct; (3) determining the standalone sales price (SSP) for each distinct performance obligation; (4) determining the timing of revenue recognition for distinct performance obligations; and (5) estimating the amount of variable consideration to include in the transaction price.
For additional information, see “Revenue Recognition” in Note 1 to the financial statements in Part 1, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report.

During the first six months of fiscal 2019, we recognized excess tax benefits on share-based compensation of $49 million as compared to $33 million during the first six months of fiscal 2018.
The increase in excess tax benefits on share-based compensation was primarily due to our increased stock price during the period.

For the three and six months ended January 31, 2019, we recognized excess tax benefits on share-based compensation of $8 million and $49 million, respectively, in our provision for income taxes.
For the three and six months ended January 31, 2018, we recognized excess tax benefits on share-based compensation of $8 million and $33 million, respectively, in our provision for income taxes.
Our effective tax rate for the three months ended January 31, 2019 was approximately 20%.
For the six months ended January 31, 2019 we recorded a tax benefit of $2 million on pretax income of $221 million.

At January 31, 2019, our cash, cash equivalents and investments totaled $1.3 billion, a decrease of $383 million from July 31, 2018 due to the factors discussed under “Statements of Cash Flows” below.
Our primary sources of liquidity have been cash from operations, which entails the collection of accounts receivable for products and services, and borrowings under our credit facility.
Our primary uses of cash have been for research and development programs, selling and marketing activities, capital projects, acquisitions of businesses, debt service costs and debt repayment, repurchases of our common stock under our stock repurchase programs, and the payment of cash dividends.
As discussed in “Executive Overview – Industry Trends and Seasonality” earlier in this Item 2, our business is subject to significant seasonality.
The balance of our cash, cash equivalents, and investments generally fluctuates with that seasonal pattern.
Our cash, cash equivalents, and investments totaled $1.3 billion at January 31, 2019.
None of those funds were restricted and approximately 83% of those funds were located in the U.S. Our unsecured revolving credit facility is available to us for general corporate purposes, including future acquisitions and stock repurchases.
Our strong liquidity profile enables us to respond nimbly to these types of opportunities.
Based on past performance and current expectations, we believe that our cash and cash equivalents, investments, and cash generated from operations will be sufficient to meet anticipated seasonal working capital needs, capital expenditure requirements, contractual obligations, commitments, debt service requirements, and other liquidity requirements associated with our operations for at least the next 12 months.
We expect to return excess cash generated by operations to our stockholders through repurchases of our common stock and payment of cash dividends, after taking into account our operating and strategic cash needs.
As described in Note 7 to the financial statements in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report, during the first six months of fiscal 2019 we continued to repurchase shares of our common stock under repurchase programs that our Board of Directors has authorized.
At January 31, 2019, we had authorization from our Board of Directors to expend up to an additional $3.0 billion for stock repurchases.
During the six months ended January 31, 2019 we declared quarterly cash dividends that totaled $0.94 per share of outstanding common stock for a total of $250 million.
In February 2019 our Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.47 per share of outstanding common stock payable on April 18, 2019 to stockholders of record at the close of business on April 10, 2019.
On February 1, 2016 we entered into a master credit agreement with certain institutional lenders for a five-year credit facility in an aggregate principal amount of $1.5 billion.
Under the master credit agreement we may, subject to certain customary conditions, on one or more occasions increase commitments under the revolving credit facility in an amount not to exceed $250 million in the aggregate and may extend the maturity date up to two times.
Advances under the revolving credit facility accrue interest at rates that are equal to, at our election, either Bank of America's alternate base rate plus a margin that ranges from 0.0% to 0.5% or the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) plus a margin that ranges from 0.9% to 1.5%.
Actual margins under either election will be based on our senior debt credit ratings.
We monitor counterparty risk associated with the institutional lenders that are providing the credit facility.
We currently believe that the credit facility will be available to us should we choose to borrow under it.
We may, subject to certain customary conditions, on one or more occasions increase commitments under the term loan in an amount not to exceed $500 million in the aggregate.
The term loan accrues interest at rates that are equal to, at our election, either Bank of America's alternate base rate plus a margin that ranges from 0.125% to 0.875% or LIBOR plus a margin that ranges from 1.125% to 1.875%.
Actual margins under either election will be based on our senior debt credit ratings.
We remained in compliance with these covenants at all times during the quarter ended January 31, 2019.
In February 2019, a subsidiary of Intuit entered into a $300 million secured revolving credit facility with a lender.
The revolving credit facility is secured by cash and receivables of the subsidiary and is non-recourse to Intuit Inc. Advances under this revolving credit facility will be used to fund a portion of our loans to qualified small businesses.
We are subject to a minimum of 20% being drawn against the revolving credit facility and any unused portions of the credit facility accrue interest at a rate of 0.50%.
Our cash, cash equivalents, and investments totaled $1.3 billion at January 31, 2019.
These foreign funds were located primarily in Canada and India.
We presented our contractual obligations at July 31, 2018 in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year then ended.
There were no significant changes to our contractual obligations during the first six months of fiscal 2019.
