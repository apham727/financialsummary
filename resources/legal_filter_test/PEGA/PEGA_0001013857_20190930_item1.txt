Pegasystems Inc. (together with its subsidiaries, “the Company”) has prepared the accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements pursuant to the rules and regulations of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) regarding interim financial reporting.
Results for reporting periods beginning on or after January 1, 2019 are presented under ASC 842, while prior period amounts were not adjusted and continue to be reported in accordance with the Company’s historical accounting under ASC 840 “Leases”.
See Note 9.
2016-13, “Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments,” which requires measurement and recognition of expected credit losses for financial assets measured at amortized cost, including accounts receivable, upon initial recognition of that financial asset using a forward-looking expected loss model, rather than an incurred loss model.
Credit losses relating to available-for-sale debt securities should be recorded through an allowance for credit losses when the fair value is below the amortized cost of the asset, removing the concept of “other-than-temporary” impairments.
The effective date for the Company will be January 1, 2020, with early adoption permitted.
As of September 30, 2019, maturities of marketable securities ranged from May 2020 to August 2022, with a weighted-average remaining maturity of approximately 1.5 years.
Unbilled receivables are client committed amounts for which revenue recognition precedes billing, and billing is solely subject to the passage of time.
Contract assets are client committed amounts for which revenue recognized exceeds the amount billed to the client and the right to payment is subject to conditions other than the passage of time, such as the completion of a related performance obligation.
Contract assets and deferred revenue are netted at the contract level for each reporting period.
The change in deferred revenue in the nine months ended September 30, 2019 was primarily due to revenue recognized during the period that was included in deferred revenue at December 31, 2018, partially offset by new billings in advance of revenue recognition.
The Company recognizes an asset for the incremental costs of obtaining a client contract, which relate to sales commissions.
The Company expects to benefit from those costs for more than one year, as the Company generally only pays sales commissions on the initial contract and not any subsequent contract renewals.
As a result, there are no commensurate commissions paid on contract renewals.
Deferred costs are amortized on a straight-line basis over the benefit period, which is on average 5 years.
The Company records its cash equivalents, marketable securities, and investments in privately-held companies at fair value on a recurring basis.
•Level 3 - significant unobservable inputs on which there is little or no market data, which require the Company to develop its own assumptions.
The Company’s investments in privately-held companies are classified within Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy.
If applicable, the Company will recognize transfers into and out of levels within the fair value hierarchy at the end of the reporting period in which the actual event or change in circumstance occurs.
There were no transfers between levels during the nine months ended September 30, 2019.
For certain other financial instruments, including accounts receivable and accounts payable, the carrying value approximates fair value due to the relatively short maturity of these items.
The Company’s leases are primarily for office space used in the ordinary course of business.
All the Company’s leases are operating leases.
The Company accounts for a contract as a lease when it has the right to control the asset for a period of time while obtaining substantially all of the asset’s economic benefits.
The Company determines the initial classification and measurement of its operating right of use assets and lease liabilities at the lease commencement date and thereafter if modified.
Fixed lease costs are recognized on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease.
Variable lease costs are recognized in the period in which the obligation for those payments is incurred.
The Company combines lease and non-lease components in the determination of lease costs for its office space leases.
reasonably certain it will exercise those options.
As of September 30, 2019, the Company had $95.6 million of unrecognized stock-based compensation expense, net of estimated forfeitures, which is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 2.2 years.
During the nine months ended September 30, 2019, the Company issued 1.1 million shares of common stock under the Company’s stock-based compensation plans.
During the nine months ended September 30, 2019, the Company’s effective income tax rate decreased primarily due to the Global Intangible Low-Taxed Income (“GILTI”) provision of the Tax Reform Act.
Basic earnings per share is computed using the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during the applicable period.
Diluted earnings per share is computed using the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during the applicable period, plus the dilutive effect of outstanding stock options and RSUs, using the treasury stock method.
In periods of loss, all stock options and RSUs are excluded, as their inclusion would be anti-dilutive.
The Company may use borrowings to finance working capital needs and for general corporate purposes.
Subject to specific circumstances, the Credit Agreement allows the Company to increase the aggregate commitment up to $200 million.
The Credit Agreement contains customary covenants, including, but not limited to, those relating to additional indebtedness, liens, asset divestures and affiliate transactions.
The Company is also required to comply with financial covenants that consist of a maximum net consolidated leverage ratio of 3.5 (with a step-up in the event of certain acquisitions) and a minimum consolidated interest coverage ratio of 3.5.
