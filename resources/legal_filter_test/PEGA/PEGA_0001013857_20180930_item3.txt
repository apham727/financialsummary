See Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk and Item 1A. Risk FactorsWe are exposed to fluctuations in currency exchange rates that could negatively impact our financial results and cash flows included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2017 for a more complete discussion of our market risk exposure.  
Our international sales are usually denominated in foreign currencies. However, the operating expenses of our foreign operations are also primarily denominated in foreign currencies, which partially offset our foreign currency exposure.  
We are primarily exposed to changes in foreign currency exchange rates associated with Australian dollar, Euro, and U.S. dollar denominated cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, unbilled receivables, and intercompany receivables and payables held by our U.K. subsidiary, a British pound functional entity.  
A hypothetical 10% strengthening in the British pound exchange rate in comparison to the Australian dollar, Euro, and U.S. dollar would result in an incremental foreign currency transaction loss of $8 million and $6 million, at September 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017.
