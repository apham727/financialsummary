Our market risk exposure is primarily related to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates.
Other than the item discussed below, there were no significant changes to our market risk exposure during the first six months ended June 30, 2018.
See Item 7A.
Our international sales are usually denominated in foreign currencies.
However, the operating expenses of our foreign operations are also primarily denominated in foreign currencies, which partially offset our foreign currency exposure.
We are primarily exposed to changes in foreign currency exchange rates associated with Australian dollar, Euro, and U.S. dollar denominated cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, unbilled receivables, and intercompany receivables and payables held by our U.K. subsidiary, a British pound functional entity.
