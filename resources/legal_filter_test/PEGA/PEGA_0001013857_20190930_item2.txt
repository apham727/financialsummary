This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q contains or incorporates forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.
We develop, market, license, and support enterprise software applications that help organizations transform the way they engage with their customers and process and complete work across their enterprise.
We also license our no-code Pega Platform™ for rapid application development to clients that wish to build and extend their business applications.
Our cloud-architected portfolio of customer engagement and digital process automation applications leverages artificial intelligence (“AI”), case management, and robotic automation technology, built on our unified no-code Pega Platform, empowering businesses to quickly design, extend, and scale their enterprise applications to meet strategic business needs.
Our target clients are Global 3000 organizations and government agencies that require applications to differentiate themselves in the markets they serve.
Our applications achieve and facilitate differentiation by increasing business agility, driving growth, improving productivity, attracting and retaining customers, and reducing risk.
We deliver applications tailored to our clients’ specific industry needs.
The change in ACV measures the growth and predictability of future cash flows from Pega Cloud and Client Cloud committed arrangements as of the end of the particular reporting period.
•“Critical Accounting Estimates and Significant Judgments” in Item 7.
“Financial Statements and Supplementary Data”.
There have been no significant changes to our critical accounting policies as disclosed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018.
Our license revenue is derived from sales of our applications and Pega Platform.
Our cloud revenue is derived from our hosted Pega Platform and software applications.
Revenue from cloud arrangements is generally recognized over the service period, while revenue from term and perpetual license arrangements is generally recognized upfront when the license rights become effective.
The increases in cloud revenue in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2019 reflect the shift in client preferences to cloud arrangements from other types of arrangements.
The increase in term license revenue in the three months ended September 30, 2019 was due to revenue recognized from several large, multi-year term license contracts in the three months ended September 30, 2019.
The decrease in term license revenue in the nine months ended September 30, 2019 was attributable to revenue recognized from term license contracts in the nine months ended September 30, 2019 with multi-year committed maintenance periods, which resulted in a greater portion of the contract value being allocated to maintenance.
The increases in maintenance revenue in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2019 were primarily due to the continued growth in the aggregate value of the installed base of our software and strong renewal rates in excess of 90%.
The decreases in perpetual license revenue in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2019 reflects the shift in client preferences in favor of our cloud offerings instead of our perpetual license arrangements.
The decreases in consulting revenue in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2019 were primarily due to decreases in billable hours.
Revenue from cloud arrangements is generally recognized over the service period, while revenue from term and perpetual license arrangements is generally recognized upfront when the license rights become effective.
It was also due to an increase in cloud revenue reflecting the shift in client preferences to cloud arrangements from other types of arrangements, an increase in maintenance revenue due to the continued growth in the aggregate value of the installed base of our software and strong renewal rates in excess of 90%.
The decrease in total gross profit in the nine months ended September 30, 2019 was primarily due to a decrease in term and perpetual license revenue and a decrease in consulting revenue due to a decrease in billable hours.
The decrease in total gross profit percent in the nine months ended September 30, 2019 was driven by the shift in client preferences in favor of cloud arrangements, which are lower margin than our term and perpetual license revenue streams and decreases in cloud and consulting gross profit percent.
The decreases in cloud gross profit percent in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2019 were driven by an increase in costs as we accelerated our investments in cloud infrastructure and service delivery to support future growth.
The decreases in consulting gross profit percent in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2019 were driven by a decrease in billable hours as consulting resources were transitioning to new projects after completing a large project and an increase in consulting resource availability as we continue growing and leveraging our partner network.
The increases in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2019 were primarily due to compensation and benefits of $22.6 million and $58.1 million, attributable to increased headcount, equity compensation, and increases of $4.0 million and $10.6 million in deferred contract cost amortization.
The increase in headcount reflects our efforts to increase our sales capacity to deepen relationships with existing clients and target new accounts.
The increases in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2019 were primarily due to compensation and benefits of $3.8 million and $10.5 million, attributable to an increase in headcount and equity compensation, and $1.2 million and $4.5 million in cloud hosting expenses as we expand our cloud-focused research and development activities.
The increases in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2019 were primarily due to compensation and benefits of $3.2 million and $3.7 million, due to increased headcount.
The increases in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2019 were primarily due to the increased value of our annual periodic equity awards granted in March 2019 and 2018 and increased headcount.
These awards generally have a five-year vesting schedule.
The changes in foreign currency transaction (loss) gain were primarily due to the impact of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates associated with our foreign currency-denominated cash, accounts receivable, and intercompany receivables and payables held by our United Kingdom (“U.K.”) subsidiary.
During the nine months ended September 30, 2019, the Company’s effective income tax rate changed primarily due to the Global Intangible Low-Taxed Income (“GILTI”) provision of the Tax Reform Act.
We may use borrowings to finance working capital needs and for general corporate purposes.
Subject to specific circumstances, the Credit Agreement allows us to increase the aggregate commitment up to $200 million.
“Other Information” for additional information.
We believe that our current cash, cash equivalents, marketable securities, cash flow from operations, and borrowing capacity will be sufficient to fund our operations, quarterly cash dividends, and stock repurchases for at least the next 12 months.
If we require additional capital resources to grow our business, we may seek to finance our operations from available funds or additional external financing.
As client preferences continue to shift in favor of cloud arrangements, we could continue to experience slower operating cash flow growth, or negative cash flow, in the near term.
The primary driver of the decrease in the nine months ended September 30, 2019 was the recent shift in our revenue mix toward cloud arrangements, which are generally collected over an average service period of three years, and increased costs as the Company accelerated investments in its cloud offerings and selling and marketing activities to support future growth.
The change in cash provided by (used in) investing activities was primarily driven by the payment of consideration for the acquisition of In the Chat Communications Inc. in May 2019.
We primarily used cash in financing activities for repurchases of our common stock under our publicly announced stock repurchase programs, stock repurchases for tax withholdings for the net settlement of our equity awards, and the payment of our quarterly dividend.
It is our current intention to pay a quarterly cash dividend of $0.03 per share, however, the Board of Directors may terminate or modify the dividend program at any time without prior notice.
We may use borrowings to finance working capital needs and for general corporate purposes.
Subject to specific circumstances, the Credit Agreement allows us to increase the aggregate commitment up to $200 million.

•a base rate (which is the highest of (1) PNC’s prime rate, (2) the Federal Funds open rate in effect on such day plus 0.5%, and (3) the daily LIBOR Rate plus 1%) plus an interest margin based on our net consolidated leverage ratio.
We are obligated to pay an unused commitment fee during the term of the Credit Agreement that varies between 0.15% and 0.225% depending on our net consolidated leverage ratio.
The credit facility includes a provision for the replacement of the LIBOR rate in the event that such rate is no longer available.
The replacement rate will be determined by PNC in consultation with us.
