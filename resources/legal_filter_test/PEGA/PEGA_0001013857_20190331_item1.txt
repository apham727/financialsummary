Pegasystems Inc. (together with its subsidiaries, “the Company”) has prepared the accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements pursuant to the rules and regulations of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) regarding interim financial reporting.
2016-13, “Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments,” which requires measurement and recognition of expected credit losses for financial assets measured at amortized cost, including accounts receivable, upon initial recognition of that financial asset using a forward-looking expected loss model, rather than an incurred loss model.
The effective date for the Company will be January 1, 2020, with early adoption permitted.
The Company is currently evaluating the effect this ASU will have on its consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.
Results for reporting periods beginning on or after January 1, 2019 are presented under ASC 842, while prior period amounts were not adjusted and continue to be reported in accordance with the Company’s historic accounting under ASC 840 “Leases”.
See Note 9.
As of March 31, 2019, the Company did not hold any investments with unrealized losses that are considered to be other-than-temporary.
As of March 31, 2019, maturities of marketable securities ranged from April 2019 to August 2022, with a weighted-average remaining maturity of approximately 1.4 years.
Unbilled receivables are client committed amounts for which revenue recognition precedes billing, and billing is solely subject to the passage of time.
As of March 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018, the allowance for doubtful accounts was not material.
Contract assets are amounts under client contracts where revenue recognized exceeds the amount billed to the client and the right to payment is subject to conditions other than the passage of time, such as the completion of a related performance obligation.
Contract assets and deferred revenue are netted at the contract level for each reporting period.
The change in deferred revenue in the three months ended March 31, 2019 was primarily due to $89.4 million of revenue recognized, excluding the impact of netting contract assets and deferred revenue at the contract level, during the period that was included in deferred revenue at December 31, 2018, partially offset by new billings in advance of revenue recognition.
Deferred costs are amortized on a straight-line basis over the benefit period, which is on average 5 years.
The Company records its cash equivalents, marketable securities, and investments in privately-held companies at fair value on a recurring basis.
The Company’s investments in privately-held companies are classified within Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy.
If applicable, the Company will recognize transfers into and out of levels within the fair value hierarchy at the end of the reporting period in which the actual event or change in circumstance occurs.
There were no transfers between levels during the three months ended March 31, 2019.
For certain other financial instruments, including accounts receivable and accounts payable, the carrying value approximates fair value due to the relatively short maturity of these items.
The Company’s leases are primarily for office space used in the ordinary course of business.
All the Company’s leases are operating leases.
The Company accounts for a contract as a lease when it has the right to control the asset for a period of time while obtaining substantially all of the asset’s economic benefits.
The Company determines the initial classification and measurement of its operating right of use assets and lease liabilities at the lease commencement date and thereafter if modified.
Fixed lease costs are recognized on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease.
Variable lease costs are recognized in the period in which the obligation for those payments is incurred.
The Company combines lease and non-lease components in the determination of lease costs for its office space leases.
The lease liability includes lease payments related to options to extend or renew the lease term, if the Company is reasonably certain it will exercise those options.
As of March 31, 2019, the Company had $114.1 million of unrecognized stock-based compensation expense, net of estimated forfeitures, related to all unvested restricted stock units (“RSUs”) and stock options.
These amounts are expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 2.3 years.
Basic earnings per share is computed using the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during the applicable period.
Diluted earnings per share is computed using the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during the applicable period, plus the dilutive effect of outstanding stock options and RSUs, using the treasury stock method.
In periods of loss, all stock options and RSUs are excluded, as their inclusion would be anti-dilutive.
We encourage you to carefully consider the risk factors identified in Item 1A.
