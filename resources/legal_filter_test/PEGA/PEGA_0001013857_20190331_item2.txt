We develop, market, license, and support enterprise software applications that help organizations transform the way they engage with their customers and process and complete work across their enterprise. We license our no-code Pega Platform™ for rapid application development to clients that wish to build and extend their own business applications. Our cloud-architected portfolio of customer engagement and digital process automation applications leverages artificial intelligence (“AI”), case management, and robotic automation technology, built on our unified no-code Pega Platform, empowering businesses to quickly design, extend, and scale their enterprise applications to meet strategic business needs.
Our target clients are Global 3000 organizations and government agencies that require applications to differentiate themselves in the markets they serve. Our applications achieve and facilitate differentiation by increasing business agility, driving growth, improving productivity, attracting and retaining customers, and reducing risk. We deliver applications tailored to our clients’ specific industry needs.
The change in ACV measures the growth and predictability of future cash flows from Pega cloud and client cloud committed arrangements as of the end of the particular reporting period. 
•Note 2. “Significant Accounting Policies” in Item 8. “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data”.
There have been no significant changes to our critical accounting policies as disclosed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018.
Our license revenue is derived from sales of our applications and Pega Platform. Our cloud revenue is derived from our hosted Pega Platform and software applications.
The decrease in term license revenue in the three months ended March 31, 2019 was primarily due to lower average revenue per arrangement. The increase in cloud revenue in the three months ended March 31, 2019 reflects the shift in client preferences to cloud arrangements from other types of arrangements.
The increase in maintenance revenue was primarily due to the continued growth in the aggregate value of the installed base of our software and strong renewal rates in excess of 90%.
The decrease in perpetual license revenue in the three months ended March 31, 2019 reflects the shift in client preferences in favor of our cloud offerings and away from perpetual license arrangements.
Our consulting revenue fluctuates depending upon the mix of new implementation projects we perform as compared to those performed by our enabled clients or led by our partners. The decrease in consulting revenue in the three months ended March 31, 2019 was primarily due to a decrease in billable hours.
The recent shift in our revenue mix toward cloud arrangements has resulted in slower total gross profit growth as our cloud business continues to grow and scale. Revenue from cloud arrangements is generally recognized over the service period, while revenue from term and perpetual license arrangements is generally recognized upfront when the license rights become effective.
The decrease in total gross profit in the three months ended March 31, 2019 was primarily due to the decrease in term and perpetual license revenue reflecting the shift in client preferences toward our cloud offerings.
The decrease in total gross profit percent in the three months ended March 31, 2019 was driven by a shift in favor of cloud arrangements, which are lower margin than our term and perpetual license revenue streams. The increase in cloud gross profit percent was driven by cost efficiency gains as our cloud business continues to grow and scale. The decrease in consulting gross profit percent was driven by a decrease in billable hours as consulting resources were transitioning to new projects after completing a large project which began in the second half of 2016 and an increase in consulting resource availability in Europe as we continue growing and leveraging our partner network.
The increase in the three months ended March 31, 2019 was primarily due to an increase in compensation and benefits of $17.7 million, attributable to increased headcount, and an increase of $4.5 million in deferred contract commission amortization. The increase in headcount reflects our efforts to increase our sales capacity to deepen relationships with existing clients and target new accounts.
The increase in the three months ended March 31, 2019 was primarily due to an increase in compensation and benefits of $2.1 million, attributable to an increase in headcount, and an increase of $1.6 million in cloud hosting expenses as we expand our cloud-focused research and development activities.
The decrease in the three months ended March 31, 2019 was primarily due to a decrease in compensation and benefits of $1.2 million, due to a decrease in equity compensation, and a decrease of $1.9 million in legal and other professional services fees. Despite the headcount increase, associated compensation and benefits did not increase because these costs are primarily allocated to other operating expense areas. 
The increase in the three months ended March 31, 2019 was primarily due to the increased value of our annual periodic equity awards granted in March 2019 and 2018. These awards generally have a five-year vesting schedule.
The change in foreign currency transaction loss was primarily due to unrealized losses on foreign currency denominated cash and receivables of our U.K subsidiary due to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates as the British Pound strengthened against the Euro and U.S. dollar.
The inclusion of excess tax benefits from stock-based compensation in the provision for income taxes has increased the variability of the effective tax rates in recent periods. This fluctuation may continue in future periods, as the amount of excess tax benefits from stock-based compensation awards varies depending on our future stock price in relation to the fair value of awards, the timing of RSU vestings, the exercise behavior of our stock option holders, and the total value of future grants of stock-based compensation awards.
We believe that our current cash, cash equivalents, marketable securities, and cash flow from operations will be sufficient to fund our operations, quarterly cash dividends, and stock repurchases for at least the next 12 months.
As client preferences continue to shift in favor of cloud arrangements, we could continue to experience slower operating cash flow growth in the near term. Cash from cloud arrangements is generally collected throughout the service period of three to five years, while cash from perpetual license arrangements is generally collected upfront, shortly after the license rights become effective.
Cash used in investing activities is primarily driven by the timing of investment maturities and purchases of new investments.
It is our current intention to pay a quarterly cash dividend of $0.03 per share, however, the Board of Directors may terminate or modify the dividend program at any time without prior notice.
The following table sets forth information regarding our repurchases of our common stock during the three months ended March 31, 2019.
