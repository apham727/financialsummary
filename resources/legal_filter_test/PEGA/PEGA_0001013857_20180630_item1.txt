Pegasystems Inc. (together with its subsidiaries, the Company) has prepared the accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements pursuant to the rules and regulations of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) regarding interim financial reporting.
On January 1, 2018 the Company adopted Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No.
2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606) using the full retrospective method which required each prior reporting period presented be adjusted to reflect the application of this ASU.
In June 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued ASU No.
2016-13, Financial InstrumentsCredit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments, which requires measurement and recognition of expected credit losses for financial assets measured at amortized cost, including accounts receivable, upon initial recognition of that financial asset using a forward-looking expected loss model, rather than an incurred loss model for credit losses.
Credit losses relating to available-for-sale debt securities should be recorded through an allowance for credit losses when the fair value is below the amortized cost of the asset, removing the concept of other-than-temporary impairments.
The effective date for the Company will be January 1, 2020, with early adoption permitted.
The Company is currently evaluating the effect this ASU will have on its consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.
2016-02, Leases (Topic 842), which requires lessees to record most leases on their balance sheets, recognizing a lease liability for the obligation to make lease payments and a right-of-use asset for the right to use the underlying asset for the lease term.
The effective date for the Company will be January 1, 2019, with early adoption permitted.
On January 1, 2018 the Company adopted the ASC 606 revenue recognition standard and has adjusted prior periods to conform.
Previously, the Company recognized revenue over the term of the agreements as payments became due or earlier if prepaid.
Any unrecognized license revenue from these arrangements is recognized in the period that control transfers or as a cumulative adjustment to retained earnings as of December 31, 2015.
Unbilled receivables in the Companys unaudited condensed consolidated balance sheets increased significantly upon adoption due to the revenue from term licenses being recognized prior to amounts billed, or prepaid by, clients and perpetual licenses with extended payment terms.
This change primarily impacts the Companys contracts related to multi-year cloud offerings, maintenance on term and perpetual licenses, and those long-term term and perpetual licenses with client usage rights that increase over time.
Receivables, Contract Assets, and Deferred Revenue, Note 5.
Includes cash, cash equivalents, marketable securities, income taxes receivable, other current assets, property and equipment, intangible assets, goodwill, and other long-term assets (as reflected in the consolidated balance sheets in the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2017).
Adoption of ASC 606 and ASC 340-40 had no impact on total cash from or used in operating, financing, or investing activities in the Companys unaudited condensed consolidated statements of cash flows for the six months ended June 30, 2017.
As of June 30, 2018, remaining maturities of marketable securities ranged from July 2018 to August 2021, with a weighted-average remaining maturity of approximately 1.5 years.
Unbilled receivables is the amount due from clients where the only condition on the right of payment is the passage of time.
The Company regularly assesses receivables for collectability.
As of June 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017, the allowance for doubtful accounts was not material.
 (1) Included in other current assets in the unaudited condensed consolidated balance sheets.
 (2) Included in other long-term assets in the unaudited condensed consolidated balance sheets.
 (3) Included in other long-term liabilities in the unaudited condensed consolidated balance sheets.
Contract assets and deferred revenue are presented net at the contract level for each reporting period.
Contract assets are amounts under client contracts where revenue recognized exceeds the amount billed to the client and the right to payment is subject to conditions other than the passage of time, such as the completion of a related performance obligation.
The change in deferred revenue in the six months ended June 30, 2018, was primarily due to new billings in advance of revenue recognition and $168.2 million of revenue recognized, excluding the impact of the netting of contract assets and deferred revenue, during the period that was included in deferred revenue at December 31, 2017.
No client represented 10% or more of the Companys total receivables as of June 30, 2018 or December 31, 2017.
These costs are deferred, as a long-term asset, and then amortized using the straight-line method over the period of benefit which is on average five years.
 (1) Included in other long-term assets in the unaudited condensed consolidated balance sheets.
During the six months ended June 30, 2018 and 2017, impairment of deferred contract costs was not material.
 (1) Included in other long-term assets in the unaudited condensed consolidated balance sheets.
 (1) Included in other long-term assets in the unaudited condensed consolidated balance sheets.
The Company records its cash equivalents, marketable securities, and investments in privately-held companies at fair value on a recurring basis.
The Companys investments in privately-held companies are classified within Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy and are valued using model-based techniques, including option pricing models and discounted cash flow models.
If applicable, the Company will recognize transfers into and out of levels within the fair value hierarchy at the end of the reporting period in which the actual event or change in circumstance occurs.
There were no transfers between levels during the six months ended June 30, 2018.
 (1) Included in other long-term assets in the unaudited condensed consolidated balance sheets.
For certain other financial instruments, including accounts receivable and accounts payable, the carrying value approximates their fair value due to the relatively short maturity of these items.
Assets recorded at fair value on a nonrecurring basis, including property and equipment and intangible assets, are recognized at fair value when they are impaired.
During the six months ended June 30, 2018 and 2017, the Company did not recognize any impairments of its assets recorded at fair value on a nonrecurring basis.
Software license revenue is primarily derived from sales of the Companys software applications and Pega Platform.
Maintenance revenue includes revenue from client support including software upgrades, on a when and-if available basis, telephone support, and bug fixes or patches.
Services revenue is primarily derived from cloud revenue, which is sales of the Companys hosted Pega Platform and software application environments and consulting revenue which is primarily related to new license implementations.
The Companys license and cloud arrangements often contain multiple performance obligations, including maintenance, consulting, and training.
For contracts with multiple performance obligations, the Company accounts for individual performance obligations separately if they are distinct.
The transaction price is allocated to the separate performance obligations on a relative stand-alone selling price basis.
If the transaction price contains discounts or the Company expects to provide a future price concession, these elements are considered when determining the transaction price prior to allocation.
The Company has concluded that its software licenses are distinct performance obligations as the client can benefit from the software on its own.
Software license revenue is typically recognized at a point in time when control is transferred to the client, which is defined as the point in time when the client can use and benefit from the license.
Stand-alone selling price for software licenses is determined using the residual approach.
Periodically, the Company evaluates whether the residual approach is appropriate for its license and cloud performance obligations when sold with other performance obligations.
As a result, if the standalone selling price analysis illustrates that the license and cloud performance obligations are no longer highly variable, the Company will utilize the relative allocation method for such arrangements.
Term license fees are usually payable in advance on a monthly, quarterly, or annual basis over the term of the license agreement, which is typically three to five years and may be renewed for additional terms at the clients option.
Perpetual license fees are usually payable when the contract is executed.
Software maintenance contracts entitle clients to receive technical support and software updates, on a when and if available basis, during the term of the maintenance contract.
Technical support and software updates are considered distinct services but accounted for as a single performance obligation as they each constitute a series of distinct services that are substantially the same and have the same pattern of transfer to the client.
Software maintenance revenue is recognized over time on a straight-line basis over the contract period.
Each of the performance obligations included in maintenance are priced as a percentage of the selling price of the related software license, which is highly variable.
The Company determined the standalone selling price of each performance obligation included in maintenance based on this pricing relationship, which has remained constant within a narrow range, and observable data from standalone sales of maintenance, along with all other observable data.
The Companys services revenue is comprised of consulting and training, including software license implementations, training, reimbursable expenses, and cloud which is derived from sales of the Companys hosted Pega Platform and software application environments.
The Company has concluded that most services are distinct performance obligations.
Consulting may be provided on a stand-alone basis or bundled with license and software maintenance services.
Fees for time and materials consulting contracts are usually payable shortly after the service is provided.
The Company estimates the stand-alone selling price for fixed price services based on the estimated hours versus actual hours in similar geographies and for similar contract sizes.
Revenue for fixed price services is recognized over time as the services are provided.
Fees for fixed price services consulting contracts are usually payable as contract milestones are achieved.
The stand-alone selling price of cloud sales of production environments is determined based on the residual approach when sold with services and is recognized over the term of the service.
If the amount of consideration expected for the added products and services reflects the stand-alone selling price of those products and services.
During the six months ended June 30, 2018 and 2017, there were no material changes in the Companys estimate of variable fees.
For reporting periods prior to January 1, 2018, the date of initial adoption of ASC 606, the Company has elected the practical expedient and not compiled and disclosed the amount of the transaction price allocated to the remaining performance obligations.
As of June 30, 2018, the Company had, net of estimated forfeitures, $79.7 million of unrecognized stock-based compensation expense, related to all unvested restricted stock units (RSUs) and stock options, which was expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 2.2 years.
Includes approximately 0.1 million RSUs which were granted in connection with the election by certain employees to receive 50% of their 2018 target incentive compensation under the Companys Corporate Incentive Compensation Plan in the form of RSUs instead of cash.
During the six months ended June 30, 2018, 0.9 million shares of common stock were issued due to stock option exercises and RSU vestings under the Companys stock-based compensation plans.
an increase in U.S. research and development tax credits; and
Under the SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin No.
However, based on the Companys provisional analysis performed as of that date, the Company does not expect to be subject to the one-time transition tax due to the Companys foreign subsidiaries being in a net accumulated deficit position.
During the six months ended June 30, 2018, the Company recognized no significant adjustments to these estimates.
The Company expects that it will be subject to incremental U.S. tax resulting from GILTI inclusions beginning in 2018.
As of June 30, 2018, the Company has included an estimate of the effect of its GILTI provisions in its estimated annual effective tax rate.
The Companys preliminary assessment is that the Company will not be subject to the BEAT in 2018.
Basic earnings per share is computed using the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during the applicable period.
Diluted earnings per share is computed using the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during the applicable period, plus the dilutive effect of outstanding stock options and RSUs, using the treasury stock method.
In periods of loss, all stock options and RSUs are excluded, as their inclusion would be anti-dilutive.
These awards may be dilutive in the future.
We encourage you to carefully consider the risk factors identified in Item 1A.
