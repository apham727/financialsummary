In designing and evaluating our disclosure controls and procedures, our management recognized that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives, and our management necessarily applied its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures.
Based on this evaluation, our CEO and CFO concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of June 30, 2018.
