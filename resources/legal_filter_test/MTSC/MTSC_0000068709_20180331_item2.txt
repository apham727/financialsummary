an estimate of the impact in our fiscal year 2018 results. See Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 1 of Part I of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for further discussion of the impact of the Tax Act.
During the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2017, we initiated a series of Test workforce reductions and facility closures intended to increase organizational effectiveness, gain manufacturing efficiencies and provide cost savings that can be reinvested in our growth initiatives. These actions include the transfer of certain production operations in China to a contract manufacturing partner in fiscal year 2018. As a result, in the three and six months ended March 31, 2018, we recorded $321 and $414 of pre-tax severance and related expense, respectively, and $25 and $187 of pre-tax facility closure costs, respectively. See Note 16 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 1 of Part I of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for further discussion of restructuring initiatives.
The terms "MTS," "we," "us," the "Company," or "our" in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, unless the context otherwise requires, refer to MTS Systems Corporation and its wholly owned subsidiaries.
The following table compares results of operations, separately identifying the estimated impact of currency translation and restructuring costs incurred in fiscal year 2018. 
See Note 16 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 1 of Part I of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for additional information on restructuring and related costs. In the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2016, we completed the acquisition of PCB Group, Inc. (PCB). As a result of the PCB acquisition, we incurred certain non-recurring costs during fiscal year 2017 including acquisition integration costs and a fair value adjustment on acquired PCB inventory (PCB acquisition inventory adjustment).
Revenue for the three and six months ended March 31, 2018 declined 1.1% and 1.8%, respectively, primarily driven by lower Test revenue, partially offset by growth in our Sensors business and the favorable impact of currency translation. Test revenue decreased $13,602 and $26,525, respectively, primarily driven by a decline in equipment volume resulting from lower trailing 12-month order volume in the ground vehicles sector that continues to operate in a rapidly changing environment. Current year Test revenue was also impacted by higher custom project backlog weighting which takes longer to convert to revenue. Sensors revenue increased $11,958 and $19,764, respectively, primarily driven by continued momentum from new opportunities in the Sensors test sector, along with continued growth in the Sensors position sector and broad demand across the remaining Sensors sectors. Excluding the impact of currency translation, revenue decreased 6.0% and 5.3%, respectively.
Gross profit for the three months ended March 31, 2018 declined 5.1% primarily driven by lower Test revenue volume, partially offset by higher Sensors revenue volume. Gross margin rate declined 1.7 percentage points primarily due to the lower contribution from product mix, unfavorable leverage on lower Test revenue volume, the impact of higher warranty expense, and the unfavorable impact of currency translation, partially offset by leverage on increased Sensors revenue volume. Excluding the impact of currency translation, prior year PCB acquisition integration expenses, and restructuring costs incurred in both fiscal years, gross profit declined 8.9% and the gross margin rate declined 1.3 percentage points.
Gross profit for the six months ended March 31, 2018 increased 0.3% primarily driven by to the prior year impact of the PCB acquisition inventory adjustment of $7,724 and increased Sensors revenue volume, partially offset by reduced Test revenue volume. Gross margin rate increased 0.8 percentage points primarily due to the prior year impact from the PCB acquisition inventory adjustment and leverage on increased Sensors revenue volume, partially offset by the lower contribution from 
product mix, unfavorable leverage on lower Test revenue volume, the impact of higher warranty expense, and the unfavorable impact of currency translation. Excluding the impact of currency translation, the prior year PCB acquisition inventory adjustment, prior year PCB acquisition integration expenses, and restructuring costs incurred in both fiscal years, gross profit declined 7.4% and the gross margin rate declined 0.9 percentage points.
General and administrative expense for the three and six months ended March 31, 2018 declined 19.4% and 16.9%, respectively, primarily due to prior year China investigation expenses of $6,169 and $8,145, respectively, and prior year PCB acquisition integration expenses of $506 and $2,009, respectively, partially offset by an increase in professional fees, the unfavorable impact of currency translation, and higher bad debt expense in Test. Excluding the impact of currency translation, prior year PCB acquisition integration expenses, prior year China investigation expenses, and restructuring costs incurred in both fiscal years, general and administrative expense increased 9.6% and 3.8%, respectively.
Income from operations for the three months ended March 31, 2018 increased 7.8% primarily due to prior year China investigation expenses of $6,759 and leverage on volume growth in Sensors, partially offset by the lower gross margin contribution from product mix, unfavorable leverage on lower Test revenue volume and the impact of higher warranty expense. Excluding the impact of currency translation, prior year non-recurring PCB acquisition integration expenses, prior year China investigation expenses, and restructuring costs incurred in both fiscal years, income from operations decreased 31.7%.
Income from operations for the six months ended March 31, 2018 increased 28.8% primarily driven by prior year China investigation expenses of $8,735, leverage on volume growth in Sensors, prior year impact from the PCB acquisition inventory adjustment, and non-recurring PCB acquisition integration expenses of $2,378. The increase was partially offset by the lower gross margin contribution from product mix and unfavorable leverage on lower Test revenue volume. Excluding the impact of currency translation, the prior year PCB acquisition inventory adjustment, prior year non-recurring PCB acquisition integration expenses, prior year China investigation expenses, and restructuring costs incurred in both fiscal years, income from operations decreased 28.7%.
The decrease in other income (expense), net for the three months ended March 31, 2018 was primarily driven by a relative decrease in gains on foreign currency transactions. 
The effective tax rate for the six months ended March 31, 2018 decreased primarily due to certain discrete benefits of $25,378 for the estimated impact of the Tax Act. The discrete benefits primarily related to $32,264 of estimated benefit from the 
Net income and diluted earnings per share for the three months ended March 31, 2018 increased due to lower operating expenses, partially offset by a decrease in gross profit.
Net income and diluted earnings per share for the six months ended March 31, 2018 increased due to a reduction in the effective tax rate and discrete benefits stemming from the Tax Act, as well as lower operating expenses and increased gross profit.

General and administrative expense for the three and six months ended March 31, 2018 declined 31.5% and 23.7%, respectively, primarily due to prior year China investigation expenses of $6,169 and $8,145, respectively. The decrease was partially offset by higher bad debt expense and the unfavorable impact of currency translation. Excluding the impact of currency translation, prior year China investigation expenses, and current year restructuring costs, general and administrative expense increased 8.6% and 3.2%, respectively.

The decrease in cash provided by operating activities was primarily due to a decrease in working capital associated with timing fluctuations from inventory payments, advanced payments from customers, accounts receivable payments received, unbilled accounts receivable accruals and billings, and accounts payable payments. Timing of payroll-related payments also contributed to the decrease in cash provided by operating activities. This decrease in cash provided by operating activities was partially offset by a decrease in cash used by other assets and liabilities primarily driven by an increase in income taxes payable, as well as an increase in net income offset by a decrease in deferred income taxes due to the remeasurement of our estimated deferred tax liabilities as a result of the Tax Act.
