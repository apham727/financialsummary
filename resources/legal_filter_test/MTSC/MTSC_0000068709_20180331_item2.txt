See Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 1 of Part I of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for further discussion of the impact of the Tax Act.
During the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2017, we initiated a series of Test workforce reductions and facility closures intended to increase organizational effectiveness, gain manufacturing efficiencies and provide cost savings that can be reinvested in our growth initiatives.
These actions include the transfer of certain production operations in China to a contract manufacturing partner in fiscal year 2018.
As a result, in the three and six months ended March 31, 2018, we recorded $321 and $414 of pre-tax severance and related expense, respectively, and $25 and $187 of pre-tax facility closure costs, respectively.
See Note 16 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 1 of Part I of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for further discussion of restructuring initiatives.
Approximately 70% of our revenue has historically been derived from customers outside of the U.S. Our financial results are principally exposed to changes in exchange rates between the U.S. dollar and the Euro, the Japanese yen and the Chinese yuan.
The discussion below quantifies the impact of foreign currency translation on our financial results for the periods discussed.
The terms "MTS," "we," "us," the "Company," or "our" in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, unless the context otherwise requires, refer to MTS Systems Corporation and its wholly owned subsidiaries.

In the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2016, we completed the acquisition of PCB Group, Inc. (PCB).
As a result of the PCB acquisition, we incurred certain non-recurring costs during fiscal year 2017 including acquisition integration costs and a fair value adjustment on acquired PCB inventory (PCB acquisition inventory adjustment).
Revenue for the three and six months ended March 31, 2018 declined 1.1% and 1.8%, respectively, primarily driven by lower Test revenue, partially offset by growth in our Sensors business and the favorable impact of currency translation.
Current year Test revenue was also impacted by higher custom project backlog weighting which takes longer to convert to revenue.
Sensors revenue increased $11,958 and $19,764, respectively, primarily driven by continued momentum from new opportunities in the Sensors test sector, along with continued growth in the Sensors position sector and broad demand across the remaining Sensors sectors.

The increase in other income (expense), net for the six months ended March 31, 2018 was primarily driven by a relative decrease in losses on foreign currency transactions.
The effective tax rate for the three months ended March 31, 2018 increased primarily due to higher earnings before taxes and a less favorable mix of geographic earnings, partially offset by the lower U.S. corporate tax rate under the Tax Act.
The effective tax rate for the six months ended March 31, 2018 decreased primarily due to certain discrete benefits of $25,378 for the estimated impact of the Tax Act.
Excluding the impact of these discrete benefits, the effective tax rate for the six months ended March 31, 2018 would have been 17.5%, and the decrease in tax rate compared to the prior year was primarily due to the lower U.S. corporate tax rate under the Tax Act.
Net income and diluted earnings per share for the three months ended March 31, 2018 increased due to lower operating expenses, partially offset by a decrease in gross profit.
Net income and diluted earnings per share for the six months ended March 31, 2018 increased due to a reduction in the effective tax rate and discrete benefits stemming from the Tax Act, as well as lower operating expenses and increased gross profit.

See Note 15 for additional information on our operating segments.
Revenue for the three and six months ended March 31, 2018 decreased 11.0% and 10.4%, respectively, primarily driven by a decline in equipment volume due to lower trailing 12-month order volume resulting from weakness in the ground vehicles sector that continues to operate in a rapidly changing environment.
Current year Test revenue was also impacted by higher custom project backlog weighting which takes longer to convert to revenue.
This was partially offset by the favorable impact of currency translation and growth in service revenue.

The decrease in cash provided by operating activities was primarily due to a decrease in working capital associated with timing fluctuations from inventory payments, advanced payments from customers, accounts receivable payments received, unbilled accounts receivable accruals and billings, and accounts payable payments.
This decrease in cash provided by operating activities was partially offset by a decrease in cash used by other assets and liabilities primarily driven by an increase in income taxes payable, as well as an increase in net income offset by a decrease in deferred income taxes due to the remeasurement of our estimated deferred tax liabilities as a result of the Tax Act.
The decrease in cash used in investing activities was primarily due to the timing of investments in property and equipment in the current year.
