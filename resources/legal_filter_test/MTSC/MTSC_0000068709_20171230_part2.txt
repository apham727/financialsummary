We are or may be involved in various legal proceedings from time-to-time arising from the normal course of business.
Item 1A.
A discussion of our risk factors can be found in Item 1A of Part I of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2017.
The risks described below and in our Annual Report on Form 10-K are not the only risks we face.
The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the Tax Act) was signed into law on December 22, 2017.
The tax benefit recorded for the three months ended December 30, 2017 involves significant judgment and assumptions as to the impact of the Tax Act.
Our estimated impact of the new law is based on management's current knowledge and assumptions.
We expect to record any adjustments in the next year in accordance with the guidance provided in the SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin No.
Item 2.
The following table presents repurchases of our equity securities we made during the fiscal quarter ended December 30, 2017.
We purchase common stock from time-to-time to mitigate dilution related to new shares issued as equity for employee compensation such as stock options, restricted stock units, performance restricted stock units and employee stock purchase plan activity, as well as to return to shareholders capital not immediately required to fund ongoing operations.
Our Board of Directors approved, and on February 11, 2011 announced, a 2,000 share purchase authorization.
The share purchase authorization has no expiration date.
We made no share purchases during the first quarter of fiscal year 2018.
As of December 30, 2017, there were 438 shares available for purchase under the existing authorization.
In connection with the pricing of the TEUs sold in our public offering in fiscal year 2016, we purchased capped calls from third party banking institutions (Capped Calls) for $7,935.
During the first quarter of fiscal year 2018, we did not settle any of the Capped Calls.
As of December 30, 2017 the range of shares of our common stock to be received under the outstanding Capped Calls was 0 to 293 shares, subject to market conditions.
