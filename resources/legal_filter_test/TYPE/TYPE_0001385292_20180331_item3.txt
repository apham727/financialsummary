 Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk  
Financial instruments that potentially subject us to concentrations of credit risk consist principally of cash and cash equivalents and trade receivables. Cash equivalents consist primarily of bank deposits and certain investments, such as commercial paper, corporate debt and municipal securities, with maturities less than 90 days. Deposits of cash held outside the United States totaled approximately $26.1 million and $24.3 million at March 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017, respectively.  
For the three months ended March 31, 2018 and 2017, no customer accounted for more than 10% of our revenue.  
Our exposure to market risk associated with changes in interest rates relates primarily to our long-term debt. At March 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017, the Company had borrowings under our revolving Credit Facility of $90.0 million and $93.0 million, respectively. The interest rate on our Credit Facility fluctuates with either the prime rate or the LIBOR interest rate and at March 31, 2018, our rate was 3.6% for LIBOR. A 10% increase in the rate would have increased our interest expense by $0.9 million.  
In accordance with ASC Topic No. 830, Foreign Currency Matters, or ASC 830, all assets and liabilities of our foreign subsidiaries whose functional currency is a currency other than U.S. dollars are translated into U.S. dollars at an exchange rate as of the balance sheet date. Revenue and expenses of these subsidiaries are translated at the average monthly exchange rates. The resulting translation adjustments as calculated from the translation of our foreign subsidiaries to U.S. dollars are recorded as a separate component of stockholdersÂ’ equity. For the three months ended March 31, 2018 and 2017, revenue from customers outside the United States, particularly EMEA and Japan, comprised 56.2% and 55.0%, respectively, of our total revenue. An effect of a 10% strengthening of the British pound sterling, the Euro Japanese yen and the Argentine peso, relative to the U.S. dollar, would have decreased our revenues by $2.0 million, decreased expenses by $2.4 million and increased operating income by $0.5 million for the three months ended March 31, 2018. The sensitivity analysis assumes that all currencies move in the same direction at the same time and the ratio of non-U.S. dollar denominated revenue and expenses to U.S. dollar denominated revenue and expenses does not change from current levels.
