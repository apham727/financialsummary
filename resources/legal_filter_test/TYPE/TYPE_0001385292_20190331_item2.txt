License revenue decreased primarily due to the decline in printer revenue from our printer imaging electronic customers and a decline in revenue from our web channels in the three months ended March 31, 2019, as compared to the same period in 2018. Service revenue decreased in the three months ended March 31, 2019, as compared to the same period in 2018, mainly due to increased customer churn in the last half of 2018.  
While revenue from services has grown to a level of significance requiring separate disclosure, we continue to operate our business based on our two principal markets, Creative Professional and OEM, which is the basis for the following discussion of operating results.  
The following discussion compares the three months ended March 31, 2019 with the three months ended March 31, 2018.  
Revenue was $51.4 million and $56.7 million for the three months ended March 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively, a decrease of $5.3 million, or 9.4%.  
Creative Professional revenue was $32.8 million and $35.0 million for the three months ended March 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively, a decrease of $2.2 million, or 6.4%, due to a decline in certain SAAS-based revenue and web-based sales mainly due to increased customer churn in the last half of 2018.  
OEM revenue decreased $3.1 million, or 14.3%, to $18.6 million in the first quarter of 2019, as compared to $21.7 million in the first quarter of 2018, mainly due to a decline in printer revenue. The decrease in printer revenue, period over period, is largely due to a decline in revenue from our printer imaging electronic OEM customers.  
Cost of revenue, excluding amortization of acquired technology, decreased $2.8 million, or 22.8%, to $9.6 million and $12.4 million in the three months ended March 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. In the first quarter of 2018, there was $2.2 million of non-recurring royalty expense in connection with the adoption of ASC 606. As a percentage of sales, cost of revenue, excluding amortization of acquired technology, was 18.7% and 22.0% of total revenue in the three months ended March 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively, a decline of 3.3%.  
The portion of cost of revenue consisting of amortization of acquired technology was unchanged at $0.9 million for the three months ended March 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively.  
Gross profit increased 3.1% to 79.6% in the three months ended March 31, 2019, as compared to 76.5% in the three months ended March 31, 2018. The increase in gross profit in the three months ended March 31, 2019, as compared to the same period in 2018, was primarily due to the one-time additional non-recurring royalty expense in the prior period that did not occur in the current period, as described above.  
Marketing and Selling. Marketing and selling expense decreased $3.0 million, or 14.7%, to $17.1 million in the three months ended March 31, 2019, as compared to $20.1 million in the three months ended March 31, 2018, primarily due to lower personnel expenses. Personnel and personnel related expenses decreased $2.4 million in the first quarter of 2019, as compared to the same period in 2018, primarily due to lower headcount from our restructuring actions in the second and fourth quarters of 2018 and other decreases in headcount and lower variable compensation as a result of lower revenue. Targeted marketing spending decreased $0.4 million in the three months ended March 31, 2019, as compared to the same period in 2018, due to portfolio decisions around discretionary programs.  
Research and Development. Research and development expense decreased $1.9 million, or 20.0%, to $7.4 million in the three months ended March 31, 2019, as compared to $9.3 million in the three months ended March 31, 2018, primarily due to lower personnel expenses. Personnel and personnel related expenses decreased mainly due to lower headcount from restructuring actions in the second and fourth quarters of 2018.  
General and Administrative. General and administrative expense decreased $3.6 million, or 23.0%, to $12.0 million in the three months ended March 31, 2019, as compared to $15.6 million in the three months ended March 31, 2018. Outside consulting and legal expenses decreased $3.2 million in the three months ended March 31, 2019, as compared to the same period in 2018, primarily due to additional expenses incurred in the prior period related to shareholder activities. Personnel and personnel related expenses decreased $0.4 million in the three months ended March 31, 2019, as compared to the same period in 2018, mainly the result of restructuring actions in the fourth quarter of 2018.  
Restructuring. Restructuring expense decreased $0.2 million, or 112.4%, due to a credit of $24 thousand in the three months ended March 31, 2019 from $0.2 million in the three months ended March 31, 2018 due to severance expense and charges associated with the closure of one of our regional offices in the prior period.  
Amortization of Other Intangible Assets. Amortization of other intangible assets was $0.8 million and $1.0 million for the three months ended March 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively, a decrease of $0.2 million, or 18.8%, mainly due to the write off intangible assets associated with the Swyft business in the second quarter of 2018.  
Interest expense, net of interest income was $0.8 million and $0.7 million for the three months ended March 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively, an increase of $0.1 million, or 5.9%, mainly due to borrowings under our revolving lines of credit.  
Loss (gain) on foreign exchange was a loss of $66 thousand and gain of $34 thousand in the three months ended March 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. The loss and gain in each of the periods was primarily the result of currency fluctuations on our foreign denominated receivables and payables.  
Loss on derivatives was $0.1 million and $0.1 million in the three months ended March 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively, the net result of changes in the market value of our 30-day forward currency derivative contracts.  
The impact of foreign earnings increased our effective tax rate by 3.6% in the first quarter of 2019, as compared to 33.8% in the same period in 2018, due to our ability to better utilize foreign tax credits and to limit the amount of income subject to the Global Intangible Low Taxed Income (GILTI) provisions. In the prior period, these provisions of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (The Act) resulted in a significantly higher effective tax rate on foreign earnings due to limitations on the Companys ability to utilize foreign tax credits in the first quarter of 2018.  
The Company has reflected a reduction in its valuation allowance for foreign tax credits, resulting in a benefit of 10.2%, related to the amount of foreign tax credit carryforwards that the Company is estimating that it will be able to utilize based on 2019 taxable income.  
Non-deductible expenses added 2.4% to the effective tax rate for the three months ended March 31, 2019, as compared to 8.2% for the three months ended March 31, 2018, a result of the acceleration of the final payment of deferred compensation to the founders of Swyft in June 2018 and to two of the founders of Olapic in December 2018, both of which lowered the total amount of non-deductible compensation in the current period.

Cash Flows for the Three Months Ended March 31, 2019 and 2018.  
Since our inception, we have financed our operations primarily through cash from operations, private and public stock sales and long-term debt arrangements, as described below. We believe our existing cash and cash equivalents, our cash flow from operating activities and available bank borrowings will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash needs for at least one year from the issuance of these financial statements. At March 31, 2019, our principal sources of liquidity were cash and cash equivalents totaling $46.4 million and a $200.0 million revolving credit facility, of which there was $70.0 million of outstanding borrowings. On May 3, 2018, our Board of Directors approved a share repurchase program of up to $25.0 million of our outstanding common stock, which permits purchases through June 7, 2019. For the three months ended March 31, 2019, we used $6.6 million in cash to purchase shares under the plan. As of March 31, 2019 the plan has $1.1 million available for future purchases. Our future working capital requirements will depend on many factors, including the operations of our existing business, our potential strategic expansion and future acquisitions we might undertake.  
We generated $4.1 million in cash from operations during the three months ended March 31, 2019. Net income, after adjusting for depreciation and amortization, loss extinguishment of debt, loss on retirement of assets, amortization of deferred financing costs, accreted interest, stock based compensation, provision for doubtful accounts, deferred income taxes, and unrealized currency gain on foreign denominated intercompany transactions generated $10.6 million in cash. Decreased accrued expenses net of increased accounts payable used $12.5 million in cash, primarily a result of the payment of 2018 accrued variable compensation. Increased deferred revenue and decreased accounts receivable generated $10.9 million in cash as a result of customer payments received. Prepaid expenses and other assets used $1.7 million in cash, which includes approximately $0.9 million of capitalized financing costs in connection with the New Credit Facility. Increased tax refunds receivable combined with decreased accrued income taxes used $3.2 million during the quarter ended March 31, 2019.  
During the three months ended March 31, 2019, we used $0.4 million in investing activities for the purchase of property and equipment. During the three months ended March 31, 2018, we used $1.6 million in investing activities for the purchase of $1.4 million of property and equipment and $0.2 million for acquisition of intangible assets.  
Cash used in financing activities in the three months ended March 31, 2019 was $17.4 million. We received cash from the exercise of stock options of $0.3 million. We paid cash dividends of $4.8 million, and reduced borrowings under our revolving line of credit by $5.2 million. We also purchased $6.6 million in treasury stock and paid $1.2 million in employee taxes on shares withheld in the three months ended March 31, 2019. Cash used in financing activities for the three months ended March 31, 2018 was $6.3 million. We received cash from exercises of stock options of $2.6 million. We paid a cash dividend of $4.7 million and we paid $3.0 million on our outstanding revolving line of credit. We also used $1.2 million for employee taxes on shares withheld.  
On February 13, 2019, our Board of Directors approved an $0.116 per share, or $4.8 million, quarterly cash dividend on our outstanding common stock. The record date was April 1, 2019 and the dividend was paid to shareholders on April 18, 2019. We anticipate this to be a recurring quarterly dividend with future payments and record dates, subject to board approval. On April 18, 2019, our Board of Directors approved a $0.116 per share quarterly cash dividend on our outstanding common stock. The record date is set for July 1, 2019 and the dividend is payable to shareholders of record on July 19, 2019.  
On March 22, 2019, the Company entered into a new credit agreement (the New Credit Agreement) by and among the Company, the Companys subsidiary, Monotype Imaging Inc., (the Borrower), any financial institution that becomes a Lender and Bank of America, N.A., as administrative agent. Pursuant to the New Credit Agreement the Lenders have agreed to provide the Borrower with a five-year $200.0 million senior secured revolving credit facility (the Credit Facility). The Credit Facility permits the Company to request that the Lenders, at their election, increase the secured credit facility to a maximum of $300.0 million. The Credit Facility provides more flexibility in addition to an increased borrowing capacity and extended terms, as defined above. The New Credit Agreement replaced the Companys existing $150.0 million revolving credit facility (the Original Credit Agreement) by and between the Company and Silicon Valley Bank. The Original Credit Agreement was terminated effective March 22, 2019 and was scheduled to expire on September 15, 2020. The Company had $75.0 million outstanding under the Original Credit Agreement at December 31, 2018. Available borrowings under the Original Credit Agreement were reduced by approximately $0.5 million for one standby letter of credit issued in connection with a facility lease agreement, leaving $74.5 million available for borrowings at December 31, 2018. At March 31, 2019, the Company had $70.0 million outstanding under the Credit Facility. Available borrowings under the Credit Facility have been reduced by approximately $0.5 million for one standby letter of credit issued in connection with a facility lease agreement, leaving $129.5 million available for borrowings at March 31, 2019.  
The New Credit Agreement includes financial covenants which require the Company to maintain (i) a consolidated leverage ratio of no greater than 3.25 to 1.0 or, upon a qualified acquisition subject to certain conditions, 3.75 to 1.0 and (ii) a minimum consolidated interest coverage ratio of 3.00 to 1.0. At March 31, 2019, our consolidated leverage ratio was 0.72 to 1.0 and our consolidated interest coverage ratio was 18.61 to 1.0. The New Credit Agreement also contains customary affirmative and negative covenants for transactions of this type and other affirmative and negative covenants agreed to by the parties, including, among others, limits on the Company and its subsidiaries ability to incur debt or liens, engage in sale-leaseback transactions, make loans, investments and acquisitions, incur additional indebtedness, engage in mergers, enter into asset sales, transact with affiliates and alter its business. Adjusted EBITDA, under the Credit Facility, is defined as consolidated net earnings (or loss), plus net interest expense, income taxes, depreciation and amortization, and share based compensation expense, plus acquisition expenses not to exceed $2.0 million, minus capitalized research and development expense, plus restructuring, issuance costs, cash non-operating costs and other expenses or losses minus cash non-operating gains and other non-cash gains; provided, however that the aggregate of all cash non-operating expense shall not exceed 10% of Consolidated EBITDA. The New Credit Agreement also provides for a number of customary events of default, including, among others, payment, bankruptcy, covenant, representation and warranty, change of control and judgment defaults. Failure to comply with these covenants, or the occurrence of an event of default, could permit the Lenders under the New Credit Agreement to declare all amounts borrowed under the New Credit Agreement, together with accrued interest and fees, to be immediately due and payable. The obligations of the Borrower under the Credit Facilities are unconditionally guaranteed by the Company and certain subsidiaries and secured by a lien on substantially all of the present and future property and assets of the Company and such subsidiaries, in each case, subject to limited exceptions and exclusions.  
The Credit Facility also contains provisions for an increased interest rate during periods of default. We do not believe that these covenants will affect our ability to operate our business, and we were in compliance with all covenants under our Credit Facility as of March 31, 2019.  
In our quarterly earnings press releases and conference calls, in addition to Adjusted EBITDA as discussed above, we discuss a key measure that is not calculated according to GAAP. This non-GAAP measure is net adjusted EBITDA, which is defined as income (loss) from operations before depreciation, amortization of acquired intangible assets, stock based compensation expense, acquisition-related compensation and one-time non-recurring expenses. We use net adjusted EBITDA as a principal indicator of the operating performance of our business. We use net adjusted EBITDA in internal forecasts and models when establishing internal operating budgets, supplementing the financial results and forecasts reported to our board of directors, determining bonus compensation for our employees based on operating performance and evaluating short-term and long-term operating trends in our operations. We believe that net adjusted EBITDA permits a comparative assessment of our operating performance, relative to our performance based on our GAAP results, while isolating the effects of charges that may vary from period-to-period without direct correlation to underlying operating performance. We believe that these non-GAAP financial adjustments are useful to investors because they allow investors to evaluate the effectiveness of the methodology and information used by management in our financial and operational decision-making. We believe that trends in our net adjusted EBITDA may be valuable indicators of our operating performance.  
For the three months ended March 31, 2019, the amount includes ($24) thousand of restructuring expenses. For the three months ended March 31, 2018, the amount includes $2.7 million of certain advisor fees related to shareholder activities, $2.2 million of royalty expenses, recorded in cost of sales, associated with revenue that was not recognized under ASC 606 and $0.2 million of restructuring expenses.  
For the three months ended March 31, 2019, the amount includes ($18) thousand, or $0.00 per share, net of tax, of restructuring expenses. For the three months ended March 31, 2018, the amount includes $2.1 million, or $0.05 per share, net of tax, of certain advisor fees related to shareholder activities, $1.7 million, or $0.04 per share, net of tax, of royalty expenses, recorded in cost of sales, associated with revenue that was not recognized under ASC 606 and $0.1 million, or $0.00 per share, net of tax, of restructuring expenses.
