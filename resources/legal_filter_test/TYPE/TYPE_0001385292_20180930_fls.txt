Forward-looking statements relate to future events or our future financial performance.
We generally identify forward-looking statements by terminology such as may, will, should, expects, plans, anticipates, could, intends, target, projects, contemplates, believes, estimates, predicts, potential or continue or the negative of these terms or other similar words.
These statements are only predictions.
Accordingly, you should not rely upon forward-looking statements as predictions of future events.
The forward-looking statements made in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q relate only to events as of the date on which the statements are made.
We undertake no obligation to update any forward-looking statement to reflect events or circumstances after the date on which the statement is made or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events.
