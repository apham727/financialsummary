For the three months ended September 30, 2018 and 2017, revenue from customers outside the United States comprised 54.5% and 53.8%, respectively, of our total revenue. For the nine months ended September 30, 2018 and 2017, revenue from customers outside the United States comprised 55.3% and 56.3%, respectively, of our total revenue. We expect that sales by our international subsidiaries will continue to represent a substantial portion of our revenue for the foreseeable future. Future international revenue will depend on the continued use and expansion of our products worldwide.  
We derive a significant portion of our OEM revenue from a limited number of customers, in particular manufacturers of laser printers and consumer electronic devices. For the three months ended September 30, 2018 and 2017, our top ten licensees by revenue, most of which are OEM customers, accounted for approximately 26.9% and 27.5% of our total revenue, respectively. For the nine months ended September 30, 2018 and 2017, our top ten licensees by revenue accounted for approximately 23.6% and 28.4% of our total revenue, respectively. Although no one customer accounted for more than 10% of our total revenue for the three months or nine months ended September 30, 2018 or 2017, if we are unable to maintain relationships with major customers or establish relationships with new customers, our licensing revenue will be adversely affected.

Gross profit from service revenue, before amortization of acquired technology, increased to 79.8% and 72.3%. See further discussion below for additional information regarding our period over period revenue and cost of revenue.  
Revenues by Market.  
Revenue was $58.0 million and $60.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively, a decrease of $2.5 million, or 4.2%.  
Creative Professional revenue was $36.1 million and $34.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively, an increase of $1.6 million, or 4.6%, mainly due to growth in sales to enterprise customers and increased service revenue as SaaS offerings continue to become a larger part of our portfolio.  
OEM revenue decreased $4.1 million, or 16.0%, to $21.9 million in the three months ended September 30, 2018, as compared to $26.0 million in the three months ended September 30, 2017. Revenue from our printer imaging OEM customers decreased period over period partially due to lower revenue from customers under fixed fee contracts and partially due to $2.0 million of one-time payments recognized in the third quarter of 2017 from the conversion of customers to fixed fee contracts from royalty bearing contracts. There was no corresponding item in the current period. Display imaging revenue decreased mainly due to a few large deals in the third quarter of 2017 that did not repeat in the third quarter of 2018.  
Cost of revenue, excluding amortization of acquired technology, was $9.4 million and $9.7 million for the three months ended September 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively, a decrease of $0.3 million, or 3.3%, mainly due to lower total revenue.  
The portion of cost of revenue consisting of amortization of acquired technology was unchanged at $0.9 million for the three months ended September 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively.  
Marketing and Selling. Marketing and selling expense decreased $4.3 million, or 18.9%, to $18.2 million in the three months ended September 30, 2018, as compared to $22.5 million in the same period in 2017. Personnel and personnel related expenses decreased $3.2 million, period over period, due to lower headcount mainly from our restructuring actions in the second quarter of 2018. Targeted marketing spending and consulting together decreased $1.1 million in the third quarter of 2018, as compared to the same period in 2017, due to portfolio decisions around discretionary programs. Decreased facilities expense, mainly due to the consolidation of certain regional offices in 2017, was offset by increased software expenses, mainly due to investments in information systems supporting the Creative Professional business, period over period.  
Research and Development. Research and development expense was $7.7 million and $9.0 million in the three months ended September 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively, a decrease of $1.3 million, or 14.6%, primarily due to lower personnel expenses. Personnel and personnel related expenses decreased $1.2 million, period over period, due to lower headcount mainly from restructuring actions in the second quarter of 2018 and in the fourth quarter of 2017.  
Restructuring. Restructuring expense was $0.2 million in the three months ended September 30, 2018 due to additional severance expense and charges associated with the closure of one of our regional offices. There were no similar charges in the same period in 2017.  
Amortization of Other Intangible Assets. Amortization of other intangible assets was $0.9 million and $1.0 million in the three months ended September 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively, a decrease of $0.1 million, or 16.8%.  
Interest expense, net of interest income was $0.8 million and $0.7 million in the three months ended September 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively, an increase of $0.1 million, or 18.2%, mainly due to increases in interest rates on our outstanding borrowings, partially offset by a reduction in the balance outstanding.  
Losses on foreign exchange were $0.4 million and $1.4 million in the three months ended September 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively, a decrease of $1.0 million, primarily the result of currency fluctuations on our foreign denominated receivables and payables. In the three months ended September 30, 2017, the loss was primarily due to the strengthening of the Euro, as compared to the U.S. dollar, on U.S. dollar denominated receivables held by our foreign subsidiaries.  
Loss (gain) on derivatives was a gain of $47 thousand and a loss of $0.1 million in the three months ended September 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively, a decrease of $0.1 million, due to our 30-day forward currency contracts.  
The statutory tax rate in the three months ended September 30, 2018 is 21.0%, as compared to the U.S. statutory tax rate of 35.0% in the same period in 2017.  
Non-deductible expenses added 14.9% to the effective tax rate for the three months ended September 30, 2018, as compared to 40.7% in the same period in 2017, primarily due to increased income before taxes.  
In addition, the effective rate for the three months ended September 30, 2018 was reduced by 4.2% for a reduction in reserves resulting from the expiration of statutes of limitations. State and local taxes, net of federal benefit, provided a benefit of 4.3% in the three months ended September 30, 2017, as compared to 0.0% for the three months ended September 30, 2018, mainly due to adjustments to our deferred state tax balances, which resulted from changes in our estimated state tax rate.  
License revenue decreased primarily due to certain one-time printer revenue recognized in the nine months ended September 30, 2017, as a result of conversion of customers to fixed fee contracts from royalty bearing contracts, partially offset by growth in sales to our enterprise customers. There was no corresponding item in the current period. In addition, our royalty based revenue is lower in the nine months ended September 30, 2018, a result of the adoption of ASC 606. We now estimate and accrue our royalty-based revenue in the quarter when the royalty-based units are shipped, as opposed to when those shipments were reported to us by the licensee under legacy GAAP. This change had the effect of shifting traditional holiday seasonality revenue for consumer electronics from the first quarter of 2018 to the fourth quarter of 2017.  
Service revenue has increased primarily due to the growth of our SaaS-based product offerings, including our Mosaic solution.  
Gross profit from license revenue, before amortization of acquired technology, decreased to 82.9% from 85.3%, primarily due to additional non-recurring royalty expense in the nine months ended September 30, 2018 for which there was no corresponding revenue in the corresponding period in 2017, in accordance with ASC 606. Gross profit from service revenue, before amortization of acquired technology, increased to 77.6% from 73.4%. See further discussion below for additional information regarding our period over period revenue and cost of revenue.

Revenue from our printer imaging OEM customers decreased period over period partially due to $6.1 million of one-time payments recognized in the nine months ended September 30, 2017 from the conversion of customers to fixed fee contracts from royalty bearing contracts. There was no corresponding item in the current period. Additionally, we recorded lower royalty based revenue as a result of the adoption of ASC 606. We now estimate and accrue royalty-based revenue in the quarter when the royalty-based units are shipped, as opposed to when those shipments were reported to us by the licensee under legacy GAAP. This change had the effect of shifting traditional holiday seasonality revenue for consumer electronics from the first quarter of 2018 to the fourth quarter of 2017.  
Amortization of acquired technology was unchanged at $2.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively.  
Gross profit was 80.4% in the nine months ended September 30, 2018, as compared to 81.7% in the nine months ended September 30, 2017, a decrease of 1.3 percentage points partially due to the additional non-recurring royalty expense as described above, and partially due to the continued shift in product mix between Creative Professional and the higher margin OEM business.

Decreased facilities expense contributed $0.4 million to the overall decrease period over period, due to the consolidation of certain regional offices in 2017. Consulting expense decreased $0.4 million, period over period due to the timing of projects.  
General and Administrative. General and administrative expense was $38.3 million and $34.0 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively, an increase of $4.3 million, or 12.4%.

Included in restructuring costs is a $3.2 million write down of intangible assets and goodwill allocated to the Swyft business, which was discontinued in connection with the restructuring action announced in June 2018. Severance expenses totaled $4.4 million and an acceleration of Swyft deferred compensation payment resulted in an incremental charge of $0.5 million mainly due to the restructuring action in the second quarter of 2018. Facilities charges were $0.1 million due to the closure of one of our regional offices in the third quarter of 2018. These charges were partially offset by a $1.4 million reversal of stock based compensation expense as a result of forfeitures of awards by employees included in the restructuring plan. There were no similar charges in the same period in 2017.

In addition, a net windfall on stock based compensation resulted in a 1.1% reduction in the effective rate for the nine months ended September 30, 2018, as compared to a shortfall rate in the same period in 2017 that resulted in a 61.5% increase in the effective rate. Further, state and local taxes reduced the effective tax rate for the nine months ended September 30, 2017 by 18.0%, as compared to 0.8% in the current period. For the nine months ended September 30, 2018 the change in state tax resulted mainly from adjustments to our deferred stat tax balances which resulted from changes in our estimated state tax rate.  
Information concerning recently issued accounting pronouncements may be found in Note 3 to our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.  
Since our inception, we have financed our operations primarily through cash from operations, private and public stock sales and long-term debt arrangements, as described below. We believe our existing cash and cash equivalents, our cash flow from operating activities and available bank borrowings will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash needs for at least one year from the issuance of these financial statements. At September 30, 2018, our principal sources of liquidity were cash and cash equivalents totaling $70.1 million and a $150.0 million revolving credit facility, of which there was $80.0 million of outstanding borrowings. On May 3, 2018, our Board of Directors approved a share repurchase program of up to $25.0 million of our outstanding common stock, which permits purchases through June 7, 2019. In the nine months ended September 30, 2018, we used $6.7 million in cash to purchase shares under the plan. At September 30, 2018, the plan has $18.3 million available for future purchases. Our future working capital requirements will depend on many factors, including the operations of our existing business, our potential strategic expansion and future acquisitions we might undertake.  
Accrued expenses and accounts payable used $10.8 million, inclusive of large non-recurring payments of deferred compensation of $10.0 million, additional royalty payments resulting from the adoption of ASC 606 of $2.1 million and payment of investor relations advisor fees of $2.2 million. In addition, we paid 2017 accrued variable compensation, offset by additional restructuring accruals. Decreased accounts receivable, net of decreased deferred revenue generated $1.2 million in cash, primarily a result of customer payments received, net of an increase in unbilled receivables due to the adoption of ASC 606. Prepaid expense and other assets used $4.8 million in cash, mainly due to an increase in long term unbilled receivables and capitalized contract costs related to the adoption of ASC 606. Accrued income taxes used $1.7 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2018.  
We generated $21.5 million in cash from operations during the nine months ended September 30, 2017.

Increased prepaid expenses and other assets combined with decreased accounts payable, offset by an increase in accrued expenses and other liabilities, used $1.4 million, which is mainly due to the timing of payments. Accrued income taxes used $0.3 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2017. Increased accounts receivable, coupled with decreased deferred revenue used $2.9 million net in cash, which is mainly due to the timing of customer payments.

Net adjusted EBITDA is not a measure of operating performance under GAAP and should not be considered as an alternative or substitute for GAAP profitability measures such as income (loss) from operations and net income (loss). Net adjusted EBITDA as an operating performance measure has material limitations since it excludes the statement of income impact of depreciation and amortization expense and stock based compensation and therefore does not represent an accurate measure of profitability. We have significant intangible assets and amortization expense is a meaningful element in our financial statements and therefore its exclusion from net adjusted EBITDA is a material limitation. Stock based compensation and the associated expense has a meaningful impact on our financial statements and therefore its exclusion from net adjusted EBITDA is a material limitation. Non-recurring expenses, such as certain advisor fees, royalty expenses and restructuring expenses, have a meaningful impact on our financial statements and therefore its exclusion from net adjusted EBITDA is a material limitation. As a result, net adjusted EBITDA should be evaluated in conjunction with net income (loss) for complete analysis of our profitability, as net income (loss) includes the financial statement impact of these items and is the most directly comparable GAAP performance measure to net adjusted EBITDA. As net adjusted EBITDA is not defined by GAAP, our definition of net adjusted EBITDA may differ from and therefore may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies, thereby limiting its usefulness as a comparative measure. Because of the limitations that net adjusted EBITDA has as an analytical tool, investors should not consider it in isolation, or as a substitute for analysis of our operating results as reported under GAAP.
