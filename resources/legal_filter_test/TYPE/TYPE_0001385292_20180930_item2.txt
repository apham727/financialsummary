We use the straight-line method to amortize acquired technology.
Creative Professional revenue is growing at a faster rate than OEM revenue.
We expect these trends to continue.
License revenue decreased primarily due to certain one-time printer revenue recognized in the third quarter of 2017, as a result of conversion of customers to fixed fee contracts from royalty bearing contracts.
In addition, our royalty based revenue is lower in the three months ended September 30, 2018, as a result of the adoption of ASC 606.
Service revenue has increased primarily due to the growth of our SaaS-based product offerings, including our Mosaic solution.
Gross profit from license revenue, before amortization of acquired technology, decreased to 84.8% from 86.4%, period over period.
Gross profit from service revenue, before amortization of acquired technology, increased to 79.8% and 72.3%.
See further discussion below for additional information regarding our period over period revenue and cost of revenue.
Revenues by Market.
Revenue was $58.0 million and $60.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively, a decrease of $2.5 million, or 4.2%.
Creative Professional revenue was $36.1 million and $34.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively, an increase of $1.6 million, or 4.6%, mainly due to growth in sales to enterprise customers and increased service revenue as SaaS offerings continue to become a larger part of our portfolio.
OEM revenue decreased $4.1 million, or 16.0%, to $21.9 million in the three months ended September 30, 2018, as compared to $26.0 million in the three months ended September 30, 2017.
Revenue from our printer imaging OEM customers decreased period over period partially due to lower revenue from customers under fixed fee contracts and partially due to $2.0 million of one-time payments recognized in the third quarter of 2017 from the conversion of customers to fixed fee contracts from royalty bearing contracts.
Display imaging revenue decreased mainly due to a few large deals in the third quarter of 2017 that did not repeat in the third quarter of 2018.
Cost of revenue, excluding amortization of acquired technology, was $9.4 million and $9.7 million for the three months ended September 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively, a decrease of $0.3 million, or 3.3%, mainly due to lower total revenue.
The portion of cost of revenue consisting of amortization of acquired technology was unchanged at $0.9 million for the three months ended September 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively.
Marketing and Selling.
Marketing and selling expense decreased $4.3 million, or 18.9%, to $18.2 million in the three months ended September 30, 2018, as compared to $22.5 million in the same period in 2017.
Personnel and personnel related expenses decreased $3.2 million, period over period, due to lower headcount mainly from our restructuring actions in the second quarter of 2018.
Targeted marketing spending and consulting together decreased $1.1 million in the third quarter of 2018, as compared to the same period in 2017, due to portfolio decisions around discretionary programs.
Decreased facilities expense, mainly due to the consolidation of certain regional offices in 2017, was offset by increased software expenses, mainly due to investments in information systems supporting the Creative Professional business, period over period.
Research and development expense was $7.7 million and $9.0 million in the three months ended September 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively, a decrease of $1.3 million, or 14.6%, primarily due to lower personnel expenses.
Personnel and personnel related expenses decreased $1.2 million, period over period, due to lower headcount mainly from restructuring actions in the second quarter of 2018 and in the fourth quarter of 2017.
Audit and legal expenses together decreased $0.4 million in the third quarter of 2018, as compared to the same period in 2017, mainly due to lower audit fees in the third quarter of 2018 and additional expenses incurred related to shareholder activities in the prior period, which did not recur.
Restructuring.
Restructuring expense was $0.2 million in the three months ended September 30, 2018 due to additional severance expense and charges associated with the closure of one of our regional offices.
Amortization of other intangible assets was $0.9 million and $1.0 million in the three months ended September 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively, a decrease of $0.1 million, or 16.8%.
Interest expense, net of interest income was $0.8 million and $0.7 million in the three months ended September 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively, an increase of $0.1 million, or 18.2%, mainly due to increases in interest rates on our outstanding borrowings, partially offset by a reduction in the balance outstanding.
Losses on foreign exchange were $0.4 million and $1.4 million in the three months ended September 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively, a decrease of $1.0 million, primarily the result of currency fluctuations on our foreign denominated receivables and payables.
In the three months ended September 30, 2017, the loss was primarily due to the strengthening of the Euro, as compared to the U.S. dollar, on U.S. dollar denominated receivables held by our foreign subsidiaries.
Loss (gain) on derivatives was a gain of $47 thousand and a loss of $0.1 million in the three months ended September 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively, a decrease of $0.1 million, due to our 30-day forward currency contracts.
The statutory tax rate in the three months ended September 30, 2018 is 21.0%, as compared to the U.S. statutory tax rate of 35.0% in the same period in 2017.
Foreign rate differential increased our effective rate 30.4% in the three months ended September 30, 2018, as compared to a decrease of 2.7% in the same period in 2017, due to changes in tax treatment of foreign earnings under The Act.
Non-deductible expenses added 14.9% to the effective tax rate for the three months ended September 30, 2018, as compared to 40.7% in the same period in 2017, primarily due to increased income before taxes.
In addition, the effective rate for the three months ended September 30, 2018 was reduced by 4.2% for a reduction in reserves resulting from the expiration of statutes of limitations.
License revenue decreased primarily due to certain one-time printer revenue recognized in the nine months ended September 30, 2017, as a result of conversion of customers to fixed fee contracts from royalty bearing contracts, partially offset by growth in sales to our enterprise customers.
In addition, our royalty based revenue is lower in the nine months ended September 30, 2018, a result of the adoption of ASC 606.
This change had the effect of shifting traditional holiday seasonality revenue for consumer electronics from the first quarter of 2018 to the fourth quarter of 2017.
Service revenue has increased primarily due to the growth of our SaaS-based product offerings, including our Mosaic solution.
Gross profit from license revenue, before amortization of acquired technology, decreased to 82.9% from 85.3%, primarily due to additional non-recurring royalty expense in the nine months ended September 30, 2018 for which there was no corresponding revenue in the corresponding period in 2017, in accordance with ASC 606.
See further discussion below for additional information regarding our period over period revenue and cost of revenue.
The following discussion compares the nine months ended September 30, 2018 with the nine months ended September 30, 2017.

Revenue from our printer imaging OEM customers decreased period over period partially due to $6.1 million of one-time payments recognized in the nine months ended September 30, 2017 from the conversion of customers to fixed fee contracts from royalty bearing contracts.
Additionally, we recorded lower royalty based revenue as a result of the adoption of ASC 606.
This change had the effect of shifting traditional holiday seasonality revenue for consumer electronics from the first quarter of 2018 to the fourth quarter of 2017.

Gross profit was 80.4% in the nine months ended September 30, 2018, as compared to 81.7% in the nine months ended September 30, 2017, a decrease of 1.3 percentage points partially due to the additional non-recurring royalty expense as described above, and partially due to the continued shift in product mix between Creative Professional and the higher margin OEM business.
Marketing and Selling.

Restructuring.
There was no restructuring expense in the same period in 2017.
Included in restructuring costs is a $3.2 million write down of intangible assets and goodwill allocated to the Swyft business, which was discontinued in connection with the restructuring action announced in June 2018.
Severance expenses totaled $4.4 million and an acceleration of Swyft deferred compensation payment resulted in an incremental charge of $0.5 million mainly due to the restructuring action in the second quarter of 2018.
Facilities charges were $0.1 million due to the closure of one of our regional offices in the third quarter of 2018.
These charges were partially offset by a $1.4 million reversal of stock based compensation expense as a result of forfeitures of awards by employees included in the restructuring plan.
Amortization of other intangible assets was $2.8 million and $3.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively, a decrease of $0.2 million, or 7.0%.
Interest expense, net of interest income was $2.4 million and $2.1 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively, an increase of $0.3 million, or 14.4%, as reductions in outstanding borrowings under our revolving line of credit were offset by an increase in interest rates.
Loss (gain) on derivatives were a gain of $0.1 million and a loss of $0.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively, a decrease of $0.4 million, due to our 30-day forward currency contracts.
As a result of the enactment of The Act in December 2017, the statutory tax rate in the nine months ended September 30, 2018 is 21.0%, as compared to the U.S. statutory tax rate of 35.0% in the same period in 2017.
Foreign rate differential increased our effective rate 31.4% in the nine months ended September 30, 2018, as compared to a decrease of 3.6% in the same period in 2017, due to changes in tax treatment of foreign earnings under The Act.
Non-deductible expenses added 15.0% to the effective tax rate for the nine months ended September 30, 2018, as compared to 55.9% in the same period in 2017, as a result of the increase in income before taxes and changes in deductibility of certain expenses under The Act.
In addition, a net windfall on stock based compensation resulted in a 1.1% reduction in the effective rate for the nine months ended September 30, 2018, as compared to a shortfall rate in the same period in 2017 that resulted in a 61.5% increase in the effective rate.
Further, state and local taxes reduced the effective tax rate for the nine months ended September 30, 2017 by 18.0%, as compared to 0.8% in the current period.
For the nine months ended September 30, 2018 the change in state tax resulted mainly from adjustments to our deferred stat tax balances which resulted from changes in our estimated state tax rate.
Information concerning recently issued accounting pronouncements may be found in Note 3 to our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.
Since our inception, we have financed our operations primarily through cash from operations, private and public stock sales and long-term debt arrangements, as described below.
We believe our existing cash and cash equivalents, our cash flow from operating activities and available bank borrowings will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash needs for at least one year from the issuance of these financial statements.
At September 30, 2018, our principal sources of liquidity were cash and cash equivalents totaling $70.1 million and a $150.0 million revolving credit facility, of which there was $80.0 million of outstanding borrowings.
On May 3, 2018, our Board of Directors approved a share repurchase program of up to $25.0 million of our outstanding common stock, which permits purchases through June 7, 2019.
In the nine months ended September 30, 2018, we used $6.7 million in cash to purchase shares under the plan.
At September 30, 2018, the plan has $18.3 million available for future purchases.
We generated $11.4 million in cash from operations during the nine months ended September 30, 2018.
Net income, after adjusting for depreciation and amortization, loss on retirement of fixed assets, amortization of deferred financing costs and accretion of interest, stock based compensation, provision for doubtful accounts, deferred income taxes and unrealized currency gain on foreign denominated intercompany transactions generated $24.3 million in cash.
The non-cash impairment of Swyft related intangible assets added back $3.2 million.
Accrued expenses and accounts payable used $10.8 million, inclusive of large non-recurring payments of deferred compensation of $10.0 million, additional royalty payments resulting from the adoption of ASC 606 of $2.1 million and payment of investor relations advisor fees of $2.2 million.
Decreased accounts receivable, net of decreased deferred revenue generated $1.2 million in cash, primarily a result of customer payments received, net of an increase in unbilled receivables due to the adoption of ASC 606.
Prepaid expense and other assets used $4.8 million in cash, mainly due to an increase in long term unbilled receivables and capitalized contract costs related to the adoption of ASC 606.
Accrued income taxes used $1.7 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2018.
Variations in operating cash flows occur from time-to-time because our enterprise customers make upfront payments on subscription revenue.
The timing and extent of such payments may significantly impact our cash balances.
We generated $21.5 million in cash from operations during the nine months ended September 30, 2017.
Net income, after adjusting for depreciation and amortization, loss on retirement of fixed assets, loss on debt extinguishment, amortization of deferred financing costs and accretion of interest, stock based compensation, excess tax benefit on stock options, provision for doubtful accounts, deferred income taxes and unrealized currency gain on foreign denominated intercompany transactions generated $26.1 million in cash.
Increased prepaid expenses and other assets combined with decreased accounts payable, offset by an increase in accrued expenses and other liabilities, used $1.4 million, which is mainly due to the timing of payments.
Accrued income taxes used $0.3 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2017.
Increased accounts receivable, coupled with decreased deferred revenue used $2.9 million net in cash, which is mainly due to the timing of customer payments.
During the nine months ended September 30, 2018, we used $2.8 million in investing activities mainly for the purchase of property and equipment.
During the nine months ended September 30, 2017, we used $5.3 million in investing activities mainly for the purchase of property and equipment.
We received cash from the exercises of stock options of $3.5 million.

We received cash from the exercises of stock options of $1.0 million.
We paid cash dividends of $14.0 million and paid $9.0 million on our outstanding revolving line of credit.

On July 25, 2018 our Board of Directors approved a $0.116 per share or $4.9 million, quarterly cash dividend on our outstanding common stock.
The record date was October 1, 2018 and the dividend was paid to shareholders of record on October 19, 2018.
We anticipate this to be a recurring quarterly dividend with future payments and record dates, subject to board approval.
On October 25, 2018, the Companys Board of Directors approved a $0.116 per share quarterly cash dividend on our outstanding common stock.
On September 15, 2015, the Company entered into a new credit agreement (the New Credit Agreement) by and among the Company, the Companys subsidiary, Monotype Imaging Inc., any financial institution that becomes a Lender (as defined therein) and Silicon Valley Bank, as agent which provides for a five-year $150.0 million secured revolving credit facility (the Credit Facility).
The Credit Facility permits the Company to request that the Lenders, at their election, increase the secured credit facility to a maximum of $200.0 million.
The Credit Facility is available to the Company on a revolving basis through September 15, 2020.
Repayment of any amounts borrowed are not required until maturity of the Credit Facility.
However, the Company may repay any amounts borrowed at any time, without premium or penalty.
Borrowings under the Credit Facility bear a variable rate not less than zero based upon, at the Companys option, either LIBOR or the higher of (i) the prime rate as published in the Wall Street Journal and (ii) 0.5% plus the overnight federal funds rate, plus in each case, an applicable margin.
At September 30, 2018, our rate, inclusive of applicable margins, was 3.8% for LIBOR, and at December 31, 2017, our rate, inclusive of applicable margins, was 3.1% for LIBOR.
The Company had outstanding borrowings under the Credit Facility of $80.0 million at September 30, 2018, and $93.0 million at December 31, 2017.
The Credit Facility has $0.5 million reserved for one stand-by letter of credit in connection with a facility lease agreement, leaving $69.5 million and $56.5 million available for borrowing at September 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017, respectively.
Adjusted EBITDA is not a measure of operating performance under GAAP and should not be considered as an alternative or substitute for GAAP profitability measures such as income (loss) from operations and net income (loss).
Adjusted EBITDA as an operating performance measure has material limitations since it excludes the statement of operations impact of depreciation and amortization expense, interest expense, net, the provision (benefit) for income taxes and stock based compensation and therefore does not represent an accurate measure of profitability, particularly in situations where a company is highly leveraged or has a disadvantageous tax structure.
Therefore, their exclusion from Adjusted EBITDA is a material limitation.
As a result, Adjusted EBITDA should be evaluated in conjunction with net income for complete analysis of our profitability, as net income includes the financial statement impact of these items and is the most directly comparable GAAP operating performance measure to Adjusted EBITDA.
The Credit Facility also contains provisions for an increased interest rate during periods of default.
This non-GAAP measure is net adjusted EBITDA, which is defined as net income (loss) before interest expense, net, other (income) expense, net, provision for income taxes, depreciation, amortization of acquired intangible assets and stock based compensation expenses.
We use net adjusted EBITDA as a principal indicator of the operating performance of our business.
This non-GAAP measure is non-GAAP earnings per diluted share, which is defined as earnings per diluted share before amortization of acquired intangible assets, stock based compensation expenses and acquisition-related compensation.
This change more accurately reflects managements view of the Companys business and financial performance.
The three months and nine months ended September 30, 2017 have been restated for comparison purposes.
For the nine months ended September 30, 2018, $1.4 million, or $0.03 per share, of stock based compensation expense was reversed as a result of forfeitures of awards by employees included in the restructuring plan.
This non-recurring amount has been included in restructuring expenses.
For the nine months ended September 30, 2018, the amount includes $2.4 million, or $0.07 per share, of expense associated with the deferred compensation arrangement resulting from the Olapic acquisition and $0.5 million, or $0.01 per share, of expense associated with the deferred compensation arrangement resulting from the Amendment to the Swyft Merger Agreement.
For the nine months ended September 30, 2017, the amount includes $2.6 million, or $0.07 per share, of expense associated with the deferred compensation arrangement resulting from the Olapic acquisition and $1.6 million, or $0.04 per share, of expense associated with the deferred compensation arrangement resulting from the Amendment to the Swyft Merger Agreement.
For the three months ended September 30, 2017, the amount includes $0.2 million of certain advisor fees related to shareholder activities.
For the nine months ended September 30, 2017, the amount includes $0.2 million of certain advisor fees related to shareholder activities.
For the three months ended September 30, 2018, the amount includes $0.2 million, or $0.00 per share, net of tax, of restructuring expenses.
For the three months ended September 30, 2017, the amount includes $0.1 million, or $0.00 per share, net of tax, of certain advisor fees related to shareholder activities.
For the nine months ended September 30, 2018, the amount includes $2.1 million, or $0.05 per share, net of tax, of certain advisor fees related to shareholder activities, $1.7 million, or $0.04 per share, net of tax, of royalty expenses, recorded in cost of sales, associated with revenue that was not recognized under ASC 606 and $5.2 million, or $0.13 per share, net of tax, of restructuring expenses.
For the nine months ended September 30, 2017, the amount includes $0.1 million, or $0.00 per share, net of tax, of certain advisor fees related to shareholder activities.
Net adjusted EBITDA is not a measure of operating performance under GAAP and should not be considered as an alternative or substitute for GAAP profitability measures such as income (loss) from operations and net income (loss).
We have significant intangible assets and amortization expense is a meaningful element in our financial statements and therefore its exclusion from net adjusted EBITDA is a material limitation.
As a result, net adjusted EBITDA should be evaluated in conjunction with net income (loss) for complete analysis of our profitability, as net income (loss) includes the financial statement impact of these items and is the most directly comparable GAAP performance measure to net adjusted EBITDA.
As net adjusted EBITDA is not defined by GAAP, our definition of net adjusted EBITDA may differ from and therefore may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies, thereby limiting its usefulness as a comparative measure.
