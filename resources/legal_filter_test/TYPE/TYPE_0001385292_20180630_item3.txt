Deposits of cash held outside the United States totaled approximately $23.6 million and $24.3 million at June 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017, respectively.
We grant credit to customers in the ordinary course of business.
Credit evaluations are performed on an ongoing basis to reduce credit risk, and no collateral is required from our customers.
An allowance for uncollectible accounts is provided for those accounts receivable considered to be uncollectible based upon historical experience and credit evaluation.
Historically, we have not recorded material losses due to customers nonpayment.
Our Creative Professional business consists of a higher volume of lower dollar value transactions.
For the three and six months ended June 30, 2018 and 2017, no customer accounted for more than 10% of our revenue.
Our exposure to market risk associated with changes in interest rates relates primarily to our long-term debt.
At June 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017, the Company had borrowings under our revolving Credit Facility of $85.0 million and $93.0 million, respectively.
The interest rate on our Credit Facility fluctuates with either the prime rate or the LIBOR interest rate and at June 30, 2018, our rate was 3.8% for LIBOR.
A 10% increase in the rate would have increased our interest expense by $0.2 million.
As discussed in Note 15, our wholly-owned Olapic Argentina S.A. subsidiary employs approximately 93 people whose functions mainly include development, sales support and administration.
The Argentinian economy was recently determined to be highly inflationary.
Argentinas inflation rate reached this threshold with the quarterly period ended June 30, 2018.
The average quarterly exchange rate for the Argentinian peso has devalued approximately 23.6% and 33.4% in the three and six months ended June 30, 2018, respectively.
The operation is a service center supporting the companys products and generates no revenue.
For the interim periods ended June 30, 2018, the functional currency for our subsidiary is the Argentinian peso, the foreign entitys local currency.
In accordance with this designation, we are required to apply the guidance in ASC Topic 830, Foreign Currency Matters, (Subtopic ASC 830-10-45-10), and account for a change in functional currency from the Argentinian peso to the U.S. dollar effective July 1, 2018.
In the period from that date until payment in the customers functional currency is received and converted into U.S. dollars, we can incur realized gains and losses.
We are currently utilizing 30-day forward contracts to mitigate our exposure on these currency fluctuations.
Any increase or decrease in the fair value of the forward contracts is offset by the change in the value of the hedged assets of our consolidated foreign affiliate.
At June 30, 2018, we had one 30-day forward contract to sell 2.6 million British pounds sterling and to purchase $3.4 million that together, had an immaterial fair value, and at December 31, 2017, we had one 30-day forward contract to sell 2.5 million British pound sterling and to purchase $3.4 million that together, had an immaterial fair value.
