These unaudited condensed consolidated interim financial statements should be read in conjunction with the Companys audited consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2017, as reported in the Companys Annual Report on Form 10-K. The Companys significant accounting policies and practices are as described in the Annual Report, except for the adoption of the accounting standards described in Note 3 below.  
We classify cloud-based subscriptions and other services, such as font related services, custom font design and post contract support as service revenue on our condensed consolidated statements of operations. All other revenue is classified as license revenue.  
At September 30, 2018, our wholly-owned Olapic Argentina S.A. subsidiary employs approximately 99 people whose functions mainly include development, sales support and administration. The monthly operations average between $0.4 million and $0.5 million. The Argentinian economy was recently determined to be highly inflationary. A highly inflationary economy is one where the cumulative inflation rate for the three years preceding the beginning of the reporting period, including interim reporting periods, is in excess of 100 percent. Argentinas inflation rate reached this threshold with the quarterly period ended June 30, 2018. For interim periods ended prior to July 1, 2018, the functional currency for our subsidiary is the Argentinian peso, the foreign entitys local currency.  
For a highly inflationary economy, we followed the guidance in ASC Topic 830, Foreign Currency Matters, (Subtopic ASC 830-10-45) and accounted for the change in functional currency from the Argentinian peso to the U.S. dollar effective July 1, 2018. Under this guidance, translation adjustments are not removed from equity, and the translated amounts for nonmonetary assets and liabilities at the end of the prior period become the accounting basis for those assets both in the period of the change and in subsequent periods. A change in functional currency due to an economys designation as highly inflationary results from changes in economic factors (i.e., inflation); therefore, such a change is not considered a change in accounting policy or accounting principle. The change in functional currency did not have a material impact on financial position, operating results or cash flow.  
3. Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements  
In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board, or FASB, and the International Accounting Standards Board jointly issued ASU 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606) (ASC 606), which outlines a comprehensive five-step revenue recognition model based on a principle that replaces virtually all existing revenue recognition rules under U.S. GAAP and which requires revenue to be recognized in a manner to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to a customer at an amount that reflects the consideration expected to be received in exchange for those goods or services. ASU 2014-09 also provided the guidance in ASC Topic 340, Other Assets and Deferred CostsContracts with Customers (Subtopic 340-40), which includes criteria for the capitalization and amortization of certain contract acquisition and fulfillment costs. The standard requires retrospective application; however, it allows entities to choose either full retrospective adoption, in which the standard is applied to all of the periods presented, or modified retrospective adoption, in which the cumulative catch-up adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings is recognized at the date of application, with additional disclosures required to describe these effects.  
We adopted the standard on January 1, 2018, and applied the modified retrospective method of adoption and have elected to apply the new standard only to contracts not completed at January 1, 2018, which represents contracts for which all (or substantially all) of the revenues have not been recognized under existing guidance as of the date of adoption.  
Contract assets, short term are included in the accounts receivables, net of allowance for doubtful accounts in our condensed consolidated balance sheet.  
Capitalized contract costs, long term are included in other assets in our condensed consolidated balance sheet.  
Deferred revenue, long term is included in other long-term liabilities in our condensed consolidated balance sheet.  
In addition, we recognized additional royalty expenses totaling approximately $2.2 million, or $0.05 per share, upon the adoption of ASC 606, as an indirect effect of a change in accounting principle. These amounts are included in cost of revenue  license in the accompanying condensed consolidated statement of operations for the nine months ended September 30, 2018.  
Under legacy GAAP, revenue related to our term licenses that were bundled with service-related performance obligations when vendor-specific objective evidence (VSOE) did not exist was required to be recognized ratably over the term of the agreement. Under ASC 606, the Company allocates revenue to each performance obligation in the contract and each performance obligation is accounted for separately; the license revenue is recognized at the time of delivery and the service revenue is recognized over time based on their relative standalone selling prices. The application of this provision is particularly impactful to our new Mosaic product offering which was launched in the first quarter of 2018. This new offering bundles our traditional font licenses with a SaaS based portal, which under legacy GAAP would have been recognized ratably. This provision also has resulted in some revenue from contracts signed prior to 2018 being accelerated and recorded to retained earnings instead of in our operating results in 2018 and beyond.  
ASC 606 requires certain incremental costs related to contract acquisition, such as sales commissions, and contract fulfillment costs to be capitalized and amortized over the expected period of benefit whereas the Company had previously recognized such expenses as incurred.  
Please see Note 4 for the Companys policies related to revenue recognition and accounting for costs to obtain and fulfill a customer contract.  
In March 2017, the FASB issued ASU No. 2017-07, Compensation-Retirement Benefits (Topic 715)-Improving the Presentation of Net Periodic Pension Cost and Net Periodic Postretirement Benefit Cost. This guidance revises the presentation of the net periodic benefit cost in the income statement. The new standard is effective for annual and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2017. We adopted ASU 2017-07 on January 1, 2018 and there was no material impact on our consolidated financial statements.  
The Company will adopt this ASU on January 1, 2019 and has begun planning for adoption by implementing new lease accounting software, and by working to establish additional changes to our processes and internal controls to ensure all requirements are met upon adoption. The standard allows for a modified retrospective approach or a modified retrospective approach with comparatives under 840 option, where entities would recognize a cumulative effect to retained earnings at the date of adoption without restating prior periods balances or disclosures. The Company plans to use the modified retrospective approach with comparatives under 840 option that will not require revising comparative period information or disclosure. We will elect the package of practical expedients permitted under the transition guidance within the new standard, which among other things, allows us to carryforward the historical lease classification. In addition, we are electing the hindsight practical expedient to determine the lease term for existing leases. We will also elect the practical expedient that allows an accounting policy election to exclude right of use assets and lease obligations from the balance sheet for all leases with an initial term of 12 months or less.  
We adopted ASC 606 on January 1, 2018 using the modified retrospective method for all contracts not completed as of the date of adoption. The reported results for 2018 reflect the application of ASC 606 guidance while the reported results for 2017 were prepared under legacy GAAP. The adoption of ASC 606 represents a change in accounting principle that will more closely align revenue recognition with the delivery of our products and services and will provide financial statement readers with enhanced disclosures.  
Our Creative Professional revenue is primarily derived from rights to use font licenses, custom font design services and hosted software as a service, or SaaS, offerings. We license fonts directly to end-users through our direct sales organization, e-commerce websites and indirectly through third-party resellers. Web font and digital ad related services refer to our web font services and web design tools. Our customers include graphic designers, advertising agencies, media organizations and corporations.  
Revenue from font licenses is recognized upfront when the font software is delivered or made available to the customer. Custom font design services are generally not a separate distinct performance obligation and are sold with a license for the custom font, in which case revenue is recognized upon completion of the services and when the font is delivered and  
 accepted by the customer. In limited cases, the Company has an enforceable right to payment prior to final delivery and acceptance of custom font design work. In these cases, the Company has determined that the proper treatment is a single over-time performance obligation using input methods (incurred hours towards completion) to measure progress towards completion to determine the pattern of satisfaction of the performance obligation.  
For our hosted offerings where we provide our customers the right to access our software without taking possession, revenue is recognized over the contract period on a time-elapsed basis, which is consistent with the transfer of service to the customer. Payment terms and conditions for Creative Professional contracts generally require payment within thirty to sixty days of contract inception. An exception exists for certain contracts for our SaaS offerings or a limited number of multi-year term license agreements which have periodic payment terms, generally quarterly or annually, over the term of the contract. In instances where the timing of revenue recognition differs from the respective payment terms, we have considered whether such contracts include a significant financing component, subject to the applicable practical expedient. The purpose of these payment structures is to align with industry and market standards, not to provide customers with financing. We have determined our contracts generally do not include a significant financing component; however, the Company will continue to assess (1) the length of time between when the goods or services are delivered and expected payment, and (2) prevailing interest rates in the market to re-evaluate this conclusion.  
Our OEM revenue is derived substantially from printer imaging, printer driver and display imaging products. OEM revenue primarily relates to licenses providing our customers the right to embed our fonts and technology in their products over a certain term. Under our OEM licensing arrangements, we either receive a fixed fee as specified under the license arrangement or a royalty for each product unit incorporating our fonts and technology that is shipped by our OEM customers. Although significantly less than royalties from per-unit shipments and fixed fees from OEM customers, we also receive revenue from software application and operating systems vendors, who include our fonts and technology in their products and for font development. Revenue from per-unit royalty contracts is estimated and recognized in the period that the royalty-bearing event or sale by our OEM customer occurs. Revenue from fixed fee licenses is generally recognized upfront at the point in time when the software embodying the font is shipped or made available to the customer. Certain OEM contracts may include customer support services and unspecified updates for our font technology that is a distinct stand-ready performance obligation and recognized ratably over the service period. Many of our per-unit royalty licenses continue for the duration that our OEM customers ship products that include our technology, unless terminated for breach. Other licenses have terms that typically range from one fiscal quarter to five years, and usually provide for automatic or optional renewals.  
Our contracts with customers often include promises to transfer multiple products and services to a customer. Determining whether products and services are considered distinct performance obligations that should be accounted for separately versus together may require significant judgment. Once we determine the performance obligations, the Company determines the transaction price, which includes estimating the amount of variable consideration to be included in the transaction price, if any. We then allocate the transaction price to each performance obligation in the contract based on a relative stand-alone selling price method. The corresponding revenue is recognized as the related performance obligations are satisfied as discussed in the revenue categories above.  
Judgment is required to determine the standalone selling price for each distinct performance obligation. We determine standalone selling price based on the price at which the performance obligation is sold separately. If the standalone selling price is not observable through past transactions, we estimate the standalone selling price taking into account available information such as market conditions and internally approved pricing guidelines related to the performance obligations.  
As discussed above, certain of our Creative Professional contracts have payment terms that differ from the timing of revenue recognition which requires us to assess whether the transaction price for those contracts include a significant financing component. We have elected the practical expedient that permits an entity to not adjust for the effects of a significant financing component if we expect that at the contract inception, the period between when the entity transfers a promised good or service to a customer and when the customer pays for that good or service will be one year or less. For those contracts in which the period exceeds the one year threshold, this assessment, as well as the quantitative estimate of the financing component and its relative significance, requires judgment. We estimate the significant financing component provided to our customers with extended payment terms by determining the present value of the future payments by applying a discount rate that reflects the customers creditworthiness.  
Revenue recognized during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2018 from amounts included in deferred revenue at the beginning of the period were approximately $7.2 million and $21.6 million, respectively. Revenue recognized during both the three and nine months ended September 30, 2018 from performance obligations satisfied or partially satisfied in previous periods, mainly due to changes in the estimate of royalty revenues, was $7.9 million. During the nine months ended September 30, 2018, the change in contract assets reclassified to receivables as a result of the right to the transaction consideration becoming unconditional was not material. The contract modifications entered into during the nine months ended September 30, 2018 did not have a significant impact on the Companys contract assets or deferred revenue.  
We capitalize incremental costs incurred to fulfill our contracts that (i) relate directly to the contract, (ii) are expected to generate resources that will be used to satisfy the Companys performance obligation under the contract, and (iii) are expected to be recovered through revenue generated under the contract. Contract fulfillment costs primarily relate to font license fees that we pay on certain fonts that are owned by third parties. These fees are related to license revenue that is satisfied at a point in time and payable again upon license renewal, and as a result are incurred immediately upon contract execution. Accordingly, there are no capitalized costs related to costs to fulfill a contract as of September 30, 2018.  
5. Fair Value Measurements  
The Companys recurring fair value measures relate to short-term investments, which are classified as cash equivalents, derivative instruments and from time to time contingent consideration. The fair value of our cash equivalents is based on quoted prices (unadjusted) for identical assets. The fair value of our derivatives is based on quoted market prices from various banking institutions or an independent third-party provider for similar instruments. In determining the fair value, we consider our non-performance risk and that of our counterparties. At September 30, 2018, we had one 30-day forward contract to sell 2.6 million British pounds sterling and purchase $3.4 million that together, had an immaterial fair value; and at December 31, 2017, we had one 30-day forward contract to sell 2.5 million British pounds sterling and purchase $3.4 million that together, had an immaterial fair value.  
The Companys non-financial assets and non-financial liabilities subject to non-recurring measurements include goodwill and intangible assets.  
During the quarter ended June 30, 2018, the Company decided to cease sales of certain service offerings that were principally acquired as part of the Companys acquisition of Swyft Media in January 2015. The decision was made in connection with other restructuring actions to re-align the Companys product and service offerings. See Note 13 for further details regarding the restructuring plan.  
On September 15, 2015, the Company entered into a new credit agreement (the New Credit Agreement) by and among the Company, the Companys subsidiary, Monotype Imaging Inc., any financial institution that becomes a Lender (as defined therein) and Silicon Valley Bank, as agent which provides for a five-year $150.0 million secured revolving credit facility (the Credit Facility). The Credit Facility permits the Company to request that the Lenders, at their election, increase the secured credit facility to a maximum of $200.0 million. The Credit Facility is available to the Company on a revolving basis through September 15, 2020. Repayment of any amounts borrowed are not required until maturity of the Credit Facility. However, the Company may repay any amounts borrowed at any time, without premium or penalty. At September 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017, the Company had $80.0 million and $93.0 million outstanding under the Credit Facility. At September 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017, available borrowings under the Credit Facility have been reduced by approximately $0.5 million for one standby letter of credit issued in connection with a facility lease agreement, leaving $69.5 million and $56.5 million available for borrowing at September 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017, respectively.  
8. Defined Benefit Pension Plan  
Our German subsidiary maintains an unfunded defined benefit pension plan which covers substantially all employees who joined the company prior to the plans closure to new participants in 2006. Participants are entitled to benefits in the form of retirement, disability and surviving dependent pensions. Benefits generally depend on years of service and the salary of the employees.  
At September 30, 2018, the reserve for uncertain tax positions was approximately $7.0 million. Of this amount, $4.7 million is recorded as a reduction of deferred tax assets and $2.3 million is classified as long-term liabilities. During the quarter, the Company recorded a benefit of $0.4 million related to reserves no longer required due to the lapses of statutes of limitations.  
10. Net Income (Loss) Per Share  
For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2018 and 2017, the net income (loss) available to common shareholders is divided by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period to calculate diluted earnings per share. The assumed exercise of stock options and assumed vesting of restricted stock and restricted stock units were included in the computation of net income per share for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2018 and for the three months ended September 30, 2017, but were excluded in the computation of net (loss) per share for the nine months ended September 30, 2017, as their effect would have been anti-dilutive. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2018 and for the three months ended September 30, 2017, the two-class method was used in the computation of diluted net income (loss) per share, as the result was more dilutive.  
In the three months ended September 30, 2018 and 2017, $3 thousand and $44 thousand, respectively, of stock based compensation was capitalized as part of internal software projects, and this amount is included in property and equipment, net in our condensed consolidated balance sheet. In the nine months ended September 30, 2018 and 2017, $24 thousand and $97 thousand, respectively, of stock based compensation was capitalized as part of internal software projects, and this amount is included in property and equipment, net in our condensed consolidated balance sheet. For the nine months ended September 30, 2018, $1.4 million of stock based compensation expense was reversed as a result of forfeitures of awards by employees included in the restructuring plan. This non-recurring amount has been included in restructuring expenses.  
As of September 30, 2018, the Company had $29.0 million of unrecognized compensation expense related to employees and directors unvested restricted stock awards, restricted stock units and stock option awards that are expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 2.2 years.  
On June 6, 2018, the Company implemented a restructuring plan, under which the Company will reduce headcount in certain areas of the Company, made the decision to cease sales and marketing of the Swyft product and service line and to close a regional office, all in an effort to improve operational efficiencies. The plan provided for the elimination of approximately 50 positions worldwide across a variety of functions, with a concentration within engineering, as well as sales and marketing. The Company recorded net charges totaling $0.2 million and $6.8 million in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2018, respectively, related to severance and termination benefits, net of stock based compensation reversal, the write off of goodwill and intangible assets attributable to Swyft, the acceleration of the final deferred compensation payment to the founders of Swyft, and charges associated with the office closure.  
We reversed $1.4 million of stock based compensation expense as a result of forfeitures of awards by employees included in the restructuring plan. See Note 6 for further details regarding the intangible asset disposal and write off of goodwill.  
Future cash expenditures related to the restructuring are expected to be approximately $2.3 million, net of tax savings. We expect the restructuring plan to be completed by the end of 2018, other than the payment of deferred termination benefits to certain terminated employees.  
14. Commitments and Contingencies  
Subsequent to September 30, 2018, the Company purchased 315,000 shares of common stock for $6.3 million, at an average price per share of $19.80 through October 26, 2018. The Company purchased these shares on the open market at prevailing market prices and in accordance with its previously announced share purchase program. At October 26, 2018, $12.0 million remains for future purchase under the Plan.  
On October 25, 2018, the Companys Board of Directors declared a $0.116 per share quarterly cash dividend on our outstanding common stock. The record date is set for January 2, 2019 and the dividend is payable to shareholders of record on January 22, 2019. Dividends are declared at the discretion of the Companys Board of Directors and depend on actual cash from operations, the Companys financial condition and capital requirements and any other factors the Companys Board of Directors may consider relevant. Future dividend declarations, as well as the record and payment dates for such dividends, will be determined by the Companys Board of Directors on a quarterly basis.
