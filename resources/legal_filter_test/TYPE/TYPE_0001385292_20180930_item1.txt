The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated interim financial statements as of September 30, 2018 and for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2018 and 2017 include the accounts of the Company and its wholly-owned subsidiaries and have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (GAAP) for interim financial reporting and pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q and Article 10 of Regulation S-X.
In managements opinion, these unaudited condensed consolidated interim financial statements contain all adjustments of a normal recurring nature necessary for a fair presentation of the financial statements for the interim periods presented.
We have elected to present the requirements in statement form.
These unaudited condensed consolidated interim financial statements should be read in conjunction with the Companys audited consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2017, as reported in the Companys Annual Report on Form 10-K.
The Companys significant accounting policies and practices are as described in the Annual Report, except for the adoption of the accounting standards described in Note 3 below.
Prior year amounts were historically reported on a combined basis and have been restated to conform to current presentation.
We classify cloud-based subscriptions and other services, such as font related services, custom font design and post contract support as service revenue on our condensed consolidated statements of operations.
At September 30, 2018, our wholly-owned Olapic Argentina S.A. subsidiary employs approximately 99 people whose functions mainly include development, sales support and administration.
The Argentinian economy was recently determined to be highly inflationary.
A highly inflationary economy is one where the cumulative inflation rate for the three years preceding the beginning of the reporting period, including interim reporting periods, is in excess of 100 percent.
Argentinas inflation rate reached this threshold with the quarterly period ended June 30, 2018.
For a highly inflationary economy, we followed the guidance in ASC Topic 830, Foreign Currency Matters, (Subtopic ASC 830-10-45) and accounted for the change in functional currency from the Argentinian peso to the U.S. dollar effective July 1, 2018.
Under this guidance, translation adjustments are not removed from equity, and the translated amounts for nonmonetary assets and liabilities at the end of the prior period become the accounting basis for those assets both in the period of the change and in subsequent periods.
In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board, or FASB, and the International Accounting Standards Board jointly issued ASU 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606) (ASC 606), which outlines a comprehensive five-step revenue recognition model based on a principle that replaces virtually all existing revenue recognition rules under U.S. GAAP and which requires revenue to be recognized in a manner to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to a customer at an amount that reflects the consideration expected to be received in exchange for those goods or services.
ASU 2014-09 also provided the guidance in ASC Topic 340, Other Assets and Deferred CostsContracts with Customers (Subtopic 340-40), which includes criteria for the capitalization and amortization of certain contract acquisition and fulfillment costs.
The standard requires retrospective application; however, it allows entities to choose either full retrospective adoption, in which the standard is applied to all of the periods presented, or modified retrospective adoption, in which the cumulative catch-up adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings is recognized at the date of application, with additional disclosures required to describe these effects.
We adopted the standard on January 1, 2018, and applied the modified retrospective method of adoption and have elected to apply the new standard only to contracts not completed at January 1, 2018, which represents contracts for which all (or substantially all) of the revenues have not been recognized under existing guidance as of the date of adoption.
Contract assets, short term are included in the accounts receivables, net of allowance for doubtful accounts in our condensed consolidated balance sheet.
Capitalized contract costs, long term are included in other assets in our condensed consolidated balance sheet.
In addition, we recognized additional royalty expenses totaling approximately $2.2 million, or $0.05 per share, upon the adoption of ASC 606, as an indirect effect of a change in accounting principle.
These amounts are included in cost of revenue  license in the accompanying condensed consolidated statement of operations for the nine months ended September 30, 2018.
Under legacy GAAP, revenue related to our term licenses that were bundled with service-related performance obligations when vendor-specific objective evidence (VSOE) did not exist was required to be recognized ratably over the term of the agreement.
The application of this provision is particularly impactful to our new Mosaic product offering which was launched in the first quarter of 2018.
This new offering bundles our traditional font licenses with a SaaS based portal, which under legacy GAAP would have been recognized ratably.
Under legacy GAAP, revenue was recognized when the payments became due, based upon the requirement that the fee be fixed or determinable.
However, under the new guidance, revenue related to such arrangements is accelerated, with revenue related to the license recognized at the time of delivery, less a financing component (interest income) to be recognized over time based on the payment terms.
This also impacts new contracts that we sign in 2018.
Under legacy GAAP, we recognized royalty revenue when the licensee reported it to us, typically one quarter after royalty-bearing units were shipped, at which time the fee is fixed or determinable.
Thus, revenue from royalties reported to us in the first quarter of 2018 were recorded to retained earnings upon adoption of ASC 606, rather than being recognized as revenue as it would have been under legacy GAAP.
This was partially offset by the recognition of revenue in the first quarter of 2018 for estimated royalties that were reported to us in the second quarter of 2018.
Please see Note 4 for the Companys policies related to revenue recognition and accounting for costs to obtain and fulfill a customer contract.
In March 2017, the FASB issued ASU No.
2017-07, Compensation-Retirement Benefits (Topic 715)-Improving the Presentation of Net Periodic Pension Cost and Net Periodic Postretirement Benefit Cost.
This guidance revises the presentation of the net periodic benefit cost in the income statement.
We adopted ASU 2017-07 on January 1, 2018 and there was no material impact on our consolidated financial statements.
The Company will adopt this ASU on January 1, 2019 and has begun planning for adoption by implementing new lease accounting software, and by working to establish additional changes to our processes and internal controls to ensure all requirements are met upon adoption.
The standard allows for a modified retrospective approach or a modified retrospective approach with comparatives under 840 option, where entities would recognize a cumulative effect to retained earnings at the date of adoption without restating prior periods balances or disclosures.
The Company plans to use the modified retrospective approach with comparatives under 840 option that will not require revising comparative period information or disclosure.
We will elect the package of practical expedients permitted under the transition guidance within the new standard, which among other things, allows us to carryforward the historical lease classification.
In addition, we are electing the hindsight practical expedient to determine the lease term for existing leases.
We will also elect the practical expedient that allows an accounting policy election to exclude right of use assets and lease obligations from the balance sheet for all leases with an initial term of 12 months or less.
We adopted ASC 606 on January 1, 2018 using the modified retrospective method for all contracts not completed as of the date of adoption.
The adoption of ASC 606 represents a change in accounting principle that will more closely align revenue recognition with the delivery of our products and services and will provide financial statement readers with enhanced disclosures.
Our Creative Professional revenue is primarily derived from rights to use font licenses, custom font design services and hosted software as a service, or SaaS, offerings.
We license fonts directly to end-users through our direct sales organization, e-commerce websites and indirectly through third-party resellers.
Our customers include graphic designers, advertising agencies, media organizations and corporations.
Revenue from font licenses is recognized upfront when the font software is delivered or made available to the customer.
In limited cases, the Company has an enforceable right to payment prior to final delivery and acceptance of custom font design work.
In these cases, the Company has determined that the proper treatment is a single over-time performance obligation using input methods (incurred hours towards completion) to measure progress towards completion to determine the pattern of satisfaction of the performance obligation.
For our hosted offerings where we provide our customers the right to access our software without taking possession, revenue is recognized over the contract period on a time-elapsed basis, which is consistent with the transfer of service to the customer.
An exception exists for certain contracts for our SaaS offerings or a limited number of multi-year term license agreements which have periodic payment terms, generally quarterly or annually, over the term of the contract.
In instances where the timing of revenue recognition differs from the respective payment terms, we have considered whether such contracts include a significant financing component, subject to the applicable practical expedient.
The purpose of these payment structures is to align with industry and market standards, not to provide customers with financing.
Our OEM revenue is derived substantially from printer imaging, printer driver and display imaging products.
Revenue from fixed fee licenses is generally recognized upfront at the point in time when the software embodying the font is shipped or made available to the customer.
Certain OEM contracts may include customer support services and unspecified updates for our font technology that is a distinct stand-ready performance obligation and recognized ratably over the service period.
Other licenses have terms that typically range from one fiscal quarter to five years, and usually provide for automatic or optional renewals.
Our contracts with customers often include promises to transfer multiple products and services to a customer.
Determining whether products and services are considered distinct performance obligations that should be accounted for separately versus together may require significant judgment.
Once we determine the performance obligations, the Company determines the transaction price, which includes estimating the amount of variable consideration to be included in the transaction price, if any.
We then allocate the transaction price to each performance obligation in the contract based on a relative stand-alone selling price method.
The corresponding revenue is recognized as the related performance obligations are satisfied as discussed in the revenue categories above.
Judgment is required to determine the standalone selling price for each distinct performance obligation.
We determine standalone selling price based on the price at which the performance obligation is sold separately.
If the standalone selling price is not observable through past transactions, we estimate the standalone selling price taking into account available information such as market conditions and internally approved pricing guidelines related to the performance obligations.
As discussed above, certain of our Creative Professional contracts have payment terms that differ from the timing of revenue recognition which requires us to assess whether the transaction price for those contracts include a significant financing component.
For those contracts in which the period exceeds the one year threshold, this assessment, as well as the quantitative estimate of the financing component and its relative significance, requires judgment.
We estimate the significant financing component provided to our customers with extended payment terms by determining the present value of the future payments by applying a discount rate that reflects the customers creditworthiness.
We record an unbilled receivable, or contract asset, when revenue is recognized prior to invoicing when we have an enforceable right to payment.
Revenue recognized during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2018 from amounts included in deferred revenue at the beginning of the period were approximately $7.2 million and $21.6 million, respectively.
Revenue recognized during both the three and nine months ended September 30, 2018 from performance obligations satisfied or partially satisfied in previous periods, mainly due to changes in the estimate of royalty revenues, was $7.9 million.
During the nine months ended September 30, 2018, the change in contract assets reclassified to receivables as a result of the right to the transaction consideration becoming unconditional was not material.
The contract modifications entered into during the nine months ended September 30, 2018 did not have a significant impact on the Companys contract assets or deferred revenue.
We have determined that certain commissions paid under our sales incentive programs meet the requirements to be capitalized.
The amount capitalized for incremental costs to obtain contracts as of September 30, 2018 was $2.5 million, of which $0.6 million was short-term and has been included in prepaid expenses and other current assets and $1.9 million was long term and has been included in other assets in our condensed consolidated balance sheet.
Costs to obtain a contract are amortized as sales and marketing expense over the expected period of benefit in a manner that is consistent with the transfer of the related goods or services to which the asset relates.
The judgments made in determining the amount of costs incurred include whether the commissions are in fact incremental and would not have occurred absent the customer contract and the estimate of the amortization period, which ranges between three and ten years depending on the nature of the performance obligations within the contract.
These costs are periodically reviewed for impairment.
The amount of capitalized costs related to contracts which were terminated on or before September 30, 2018, due to the customer exercising an opt-out clause or the cancellation of an anticipated renewal was not material and was charged to operating expenses in the third quarter of 2018.
We capitalize incremental costs incurred to fulfill our contracts that (i) relate directly to the contract, (ii) are expected to generate resources that will be used to satisfy the Companys performance obligation under the contract, and (iii) are expected to be recovered through revenue generated under the contract.
Contract fulfillment costs primarily relate to font license fees that we pay on certain fonts that are owned by third parties.
Accordingly, there are no capitalized costs related to costs to fulfill a contract as of September 30, 2018.
The Companys recurring fair value measures relate to short-term investments, which are classified as cash equivalents, derivative instruments and from time to time contingent consideration.
The fair value of our cash equivalents is based on quoted prices (unadjusted) for identical assets.
The fair value of our derivatives is based on quoted market prices from various banking institutions or an independent third-party provider for similar instruments.
In determining the fair value, we consider our non-performance risk and that of our counterparties.
At September 30, 2018, we had one 30-day forward contract to sell 2.6 million British pounds sterling and purchase $3.4 million that together, had an immaterial fair value; and at December 31, 2017, we had one 30-day forward contract to sell 2.5 million British pounds sterling and purchase $3.4 million that together, had an immaterial fair value.
The Companys non-financial assets and non-financial liabilities subject to non-recurring measurements include goodwill and intangible assets.
During the quarter ended June 30, 2018, the Company decided to cease sales of certain service offerings that were principally acquired as part of the Companys acquisition of Swyft Media in January 2015.
The decision was made in connection with other restructuring actions to re-align the Companys product and service offerings.
As a result, such assets were determined to be fully impaired and an impairment charge of approximately $2.6 million, representing the carrying value of these intangible assets, was recorded during the quarter ended June 30, 2018.
The Credit Facility permits the Company to request that the Lenders, at their election, increase the secured credit facility to a maximum of $200.0 million.
The Credit Facility is available to the Company on a revolving basis through September 15, 2020.
However, the Company may repay any amounts borrowed at any time, without premium or penalty.
At September 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017, the Company had $80.0 million and $93.0 million outstanding under the Credit Facility.
At September 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017, available borrowings under the Credit Facility have been reduced by approximately $0.5 million for one standby letter of credit issued in connection with a facility lease agreement, leaving $69.5 million and $56.5 million available for borrowing at September 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017, respectively.
Borrowings under the Credit Facility bear a variable rate not less than zero based upon, at the Companys option, either LIBOR or the higher of (i) the prime rate as published in the Wall Street Journal, and (ii) 0.5% plus the overnight federal funds rate, plus in each case, an applicable margin.
At September 30, 2018, our rate, inclusive of applicable margins, was 3.8% for LIBOR, and at December 31, 2017, our rate, inclusive of applicable margins, was 3.1% for LIBOR.
Participants are entitled to benefits in the form of retirement, disability and surviving dependent pensions.
Benefits generally depend on years of service and the salary of the employees.
At September 30, 2018, the reserve for uncertain tax positions was approximately $7.0 million.
Of this amount, $4.7 million is recorded as a reduction of deferred tax assets and $2.3 million is classified as long-term liabilities.
During the quarter, the Company recorded a benefit of $0.4 million related to reserves no longer required due to the lapses of statutes of limitations.
The Company recorded an initial estimate of the tax on unremitted earnings of approximately $0.2 million; however, this amount was offset by available foreign tax credits, and as a result the net estimated amount payable related to the deemed repatriation of foreign earnings was zero.
The Company finalized this estimate during the quarter, and there was no change from the initial estimate.
For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2018 and 2017, the net income (loss) available to common shareholders is divided by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period to calculate diluted earnings per share.
The assumed exercise of stock options and assumed vesting of restricted stock and restricted stock units were included in the computation of net income per share for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2018 and for the three months ended September 30, 2017, but were excluded in the computation of net (loss) per share for the nine months ended September 30, 2017, as their effect would have been anti-dilutive.
For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2018 and for the three months ended September 30, 2017, the two-class method was used in the computation of diluted net income (loss) per share, as the result was more dilutive.
In the three months ended September 30, 2018 and 2017, $3 thousand and $44 thousand, respectively, of stock based compensation was capitalized as part of internal software projects, and this amount is included in property and equipment, net in our condensed consolidated balance sheet.
In the nine months ended September 30, 2018 and 2017, $24 thousand and $97 thousand, respectively, of stock based compensation was capitalized as part of internal software projects, and this amount is included in property and equipment, net in our condensed consolidated balance sheet.
For the nine months ended September 30, 2018, $1.4 million of stock based compensation expense was reversed as a result of forfeitures of awards by employees included in the restructuring plan.
This non-recurring amount has been included in restructuring expenses.
As of September 30, 2018, the Company had $29.0 million of unrecognized compensation expense related to employees and directors unvested restricted stock awards, restricted stock units and stock option awards that are expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 2.2 years.
We market our products and services principally through offices in the United States, United Kingdom, Germany, China, Republic of Korea and Japan.
We report revenue based on the geographic location of our customers.
For example, licenses may be sold to large international companies, which may be headquartered in the Republic of Korea, such revenues would be included in the revenue defined as Rest of World.
On June 6, 2018, the Company implemented a restructuring plan, under which the Company will reduce headcount in certain areas of the Company, made the decision to cease sales and marketing of the Swyft product and service line and to close a regional office, all in an effort to improve operational efficiencies.
The plan provided for the elimination of approximately 50 positions worldwide across a variety of functions, with a concentration within engineering, as well as sales and marketing.
The Company recorded net charges totaling $0.2 million and $6.8 million in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2018, respectively, related to severance and termination benefits, net of stock based compensation reversal, the write off of goodwill and intangible assets attributable to Swyft, the acceleration of the final deferred compensation payment to the founders of Swyft, and charges associated with the office closure.
We reversed $1.4 million of stock based compensation expense as a result of forfeitures of awards by employees included in the restructuring plan.
See Note 6 for further details regarding the intangible asset disposal and write off of goodwill.
Future cash expenditures related to the restructuring are expected to be approximately $2.3 million, net of tax savings.
We expect the restructuring plan to be completed by the end of 2018, other than the payment of deferred termination benefits to certain terminated employees.
From time to time, we may be a party to various claims, suits and complaints.
Accordingly, there are no liabilities recorded for these warranties as of September 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017.
Subsequent to September 30, 2018, the Company purchased 315,000 shares of common stock for $6.3 million, at an average price per share of $19.80 through October 26, 2018.
The Company purchased these shares on the open market at prevailing market prices and in accordance with its previously announced share purchase program.
Dividends are declared at the discretion of the Companys Board of Directors and depend on actual cash from operations, the Companys financial condition and capital requirements and any other factors the Companys Board of Directors may consider relevant.
Future dividend declarations, as well as the record and payment dates for such dividends, will be determined by the Companys Board of Directors on a quarterly basis.
From time to time, we may be a party to various claims, suits and complaints.
This future international revenue will depend on the continued use and expansion of our type and technologies, including the licensing of our solutions worldwide.
the strength of international economies, including consideration of high inflation rates.
