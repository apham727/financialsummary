For a description of our Creative Professional revenue and related accounting policy, see Note 4.
For a description of our OEM revenue and related accounting policy, see Note 4.
Cost of revenue also includes amortization of acquired technology, which we amortize over 7 to 15 years.
We use the straight-line method to amortize acquired technology.
Creative Professional revenue is growing at a faster rate than OEM revenue.
We expect these trends to continue.
License revenue increased primarily due to the growth in sales to enterprise customers, including the launch of our Mosaic product offering.
This growth was partially offset by decreases due to certain one-time printer revenue recognized in the second quarter of 2017, as a result of conversion of customers to fixed fee contracts from royalty bearing contracts.
In addition, our royalty based revenue is lower in the three months ended June 30, 2018, as a result of the adoption of ASC 606.
Gross profit from license revenue, before amortization of acquired technology, is unchanged at 84.9%, period over period.
Gross profit from service revenue, before amortization of acquired technology, increased to 78.7% from 71.2%.
See further discussion below for additional information regarding our period over period revenue and cost of revenue.
The following discussion compares the three months ended June 30, 2018 with the three months ended June 30, 2017.
Revenue was $60.7 million and $57.8 million for the three months ended June 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively, an increase of $2.9 million, or 5.0%.
Creative Professional revenue increased $7.8 million, or 25.4%, to $38.4 million for the three months ended June 30, 2018, as compared to $30.6 million for the three months ended June 30, 2017, mainly due to growth in sales to enterprise customers, including our new Mosaic solution, and increased service revenue as SaaS offerings continue to become a larger part of our portfolio.
OEM revenue decreased $4.9 million, or 18.0%, to $22.3 million for the three months ended June 30, 2018, from $27.2 million for the three months ended June 30, 2017.
Revenue from our printer imaging OEM customers decreased period over period partially due to lower revenue from customers under fixed fee contracts and partially due to $2.4 million of one-time payments recognized in the second quarter of 2017 from the conversion of customers to fixed fee contracts from royalty bearing contracts.
Cost of revenue, excluding amortization of acquired technology, was $10.0 million and $10.1 million for the three months ended June 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively, a decrease of $0.1 million, or 1.8%.
As a percentage of sales, cost of revenue, excluding amortization of acquired technology, was 16.4% and 17.6% of total revenue in the three months ended June 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively.
The portion of cost of revenue consisting of amortization of acquired technology was unchanged at $0.9 million for both the three months ended June 30, 2018 and 2017.
Gross profit in the three months ended June 30, 2018 increased 1.3 percentage points to 82.2% of sales in the second quarter of 2018, as compared to 80.9% of sales in the same period in 2017, mainly due to improved margins in our enterprise sales business, partially offset by the continued mix shift between Creative Professional and the higher margin OEM business.
Marketing and Selling.
Marketing and selling expense was $20.1 million and $22.7 million in the three months ended June 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively, a decrease of $2.6 million, or 11.6%.
Personnel and personnel related expenses decreased $2.2 million, period over period, due to lower headcount mainly from restructuring actions in the fourth quarter of 2017.
Software expenses increased $0.5 million in the second quarter of 2018, as compared to the same period in 2017, mainly due to investments in information systems supporting the Creative Professional business.
Targeted marketing spending decreased $0.6 million in the second quarter of 2018, as compared to the same period in 2017, due to portfolio decisions around discretionary programs.
Research and development expense was $8.5 million and $9.2 million in the three months ended June 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively, a decrease of $0.7 million, or 8.4%, mainly due to lower personnel expenses.
Personnel expenses decreased $0.4 million in the three months ended June 30, 2018, as compared to the same period in 2017, due to lower headcount from restructuring actions in the fourth quarter of 2017.
Outside consulting expense decreased $0.2 million period over period, mainly due to timing of projects.
General and administrative expense was $11.9 million in both the three months ended June 30, 2018 and 2017.
Personnel expenses decreased in the second quarter of 2018, as compared to the same period in 2017, primarily due to lower recruitment costs, which was mostly offset by increased depreciation expense, mainly due to the capitalization of internally developed software.
Restructuring.
Restructuring expense was $6.4 million in the three months ended June 30, 2018.
There was no restructuring expense in the same period in 2017.
Included in restructuring costs is a $3.2 million write down of the intangible assets and goodwill allocated to the Swyft business, which was discontinued in connection with the restructuring action announced in June 2018.
Severance expenses totaled $4.0 million and an acceleration of Swyft deferred compensation payment resulted in an incremental charge of $0.5 million due to the restructuring action in the second quarter of 2018.
These charges were partially offset by a $1.4 million reversal of stock based compensation expense as a result of forfeitures of awards by employees included in the restructuring plan.
Amortization of other intangible assets was unchanged at $1.0 million for both three month periods ended June 30, 2018 and 2017.
Interest expense, net of interest income was $0.8 million and $0.7 million for the three months ended June 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively, an increase of $0.1 million, mainly due to increases in interest rates on our outstanding borrowings, partially offset by a reduction in the balance outstanding.
      Foreign rate differential increased our effective rate 40.1% in the three months ended June 30, 2018, as compared to a decrease of 1.0% in the same period in 2017, due to changes in tax treatment of foreign earnings under The Act.
      Non-deductible expenses added 3.1% to the effective tax rate for the three months ended June 30, 2018, as compared to 43.1% in the same period in 2017, primarily due to changes in the deductibility of officer compensation under The Act, partially offset by the reduction in the statutory rate and a decrease in non-deductible acquisition-related compensation expense for the period.
License revenue increased primarily due to growth in sales to our enterprise customers, including the launch of our Mosaic product offering.
This growth was partially offset by decreases due to certain one-time printer revenue recognized in the six months ended June 30, 2017, as a result of conversion of customers to fixed fee contracts from royalty bearing contracts.
In addition, our royalty based revenue is lower in the six months ended June 30, 2018, a result of the adoption of ASC 606.
This change had the effect of shifting traditional holiday seasonality revenue for consumer electronics from the first quarter of 2018 to the fourth quarter of 2017.
Service revenue has increased as a percentage of total revenue due primarily to the growth of our SaaS-based product offerings.
Gross profit from license revenue, before amortization of acquired technology, decreased to 82.0% from 84.7%.
These decreases are primarily due to additional non-recurring royalty expense in the six months ended June 30, 2018 for which there was no corresponding revenue in the corresponding period in 2017, in accordance with ASC 606.
See further discussion below for additional information regarding our period over period revenue and cost of revenue.
Revenue by Market.
Revenue was $117.4 million and $110.3 million for the six months ended June 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively, an increase of $7.1 million, or 6.4%.
Creative Professional revenue increased $15.7 million, or 27.2%, to $73.4 million for the six months ended June 30, 2018, as compared to $57.7 million for the six months ended June 30, 2017, mainly due to growth in sales of revenue from our enterprise customers, including the launch of our Mosaic solution and higher service revenue as SaaS offerings continue to become a larger part of our offering portfolio.
OEM revenue decreased $8.6 million, or 16.4%, to $43.9 million for the six months ended June 30, 2018, as compared to $52.6 million for the six months ended June 30, 2017.
Revenue from our printer imaging OEM customers decreased period over period partially due to lower revenue from customers under fixed fee contracts and partially due to $4.1 million of one-time payments recognized in the six months ended June 30, 2017 from the conversion of customers to fixed fee contracts from royalty bearing contracts.
Additionally, we recorded lower royalty based revenue as a result of the adoption of ASC 606.
This change had the effect of shifting traditional holiday seasonality revenue for consumer electronics from the first quarter of 2018 to the fourth quarter of 2017.
Cost of revenue excluding amortization of acquired technology increased $3.5 million, or 18.4%, to $22.4 million in the six months ended June 30, 2018 as compared to $18.9 million in the six months ended June 30, 2017.
The increase in cost of revenue in the six months ended June 30, 2018 is mainly due to $2.2 million of additional non-recurring royalty expense for which there was no corresponding revenue item in the period in accordance with ASC 606.
As a percentage of sales, cost of revenue, excluding amortization of acquired technology, was 19.1% and 17.2% of total revenue in the six months ended June 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively.
Amortization of acquired technology was $1.7 million and $1.8 million for the six months ended June 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively, a decrease of $0.1 million, or 2.0%.
The decrease in gross profit in the six months ended June 30, 2018, as compared to the same period in 2017, was partially due to the additional non-recurring royalty expense as described above, and partially offset by the continued mix shift between Creative Professional and the higher margin OEM business.

Software expenses increased $1.0 million in the first half of 2018 mainly due to investments in information systems supporting the Creative Professional business than in the prior period.
Targeted marketing spending decreased $0.6 million in the second quarter of 2018, as compared to the same period in 2017, due to portfolio decisions around discretionary marketing programs.

Personnel and consulting expenses together decreased $0.6 million in the six months ended June 30, 2018, as compared to the same period in 2017, primarily due to a reduction in headcount from the restructuring action in the fourth quarter of 2017 and timing of projects.
Decreased facilities expense contributed $0.3 million to the overall decrease period over period, due to the consolidation of certain regional offices in 2017.
General and administrative expense increased $4.7 million, or 20.8% to $27.5 million in the six months ended June 30, 2018, as compared to $22.7 million in the same period in 2017.

Restructuring.
Restructuring expense was $6.6 million in the six months ended June 30, 2018.

Included in restructuring costs is a $3.2 million write down of intangible assets and goodwill allocated to the Swyft business, which was discontinued in connection with the restructuring action announced in June 2018.
Severance expenses totaled $4.2 million and an acceleration of Swyft deferred compensation payment resulted in an incremental charge of $0.5 million mainly due to the restructuring action in the second quarter of 2018.
These charges were partially offset by a $1.4 million reversal of stock based compensation expense as a result of forfeitures of awards by employees included in the restructuring plan.
Amortization of other intangible assets was unchanged at $2.0 million for the six month periods ended June 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively.
Interest expense, net of interest income was $1.5 million and $1.4 million for the six months ended June 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively, an increase of $0.1 million, as reductions in outstanding borrowings under our revolving line of credit were offset by an increase in interest rates.
      Foreign rate differential increased our effective rate 26.4% in the six months ended June 30, 2018, as compared to a decrease of 2.3% in the same period in 2017, due to changes in tax treatment of foreign earnings under The Act.
      Non-deductible expenses added 14.2% to the effective tax rate for the six months ended June 30, 2018, as compared to 33.4% in the same period in 2017, primarily due to changes in the deductibility of officer compensation under The Act, partially offset by the reduction in the statutory rate and a decrease in non-deductible acquisition-related compensation expense for the period.
In addition, a net windfall on stock based compensation resulted in a 9.2% increase in the effective rate for the first half of 2018, as compared to a shortfall rate in the same period in 2017 that resulted in a 20.1% reduction in the effective rate.
Information concerning recently issued accounting pronouncements may be found in Note 3 to our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.
Since our inception, we have financed our operations primarily through cash from operations, private and public stock sales and long-term debt arrangements, as described below.
We believe our existing cash and cash equivalents, cash flow from operating activities and available bank borrowings will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash needs for at least one year from the issuance of these financial statements.
At June 30, 2018, our principal sources of liquidity were cash and cash equivalents totaling $75.8 million and a $150.0 million revolving credit facility, of which there was $85.0 million of outstanding borrowings.
Our liquidity and cash flows in the six months ended June 30, 2017, included share purchases made under a share repurchase program, which ended on December 31, 2017.
On May 3, 2018, our Board of Directors approved a share repurchase program of up to $25.0 million of our outstanding common stock, which permits purchases through June 7, 2019.
In the six months ended June 30, 2018, we used $1.0 million in cash to purchase shares under the plan.
We generated $3.3 million in cash from operations during the six months ended June 30, 2018.
Net loss, after adjusting for depreciation and amortization, amortization of deferred financing costs and accretion of interest, loss on retirement of fixed assets, stock based compensation, provision for doubtful accounts, deferred income taxes and unrealized currency loss on foreign denominated intercompany transactions generated $9.3 million in cash.
Accrued expenses and accounts payable used $9.9 million, inclusive of large non-recurring payments of deferred compensation of $7.0 million, additional royalty payments resulting from the adoption of ASC606 of $2.1 million and payment of investor relations advisor fees of $2.2 million.
Decreased deferred revenue and increased accounts receivable generated $5.6 million in cash, primarily a result of customer payments received, net of an increase in unbilled receivables due to the adoption of ASC 606.
Increased prepaid expense and other assets used $4.0 million in cash, mainly due to an increase in long term unbilled receivables and capitalized contract costs related to the adoption of ASC 606.
Accrued income taxes used $1.0 million during the six months ended June 30, 2018.
Variations in operating cash flows occur from time-to-time, because our enterprise customers make upfront payments on subscription revenue.
The timing and extent of such payments may significantly impact our cash balances.
We generated $12.4 million in cash from operations during the six months ended June 30, 2017.
Net loss, after adjusting for depreciation and amortization, amortization of deferred financing costs and accretion of interest, loss on retirement of fixed assets, stock based compensation, provision for doubtful accounts, deferred income taxes, and unrealized currency loss on foreign denominated intercompany transactions generated $13.4 million in cash.
Decreased accrued expenses and accounts payable used $2.5 in cash, primarily a result of the payment of 2016 accrued variable compensation.
Increased deferred revenue and decreased accounts receivable, offset by increased prepaid expense generated $0.4 million in cash, mainly due to timing.
Accrued income taxes generated $1.1 million during the six months ended June 30, 2017.
During the six months ended June 30, 2018, we used $2.3 million in investing activities mainly for the purchase of property and equipment.

We also purchased $2.2 million of treasury stock and paid $0.6 million in employee taxes on shares withheld in the six months ended June 30, 2017.
On April 2, 2018, our Board of Directors approved a $0.116 per share or $4.9 million, quarterly cash dividend on our outstanding common stock.
The record date was July 2, 2018 and the dividend was paid to shareholders of record on July 20, 2018.
On July 25, 2018 the Companys Board of Directors declared a $0.116 per share quarterly cash dividend on our outstanding common stock.
The record date is set for October 1, 2018 and the dividend is payable to shareholders of record on October 19, 2018.
We anticipate this to be a recurring quarterly dividend with future payments and record dates, subject to board approval.
The Credit Facility permits the Company to request that the Lenders, at their election, increase the secured credit facility to a maximum of $200.0 million.
The Credit Facility is available to the Company on a revolving basis through September 15, 2020.
Repayment of any amounts borrowed is not required until maturity of the Credit Facility; however, the Company may repay any amounts borrowed at any time, without premium or penalty.
Borrowings under the Credit Facility bear a variable rate not less than zero based upon, at the Companys option, either LIBOR or the higher of (i) the prime rate as published in the Wall Street Journal, and (ii) 0.5% plus the overnight federal funds rate, plus in each case, an applicable margin.
At June 30, 2018, our rate, inclusive of applicable margins, was 3.8% for LIBOR, and at December 31, 2017, our rate, inclusive of applicable margins, was 3.1% for LIBOR.
The Company had outstanding borrowings under the Credit Facility of $85.0 million at June 30, 2018, and $93.0 million at December 31, 2017.
The Credit Facility has $0.5 million reserved for one stand-by letter of credit in connection with a facility lease agreement, leaving $64.5 million and $56.5 million available for borrowing at June 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017, respectively.
Adjusted EBITDA is not a measure of operating performance under GAAP and should not be considered as an alternative or substitute for GAAP profitability measures such as income (loss) from operations and net income (loss).
We have significant intangible assets and amortization expense is a meaningful element in our financial statements and therefore its exclusion from Adjusted EBITDA is a material limitation.
Therefore, their exclusion from Adjusted EBITDA is a material limitation.
As a result, Adjusted EBITDA should be evaluated in conjunction with net income (loss) for complete analysis of our profitability, as net income (loss) includes the financial statement impact of these items and is the most directly comparable GAAP operating performance measure to Adjusted EBITDA.
The Credit Facility also contains provisions for an increased interest rate during periods of default.
This non-GAAP measure is net adjusted EBITDA, which is defined as income (loss) from operations before depreciation, amortization of acquired intangible assets, stock based compensation expense and acquisition-related compensation.
We use net adjusted EBITDA as a principal indicator of the operating performance of our business.
This non-GAAP measure is non-GAAP earnings per diluted share, which is defined as earnings per diluted share before amortization of acquired intangible assets, stock based compensation expenses and acquisition-related compensation.
This change more accurately reflects managements view of the Companys business and financial performance.
 (1) For the three and six months ended June 30, 2018, $1.4 million, or $0.03 per share, of stock based compensation expense was reversed as a result of forfeitures of awards by employees included in the restructuring plan.
This non-recurring amount has been included in restructuring expenses.
 (2) For the three months ended June 30, 2018, the amount includes $0.9 million, or $0.02 per share, of expense associated with the deferred compensation arrangement resulting from the Olapic acquisition and $0.2 million, or $0.01 per share, of expense associated with the deferred compensation arrangement resulting from the Amendment to the Swyft Merger Agreement.
For the three months ended June 30, 2017, the amount includes $0.9 million, or $0.02 per share, of expense associated with the deferred compensation arrangement resulting from the Olapic acquisition and $0.5 million, or $0.01 per share, of expense associated with the deferred compensation arrangement resulting from the Amendment to the Swyft Merger Agreement.
For the six months ended June 30, 2018, the amount includes $1.8 million, or $0.04 per share, of expense associated with the deferred compensation arrangement resulting from the Olapic acquisition and $0.5 million, or $0.01 per share, of expense associated with the deferred compensation arrangement resulting from the Amendment to the Swyft Merger Agreement.
For the six months ended June 30, 2017, the amount includes $1.8 million, or $0.04 per share, of expense associated with the deferred compensation arrangement resulting from the Olapic acquisition and $1.0 million, or $0.03 per share, of expense associated with the deferred compensation arrangement resulting from the Amendment to the Swyft Merger Agreement.
 (3) For the three months ended June 30, 2018, the amount includes $4.9 million, or $0.12 per share, net of tax, of restructuring expenses.
For the six months ended June 30, 2018, the amount includes $2.1 million, or $0.06 per share, net of tax, of certain advisor fees related to shareholder activities, $1.7 million, or $0.04 per share, net of tax, of royalty expenses, recorded in cost of sales, associated with revenue that was not recognized under ASC 606 and $5.0 million, or $0.12 per share, net of tax, of restructuring expenses.
Net adjusted EBITDA is not a measure of operating performance under GAAP and should not be considered as an alternative or substitute for GAAP profitability measures such as income (loss) from operations and net income (loss).
We have significant intangible assets and amortization expense is a meaningful element in our financial statements and therefore its exclusion from net adjusted EBITDA is a material limitation.
Stock based compensation and the associated expense has a meaningful impact on our financial statements and therefore its exclusion from net adjusted EBITDA is a material limitation.
As a result, net adjusted EBITDA should be evaluated in conjunction with net income (loss) for complete analysis of our profitability, as net income (loss) includes the financial statement impact of these items and is the most directly comparable GAAP performance measure to net adjusted EBITDA.
As net adjusted EBITDA is not defined by GAAP, our definition of net adjusted EBITDA may differ from and therefore may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies, thereby limiting its usefulness as a comparative measure.
