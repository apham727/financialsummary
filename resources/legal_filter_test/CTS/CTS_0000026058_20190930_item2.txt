Sales were $115,651 in the third quarter of 2019, a decrease of $3,208 or 2.7% from the third quarter of 2018.
Sales to transportation markets decreased $3,625 or 4.8%.
Sales to other markets increased $417 or 1.0% due to the addition of sales from the QTI acquisition.
The QTI acquisition, which was completed in July 2019, added $3,670 in sales for the quarter.
Gross margin as a percent of sales was 32.0% in the third quarter of 2019 compared to 35.4% in the third quarter of 2018.
These were partially offset by savings related to the manufacturing transition from Elkhart, Indiana and other cost improvements.
Research and development expenses were $6,806 or 5.9% of sales in the third quarter of 2019 compared to $6,517 or 5.5% of sales in the comparable quarter of 2018.
Restructuring charges were $2,342 or 2.0% of sales in the third quarter of 2019.
The charges were mainly for building and equipment relocation, severance, and asset impairment charges related to the restructuring of certain operations as part of the 2016 Restructuring Plan, as well as a lease termination fee related to a property lease we acquired in the QTI acquisition.
Restructuring charges were $997 or 0.8% of sales in the third quarter of 2018.
Operating earnings were $10,124 or 8.8% of sales in the third quarter of 2019 compared to operating earnings of $16,118 or 13.6% of sales in the third quarter of 2018.
Interest expense increased mainly as a result of an increase in debt related to the QTI acquisition.
Other expense in the third quarter of 2019 was principally driven by foreign currency translation losses, mainly due to the appreciation of the U.S. Dollar compared to the Chinese Renminbi during the quarter, as well as pension expense.
Our effective income tax rate was 62.2% and 28.9% in the third quarters of 2019 and 2018, respectively.
The increase in the effective tax rate for the three months ended September 30, 2019, compared with the same period in 2018 is primarily attributed to the net impact of changes in reserves relating to uncertain tax positions.
Sales were $353,959 in the nine months ended September 30, 2019, an increase of $3,549 or 1.0% from the nine months ended September 30, 2018.

Other expense in the nine months ended September 30, 2019 was principally driven by foreign currency translation losses, mainly due to the appreciation of the U.S. Dollar compared to the Chinese Renminbi during the first nine months of the year, as well as pension expense.
Our effective income tax rate was 30.3% and 29.7% in the nine months ended September 30, 2019 and 2018, respectively.
Cash and cash equivalents were $101,199 at September 30, 2019, and $100,933 at December 31, 2018, of which $99,690 and $96,762, respectively, were held outside the United States.
The increase in cash and cash equivalents of $266 was primarily driven by cash generated from operating activities of $40,735 and net proceeds from an increase in borrowings of long-term debt of $62,700, which were partially offset by the payment for the QTI acquisition of $73,588, capital expenditures of $15,299, treasury stock purchases of $8,045, dividends paid of $3,934, and taxes paid on behalf of equity award participants of $2,653.
Total long-term debt was $112,700 as of September 30, 2019 and $50,000 as of December 31, 2018.
Working capital increased by $9,112 during the nine months ended September 30, 2019, primarily due to the increase in accounts receivable, inventory and other assets as well as the decrease of accounts payable and accrued payroll and benefits, which were partially offset by an increase in operating lease obligations.
Components of net cash provided by operating activities included net earnings of $26,084, depreciation and amortization expense of $18,038, other net non-cash items of $6,236, and a net cash outflow from changes in assets and liabilities of $9,623.
Net cash used in investing activities for the first nine months of 2019 was $88,750, driven by the payment for the QTI acquisition of $73,588 and capital expenditures of $15,299.
The net cash inflow was the result of net proceeds from an increase in borrowings of long-term debt of $62,700, which was partially offset by treasury stock purchases of $8,045, dividends paid of $3,934, and taxes paid on behalf of equity award participants in the amount of $2,653.
The Credit Agreement provides for a revolving credit facility of $300,000, which may be increased by $150,000 at the request of the Company, subject to the administrative agent's approval.
This new unsecured credit facility replaces the prior $300,000 unsecured credit facility, which would have expired August 10, 2020.
The prior agreement was terminated as of February 12, 2019.
The Revolving Credit Facility requires, among other things, that CTS comply with a maximum total leverage ratio and a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio.
Failure to comply with these covenants could reduce the borrowing availability under the Revolving Credit Facility.
We were in compliance with all debt covenants at September 30, 2019.
We have entered into interest rate swap agreements to fix interest rates on $50,000 of long-term debt through February 2024.
The difference to be paid or received under the terms of the swap agreements is recognized as an adjustment to interest expense when settled.
We have historically funded our capital and operating needs primarily through cash flows from operating activities, supported by available credit under our Revolving Credit Facility.
We believe that cash flows from operating activities and available borrowings under our Revolving Credit Facility will be adequate to fund our working capital needs, capital expenditures, and debt service requirements for at least the next twelve months.
However, we may choose to pursue additional equity and debt financing to provide additional liquidity or to fund acquisitions.
Management prepared the consolidated financial statements of CTS under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.
These principles require the use of estimates, judgments, and assumptions.
Our contracts normally contain a single performance obligation that is fulfilled on the date of delivery based on shipping terms stipulated in the contract.
Contract assets will be reviewed for impairment when events or circumstances indicate that they may not be recoverable.
Provisions for estimated warranty expenses primarily related to our automotive products are made at the time products are sold.
We adjust our warranty reserve for any known or anticipated warranty claims as new information becomes available.
Over the last three years, product warranty reserves have ranged from 0.5% to 2.4% of total sales.
•Limited credit insurance on the majority of our international receivables.
We reserve for estimated credit losses based on historical experience and specific customer collection issues.
We believe our reserve level is appropriate considering the quality of the portfolio.
We value our inventories at the lower of the actual cost to purchase or manufacture using the first-in, first-out ("FIFO") method, or net realizable value.
We review inventory quantities on hand and record a provision for excess and obsolete inventory based on forecasts of product demand and production requirements.
Over the last three years, our reserves for excess and obsolete inventories have ranged from 10.2% to 18.4% of gross inventory.
We believe our reserve level is appropriate considering the quantities and quality of the inventories.
Actuarial assumptions are used in determining pension income and expense and our pension benefit obligation.
We utilize actuaries from consulting companies in each applicable country to develop our discount rates that match high-quality bonds currently available and expected to be available during the period to maturity of the pension benefit in order to provide the necessary future cash flows to pay the accumulated benefits when due.
After considering the recommendations of our actuaries, we have assumed a discount rate, expected rate of return on plan assets and a rate of compensation increase in determining our annual pension income and expense and the projected benefit obligation.
During the fourth quarter of each year, we review our actuarial assumptions in light of current economic factors to determine if the assumptions need to be adjusted.
•Allocation of a portion of goodwill to a business to be disposed.
If we believe that one or more of the above indicators of impairment have occurred, we perform an impairment test.
We have the option to perform a qualitative assessment (commonly referred to as "step zero" test) to determine whether further quantitative analysis for impairment of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets is necessary.
If, after assessing the totality of events or circumstances we determine that it is not more-likely-than-not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, we do not need to perform a quantitative analysis.
If a quantitative assessment is required, we estimate the fair value of each reporting unit using a combination of discounted cash flow analysis and market-based valuation methodologies.
Determining fair value using a quantitative approach requires significant judgment, including judgments about projected revenues, operating expenses, working capital investment, capital expenditures, and cash flows over a multi-year period.
The discount rate applied to our forecasts of future cash flows is based on our estimated weighted average cost of capital.
Changes in these estimates and assumptions could materially affect the determination of fair value and impact the goodwill impairment assessment.
•Significant negative industry or economic trends.
If we believe that one or more indicators of impairment have occurred, we perform a recoverability test by comparing the carrying amount of an asset or asset group to the sum of the undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and the eventual disposition of the asset or asset group.
During the nine months ended September 30, 2019 quarter we recognized impairment charges of $1,100 for fixed assets relating to our restructuring activities.
No other indicators of impairment were identified during the quarter ended September 30, 2019.
accordance with ASC 740 and adjust these liabilities when our judgment changes as a result of the evaluation of new information not previously available.
These differences will be reflected as increases or decreases to income tax expense in the period in which new information is available.
This transition tax substantially eliminated the basis difference that existed prior to the Tax Act.
We completed an evaluation of our indefinite reinvestment assertion as a result of the Tax Cut and Jobs Act during the fourth quarter of 2018 and decided not to reinvest the current year earnings of our primary operations, except for in the Czech Republic, Denmark, India, Mexico and Taiwan.
We intend to continue to indefinitely reinvest the earnings in these non-U.S. subsidiaries.
On February 7, 2019 the Board of Directors authorized a new stock repurchase program with a maximum dollar limit of $25 million.
