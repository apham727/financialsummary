Based on such evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of September 30, 2019.
The acquisition of Quality Thermistor, Inc. ("QTI") on July 31, 2019, represents a material change in internal control over financial reporting since managementâ€™s last assessment of our internal control over financial reporting which was completed as of December 31, 2018.

The process for evaluating controls and procedures is continuous and encompasses constant improvement of the design and effectiveness of established controls and procedures and the remediation of any deficiencies which may be identified during this process.
