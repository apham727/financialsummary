The accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared by CTS Corporation (“CTS” "we", "our", "us" or the "Company”), without audit, pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission.
Certain information and footnote disclosures normally included in financial statements prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles have been omitted pursuant to such rules and regulations.
The results of operations for the interim periods are not necessarily indicative of the results for the entire year.
In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Accounting Standards Update ("ASU") 2014-09, "Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606)".
The guidance in this ASU affects any entity that either enters into contracts with customers to transfer goods or services or enters into contracts for the transfer of nonfinancial assets unless those contracts are within the scope of other standards (for example, insurance contracts or lease contracts).
This guidance requires a company to recognize revenue to depict the transfer of goods or services to a customer at an amount that reflects the consideration it expects to receive in exchange for those goods or services.
Beginning in January 2018, CTS adopted the provisions of Topic 606 under the modified retrospective method, which requires a cumulative effect adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings on the date of adoption.
This approach was applied to contracts not completed as of December 31, 2017.
At date of adoption, there was no significant change to our past revenue recognition practices and therefore no adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings was required.
Our contracts normally contain a single performance obligation that is fulfilled on the date of delivery based on shipping terms stipulated in the contract.
We usually expect payment within 30 to 90 days from the shipping date, depending on our terms with the customer.
None of our contracts as of March 31, 2018, contained a significant financing component.
Contract assets will be reviewed for impairment when events or circumstances indicate that they may not be recoverable.
During the three months period ended March 31, 2018, we recognized revenues of $131 that were included in contract liabilities at the beginning of the period.
The increase in contract liabilities during the three months ended March 31, 2018 is primarily due to net increases in estimated future discounts and price concessions, offset by net settlements of products sold with rights of return.
In June 2016, we announced plans to restructure operations by phasing out production at our Elkhart facility by the end of 2018 and transitioning it into a research and development center supporting our global operations ("June 2016 Plan").
Additional organizational changes will also occur in various other locations.
During the third quarter of 2017, we revised the June 2016 Plan.
The amendment added an additional $1,100 in planned costs related to the relocation of our corporate headquarters in Lisle, IL and our plant in Bolingbrook, IL, both of which will be consolidated into a single facility.
The amendment does not impact any additional employees.
The total cost of the plan is expected to be approximately $13,400 and will impact approximately 230 employees.
The total restructuring liability related to severance and other one-time benefit arrangements under the June 2016 Plan was $1,279 at March 31, 2018, and $1,460 at December 31, 2017.
These restructuring actions, which were completed during 2015, impacted approximately 120 positions.
The remaining restructuring liability related to the April 2014 Plan was $445 at March 31, 2018, and $453 at December 31, 2017.
Certain processes in the manufacture of our current and past products create by-products classified as hazardous waste.
We reserve for probable remediation activities and for claims and proceedings against us with respect to other environmental matters.
We record reserves on an undiscounted basis.
On May 23, 2016, we requested and received a $100,000 increase in the aggregate revolving credit commitments under the existing credit agreement, which increased the credit line from $200,000 to $300,000.
The Revolving Credit Facility includes a swing line sublimit of $15,000 and a letter of credit sublimit of $10,000.
Borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility bear interest, at our option, at the base rate plus the applicable margin for base rate loans or LIBOR plus the applicable margin for LIBOR loans.
We also pay a quarterly commitment fee on the unused portion of the Revolving Credit Facility.
The commitment fee ranges from 0.20% to 0.40% based on the our total leverage ratio.
The Revolving Credit Facility requires, among other things, that we comply with a maximum total leverage ratio and a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio.
We have debt issuance costs related to our long-term debt that are being amortized using the straight-line method over the life of the debt.
Amortization expense was approximately $46 for both the three months ended March 31, 2018 and March 31, 2017.
We selectively use derivative financial instruments including foreign currency forward contracts and interest rate swaps to manage our exposure to these risks.
The use of derivative financial instruments exposes the Company to credit risk, which relates to the risk of nonperformance by a counterparty to the derivative contracts.
We manage our credit risk by entering into derivative contracts with only highly rated financial institutions and by using netting agreements.
In January of 2016, we began using forward contracts to mitigate currency risk related to a portion of our forecasted foreign currency revenues and costs.
The currency forward contracts are designed as cash flow hedges and are recorded in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets at fair value.
At least quarterly, we assess the effectiveness of these hedging relationships based on the total change in their fair value using regression analysis.
We continue to monitor the Company’s overall currency exposure and may elect to add cash flow hedges in the future.
At March 31, 2018, we had a net unrealized gain of $37 in accumulated other comprehensive loss, of which $34 is expected to be reclassified to income within the next 12 months.
At March 31, 2017 we had a net unrealized gain of $486 in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss).
In the third quarter of 2016, we entered into three additional interest rate swap agreements to fix interest rates on $50,000 of long-term debt for the periods August 2017 to August 2020.
The difference to be paid or received under the terms of the swap agreements will be recognized as an adjustment to interest expense when settled.
These swaps are treated as cash flow hedges and consequently, the changes in fair value were recorded in other comprehensive income (loss).
The estimated net amount of the existing gains or losses that are reported in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) that is expected to be reclassified into earnings within the next twelve months is approximately $424.
The Company has elected to net its foreign currency derivative assets and liabilities in the balance sheet in accordance with ASC 210-20 (Balance Sheet, Offsetting).
On a gross basis, there were foreign currency derivative assets of $351 and foreign currency derivative liabilities of $317.
Unrealized gains (losses) on hedges relate to interest rate swaps to convert the revolving credit facility's variable rate of interest into a fixed rate and foreign currency forward contracts used to hedge our exposure to changes in exchange rates affecting certain revenues and costs denominated in foreign currencies.
These hedges are designated as cash flow hedges, and we have deferred income statement recognition of gains and losses until the hedged transactions occur, at which time amounts are reclassified into earnings.
Further information related to CTS’ derivative financial instruments is included in Note 12 - Derivative Financial Instruments and Note 16 – Fair Value Measurements.
Cumulative translation adjustments relate to our non-U.S. subsidiary companies that have designated a functional currency other than the U.S. dollar.
We are required to translate the subsidiary functional currency financial statements to dollars using a combination of historical, period-end, and average foreign exchange rates.
This combination of rates creates the foreign currency translation adjustment component of other comprehensive (loss) income.
Changes in exchange rates between the functional currency and the currency in which a transaction is denominated are foreign exchange transaction gains or losses.
Transaction gains for the three months ended March 31, 2018 and March 31, 2017 were $1,996 and $395, respectively, which have been included in other income (expense) in the Condensed Consolidated Statement of Earnings.
No common stock repurchases were made during the three months ended March 31, 2018.
Approximately $17,554 is available for future purchases.
Certain potentially dilutive restricted stock units are excluded from diluted earning per share because they are anti-dilutive.
The number of awards that were anti-dilutive at March 31, 2018 and March 31, 2017 were 78,317 and 88,592, respectively.
We recognize expense on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period for each separately vesting portion of the award as if the award was, in substance, multiple awards.
We have no stock options exercisable or outstanding as of March 31, 2018, other than the performance-based stock options described below.
During 2015 and 2016, the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors of the Company (the “Committee”) granted a total of 350,000 performance-based stock option awards (“Performance-Based Option Awards”) for certain employees under the 2014 Plan, of which 295,000 remain outstanding after considering forfeitures.
The Performance-Based Option Awards have an exercise price of $18.37, a term of five years, and generally will become exercisable (provided the optionee remains employed by the Company or an affiliate) upon our attainment of at least $600,000 in revenues during any of our trailing four quarterly periods (as determined by the Committee) during the term.
The following table summarizes each grant of performance awards outstanding at March 31, 2018.
Cash-Settled RSUs entitle the holder to receive the cash equivalent of one share of common stock for each unit when the unit vests.
These RSUs are issued to key employees residing in foreign locations as direct compensation.
Generally, these RSUs vest over a three-year period.
Cash-Settled RSUs are classified as liabilities and are remeasured at each reporting date until settled.
At March 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017 we had 17,361 and 14,082 cash-settled RSUs outstanding, respectively.
At March 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017, liabilities of $127 and $241, respectively were included in Accrued liabilities on our Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets.
We use interest rate swaps to convert our Revolving Credit Facility’s variable rate of interest into a fixed rate and foreign currency forward contracts to hedge the effect of foreign currency changes on certain revenues and costs denominated in foreign currencies.
These derivative financial instruments are measured at fair value on a recurring basis.
The fair value of our interest rate swaps and foreign currency hedges were measured using standard valuation models using market-based observable inputs over the contractual terms, including forward yield curves, among others.
There is a readily determinable market for these derivative instruments, but that market is not active and therefore they are classified within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy.
Our long-term debt consists of the Revolving Credit Facility which is recorded at its carrying value.
There is a readily determinable market for our long-term debt and it is classified within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy as the market is not deemed to be active.
The fair value of long-term debt approximates carrying value and was determined by valuing a similar hypothetical coupon bond and attributing that value to our long-term debt under the Revolving Credit Facility.
Our effective income tax rate was 24.5% and 30.6% in the first quarters of 2018 and 2017, respectively.
The decrease in the effective tax rate for the three months ended March 31, 2018, compared with the same period in 2017, was primarily attributed to the impact of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the "Act"), which reduced the U.S. federal corporate income tax rate from 35 percent to 21 percent effective January 1, 2018.
During the three-months ended March 31, 2018, we recognized measurement period adjustments that resulted in additional tax expense of $241.
For these computations, we have recorded an estimate in our effective tax rate for the three-months ended March 31, 2018.
If we subsequently change our assertion during the measurement period, we will account for the change in assertion as part of the Act enactment.
The ASU will be applied prospectively.
This ASU is meant to improve the accounting for the income tax effect of intra-entity transfers of assets other than inventory.
Currently, US GAAP prohibits the recognition of current and deferred income taxes for intra-entity asset transfers until the asset is sold to a third party.
This ASU will now require companies to recognize the income tax effect of an intra-entity asset transfer (other than inventory) when the transaction occurs.
Early adoption is permitted and is to be applied on a modified retrospective basis through a cumulative-effect adjustment to retained earnings as of the beginning of the period of adoption.
2016-15, "Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments".
This ASU reduces the diversity in reporting of eight specific cash flow issues due to accounting guidance that is unclear or does not exist.
The eight issues relate to certain debt activities, business combination activities, insurance settlements and other various activities.
We adopted this ASU as of January 1, 2018 and it did not have an impact on our financial statements.
This amendment created a new Topic under the accounting standards codification to account for the provisions of the ASU.
This amendment is meant to provide transparency and to improve comparability between entities.
The ASU requires companies to record an asset and liability on the balance sheet for leases that were formerly designated as operating leases as well as leases designated as financing leases.
The provisions of the ASU predominately change the recognition of leases for lessees; the provisions do not substantially change the accounting for lessors.
This ASU will supersede the provisions of Topic 840 Leases.
The liability recorded for a lease is meant to recognize the lease payments and the asset as a right to use the underlying asset for the lease, including optional periods if it is reasonably certain the option will be exercised.
Recording of the liability should be based on the present value of the lease payments.
If a lease term is less than twelve months, a company is allowed to elect not to record the asset and liability.
Additionally, the provisions of this ASU provide additional guidance on separating lease terms from maintenance and other type of provisions that provide a good or service, accounting for sale-leaseback provisions, and leveraged leases.
Reporting in the cash flow statement remains virtually unchanged.
Additional qualitative and quantitative disclosures are required.
These updates are required to be applied under a modified retrospective approach from the beginning of the earliest period presented in our financial statements upon adoption.
The modified approach provides optional practical expedients that may be elected, which will allow companies to continue to account for leases under the previous guidance for leases that commenced prior to the effective date.
We have not yet commenced the process for evaluating the impact of this ASU on our financial statements, and therefore it's impact has not yet been determined.
