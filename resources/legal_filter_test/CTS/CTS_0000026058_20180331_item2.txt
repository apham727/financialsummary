Sales were $113,530 in the first quarter of 2018, an increase of $13,376 or 13.4% from the first quarter of 2017. Sales to automotive markets increased $7,912 or 11.9%. Other sales increased $5,464 or 16.2%. The Noliac acquisition, which was completed in May 2017, added $2,596 in sales for the quarter. Changes in foreign exchange rates increased sales by $2,751 year-over-year due to the U.S. Dollar depreciating compared to the Euro and Chinese Renminbi and relating mostly to sales of automotive products.
Gross margin as a percent of sales was 33.9% in the first quarter of 2018 compared to 34.2% in the first quarter of 2017.
Research and development expenses were $6,507 or 5.7% of sales in the first quarter of 2018 compared to $6,003 or 6.0% of sales in the comparable quarter of 2017. Research and development expenses are focused on expanded applications of existing products and new product development as well as current product and process enhancements.
Restructuring charges were $1,195 or 1.1% of sales in the first quarter of 2018. The charges were mainly for building and equipment relocation, severance, and travel costs related to the restructuring of certain operations as part of the 2016 Restructuring Plan. Restructuring charges were $777 or 0.8% of sales in the first quarter of 2017.
Operating earnings were $13,359 or 11.8% of sales in the first quarter of 2018 compared to operating earnings of $12,196 or 12.2% of sales in the comparable quarter of 2017 as a result of the items discussed above.
Interest income increased due to higher cash balances and interest rates. Other income in the first quarter of 2018 was principally driven by foreign currency translation gains, mainly due to the depreciation of the U.S. Dollar compared to the Chinese Renminbi and Euro during the quarter.
Our effective income tax rate was 24.5% and 30.6% in the first quarters of 2018 and 2017, respectively. The decrease in the effective tax rate for the three months ended March 31, 2018, compared with the same period in 2017, was primarily attributed to the impact of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, which reduced the U.S. federal corporate income tax rate from 35 percent to 21 percent effective January 1, 2018 and additional tax expense of $241 associated with measurement period adjustments to provisional amounts recorded in the prior year as allowed for under the guidance issued in Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 118.
Cash and cash equivalents were $121,383 at March 31, 2018, and $113,572 at December 31, 2017, of which $115,167 and $112,531, respectively, were held outside the United States. The increase in cash and cash equivalents of $7,811 was primarily driven by cash generated from operating activities of $20,154, which was partially offset by capital expenditures of $6,912, net long-term debt payments of $2,300, taxes paid on behalf of employees for equity awards of $1,423, and dividends paid of $1,318. Total long-term debt was $74,000 as of March 31, 2018 and $76,300 as of December 31, 2017. Total debt as a percentage of total capitalization, defined as the sum of notes payable and long-term debt as a percentage of total debt and shareholders' equity, was 17.2% at March 31, 2018, compared to 18.2% at December 31, 2017.
Net cash provided by operating activities was $20,154 during the first three months of 2018. Components of net cash provided by operating activities included net earnings of $11,548, depreciation and amortization expense of $5,483, other net non-cash items of $2,264, and the net cash inflow from changes in assets and liabilities of $859.
On August 10, 2015, we entered into a new five-year credit agreement (“Revolving Credit Facility”) with a group of banks in order to support our financing needs. The Revolving Credit Facility originally provided for a credit line of $200,000. On May 23, 2016, we requested and received a $100,000 increase in the aggregate revolving credit commitments under the existing credit agreement, which increased the credit line from $200,000 to $300,000. 
The Revolving Credit Facility requires, among other things, that CTS comply with a maximum total leverage ratio and a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio. Failure to comply with these covenants could reduce the borrowing availability under the Revolving Credit Facility. We were in compliance with all debt covenants at March 31, 2018. 
We use interest rate swaps to convert the Revolving Credit Facility’s variable rate of interest into a fixed rate. In the second quarter of 2012, we entered into four separate interest rate swap agreements to fix interest rates on $50,000 of long-term debt for the periods January 2013 to January 2017. In the third quarter of 2012, we entered into four additional interest rate swap agreements to fix interest rates on $25,000 of long-term debt for the periods January 2013 to January 2017. In the third quarter of 2016, we entered into three additional forward-starting interest rate swap agreements to fix interest rates on $50,000 of long-term debt for the periods August 2017 to August 2020. The difference to be paid or received under the terms of the swap agreements will be recognized as an adjustment to interest expense when settled.
We have historically funded our capital and operating needs primarily through cash flows from operating activities, supported by available credit under our Revolving Credit Facility. We believe that cash flows from operating activities and available borrowings under our Revolving Credit Facility will be adequate to fund our working capital needs, capital expenditures, and debt service requirements for at least the next twelve months. However, we may choose to pursue additional equity and debt financing to provide additional liquidity or to fund acquisitions.
Our contracts normally contain a single performance obligation that is fulfilled on the date of delivery based on shipping terms stipulated in the contract. We recognize revenue when (or as) the performance obligation has been satisfied after considering the impact of variable consideration and other factors that may affect the transaction price. Differences between the amount of revenue recognized and the amount invoiced, collected from, or paid to our customers are recognized as contract assets or liabilities. Contract assets will be reviewed for impairment when events or circumstances indicate that they may not be recoverable. 
Provisions for estimated warranty expenses related to our automotive products are made at the time products are sold. These estimates are established using a quoted industry rate. We adjust our warranty reserve for any known or anticipated warranty claims as new information becomes available. We evaluate our warranty obligations at least quarterly and adjust our accruals if it is probable that future costs will be different than our current reserve. 
•Limited credit insurance on the majority of our international receivables.
We reserve for estimated credit losses based on historical experience and specific customer collection issues. Over the last three years, accounts receivable reserves have been approximately 0.2% to 0.7% of total accounts receivable. We believe our reserve level is appropriate considering the quality of the portfolio. While credit losses have historically been within expectations and the reserves established, we cannot guarantee that our credit loss experience will continue to be consistent with historical experience.
We value our inventories at the lower of the actual cost to purchase or manufacture using the first-in, first-out ("FIFO") method, or net realizable value. We review inventory quantities on hand and record a provision for excess and obsolete inventory based on forecasts of product demand and production requirements.
Over the last three years, our reserves for excess and obsolete inventories have ranged from 13.8% to 19.5% of gross inventory. We believe our reserve level is appropriate considering the quantities and quality of the inventories.
Actuarial assumptions are used in determining pension income and expense and our pension benefit obligation. We utilize actuaries from consulting companies in each applicable country to develop our discount rates that match high-quality bonds currently available and expected to be available during the period to maturity of the pension benefit in order to provide the necessary future cash flows to pay the accumulated benefits when due. After considering the recommendations of our actuaries, we have assumed a discount rate, expected rate of return on plan assets and a rate of compensation increase in determining our annual pension income and expense and the projected benefit obligation. During the fourth quarter of each year, we review our actuarial assumptions in light of current economic factors to determine if the assumptions need to be adjusted. Changes in the actuarial assumptions could have a material effect on our results of operations.
•Allocation of a portion of goodwill to a business to be disposed.
If we believe that one or more of the above indicators of impairment have occurred, we perform an impairment test. The test involves comparing the fair values of our reporting units with their carrying values. We recognize an impairment charge for the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the reporting unit's fair value, but only to the extent of goodwill recognized. 
Under the "Income Approach — Discounted Cash Flow Method", the key assumptions include sales, cost of sales, and operating expense projections through the year 2021. These assumptions were determined by management utilizing our internal operating plan and assuming growth rates for revenues, operating expenses, and gross margin assumptions. The fourth key assumption under this approach is the discount rate, which is determined by looking at current risk-free rates, current market interest rates and the evaluation of risk premium relevant to the business segment. If any of our assumptions were to change or were incorrect, our fair value calculation may change, which could result in impairment.
The results of these two methods are weighted based upon management's determination. 
If the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds the reporting unit's fair value, we perform the second step of the goodwill impairment test to determine the amount of impairment loss, if any. This involves comparing the implied fair value of the affected reporting unit's goodwill with the carrying value of that goodwill.
•Significant negative industry or economic trends.
If we believe that one or more indicators of impairment have occurred, we perform a recoverability test by comparing the carrying amount of an asset or asset group to the sum of the undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and the eventual disposition of the asset or asset group. If such assets are considered to be impaired, the impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the fair value. No indicators of impairment were identified as of March 31, 2018. 
Item 2.  Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds
On April 27, 2015, we announced that our Board of Directors authorized an expansion to its repurchase program by authorizing the purchase of an additional $25 million dollars of its common stock in the open market. This authorization has no expiration. As shown in the following table, there were no stock repurchases during the quarter ended March 31, 2018.
