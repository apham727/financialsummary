Other expense in the first six months of 2018 was principally driven by foreign currency translation losses, mainly due to the appreciation of the U.S. Dollar compared to the Chinese Renminbi and Euro during the first half of the year.
Our effective income tax rate was 30.2% and 29.4% in the first half of 2018 and 2017, respectively.
Cash and cash equivalents were $102,861 at June 30, 2018, and $113,572 at December 31, 2017, of which $94,507 and $112,531, respectively, were held outside the United States.
The decrease in cash and cash equivalents of $10,711 was primarily driven by capital expenditures of $14,910 and net long-term debt payments of $19,300, which were partially offset by cash generated from operating activities of $27,721.
Total long-term debt was $57,000 as of June 30, 2018 and $76,300 as of December 31, 2017.
Total debt as a percentage of total capitalization, defined as long-term debt as a percentage of total debt and shareholders' equity, was 13.5% at June 30, 2018, compared to 18.2% at December 31, 2017.
Working capital decreased by $4,283 during the six months ended June 30, 2018, primarily due the decrease in cash and cash equivalents as well as the increase in accounts payable, which were partially offset by higher accounts receivable and inventory.
Components of net cash provided by operating activities included net earnings of $18,757, depreciation and amortization expense of $10,961, other net non-cash items of $1,677, and a net cash outflow from changes in assets and liabilities of $3,674.
Net cash used in investing activities for the first six months of 2018 was $14,909, driven almost entirely by capital expenditures relating to our ongoing ERP project and production line movements.
These cash outflows were the result of net long-term debt payments of $19,300, dividend payments of $2,638, and taxes paid on behalf of equity award participants in the amount of $1,429.
On May 23, 2016, we requested and received a $100,000 increase in the aggregate revolving credit commitments under the existing credit agreement, which increased the credit line from $200,000 to $300,000.
The Revolving Credit Facility requires, among other things, that CTS comply with a maximum total leverage ratio and a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio.
Failure to comply with these covenants could reduce the borrowing availability under the Revolving Credit Facility.
We were in compliance with all debt covenants at June 30, 2018.
In the third quarter of 2016, we entered into three additional forward-starting interest rate swap agreements to fix interest rates on $50,000 of long-term debt for the periods August 2017 to August 2020.
The difference to be paid or received under the terms of the swap agreements will be recognized as an adjustment to interest expense when settled.
We are still evaluating whether to change our indefinite reinvestment assertion in light of the Act and consider that conclusion to be incomplete under guidance issued by SAB 118.
If we subsequently change our assertion during the measurement period, we will account for the change in assertion as a change in estimate related to the enactment of the Act.
We have historically funded our capital and operating needs primarily through cash flows from operating activities, supported by available credit under our Revolving Credit Facility.
We believe that cash flows from operating activities and available borrowings under our Revolving Credit Facility will be adequate to fund our working capital needs, capital expenditures, and debt service requirements for at least the next twelve months.
However, we may choose to pursue additional equity and debt financing to provide additional liquidity or to fund acquisitions.
Management prepared the consolidated financial statements of CTS under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.
These principles require the use of estimates, judgments, and assumptions.
Our contracts normally contain a single performance obligation that is fulfilled on the date of delivery based on shipping terms stipulated in the contract.
Contract assets will be reviewed for impairment when events or circumstances indicate that they may not be recoverable.
Provisions for estimated warranty expenses related to our automotive products are made at the time products are sold.
We adjust our warranty reserve for any known or anticipated warranty claims as new information becomes available.
•Limited credit insurance on the majority of our international receivables.
We reserve for estimated credit losses based on historical experience and specific customer collection issues.
We believe our reserve level is appropriate considering the quality of the portfolio.
We value our inventories at the lower of the actual cost to purchase or manufacture using the first-in, first-out ("FIFO") method, or net realizable value.
We review inventory quantities on hand and record a provision for excess and obsolete inventory based on forecasts of product demand and production requirements.
Over the last three years, our reserves for excess and obsolete inventories have ranged from 11.9% to 20.1% of gross inventory.
We believe our reserve level is appropriate considering the quantities and quality of the inventories.
Actuarial assumptions are used in determining pension income and expense and our pension benefit obligation.
We utilize actuaries from consulting companies in each applicable country to develop our discount rates that match high-quality bonds currently available and expected to be available during the period to maturity of the pension benefit in order to provide the necessary future cash flows to pay the accumulated benefits when due.
After considering the recommendations of our actuaries, we have assumed a discount rate, expected rate of return on plan assets and a rate of compensation increase in determining our annual pension income and expense and the projected benefit obligation.
During the fourth quarter of each year, we review our actuarial assumptions in light of current economic factors to determine if the assumptions need to be adjusted.
•Allocation of a portion of goodwill to a business to be disposed.
If we believe that one or more of the above indicators of impairment have occurred, we perform an impairment test.
The test involves comparing the fair values of our reporting units with their carrying values.
We recognize an impairment charge for the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the reporting unit's fair value, but only to the extent of goodwill recognized.
Under the "Income Approach — Discounted Cash Flow Method", the key assumptions include sales, cost of sales, and operating expense projections through the year 2021.
The fourth key assumption under this approach is the discount rate, which is determined by looking at current risk-free rates, current market interest rates and the evaluation of risk premium relevant to the business segment.
Under the "Market Approach — Guideline Public Company Method", we identified eight publicly traded companies which we believe have significant relevant similarities to CTS.
For these eight companies, we calculated a range of EBITDA multiples derived from the ratio of enterprise value to EBITDA and compared these multiples to the corresponding multiples for each of our reporting units.
The market prices of CTS and the other guideline company's shares are also key assumptions as they are used to calculate enterprise value.
The results of these two methods are weighted based upon management's determination.
If the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds the reporting unit's fair value, we perform the second step of the goodwill impairment test to determine the amount of impairment loss, if any.
This involves comparing the implied fair value of the affected reporting unit's goodwill with the carrying value of that goodwill.
There have not been any significant changes to our impairment testing methodology other than updates to the assumptions to reflect the current market environment.
Based upon our latest assessment, we determined that our goodwill was not impaired as of October 1, 2017.
•Significant negative industry or economic trends.
If we believe that one or more indicators of impairment have occurred, we perform a recoverability test by comparing the carrying amount of an asset or asset group to the sum of the undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and the eventual disposition of the asset or asset group.
ASC 740 states that a tax benefit from an uncertain tax position may be recognized when it is more-likely-than-not that the position will be sustained upon examination, including resolutions of any related appeals or litigation processes, on the basis of its technical merits.
These differences will be reflected as increases or decreases to income tax expense in the period in which new information is available.
We are still evaluating whether to change our indefinite reinvestment assertion in light of the Act and consider that conclusion to be incomplete under guidance issued by SAB 118.
If we subsequently change our assertion during the measurement period, we will account for the change in assertion as a change in estimate related to enactment of the Act.
On April 27, 2015, we announced that our Board of Directors authorized an expansion to its repurchase program by authorizing the purchase of an additional $25 million dollars of its common stock in the open market.
This authorization has no expiration.
As shown in the following table, there were no stock repurchases during the quarter ended June 30, 2018.
