We are a leading supplier of process control and yield management solutions for the semiconductor and related nanoelectronics industries. Our broad portfolio of inspection and metrology products, and related service, software and other offerings primarily supports integrated circuit (“IC” or “chip”) manufacturers throughout the entire semiconductor fabrication process, from research and development to final volume production. We provide leading edge equipment, software and support that enable IC manufacturers to identify, resolve and manage significant advanced technology manufacturing process challenges and obtain higher finished product yields at lower overall cost. In addition to serving the semiconductor industry, we also provide a range of technology solutions to a number of other high technology industries, including advanced packaging, light emitting diode (“LED”), power devices, compound semiconductor, and data storage industries, as well as general materials research.
Our products and services are used by the vast majority of bare wafer, IC, lithography reticle (“reticle” or “mask”) and hard disk drive manufacturers around the world. Our products, services and expertise are used by our customers to measure, detect, analyze and resolve critical product defects that arise in that environment in order to control nanometric level manufacturing processes. Our revenues are driven largely by our customers’ spending on capital equipment and related maintenance services necessary to support key transitions in their underlying product technologies, or to increase their production volumes in response to market demand or expansion plans. Our semiconductor customers generally operate in one or more of the three major semiconductor markets - memory, foundry and logic. All three of these markets are characterized by rapid technological changes and sudden shifts in end-user demand, which influence the level and pattern of our customers’ spending on our products and services. Although capital spending in all three semiconductor markets has historically been very cyclical, the demand for more advanced and lower cost chips used in a growing number of consumer electronics, communications, data processing, and industrial and automotive products has resulted over the long term in a favorable demand environment for our process control and yield management solutions, particularly in the foundry and logic markets, which have higher levels of process control adoption than the memory market. 
As we are a supplier to the global semiconductor and semiconductor-related industries, our customer base continues to become more highly concentrated over time, thereby increasing the potential impact of a sudden change in capital spending by a major customer on our revenues and profitability. As our customer base becomes increasingly more concentrated, large orders from a relatively limited number of customers account for a substantial portion of our sales, which potentially exposes us to more volatility for revenues and earnings. In the global semiconductor related industries, China is emerging as a major region for manufacturing of logic and memory chips, adding to its role as the world’s largest consumer of ICs. Government initiatives are propelling China to expand its domestic manufacturing capacity and attracting semiconductor manufacturers from Taiwan, Korea, Japan and the US. China is currently seen as an important long-term growth region for the semiconductor capital equipment sector. We are also subject to the cyclical capital spending that has historically characterized the semiconductor and semiconductor-related industries. The timing, length, intensity and volatility of the capacity-oriented capital spending cycles of our customers are unpredictable. 
Our view of the current wafer fab equipment demand climate is aligned with consensus industry analyst expectations for the calendar year 2019, which reflects a decline in capital equipment spending by memory customers. In contrast to the memory business, capital equipment spending by foundry and logic customers at the leading edge has begun to ramp, and the momentum is expected to continue in calendar year 2019. We have already seen our mix of business begin to shift toward increased purchases by logic and foundry customers as a percentage of total sales, and we expect spending from these customers to continue to remain strong. Because of a more diversified semiconductor device-end demand, and disciplined capacity planning by wafer fab equipment customers, we believe the long-term growth dynamics for the industry remain strong.
Proposed Merger with Orbotech, Ltd.
On March 18, 2018, we entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the “Merger Agreement”) with Orbotech, Ltd. (“Orbotech”) pursuant to which we would acquire Orbotech for $38.86 in cash and 0.25 of a share of our common stock in exchange for each ordinary share of Orbotech, which at the time of announcement valued Orbotech at $3.2 billion in enterprise value. The merger contemplated by the Merger Agreement (the “Orbotech Merger”) is subject to receipt of required regulatory approvals and satisfaction of the other customary closing conditions. KLA continues to have advanced discussions with the State Administration for Market Regulation of the People’s Republic of China (SAMR) regarding clearance of the proposed merger with a goal of obtaining clearance as soon as practicable in 2019. We intend to fund the cash portion of the purchase price with cash from the combined company’s balance sheet.
In addition, we announced a share repurchase authorization up to $2 billion. The share repurchase program is targeted to be completed within 12 to 18 months following the close of this transaction. We intend to raise approximately $1 billion in new long-term debt financing to complete the share repurchase program. For additional details, refer to Note 10, “Stock Repurchase Program.” to the condensed consolidated financial statements.
For a description of recent accounting pronouncements, including those recently adopted and the expected dates of adoption as well as estimated effects, if any, on our condensed consolidated financial statements of those not yet adopted, see Note 1, “Basis of Presentation” to the condensed consolidated financial statements for additional details.
On July 1, 2018, we adopted ASC 606 using the modified retrospective transition approach. Results for reporting periods beginning after July 1, 2018 are presented under the ASC 606, while prior period amounts are presented under legacy guidance. For additional details, refer to Note 2 “Revenue” to the condensed consolidated financial statements. 
Product revenue increased during the three months ended December 31, 2018 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017, primarily due to a strong demand from our customers in the memory business resulting in the increased next generation and capacity-related investments.
Product revenues increased during the six months ended December 31, 2018 compared to the six months ended December 31, 2017, primarily due to a strong demand from our customers in the memory and wafer inspection businesses resulting in the increased next generation and capacity-related investments, and a favorable impact from the adoption of ASC 606 due to our assessment of timing of transfer of control.
Service revenues during the three months ended December 31, 2018 increased compared to the three months ended September 30, 2018, primarily due to an increase in the number of systems installed at our customers’ sites.
Service revenues during the three and six months ended December 31, 2018 increased compared to the three and six months ended December 31, 2017, primarily due an increase in the number of systems installed at our customers’ sites, and the impact of adoption of ASC 606 whereby revenue from the standard warranty represents a separate performance obligation and included in our services revenue.
A significant portion of our revenues continues to be generated in Asia, where a substantial portion of the world’s semiconductor manufacturing capacity is located, and we expect that trend to continue. 
Our gross margin decreased to 63.5% for three months ended December 31, 2018 from 65.1% during the three months ended September 30, 2018, primarily due to an unfavorable mix of products and services sold. 
 Our gross margin decreased to 63.5% for three months ended December 31, 2018 from 64.4% during the three months ended December 31, 2017, primarily due to an increase in service and manufacturing costs, partially offset by a favorable mix of products and services sold. 
Our gross margin increased to 64.3% during the six months ended December 31, 2018, from 64.0% during the six months ended December 31, 2017, primarily due to a favorable mix of products and services sold, partially offset by an increase in service and manufacturing costs. 
Other expense (income), net is comprised primarily of realized gains or losses on sales of marketable securities, gains or losses from revaluations of certain foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities as well as foreign currency contracts, and interest-related accruals (such as interest and penalty accruals related to our tax obligations) and interest income earned on our invested cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities.
The increase in other expense (income), net during the three months ended December 31, 2018 compared to the three months ended December 31, 2017 was primarily due to an increase in interest income of $2.9 million.
As of December 31, 2018, we have completed our accounting for the tax effects of the Act, which was enacted into law on December 22, 2017. We recorded a tax benefit adjustment of $0.3 million and $20.1 million for the transition tax liability provided by the Act during the three and six months ended December 31, 2018, respectively. Future guidance of the Act from U.S. federal and state governments may change the tax liability.
Our future effective income tax rate depends on various factors, such as tax legislation, the geographic composition of our pre-tax income, the amount of our pre-tax income as business activities fluctuate, non-deductible expenses incurred in connection with acquisitions, research and development credits as a percentage of aggregate pre-tax income, the domestic manufacturing deduction, non-taxable or non-deductible increases or decreases in the assets held within our Executive Deferred Savings Plan, the tax effects of employee stock activity and the effectiveness of our tax planning strategies.
As of December 31, 2018, our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities totaled $2.69 billion, which represents a decrease of $186.2 million from June 30, 2018. The decrease is mainly due to stock repurchases of $550.2 million, and cash used for payment of dividends and dividend equivalents of $237.3 million, partially offset by our cash generated from operations and net proceeds from marketable securities transactions.
During the three months ended December 31, 2018, our Board of Directors declared a regular quarterly cash dividend of $0.75 per share on our outstanding common stock, which was paid on December 4, 2018 to our stockholders of record as of the close of business on November 17, 2018. During the same period in fiscal year 2017, our Board of Directors declared and paid a regular quarterly cash dividend of $0.59 per share on our outstanding common stock. The total amount of regular quarterly cash dividends and dividend equivalents paid during the three months ended December 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017 was $114.5 million and $92.6 million, respectively. The total amount of regular quarterly cash dividends and dividend equivalents paid during the six months ended December 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017 was $234.4 million and $186.7 million, respectively. The amount of accrued dividends payable for regular quarterly cash dividends on unvested restricted stock units (RSUs) with dividend equivalent rights as of December 31, 2018 and June 30, 2018 was $5.4 million and $6.7 million, respectively. These amounts will be paid upon vesting of the underlying unvested RSU as described in Note 9, “Equity and Long-term Incentive Compensation Plans,” to the condensed consolidated financial statements.
On November 19, 2014, our Board of Directors declared a special cash dividend of $16.50 per share on our outstanding common stock. The declaration and payment of the special cash dividend was part of our leveraged recapitalization transaction under which the special cash dividend was financed through a combination of existing cash and proceeds from the debt financing disclosed in Note 8 “Debt” to the condensed consolidated financial statements that was completed during the three months ended December 31, 2014. The total amount of the special cash dividend accrued by us at the declaration date was substantially paid out during the three months ended December 31, 2014, except for the aggregate special cash dividend of $43.0 million that was accrued for the unvested RSUs and to be paid when such underlying unvested RSUs vest. During the three months ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, the total special cash dividends paid with respect to vested RSUs were immaterial. During the six months ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, the total special cash dividends paid with respect to vested RSUs were $2.9 million and $6.2 million, respectively. As of December 31, 2018, all of the special cash dividends accrued with respect to outstanding RSUs were vested and paid in full. Other than the special cash dividend declared during the three months ended December 31, 2014, we historically have not declared any special cash dividends. For details of the special cash dividend, refer to Note 8 “Equity and Long-Term Incentive Compensation Plans,” of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2018. 
The shares repurchased under our stock repurchase program have reduced our basic and diluted weighted-average shares outstanding for the six months ended December 31, 2018 and 2017. The stock repurchase program is intended, in part, to offset shares issued in connection with the purchases under our ESPP program and the vesting of employee restricted stock units. 
In November 2014, we issued $2.50 billion aggregate principal amount of senior, unsecured long-term notes (collectively referred to as “Senior Notes”) as part of the leveraged recapitalization plan. 
The original discount on the Senior Notes amounted to $4.0 million and is being amortized over the life of the debt. Interest is payable semi-annually on May 1 and November 1 of each year. The debt indenture (the “Indenture”) includes covenants that limit our ability to grant liens on our facilities and enter into sale and leaseback transactions, subject to certain allowances under which certain sale and leaseback transactions are not restricted. 
As of December 31, 2018, we were in compliance with all of our covenants under the Indenture associated with the Senior Notes. 
We may borrow, repay and reborrow funds under the Revolving Credit Facility until the Maturity Date, at which time such Revolving Credit Facility will terminate, and all outstanding loans under such facility, together with all accrued and unpaid interest, must be repaid. We may prepay the outstanding borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility at any time without a prepayment penalty.
The Revolving Credit Facility requires us to maintain an interest expense coverage ratio as described in the Credit Agreement, on a quarterly basis, covering the trailing four consecutive fiscal quarters of no less than 3.50 to 1.00. In addition, we are required to maintain the maximum leverage ratio as described in the Credit Agreement, on a quarterly basis of 3.00 to 1.00, covering the trailing four consecutive fiscal quarters for each fiscal quarter, which can be increased to 4.00 to 1.00 for a period of time in connection with a material acquisition or a series of material acquisitions. 
We were in compliance with the financial covenants under the Credit Agreement as of December 31, 2018 (the interest expense coverage ratio was 17.12 to 1.00 and the leverage ratio was 1.20 to 1.00) and had no outstanding borrowings under the unfunded Revolving Credit Facility. Considering our current liquidity position, short-term financial forecasts and ability to prepay the Revolving Credit Facility, if necessary, we expect to continue to be in compliance with our financial covenants at the end of our fiscal year ending June 30, 2019.
We have adopted a cash-based long-term incentive (“Cash LTI”) program for many of our employees as part of our employee compensation program. Cash LTI awards issued to employees under the Cash Long-Term Incentive Plan (“Cash LTI Plan”) generally vest in three or four equal installments. For additional details, refer to Note 9, “Equity and Long-term Incentive Compensation Plans,” to the condensed consolidated financial statements.
We have agreements with financial institutions to sell certain of our trade receivables and promissory notes from customers without recourse. In addition, we periodically sell certain letters of credit (“LCs”), without recourse, received from customers in payment for goods and services.
We maintain guarantee arrangements available through various financial institutions for up to $22.5 million, of which $18.2 million had been issued as of December 31, 2018, primarily to fund guarantees to customs authorities for VAT and other operating requirements of our subsidiaries in Europe and Asia. 
Working capital was $3.00 billion as of December 31, 2018, which is a decrease of $327.9 million compared to our working capital of $3.33 billion as of June 30, 2018. As of December 31, 2018, our principal sources of liquidity consisted of $2.69 billion of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities. Our liquidity may be affected by many factors, some of which are based on the normal ongoing operations of the business, spending for business acquisitions including the pending acquisition of Orbotech, and other factors such as uncertainty in the global and regional economies and the semiconductor equipment industries. Although cash requirements will fluctuate based on the timing and extent of these factors, we believe that cash generated from operations, together with the liquidity provided by existing cash and cash equivalents balances and our $1.00 billion Revolving Credit Facility, will be sufficient to satisfy our liquidity requirements associated with working capital needs, capital expenditures, cash dividends, stock repurchases and other contractual obligations, including repayment of outstanding debt, for at least the next 12 months.
