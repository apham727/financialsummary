To mitigate these risks, we utilize derivative financial instruments, such as foreign currency hedges.
As of December 31, 2017, we had an investment portfolio of fixed income securities of $1.68 billion.
These securities, as with all fixed income instruments, are subject to interest rate risk and will decline in value if market interest rates increase.
If market interest rates were to increase immediately and uniformly by 100 bps from levels as of December 31, 2017, the fair value of the portfolio would have declined by $20.2 million.
In November 2017, we entered into a Credit Agreement (the “Credit Agreement”) for a $750.0 million five-year unsecured revolving credit facility (the “Revolving Credit Facility”), which replaced our prior Credit Agreement.
Subject to the terms of the Credit Agreement, the Revolving Credit Facility may be increased in an amount up to $250.0 million in the aggregate.
As of December 31, 2017 after giving effect to the borrowings made on the closing date, we had outstanding $250.0 million aggregate principal amount of borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility.
We elected to pay interest on the borrowed amount under the Revolving Credit Facility at the London Interbank Offered Rate (“LIBOR”) plus a spread.
The spread ranges from 100 bps to 175 bps based on the adjusted credit rating.
We are also obligated to pay an annual commitment fee of 15 bps on the daily undrawn balance of the Revolving Credit Facility which is also subject to an adjustment in conjunction with our credit rating downgrades or upgrades.
As of December 31, 2017, if LIBOR-based interest rates increased by 100 bps, the change would increase our annual interest expense annually by approximately $2.4 million as it relates to our borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility.
Additionally, as of December 31, 2017, if our credit ratings were downgraded to be below investment grade, the maximum potential increase to our annual interest expense for the Revolving Credit Facility, using the highest range of the ranges discussed above, is estimated to be approximately $1.8 million.
As of December 31, 2017, we had net forward and option contracts to sell $70.4 million in foreign currency in order to hedge certain currency exposures (see Note 14, “Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities,” to the condensed consolidated financial statements for additional details).
A 10% adverse move in all currency exchange rates affecting the contracts would decrease the fair value of the contracts by $29.6 million.
However, if this occurred, the fair value of the underlying exposures hedged by the contracts would increase by a similar amount.
