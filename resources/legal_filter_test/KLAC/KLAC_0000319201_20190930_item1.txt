Basis of Presentation.
On July 15, 2019 we changed our corporate name from “KLA-Tencor Corporation” to “KLA Corporation”.
For purposes of this report, “KLA,” the “Company,” “we,” “our,” “us,” or similar references mean KLA Corporation, and its majority-owned subsidiaries unless the context requires otherwise.
The Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared by us pursuant to the rules and regulations of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”).
Certain information and footnote disclosures normally included in financial statements prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America have been condensed or omitted pursuant to such rules and regulations.
In the opinion of management, the unaudited interim financial statements reflect all adjustments (consisting only of normal, recurring adjustments) necessary for a fair statement of the financial position, results of operations, comprehensive income, stockholders’ equity and cash flows for the periods indicated.
The Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of KLA and its majority-owned subsidiaries.
All significant intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated.
The results of operations for the three months ended September 30, 2019 are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for any other interim period or for the full fiscal year ending June 30, 2020.
Certain reclassifications have been made to the prior year’s Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements to conform to the current year presentation.
The reclassifications did not have material effects on the prior year’s Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets, Statements of Operations, Comprehensive Income and Cash Flows.
Acquisition of Orbotech, Ltd. On February 20, 2019 (the “Closing Date” or “Acquisition Date”), we completed the acquisition of Orbotech, Ltd. (“Orbotech”) for total consideration of $3.26 billion.
The acquisition of Orbotech is referred to as the “Orbotech Acquisition”.
The Orbotech Acquisition was accounted for by applying the acquisition method of accounting for business combinations.
The unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements in this report include the financial results of Orbotech prospectively from the Acquisition Date.
For additional details, refer to Note 6 “Business Combinations” of the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements.
Management Estimates.
Actual results could differ from those estimates.
Prior periods were not retrospectively restated, and accordingly, the Consolidated Balance Sheet as of June 30, 2019, and the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations for the three months ended September 30, 2018 were prepared using accounting standards that were different than those in effect for the three months ended September 30, 2019.
We updated our accounting policies for Leases.
Under ASC 842, a contract is or contains a lease when we have the right to control the use of an identified asset for a period of time.
We determine if an arrangement is a lease at inception of the contract, which is the date on which the terms of the contract are agreed to, and the agreement creates enforceable rights and obligations.
On the commencement date leases are evaluated for classification and assets and liabilities are recognized based on the present value of lease payments over the lease term.
Variable lease payments, consisting primarily of reimbursement of costs incurred by lessors for common area maintenance, real estate taxes, and insurance are not included in the lease liability and are recognized as they are incurred.
As most of our leases do not provide an implicit rate, we use our incremental borrowing rate at lease commencement to measure ROU assets and lease liabilities.
The incremental borrowing rate used by us is based on baseline rates and adjusted by the credit spreads commensurate with our secured borrowing rate, over a similar term.
We used the incremental borrowing rate on June 30, 2019 for all leases that commenced on or prior to that date.
We have elected the practical expedient to account for the lease and non-lease components as a single lease component for the majority of our asset classes.
For leases with a term of one year or less, we have elected not to record the ROU asset or liability.
Recent Accounting Pronouncements.
Consistent with ASC 840, leases will be classified as either finance or operating, with classification affecting the pattern of expense recognition in the statements of operations.
In July 2018, the FASB issued an accounting standard update which amended ASC 842 and offered an additional (and optional) transition method by which entities could elect not to recast the comparative periods presented in financial statements in the period of adoption.
KLA adopted the new standard on July 1, 2019, the first day of fiscal 2020, using the optional adoption method whereby we did not adjust comparative period financial statements.
KLA elected certain practical expedients, which among other things, allowed us to carry forward prior conclusions about lease identification and classification.
The adoption of ASC 842 resulted in the balance sheet recognition of additional lease assets and lease liabilities of $110.7 million and $108.7 million, respectively, related primarily to facilities, vehicles and other equipment.
The adoption of ASC 842 did not have a material impact on beginning retained earnings, the Condensed Consolidated Statement of Operations, Cash Flows, or earnings per share.
Additionally, the adoption of ASC 842 did not have a material impact on the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for arrangements in which KLA is the lessor.
For additional information regarding KLA’s leases, see Note 9 “Leases” in the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements.
Under the update, credit losses for certain types of financial instruments will be estimated based on expected losses.
The update also modifies the impairment models for available-for-sale debt securities and for purchased financial assets with credit deterioration since their origination.
The update is effective for us beginning in the first quarter of our fiscal year ending June 30, 2021, with early adoption permitted starting in the first quarter of fiscal year ending June 30, 2020.
We are currently evaluating the impact of this accounting standard update on our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements.
This update eliminates the disclosure of the amount of and reasons for transfers between level 1 and level 2 of the fair value hierarchy, and the policy for timing of transfers between levels.
This standard update is effective for us beginning in the first quarter of our fiscal year ending June 30, 2021, and early adoption is permitted.
We are currently evaluating the impact of this accounting standard update on our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements.
In August 2018, the FASB issued an accounting standard update to amend the disclosure requirements related to defined benefit pension and other post-retirement plans.
Some of the changes include adding a disclosure requirement for significant gains and losses related to changes in the benefit obligation for the period and removing the amounts in accumulated other comprehensive income expected to be recognized as components of net periodic benefit cost over the next fiscal year.
This standard update is effective for us for the fiscal year ending June 30, 2021, and early adoption is permitted.
We are currently evaluating the impact of this accounting standard update on our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements.
In August 2018, the FASB issued an accounting standard update to align the requirements for capitalizing implementation costs incurred in a cloud computing arrangement that is a service contract with the requirements for capitalizing implementation costs incurred to develop or obtain internal-use software.
The guidance clarifies which costs should be capitalized including the cost to acquire the license and the related implementation costs.
This standard update is effective for us beginning in the first quarter of our fiscal year ending June 30, 2021, with an option to be adopted either prospectively or retrospectively.
We are currently evaluating the impact of this accounting standard update on our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements.
The following table represents the opening and closing balances of accounts receivables, contract assets and contract liabilities for the indicated periods.
Our payment terms and conditions vary by contract type, although terms generally include a requirement of payment of 70% to 90% of total contract consideration within 30 to 60 days of shipment, with the remainder payable within 30 days of acceptance.
The change in contract assets during the three months ended September 30, 2019 was mainly due to $27.6 million of revenue recognized for which the payment is subject to conditions other than passage of time, partially offset by $22.8 million of contract assets reclassified to net accounts receivable as our right to consideration for these contract assets became unconditional.
Contract assets are included in Other current assets on our Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet.
This was partially offset by the value of products and services billed to customers for which control of the products and service has not transferred to the customers.
Contract liabilities are included in current and non-current liabilities on our Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets.
As of September 30, 2019, we had $2.08 billion of remaining performance obligations, which represents our obligation to deliver products and services, and consists primarily of sales orders where written customer requests have been received.
We expect to recognize approximately 5% to 15% of these performance obligations as revenue beyond the next twelve months, subject to risk of delays, pushouts, and cancellation by the customer, usually with limited or no penalties.
Refer to Note 18 “Segment Reporting and Geographic Information” of the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for information related to revenue by geographic region as well as significant product and service offerings.
Our financial assets and liabilities are measured and recorded at fair value, except for our debt and certain equity investments in privately-held companies.
Equity investments without a readily available fair value are accounted for using the measurement alternative.
The measurement alternative is calculated as cost minus impairment, if any, plus or minus changes resulting from observable price changes.
Our non-financial assets, such as goodwill, intangible assets, and land, property and equipment, are assessed for impairment when an event or circumstance indicates that an other-than-temporary decline in value may have occurred.
Level 2 Valuations based on quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities, quoted prices in markets that are not active, or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities.
Level 3 Valuations based on inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the fair value of the assets or liabilities.
A financial instrument’s level within the fair value hierarchy is based on the lowest level of any input that is significant to the fair value measurement.
As of September 30, 2019, the types of instruments valued based on quoted market prices in active markets included money market funds, certain U.S. Treasury securities and U.S. Government agency securities.
The principal market in which we execute our foreign currency contracts is the institutional market in an over-the-counter environment with a relatively high level of price transparency.
Our foreign currency contracts’ valuation inputs are based on quoted prices and quoted pricing intervals from public data sources and do not involve management judgment.
These contracts are typically classified within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy.
The fair value of deferred payments and contingent consideration payable, the majority of which were recorded in connection with recent business combinations, were classified as Level 3 and estimated using significant inputs that were not observable in the market.
See Note 6 “Business Combinations” of the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.
There were no transfers between Level 1, Level 2 and Level 3 fair value measurements during the three months ended September 30, 2019.
See Note 8 “Debt” of the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for disclosure of the fair value of our Senior Notes.
For additional details, refer to Note 16, “Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities” of the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements.
The amounts reclassified out of accumulated OCI related to our defined benefit pension plans, which were recognized as a component of net periodic cost for the three months ended September 30, 2019 and 2018 were $0.2 million, respectively.
For additional details, refer to Note 12, “Employee Benefit Plans” of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2019.
Actual maturities may differ from contractual maturities because borrowers may have the right to call or prepay obligations with or without call or prepayment penalties.
Realized gains and losses on available-for-sale securities for the three months ended September 30, 2019 and 2018 were immaterial.
On August 22, 2019, we acquired the outstanding shares of a privately-held company, primarily to expand our products and services offerings, for a total purchase consideration of $93.9 million, including the fair value of the promise to pay an additional consideration up to $60.0 million contingent on the achievement of certain revenue milestones.
As of September 30, 2019, the estimated fair value of the additional consideration was $9.2 million, which was classified as a non-current liability on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets.
 We have included the financial results of the acquisition completed during the first quarter of the fiscal year 2020 in our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements from the date of acquisition.
These results were not material to our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements.
The purchase price allocation is preliminary and as additional information becomes available, we may further revise the preliminary purchase price allocation during the remainder of the measurement period, which will not exceed 12 months from the closing of the acquisition.
The $54.0 million of goodwill was assigned to the Wafer Inspection and Patterning reporting units.
None of the goodwill recognized is deductible for income tax purposes.
On February 20, 2019, we completed the acquisition of Orbotech for total purchase consideration of approximately $3.26 billion which was paid in part by cash of $1.90 billion, in part by KLA common stock with a fair value of $1.32 billion and the balance by the assumption of stock options and RSUs.
Orbotech is a global supplier of yield-enhancing and process-enabling solutions for the manufacture of electronics products.
KLA acquired Orbotech to extend and enhance its portfolio of products to address market opportunities in the printed circuit board, flat panel display, advanced packaging and semiconductor manufacturing areas.
Also refer to Note 10, “Equity, Long-Term Incentive Compensation Plans and Non-Controlling Interest” of the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information about assumed stock options and RSUs.
Primarily related to tax impact on the future amortization of intangible assets acquired and inventory fair value adjustments.
During the first quarter of the fiscal year ended June 30, 2020, we recorded measurement period adjustments to reflect facts and circumstances in existence as of the Acquisition Date.
KLA allocated the purchase price to tangible and identified intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on the preliminary estimates of their estimated fair values, which were determined using generally accepted valuation techniques based on estimates and assumptions made by management at the time of the Orbotech Acquisition and are subject to change during the measurement period which is not expected to exceed one year.
The primary tasks that are required to be completed include discovery and the remeasurement of unknown uncertain tax positions that existed at the Acquisition Date, adjustments to the deferred tax liabilities for unremitted earnings, validation of synergies expected to be derived from the acquisition of Orbotech, recoverability of certain acquired assets and reallocation of certain acquired intangible assets between jurisdictions based on the outcome of ongoing tax audits, including any related tax impacts.
Any adjustments to our preliminary purchase price allocation identified during the measurement period will be recognized in the period in which the adjustments are determined and recorded against goodwill.
The operating results of Orbotech have been included in our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for the three months ended September 30, 2019.
The goodwill was primarily attributable to the assembled workforce of Orbotech, planned growth in new markets and synergies expected to be achieved from the combined operations of KLA and Orbotech.
None of the goodwill is deductible for income tax purposes.
Goodwill arising from the Orbotech Acquisition has been allocated to the Specialty Semiconductor Process; and the PCB and Display reporting units during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2019.
For additional details, refer to Note 7 “Goodwill and Purchased Intangible Assets” of the Consolidated Financial Statements included in our Annual Report Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2019.
Existing technology was identified from the products of Orbotech and its fair value was determined using the Relief-from-Royalty Method under the income approach, which estimates the cost savings generated by a company related to the ownership of an asset for which it would otherwise have had to pay royalties or license fees on revenues earned through the use of the asset.
The discount rate used was determined at the time of measurement based on an analysis of the implied internal rate of return of the transaction, weighted average cost of capital and weighted average return on assets.
The economic useful life was determined based on the technology cycle related to each developed technology, as well as the cash flows over the forecast period.
Customer contracts and related relationships represent the fair value of the existing relationships with the Orbotech customers and its fair value was determined using the Multi-Period Excess Earning Method which involves isolating the net earnings attributable to the asset being measured based on present value of the incremental after-tax cash flows (excess earnings) attributable solely to the intangible asset over its remaining useful life.
The economic useful life was determined based on historical customer attrition rates.
Backlog primarily relates to the dollar value of purchase arrangements with customers, effective, as of a given point in time, that are based on mutually agreed terms which, in some cases, may still be subject to completion of written documentation and may be changed or canceled by the customer, often without penalty.
Orbotech’s backlog consists of these arrangements with assigned shipment dates expected, in most cases, within three to twelve months.
The economic useful life is based on the time to fulfill the outstanding order backlog obligation.
We believe the amounts of purchased intangible assets recorded above represent the fair values of and approximate the amounts a market participant would pay for, these intangible assets as of the Acquisition Date.
During the three months ended March 31, 2019 we acquired three privately-held companies primarily to expand our products and services offerings for an aggregate purchase price of $118.3 million, including a post-closing working capital adjustment, and the fair value of the promise to pay additional consideration of up to $13.0 million contingent on the achievement of certain milestones.
As of September 30, 2019, the estimated fair value of the additional consideration was $5.3 million, which was classified as a non-current liability on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets.
During the three months ended September 30, 2018 we acquired two privately-held companies for an aggregate purchase price of $15.4 million, including the fair value of the promise to pay total additional consideration of up to $6.0 million contingent on the achievement of certain milestones.
additional consideration was $1.7 million, which is classified as a non-current liability on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets.
None of these acquisitions were individually material to our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements.
The goodwill was primarily assigned to the Wafer Inspection and Patterning, and GSS reporting units, and mainly attributable to the assembled workforce, and planned growth in new markets.
The following unaudited pro forma financial information summarizes the combined results of operations for KLA, Orbotech, and the three acquisitions completed in the third quarter of fiscal 2019 as if the companies were combined as of the beginning of fiscal 2018.
The unaudited pro forma information includes adjustments to amortization and depreciation for intangible assets and property, plant and equipment acquired, adjustments to stock-based compensation expense, the purchase accounting effect on inventory acquired, the purchase accounting effect on deferred revenue, interest expense and amortization of debt issuance costs associated with the Senior Notes financing, and transaction costs.
We have not included pro forma results of operations for the acquisition of privately-held companies completed in the first quarter of fiscal 2019 or the first quarter of fiscal 2020 herein as they were not material to us on either an individual or in aggregate.
We included the results of operations of each acquisition in our Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations from the date of each acquisition.
Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the net tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired in the current and prior business combinations.
We have four reportable segments and six reporting units.
As of September 30, 2019, there have been no significant events or circumstances affecting the valuation of goodwill subsequent to the qualitative assessment performed in the third and fourth quarters of the fiscal year ended June 30, 2019.
For additional details, refer to Note 7 “Goodwill and Purchased Intangible Assets,” of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2019.
The next annual assessment of goodwill by reporting unit is scheduled to be performed in the third quarter of the fiscal year ending June 30, 2020.
Purchased intangible assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset or asset group may not be recoverable.
The change in the gross carrying amounts of intangible assets is due to acquisition of certain assets and liabilities of privately-held companies.
For additional details, refer to Note 6 “Business Combinations” of the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements.
As of September 30, 2019, future principal payments for our debt are $250.0 million for the remaining nine months in fiscal year 2020; $500.0 million in fiscal year 2022; and $2.70 billion after fiscal year 2023.
In March 2019 and November 2014, we issued $1.20 billion and $2.50 billion, respectively (each, a “2019 Senior Notes”, a “2014 Senior Notes”, and collectively the “Senior Notes”), aggregate principal amount of senior, unsecured long-term notes.
The indenture for the Senior Notes (the “Indenture”) includes covenants that limit our ability to grant liens on our facilities and enter into sale and leaseback transactions, subject to certain allowances under which certain sale and leaseback transactions are not restricted.
Based on the trading prices of the Senior Notes on the applicable dates, the fair value of the Senior Notes as of September 30, 2019 and June 30, 2019 was approximately $3.82 billion and $3.70 billion, respectively.
As of September 30, 2019, we were in compliance with all of our covenants under the Indenture associated with the Senior Notes.
In November 2017, we entered into a Credit Agreement (the “Credit Agreement”) providing for a $750.0 million five-year unsecured Revolving Credit Facility (the “Revolving Credit Facility”), which replaced our prior Credit Facility.
Subject to the terms of the Credit Agreement, the Revolving Credit Facility may be increased in an amount up to $250.0 million in the aggregate.
In November 2018, we entered into an Incremental Facility, Extension and Amendment Agreement (the “Amendment”), which amends the Credit Agreement to (a) extend the Maturity Date (the “Maturity Date”) from November 30, 2022 to November 30, 2023, (b) increase the total commitment by $250.0 million and (c) effect certain other amendments to the Credit Agreement as set forth in the Amendment.
We may borrow, repay and reborrow funds under the Revolving Credit Facility until the Maturity Date, at which time such Revolving Credit Facility will terminate, and all outstanding loans under such facility, together with all accrued and unpaid interest, must be repaid.
We may prepay outstanding borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility at any time without a prepayment penalty.
In addition, we are required to maintain the maximum leverage ratio as described in the Credit Agreement, on a quarterly basis of 3.00 to 1.00, covering the trailing four consecutive fiscal quarters for each fiscal quarter, which can be increased to 4.00 to 1.00 for a period of time in connection with a material acquisition or a series of material acquisitions.
As of September 30, 2019, our maximum allowed leverage ratio was 4.00 to 1.00 following the Orbotech Acquisition.
We were in compliance with all covenants under the Credit Agreement as of September 30, 2019 and had no outstanding borrowings under the unfunded Revolving Credit Facility.
We have operating leases for facilities, vehicles, and other equipment.
Our facility leases are primarily used for administrative functions, research and development, manufacturing, and storage and distribution.
Our finance leases are not material.
Our existing leases do not contain significant restrictive provisions or residual value guarantees; however, certain leases contain provisions for payment of maintenance, real estate taxes, or insurance costs by us.
Our leases have remaining lease terms ranging from less than one year to eleven years, including periods covered by options to extend the lease when it is reasonably certain that the option will be exercised.
Total lease expense for the three months ended September 30, 2019 was $8.7 million and included $0.2 million of costs related to short term leases which are not recorded on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets.
As of September 30, 2019, we did not have material leases that had not yet commenced.
As of September 30, 2019, we had 10.8 million shares available for issuance under our 2004 Equity Incentive Plan (the “2004 Plan”).
For details of the 2004 Plan refer to Note 9 “Equity, Long-Term Incentive Compensation Plans and Non-Controlling Interest,” of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2019.
As of September 30, 2019, there were 10,651 and 432,372 shares of our common stock underlying the outstanding Assumed Options and RSUs, respectively, under the Assumed Equity Plans.
The weighted-average remaining contractual terms, the aggregate intrinsic values, and the weighted average exercise price for the stock options outstanding under the Assumed Equity Plans as of September 30, 2019 were 4.75 years, $0.6 million, and $63.08 per share, respectively.
During the three months ended September 30, 2019, there were 3,907 Assumed Options exercised with a weighted-average exercise price of $29.26.
For details on the Assumed Equity Plans refer to Note 9 “Equity, Long-Term Incentive Compensation Plans and Non-Controlling Interest,” of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2019.
The fair value of stock-based awards is measured at the grant date and is recognized as an expense over the employee’s requisite service period.
For RSUs granted without “dividend equivalent” rights, fair value is calculated using the closing price of our common stock on the grant date, adjusted to exclude the present value of dividends which are not accrued on those RSUs.
The fair value for RSUs granted with “dividend equivalent” rights is determined using the closing price of our common stock on the grant date.
The fair value for purchase rights under our Employee Stock Purchase Plan is determined using a Black-Scholes model.
As of September 30, 2019, the unrecognized stock-based compensation expense balance related to RSUs was $206.2 million, excluding the impact of estimated forfeitures, and will be recognized over a weighted-average remaining contractual term and an estimated weighted-average amortization period of 1.8 years.
We have adopted a cash-based long-term incentive (“Cash LTI Plan”) program for many of our employees as part of our employee compensation program.
Executives and non-employee members of the Board of Directors are not participating in this program.
During the three months ended September 30, 2019 and 2018, we approved Cash LTI awards of $1.8 million and $2.8 million, respectively under our Cash LTI Plan.
During the three months ended September 30, 2019 and 2018, we recognized $16.6 million and $15.2 million, respectively, in compensation expense under the Cash LTI Plan.
For details, refer to Note 9 “Equity, Long-Term Incentive Compensation Plans and Non-Controlling Interest,” of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2019.
Our Employee Stock Purchase Plan (“ESPP”) provides that eligible employees may contribute up to 15% of their eligible earnings toward the semi-annual purchase of our common stock.
The ESPP is qualified under Section 423 of the Internal Revenue Code.
The employee’s purchase price is derived from a formula based on the closing price of the common stock on the first day of the offering period versus the closing price on the date of purchase (or, if not a trading day, on the immediately preceding trading day).
The offering period (or length of the look-back period) under the ESPP has a duration of six months, and the purchase price with respect to each offering period beginning on or after such date is, until otherwise amended, equal to 85% of the lesser of (i) the fair market value of our common stock at the commencement of the applicable six-month offering period or (ii) the fair market value of our common stock on the purchase date.
We estimate the fair value of purchase rights under the ESPP using a Black-Scholes model.
The provision allows for share replenishment equal to the lesser of 2.0 million shares or the number of shares which we estimate will be required to be issued under the ESPP during the forthcoming fiscal year.
As of September 30, 2019, a total of 2.6 million shares were reserved and available for issuance under the ESPP.
On August 1, 2019, our Board of Directors declared a regular quarterly cash dividend of $0.75 per share on the outstanding shares of our common stock, which was paid on September 3, 2019 to the stockholders of record as of the close of business on August 15, 2019.
These amounts will be paid upon vesting of the underlying RSUs.
We have consolidated the results of Orbotech LT Solar, LLC (“OLTS”) and Orbograph Ltd. (“Orbograph”), in which we own approximately 84% and 94% of the outstanding equity interest, respectively.
OLTS is engaged in the research, development and marketing of products for the deposition of thin film coating of various materials on crystalline silicon photovoltaic wafers for solar energy panels through plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition (“PECVD”).
Orbograph is engaged in the development and marketing of character recognition solutions to banks, financial and other payment processing institutions and healthcare providers.
Additionally, we have consolidated the results of PixCell, an Israeli company developing diagnostic equipment for point-of-care hematology applications of which we own approximately 52% of the outstanding equity interest and are entitled to appoint the majority of this company’s directors.
Our Board of Directors has authorized a program which permits us to repurchase shares of our common stock.
The intent of this program is to offset the dilution from our equity incentive plans, employee stock purchase plan, the issuance of shares in the Orbotech Acquisition, as well as to return excess cash to our stockholders.
Subject to market conditions, applicable legal requirements and other factors, the repurchases were made in the open market in compliance with applicable securities laws, including the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and the rules promulgated thereunder, such as Rule 10b-18 and Rule 10b5-1.
This stock repurchase program has no expiration date and may be suspended at any time.
On September 17, 2019, our Board of Directors authorized us to repurchase an additional $1.00 billion of our common stock.
As of September 30, 2019, an aggregate of approximately $1.63 billion was available for repurchase under our stock repurchase program.
As of September 30, 2019, we had repurchased 50 thousand shares for $8.0 million, for which repurchases had not settled prior to September 30, 2019.
The amount was recorded as a component of other current liabilities for the period presented.
Basic net income per share is calculated by dividing net income available to common stockholders by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during the period.
Diluted net income per share is calculated by using the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during the period, increased to include the number of additional shares of common stock that would have been outstanding if the shares of common stock underlying our outstanding dilutive restricted stock units had been issued.
We are also subject to examinations in other major foreign jurisdictions, including Singapore and Israel, for all years beginning from the calendar year ended December 31, 2012.
We are under audit in Germany related to Orbotech for the years ended December 31, 2013 to December 31, 2015.
It is possible that certain examinations may be concluded in the next twelve months.
The timing and resolution of income tax examinations is uncertain.
The amounts paid, if any, upon resolution of issues raised by the taxing authorities may differ materially from the amounts accrued for each year.
In May 2017, Orbotech received an assessment from the Israel Tax Authority (“ITA”) with respect to its fiscal years 2012 through 2014 (the “Assessment”, and the “Audit Period”, respectively), for an aggregate amount of tax, after offsetting all net operating losses (“NOLs”) available through the end of 2014, of approximately NIS 229.0 million (equivalent to approximately $66.0 million which includes related interest and linkage differentials to the Israeli consumer price index as of date of the issuance of the Tax Decrees, as defined below).
On August 31, 2018, Orbotech filed an objection in respect of the tax assessment (the “Objection”).
The ITA completed the second stage of the audit, in which the claims Orbotech raised in the Objection were examined by different personnel at the ITA.
In addition, the ITA examined additional items during this second stage of the audit.
As Orbotech and the ITA did not reach an agreement during the second stage, the ITA issued Tax Decrees to Orbotech on August 28, 2019 (“Tax Decrees”) for an aggregate amount of tax, after offsetting all NOLs available through the end of 2014, of approximately NIS 257 million (equivalent to approximately $74 million which includes related interest and linkage differentials to the Israeli consumer price index as of the date of the issuance of the Tax Decrees).
These Tax Decrees replaced the Assessment.
The ITA and Orbotech have agreed to extend the filing of the ITA's arguments in support of the Tax Decrees to February 28, 2020.
In connection with the above, there is an ongoing criminal investigation in Israel against Orbotech, certain of its employees and its tax consultant.
The letter further states that the District Attorney’s Office has not yet made a decision regarding submission of an indictment against Orbotech; and that if after studying the case, a decision is made to consider prosecuting Orbotech, Orbotech will receive an additional letter, and within 30 days, Orbotech may present its arguments to the District Attorney’s Office as to why it should not be indicted.
On October 27, 2019, we received a request for additional information from the District Attorney's Office.
We will continue to monitor the progress of the District Attorney’s Office investigation, however, we cannot anticipate when the review of the case will be completed and what will be the results thereof.
We intend to cooperate with the District Attorney’s Office to enable them to conclude their investigation.
We are named from time to time as a party to lawsuits and other types of legal proceedings and claims in the normal course of our business.
Actions filed against us include commercial, intellectual property, customer, and labor and employment related claims, including complaints of alleged wrongful termination and potential class action lawsuits regarding alleged violations of federal and state wage and hour and other laws.
Moreover, the results of legal proceedings are difficult to predict, and the costs incurred in litigation can be substantial, regardless of outcome.
We believe the amounts provided in our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements are adequate in light of the probable and estimated liabilities.
We have agreements (referred to as “factoring agreements”) with financial institutions to sell certain of our trade receivables and promissory notes from customers without recourse.
We do not believe we are at risk for any material losses as a result of these agreements.
In addition, we periodically sell certain letters of credit (“LCs”), without recourse, received from customers in payment for goods and services.
We maintain commitments to purchase inventory from our suppliers as well as goods, services, and other assets in the ordinary course of business.
Our liability under these purchase commitments is generally restricted to a forecasted time-horizon as mutually agreed upon between the parties.
This forecasted time-horizon can vary among different suppliers.
Our estimate of our significant purchase commitments for primarily material, services, supplies and asset purchases is approximately $643.5 million as of September 30, 2019, which are primarily due within the next 12 months.
Actual expenditures will vary based upon the volume of the transactions and length of contractual service provided.
In addition, the amounts paid under these arrangements may be less in the event that the arrangements are renegotiated or canceled.
Certain agreements provide for potential cancellation penalties.
As of September 30, 2019, we have committed $176.0 million for future payment obligations under our Cash LTI Plan.
The calculation of compensation expense related to the Cash LTI Plan includes estimated forfeiture rate assumptions.
Cash LTI awards issued to employees under the Cash LTI Plan vest in three or four equal installments, with one-third or one-fourth of the aggregate amount of the Cash LTI award vesting on each anniversary of the grant date over a three or four-year period.
Guarantees and Contingencies.
We maintain guarantee arrangements available through various financial institutions for up to $49.2 million, of which $43.0 million had been issued as of September 30, 2019, primarily to fund guarantees to customs authorities for value-added tax (“VAT”) and other operating requirements of our subsidiaries in Europe, Israel and Asia.
These obligations arise under the terms of our certificate of incorporation, our bylaws, applicable contracts, and Delaware and California law.
For example, we have paid or reimbursed legal expenses incurred in connection with the investigation of our historical stock option practices and the related litigation and government inquiries by several of our current and former directors, officers and employees.
Although the maximum potential amount of future payments we could be required to make under the indemnification obligations generally described in this paragraph is theoretically unlimited, we believe the fair value of this liability, to the extent estimable, is appropriately considered within the reserve we have established for currently pending legal proceedings.
In addition, we may in limited circumstances enter into agreements that contain customer-specific commitments on pricing, tool reliability, spare parts stocking levels, response time and other commitments.
Furthermore, we may give these customers limited audit or inspection rights to enable them to confirm that we are complying with these commitments.
If a customer elects to exercise its audit or inspection rights, we may be required to expend significant resources to support the audit or inspection, as well as to defend or settle any dispute with a customer that could potentially arise out of such audit or inspection.
To date, we have made no significant accruals in our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for this contingency.
While we have not in the past incurred significant expenses for resolving disputes regarding these types of commitments, we cannot make any assurance that it will not incur any such liabilities in the future.
It is not possible to predict the maximum potential amount of future payments under these or similar agreements due to the conditional nature of our obligations and the unique facts and circumstances involved in each particular agreement.
The authoritative guidance requires companies to recognize all derivative instruments and hedging activities, including foreign currency exchange contracts and interest rate lock agreements, (collectively “derivatives”) as either assets or liabilities at fair value on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets.
In accordance with the accounting guidance, we designate foreign currency exchange contracts and interest rate lock agreements as cash flow hedges of certain forecasted foreign currency denominated sales, purchase and spending transactions, and the benchmark interest rate of the corresponding debt financing, respectively.
As a result, we are exposed to risks relating to changes in foreign currency exchange rates.
We utilize foreign currency forward exchange contracts and option contracts to hedge against future movements in foreign exchange rates that affect certain existing and forecasted foreign currency denominated sales and purchase transactions, such as the Japanese yen, the euro, the pound sterling and the Israeli new shekel.
We routinely hedge our exposures to certain foreign currencies with various financial institutions in an effort to minimize the impact of certain currency exchange rate fluctuations.
These currency forward exchange contracts and options, designated as cash flow hedges, generally have maturities of less than 18 months.
If a financial counterparty to any of our hedging arrangements experiences financial difficulties or is otherwise unable to honor the terms of the foreign currency hedge, we may experience material losses.
The Rate Lock Agreements were terminated on the date of the pricing of the $1.25 billion of 4.650% Senior Notes due in 2024 and we recorded the fair value of $7.5 million as a gain within accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) (“OCI”) as of December 31, 2014.
We recognized $0.2 million for each of the three months ended September 30, 2019 and 2018, for the amortization of the gain recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), which amount reduced the interest expense.
For more details, refer to Note 16, “Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities” of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2019.
We recognized $0.3 million amortization of the loss recognized in accumulated OCI, which increased the interest expense for the three months ended September 30, 2019.
For derivatives that are designated and qualify as cash flow hedges, the effective portion of the gains or losses is reported in OCI and reclassified into earnings in the same period or periods during which the hedged transaction affects earnings.
For derivative contracts executed after adopting the new accounting guidance, the election to include time value for the assessment of effectiveness is made on all forward contracts designated as cash flow hedges.
The change in fair value of the derivative are recorded in OCI until the hedged item is recognized in earnings.
The assessment of effectiveness of options contracts designated as cash flow hedges continue to exclude time value after adopting the new accounting guidance.
Any difference between change in the fair value of the excluded components and the amounts recognized in earnings are recorded in OCI.
For derivatives that are not designated as cash flow hedges, gains and losses are recognized in other expense (income), net.
We use foreign currency forward contracts to hedge certain foreign currency denominated assets or liabilities.
The gains and losses on these derivative instruments are largely offset by the changes in the fair value of the assets or liabilities being hedged.
Our receivable balances from these parties were $1.8 million at September 30, 2019 and immaterial as of June 30, 2019.
Our payable balances from these parties were immaterial at September 30, 2019 and June 30, 2019.
Operating segments are defined as components of an enterprise about which separate financial information is evaluated regularly by the chief operating decision maker (“CODM”) in deciding how to allocate resources and in assessing performance.
This segment also engages in the development and marketing of character recognition solutions to banks, financial and other payment processing institutions and healthcare providers.
We engage in the research, development and marketing of products for the deposition of thin film coating of various materials on crystalline silicon photovoltaic wafers for solar energy panels.
The CODM assesses the performance of each operating segment and allocates resources to those segments based on total revenue and segment gross margin and does not evaluate the segments using discrete asset information.
Segment gross margin excludes corporate allocations and effects of foreign exchange rates, amortization of intangible assets, amortization of inventory fair value adjustments, and transaction costs associated with our acquisitions related to costs of revenues.
Acquisition-related charges primarily include amortization of intangible assets, amortization of inventory fair value adjustments, and other acquisition-related costs classified or presented as part of costs of revenues.
Our significant operations outside the United States include manufacturing facilities in China, Germany, Israel and Singapore and sales, marketing and service offices in Japan, the rest of the Asia Pacific region and Europe.
For geographical revenue reporting, revenues are attributed to the geographic location in which the customer is located.
Long-lived assets consist of land, property and equipment, net and are attributed to the geographic region in which they are located.
Wafer Inspection, and Patterning products are offered in Semiconductor Process Control segment.
Other includes primarily refurbished systems, remanufactured legacy systems, and enhancements and upgrades for previous-generation products which are part of Semiconductor Process Control segment.
In the three months ended September 30, 2019, two customers accounted for approximately 17% and 12% of total revenues.
In the three months ended September 30, 2018, two customers accounted for approximately 15% and 10% of total revenues.
One customer on an individual basis accounted for greater than 10% of net accounts receivables at September 30, 2019 and June 30, 2019.
In September 2019, management approved a plan to streamline our organization and business processes that included the reduction of workforce, which is expected to be completed in the second half of our fiscal year 2021, primarily in our PCB, Display and Component Inspection segment, and a potential disposition of our solar energy business in our Other segment.
Restructuring charges were immaterial for the three months ended September 30, 2019.
Proceeds from disposition of our solar energy business are not expected to be material.
We expect to incur additional restructuring charges, including additional severance costs and other related costs in future periods in connection with the completion of our workforce reduction.
The information set forth above under Note 14, “Litigation and Other Legal Matters,” to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 1 of Part 1 is incorporated herein by reference.
Ongoing changes in the technology industry, as well as the semiconductor industry in particular, could expose our business to significant risks.
The industries that we serve, including the semiconductor, flat panel display and printed circuit board industries, are constantly developing and changing over time.
•the entry by some semiconductor manufacturers into collaboration or sharing arrangements for capacity, cost or risk with other manufacturers, as well as increased outsourcing of their manufacturing activities, and greater focus only on specific markets or applications, whether in response to adverse market conditions or other market pressures.
We are exposed to risks associated with a highly concentrated customer base.
•As a result of this consolidation, the customers that survive the consolidation represent a greater portion of our sales and, consequently, have greater commercial negotiating leverage.
•Certain customers have undergone significant ownership changes, created alliances with other companies, experienced management changes or have outsourced manufacturing activities, any of which may result in additional complexities in managing customer relationships and transactions.
•The highly concentrated business environment also increases our exposure to risks related to the financial condition of each of our customers.
For example, as a result of the challenging economic environment during fiscal year 2009, we were (and in some cases continue to be) exposed to additional risks related to the continued financial viability of certain of our customers.
To the extent our customers experience liquidity issues in the future, we may be required to incur additional bad debt expense with respect to receivables owed to us by those customers.
•Semiconductor manufacturers generally must commit significant resources to qualify, install and integrate process control and yield management equipment into a semiconductor production line.
We believe that once a semiconductor manufacturer selects a particular supplier’s process control and yield management equipment, the manufacturer generally relies upon that equipment for that specific production line application for an extended period of time.
Accordingly, we expect it to be more difficult to sell our products to a given customer for that specific production line application and other similar production line applications if that customer initially selects a competitor’s equipment.
In addition, when products are initially introduced, they tend to have higher costs because of initial development costs and lower production volumes relative to the previous product generation, which can impact gross margin.
We operate in industries that have historically been cyclical, including the semiconductor industry.
If we fail to respond to industry cycles, our business could be seriously harmed.
The timing, length and severity of the up-and-down cycles in the industries in which we serve are difficult to predict.
During periods of declining revenues, we must be in a position to adjust our cost and expense structure to prevailing market conditions and to continue to motivate and retain our key employees.
Furthermore, any workforce reductions and cost reduction actions that we adopt in response to down cycles may result in additional restructuring charges, disruptions in our operations and loss of key personnel.
In addition, during periods of rapid growth, we must be able to increase manufacturing capacity and personnel to meet customer demand.
We can provide no assurance that these objectives can be met in a timely manner in response to industry cycles.
The primary driver of technology advancement in the semiconductor industry has been to shrink the lithography that prints the circuit design on semiconductor chips.
That driver appears to be slowing, which may cause semiconductor manufacturers to delay investments in equipment, investigate more complex device architectures, use new materials and develop innovative fabrication processes.
These and other evolving customer plans and needs require us to respond with continued development programs and cut back or discontinue older programs, which may no longer have industry-wide support.
Technical innovations are inherently complex and require long development cycles and appropriate staffing of highly qualified employees.
We must continue to make significant investments in research and development in order to enhance the performance, features and functionality of our products, to keep pace with competitive products and to satisfy customer demands.
Substantial research and development costs typically are incurred before we confirm the technical feasibility and commercial viability of a new product, and not all development activities result in commercially viable products.
There can be no assurance that revenues from future products or product enhancements will be sufficient to recover the development costs associated with such products or enhancements.
In addition, we cannot be sure that these products or enhancements will receive market acceptance or that we will be able to sell these products at prices that are favorable to us.
In addition, the complexity of our products exposes us to other risks.
However, our products are very technologically complex and rely on the interconnection of numerous subcomponents (all of which must perform to their respective specifications), so it is conceivable that a product for which we recognize revenue upon shipment may ultimately fail to meet the overall product’s required specifications.
We derive a substantial percentage of our revenues from sales of inspection products.
Our success is dependent in part on our technology and other proprietary rights.
Our success is dependent in part on our technology and other proprietary rights.
We own various United States and international patents and have additional pending patent applications relating to some of our products and technologies.
In addition, we at times engage in collaborative technology development efforts with our customers and suppliers, and these collaborations may constitute a key component of certain of our ongoing technology and product research and development projects.
We also maintain trademarks on certain of our products and services and claim copyright protection for certain proprietary software and documentation.
We attempt to protect our trade secrets and other proprietary information through confidentiality and other agreements with our customers, suppliers, employees and consultants and through other security measures.
However, these employees, consultants and third parties may breach these agreements, and we may not have adequate remedies for wrongdoing.
In any event, the extent to which we can protect our trade secrets through the use of confidentiality agreements is limited, and our success will depend to a significant extent on our ability to innovate ahead of our competitors.
Our industry includes large manufacturers with substantial resources to support customers worldwide.
Some of our competitors are diversified companies with greater financial resources and more extensive research, engineering, manufacturing, marketing, and customer service and support capabilities than we possess.
We face competition from companies whose strategy is to provide a broad array of products and services, some of which compete with the products and services that we offer.
In addition, we face competition from smaller emerging companies whose strategy is to provide a portion of the products and services that we offer, using innovative technology to sell products into specialized markets.
We attempt to operate our business in accordance with a business plan that is established annually, revised frequently (generally quarterly), and reviewed by management even more frequently (at least monthly).
In addition, our management is constantly striving to balance the requirements and demands of our customers with the availability of resources, the need to manage our operating model and other factors.
In furtherance of those efforts, we often must exercise discretion and judgment as to the timing and prioritization of manufacturing, deliveries, installations and payment scheduling.
We have a leveraged capital structure.
Borrowings under our Revolving Credit Facility bear interest at a floating rate, and an increase in interest rates would require us to pay additional interest on any borrowings, which may have an adverse effect on the value and liquidity of our debt and the market price of our common stock could decline.
The interest rate under our Revolving Credit Facility is also subject to an adjustment in conjunction with our credit rating downgrades or upgrades.
Additionally, under our Revolving Credit Facility, we are required to comply with affirmative and negative covenants, which include the maintenance of certain financial ratios, the details of which can be found in Note 8, “Debt,” to our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements.
If we fail to comply with these covenants, we will be in default and our borrowings will become immediately due and payable.
There can be no assurance that we will have sufficient financial resources or we will be able to arrange financing to repay our borrowings at such time.
In addition, certain of our domestic subsidiaries are required to guarantee our borrowings under our Revolving Credit Facility.
•obligations to comply with restrictive and financial covenants as noted in the above risk factor and Note 8, “Debt,” to our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements.
Furthermore, our future operations may not generate sufficient cash flows to enable us to meet our future expenses and service our new debt obligations, which may impact our ability to manage our capital structure to preserve and maintain our investment grade rating.
If our future operations do not generate sufficient cash flows, we may need to access the money available for borrowing under our Revolving Credit Facility or enter into new financing arrangements to obtain necessary funds.
If we determine it is necessary to seek additional funding for any reason, we may not be able to obtain such funding or, if funding is available, we may not be able to obtain it on acceptable terms.
Any borrowings under our Revolving Credit Facility will place further pressure on us to comply with the financial covenants.
If we fail to make a payment associated with our debt obligations, we could be in default on such debt, and such a default could cause us to be in default on our other obligations.
There can be no assurance that we will continue to declare cash dividends at all or in any particular amounts.
In situations where we engage in business with a third party without an explicit master agreement regarding the applicable terms and conditions, or where the commercial documentation applicable to the transaction is subject to varying interpretations, we may have disputes with those third parties regarding the applicable terms and conditions of our business relationship with them.
In addition, in our commercial agreements, from time to time in the normal course of business we indemnify third parties with whom we enter into contractual relationships, including customers, suppliers and lessors, with respect to certain matters.
We are also exposed to potential costs associated with unexpected product performance issues.
Our products and production processes are extremely complex and thus could contain unexpected product defects, especially when products are first introduced.
Furthermore, we occasionally enter into volume purchase agreements with our larger customers, and these agreements may provide for certain volume purchase incentives, such as credits toward future purchases.
We believe that these arrangements are beneficial to our long-term business, as they are designed to encourage our customers to purchase higher volumes of our products.
However, these arrangements could require us to recognize a reduced level of revenue for the products that are initially purchased, to account for the potential future credits or other volume purchase incentives.
Our volume purchase agreements require significant estimation for the amounts to be accrued depending upon the estimate of volume of future purchases.
As such, we are required to update our estimates of the accruals on a periodic basis.
In addition, we may in limited circumstances enter into agreements that contain customer-specific commitments on pricing, tool reliability, spare parts stocking levels, response time and other commitments.
Furthermore, we may give these customers limited audit or inspection rights to enable them to confirm that we are complying with these commitments.
If a customer elects to exercise its audit or inspection rights, we may be required to expend significant resources to support the audit or inspection, as well as to defend or settle any dispute with a customer that could potentially arise out of such audit or inspection.
To date, we have made no significant accruals in our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for this contingency.
While we have not in the past incurred significant expenses for resolving disputes regarding these types of commitments, we cannot make any assurance that we will not incur any such liabilities in the future.
There are risks associated with our receipt of government funding for research and development.
We are exposed to additional risks related to our receipt of external funding for certain strategic development programs from various governments and government agencies, both domestically and internationally.
Governments and government agencies typically have the right to terminate funding programs at any time in their sole discretion, or a project may be terminated by mutual agreement if the parties determine that the project’s goals or milestones are not being achieved, so there is no assurance that these sources of external funding will continue to be available to us in the future.
In addition, under the terms of these government grants, the applicable granting agency typically has the right to audit the costs that we incur, directly and indirectly, in connection with such programs.
Any such audit could result in modifications to, or even termination of, the applicable government funding program.
For example, if an audit were to identify any costs as being improperly allocated to the applicable program, those costs would not be reimbursed, and any such costs that had already been reimbursed would have to be refunded.
Historically, we have recorded material restructuring charges related to our prior global workforce reductions, large excess inventory write-offs, and material impairment charges related to our goodwill and purchased intangible assets.
Such additional write-offs could result in material charges.
In the past, we have recorded material charges related to the impairment of our goodwill and purchased intangible assets.
Goodwill is not amortized, but is instead tested for impairment at least annually in accordance with authoritative guidance for goodwill.
Purchased intangible assets with estimable useful lives are amortized over their respective estimated useful lives based on economic benefit if known or using the straight-line method, and are reviewed for impairment in accordance with authoritative guidance for long-lived assets.
The valuation of goodwill and intangible assets requires assumptions and estimates of many critical factors, including revenue and market growth, operating cash flows, market multiples, and discount rates.
A substantial decline in our stock price, or any other adverse change in market conditions, particularly if such change has the effect of changing one of the critical assumptions or estimates we previously used to calculate the value of our goodwill or intangible assets (and, as applicable, the amount of any previous impairment charge), could result in a change to the estimation of fair value that could result in an additional impairment charge.
We are exposed to risks related to our financial arrangements with respect to receivables factoring and banking arrangements.
We enter into factoring arrangements with financial institutions to sell certain of our trade receivables and promissory notes from customers without recourse.
In addition, we maintain bank accounts with several domestic and foreign financial institutions, any of which may prove not to be financially viable.
However, by entering into these arrangements, and by engaging these financial institutions for banking services, we are exposed to additional risks.
We are subject to the risks of additional government actions in the event we were to breach the terms of any settlement arrangement into which we have entered.
In connection with the settlement of certain government actions and other legal proceedings related to our historical stock option practices, we have explicitly agreed as a condition to such settlements that we will comply with certain laws, such as the books and records provisions of the federal securities laws.
•receiving prepayments for certain of our products and services sold in certain jurisdictions.
These prepayments increase our cash flows for the quarter in which they are received.
If our practice of requiring prepayments in those jurisdictions changes or deteriorates, our cash flows would be harmed.
•inadequate protection or enforcement of our intellectual property and other legal rights in foreign jurisdictions.
In addition, government controls, either by the United States or other countries, that restrict our business overseas or the import or export of our products or increase the cost of our operations through the imposition of tariffs or otherwise, could harm our business.
For example, effective on October 30, 2018, the United States Department of Commerce added Fujian Jinhua Integrated Circuit Company, Ltd. (“JHICC”) to its entity list, restricting exports of technology to JHICC without a license.
Demand for our products is ultimately driven by the global demand for electronic devices by consumers and businesses.
In addition, the tightening of credit markets and concerns regarding the availability of credit that accompanied that slowdown made it more difficult for our customers to raise capital, whether debt or equity, to finance their purchases of capital equipment, including the products we sell.
Our investment portfolio includes corporate and government securities, money market funds and other types of debt and equity investments.
We are exposed to various risks related to the legal, regulatory and tax environments in which we perform our operations and conduct our business.
Our employees are vital to our success, and our key management, engineering and other employees are difficult to replace.
Further, we do not maintain key person life insurance on any of our employees.
The expansion of high technology companies worldwide has increased demand and competition for qualified personnel.
We outsource a number of services to third-party service providers, which decreases our control over the performance of these functions.
We outsource a number of services, including our transportation, information systems management and logistics management of spare parts and certain accounting and procurement functions, to domestic and overseas third-party service providers.
While outsourcing arrangements may lower our cost of operations, they also reduce our direct control over the services rendered.
In addition, many of these outsourced service providers, including certain hosted software applications that we use for confidential data storage, employ cloud computing technology for such storage.
These providers’ cloud computing systems may be susceptible to “cyber incidents,” such as intentional cyber attacks aimed at theft of sensitive data or inadvertent cyber-security compromises, which are outside of our control.
We are exposed to risks related to cybersecurity threats and cyber incidents.
In the conduct of our business, we collect, use, transmit and store data on information systems.
This data includes confidential information, transactional information and intellectual property belonging to us, our customers and our business partners, as well as personally-identifiable information of individuals.
We allocate significant resources to network security, data encryption and other measures to protect our information systems and data from unauthorized access or misuse.
Despite our ongoing efforts to enhance our network security measures, our information systems are susceptible to computer viruses, cyber-related security breaches and similar disruptions from unauthorized intrusions, tampering, misuse, criminal acts, including phishing, or other events or developments that we may be unable to anticipate or fail to mitigate and are subject to the inherent vulnerabilities of network security measures.
We have experienced cyber-related attacks in the past, and may experience cyber-related attacks in the future.
Our security measures may also be breached due to employee errors, malfeasance, or otherwise.
Third parties may also attempt to influence employees, users, suppliers or customers to disclose sensitive information in order to gain access to our, our customers’ or business partners’ data.
Because the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access to the information systems change frequently, and may not be recognized until launched against a target, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventative measures.
We carry insurance that provides some protection against the potential losses arising from a cybersecurity incident but it will not likely cover all such losses, and the losses that it does not cover may be significant.
We rely upon certain critical information systems for our daily business operations.
Our global operations are dependent upon certain information systems, including telecommunications, the internet, our corporate intranet, network communications, email and various computer hardware and software applications.
Our enterprise resource planning (“ERP”) system is integral to our ability to accurately and efficiently maintain our books and records, record transactions, provide critical information to our management, and prepare our financial statements.
Any disruptions or difficulties that may occur in connection with our ERP system or other systems (whether in connection with the regular operation, periodic enhancements, modifications or upgrades of such systems or the integration of our acquired businesses into such systems) could adversely affect our ability to complete important business processes, such as the evaluation of our internal control over financial reporting pursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002.
We are also exposed to risks in connection with strategic alliances into which we may enter.
At times, we may also enter into strategic alliances with customers, suppliers or other business partners with respect to development of technology and intellectual property.
These alliances typically require significant investments of capital and exchange of proprietary, highly sensitive information.
The success of these alliances depends on various factors over which we may have limited or no control and requires ongoing and effective cooperation with our strategic partners.
We have significant manufacturing operations in the United States, Singapore, Israel, Germany, United Kingdom, Italy and China.
In addition, our business is international in nature, with our sales, service and administrative personnel and our customers located in numerous countries throughout the world.
Operations at our manufacturing facilities and our assembly subcontractors, as well as our other operations and those of our customers, are subject to disruption for a variety of reasons, including work stoppages, acts of war, terrorism, health epidemics, fire, earthquake, volcanic eruptions, energy shortages, flooding or other natural disasters.
We cannot provide any assurance that alternate means of conducting our operations (whether through alternate production capacity or service providers or otherwise) would be available if a major disruption were to occur or that, if such alternate means were available, they could be obtained on favorable terms.
In addition, as part of our cost-cutting actions, we have consolidated several operating facilities.
Our California operations are now primarily centralized in our Milpitas facility.
The consolidation of our California operations into a single campus could further concentrate the risks related to any of the disruptive events described above, such as acts of war or terrorism, earthquakes, fires or other natural disasters, if any such event were to impact our Milpitas facility.
We are predominantly uninsured for losses and interruptions caused by terrorist acts and acts of war.
The threat of terrorism targeted at, or acts of war in, the regions of the world in which we do business increases the uncertainty in our markets.
Any act of terrorism or war that affects the economy or the industries we serve could adversely affect our business.
Increased international political instability in various parts of the world, disruption in air transportation and further enhanced security measures as a result of terrorist attacks may hinder our ability to do business and may increase our costs of operations.
We maintain significant operations in Israel.
In addition, some our employees in Israel are obligated to perform annual reserve duty in the Israel Defense Forces, and may be called to active military duty in emergency circumstances.
Instability in any region could directly impact our ability to operate our business (or our customers’ ability to operate their businesses), cause us to incur increased costs in transportation, make such transportation unreliable, increase our insurance costs, and cause international currency markets to fluctuate.
Instability in the region could also have the same effects on our suppliers and their ability to timely deliver their products.
We are predominantly uninsured for losses and interruptions caused by terrorist acts and acts of war.
We self-insure certain risks including earthquake risk.
If one or more of the uninsured events occurs, we could suffer major financial loss.
We purchase insurance to help mitigate the economic impact of certain insurable risks; however, certain risks are uninsurable, are insurable only at significant cost or cannot be mitigated with insurance.
Accordingly, we may experience a loss that is not covered by insurance, either because we do not carry applicable insurance or because the loss exceeds the applicable policy amount or is less than the deductible amount of the applicable policy.
For example, we do not currently hold earthquake insurance.
An earthquake could significantly disrupt our manufacturing operations, a significant portion of which are conducted in California, an area highly susceptible to earthquakes.
It could also significantly delay our research and engineering efforts on new products, much of which is also conducted in California.
We take steps to minimize the damage that would be caused by an earthquake, but there is no certainty that our efforts will prove successful in the event of an earthquake.
We self-insure earthquake risks because we believe this is a prudent financial decision based on our cash reserves and the high cost and limited coverage available in the earthquake insurance market.
Certain other risks are also self-insured either based on a similar cost-benefit analysis, or based on the unavailability of insurance.
If one or more of the uninsured events occurs, we could suffer major financial loss.
We are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations.
Although we hedge certain currency risks, we may still be adversely affected by changes in foreign currency exchange rates or declining economic conditions in these countries.
We have some exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, primarily the Japanese Yen, the euro, the pound sterling and the Israeli new shekel.
In addition, an increasing proportion of our manufacturing activities are conducted outside of the United States, and many of the costs associated with such activities are denominated in foreign currencies.
We routinely hedge our exposures to certain foreign currencies with certain financial institutions in an effort to minimize the impact of certain currency exchange rate fluctuations, but these hedges may be inadequate to protect us from currency exchange rate fluctuations.
Furthermore, if a financial counterparty to our hedges experiences financial difficulties or is otherwise unable to honor the terms of the foreign currency hedge, we may experience material financial losses.
Our investment portfolio primarily consists of both corporate and government debt securities that are susceptible to changes in market interest rates and bond yields.
As market interest rates and bond yields increase, those securities with a lower yield-at-cost show a mark-to-market unrealized loss.
We believe we have the ability to realize the full value of all these investments upon maturity.
We can make no assurances that an indictment will not result from the criminal investigation.
Compliance with federal securities laws, rules and regulations, as well as NASDAQ requirements, has become increasingly complex, and the significant attention and expense we must devote to those areas may have an adverse impact on our business.
Federal securities laws, rules and regulations, as well as NASDAQ rules and regulations, require companies to maintain extensive corporate governance measures, impose comprehensive reporting and disclosure requirements, set strict independence and financial expertise standards for audit and other committee members and impose civil and criminal penalties for companies and their chief executive officers, chief financial officers and directors for securities law violations.
These laws, rules and regulations have increased, and in the future are expected to continue to increase, the scope, complexity and cost of our corporate governance, reporting and disclosure practices, which could harm our results of operations and divert management’s attention from business operations.
Changes to (or revised interpretations or applications of) existing accounting standards or tax rules or the questioning of current or past practices may adversely affect our reported financial results or the way we conduct our business.
For example, in the quarter ended September 30, 2019, we adopted the FASB accounting standard update and amended our accounting for leases.
Adoption of new standards may require changes to our processes, accounting systems, and internal controls.
Difficulties encountered during adoption could result in internal control deficiencies or delay the reporting of our financial results.
