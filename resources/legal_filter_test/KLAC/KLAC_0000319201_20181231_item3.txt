As of December 31, 2018, we had an investment portfolio of fixed income securities of $1.57 billion.
These securities, as with all fixed income instruments, are subject to interest rate risk and will decline in value if market interest rates increase.
If market interest rates were to increase immediately and uniformly by 100 bps from levels as of December 31, 2018, the fair value of the portfolio would have declined by $7.3 million.
In November 2017, we entered into a Credit Agreement (the “Credit Agreement”) for a $750.0 million five-year unsecured Revolving Credit Facility (the “Revolving Credit Facility”), which replaced our prior Credit Agreement.
Subject to the terms of the Credit Agreement, the Revolving Credit Facility may be increased in an amount up to $250.0 million in the aggregate.
In November 2018, we entered into an Incremental Facility, Extension and Amendment Agreement (the “Amendment”), which amends the Credit Agreement to (a) extend the Maturity Date (the “Maturity Date”) from November 30, 2022 to November 30, 2023, (b) increase the total commitment by $250.0 million and (c) effect certain other amendments to the Credit Agreement as set forth in the Amendment.
After giving effect to the Amendment, the total commitments under the Credit Agreement are $1.00 billion.
As of December 31, 2018, we do not have any outstanding floating rate debts that are subject to an increase in interest rates.
We are obligated to pay an annual commitment fee of 12.5 bps on the daily undrawn balance of the Revolving Credit Facility which is subject to an adjustment in conjunction with our credit rating downgrades or upgrades.
As of December 31, 2018, if our credit ratings were downgraded to be below investment grade, the maximum potential increase to our annual commitment fee for the Revolving Credit Facility, using the highest range of the ranges discussed above, is estimated to be approximately $0.6 million.
As of December 31, 2018, we had net forward and option contracts to sell $93.6 million in foreign currency in order to hedge certain currency exposures (see Note 15, “Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities,” to the condensed consolidated financial statements for additional details).
If we had entered into these contracts on December 31, 2018, the U.S. dollar equivalent would have been $106.1 million.
A 10% adverse move in all currency exchange rates affecting the contracts would decrease the fair value of the contracts by $28.2 million.
However, if this occurred, the fair value of the underlying exposures hedged by the contracts would increase by a similar amount.
As of December 31, 2018, we had forward contracts to sell $500.0 million in treasury securities in order to hedge certain interest rate exposures (see Note 15, “Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities,” to the condensed consolidated financial statements for additional details).
However, if this occurred, the fair value of the underlying exposures hedged by the contracts would increase by a similar amount.
