Sales taking into account these adjustments are referred to as “organic sales.”
 Management believes that providing this additional information is useful to readers to better assess and understand operating performance, especially when comparing results with prior periods or forecasting performance for future periods, primarily because management typically monitors the business both including and excluding these adjustments to GAAP results.
Management also uses these non-GAAP measures to establish operational goals and, in many cases, for measuring performance for compensation purposes.
However, any analysis of results on a non-GAAP basis should be used as a complement to, and in conjunction with, results presented in accordance with GAAP.

 Loss from discontinued operations was $10.1 million and $9.9 million in the second quarter and the first six months of fiscal 2018, respectively, primarily as a result of settlement losses associated with the Company’s pension plan due to former TS business employees requesting and receiving distributions from the Company’s pension plan during fiscal 2018.
Refer to Note 9, “Pension Plan,” for further information on the pension settlement losses.
 Income from discontinued operations was $70.8 million and $71.9 million in the second quarter and the first six months of fiscal 2017, respectively due to the operating results of the TS business, which was sold in the third quarter of fiscal 2017.
 Cash used for operating activities of discontinued operations was $63.1 million in the first six months of fiscal 2017 as the sale of the TS business was completed in the third quarter of fiscal 2017.
During the first six months of fiscal 2018, the Company repaid $27.4 million from borrowings of various bank credit facilities and $100.0 million under the Company’s Credit Facility.

 During the first six months of fiscal 2018, the Company generated $112.7 million of cash from investing activities – discontinued operations, substantially all driven by the sale of marketable securities obtained through the sale of the TS business.
With the exception of the Company’s debt transactions discussed herein, there are no material changes to this information outside of normal borrowings and repayments of long-term debt and operating lease payments.
The Company was in compliance with all covenants under the Credit Facility and the Program as of December 30, 2017.
Outstanding borrowings under such forms of debt at the end of second quarter of fiscal 2018 was $0.9 million.
 The Company held cash and cash equivalents of $589.5 million as of December 30, 2017, of which $568.7 million was held outside the United States.
As of July 1, 2017, the Company held cash and cash equivalents of $836.4 million, of which $619.5 million was held outside of the United States.
 As of the end of the second quarter of fiscal 2018, the Company had a combined total borrowing capacity of $1.65 billion under the Credit Facility and the Program.
There were no borrowings outstanding and $2.0 million in letters of credit issued under the Credit Facility and $220.0 million in borrowings outstanding under the Program, resulting in approximately $1.37 billion of total availability as of December 30, 2017.
The Company currently expects to utilize availability under credit facilities to support working capital and other general corporate purposes to the extent such incremental borrowings do not impact the Company’s investment grade credit rating.
 During periods of weakening demand in the electronic components industry, the Company typically generates cash from operating activities.
Conversely, the Company is more likely to use operating cash flows for working capital requirements during periods of higher growth.
The Company used $141.4 million in cash flows from operating activities over the trailing four fiscal quarters ended December 30, 2017 for continuing operations.
To the extent the cash balances held in foreign locations cannot be remitted back to the U.S. in a tax efficient manner, those cash balances are generally used for ongoing working capital, capital expenditure needs and to support acquisitions, and are currently expected to be permanently reinvested outside the United States.
In addition, local government regulations may restrict the Company’s ability to move funds among various locations under certain circumstances.
Management does not believe such restrictions would limit the Company’s ability to pursue its intended business strategy.
Management believes that Avnet’s available borrowing capacity, its current cash on hand including the remaining proceeds and marketable securities from the sale of the TS business and the Company’s expected ability to generate operating cash flows in the future will be sufficient to meet its future liquidity needs.
 The Company expects to make material income tax payments on its unremitted foreign earnings as a result of the impact of the Act.
The Act requires the Company to pay a one-time transition tax on unremitted foreign earnings (the “transition tax”), which the Company expects to make a policy decision to pay over an eight year period.
The Company is still gathering the necessary information to make reasonable estimates for the amount of the transition tax, but the Company expects the transition tax owed will be material due to the Company’s approximately $3.3 billion of unremitted foreign earnings as of July 1, 2017.
Additionally, as the Company integrates PF and restructures to transform Avnet into an electronic components focused business, the Company expects to use cash for restructuring, integration and other expenses.
 In addition to continuing to make investments in acquisitions, as of December 30, 2017, the Company may repurchase up to an aggregate of $459.6 million of shares of the Company’s common stock through a $1.95 billion share repurchase program approved by the Board of Directors.
The Company may terminate or limit the share repurchase program at any time without prior notice.
Additionally, the Company currently expects to pay quarterly cash dividends on shares of its common stock, subject to approval of the Board of Directors.
