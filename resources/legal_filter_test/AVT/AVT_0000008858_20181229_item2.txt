Sales taking into account these adjustments are referred to as “organic sales.”
 Management believes that providing this additional information is useful to readers to better assess and understand operating performance, especially when comparing results with prior periods or forecasting performance for future periods, primarily because management typically monitors the business both including and excluding these adjustments to GAAP results.
Management also uses these non-GAAP measures to establish operational goals and, in many cases, for measuring performance for compensation purposes.
However, any analysis of results on a non-GAAP basis should be used as a complement to, and in conjunction with, results presented in accordance with GAAP.

 For a detailed description of the Company’s long-term debt and lease commitments for the next five years and thereafter, see Long-Term Contractual Obligations appearing in Item 7 of the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2018.
With the exception of the Company’s debt transactions discussed herein, there are no material changes to this information outside of normal borrowings and repayments of long-term debt and operating lease payments.
The Company was in compliance with all covenants under the Credit Facility and the Securitization Program as of December 29, 2018 and June 30, 2018.
 The Company has various lines of credit, financing arrangements and other forms of bank debt in the U.S. and various foreign locations to fund the short-term working capital, foreign exchange, overdraft and letter of credit needs of its wholly owned subsidiaries.
Outstanding borrowings under such forms of debt at the end of second quarter of fiscal 2019 was $0.9 million.
 As an alternative form of financing outside of the United States, the Company sells certain of its trade accounts receivable on a non-recourse basis to third-party financial institutions pursuant to factoring agreements.
The Company accounts for these transactions as sales of receivables and presents cash proceeds as cash provided by operating activities in the consolidated statements of cash flows.
As of June 30, 2018, the Company held cash and cash equivalents of $621.1 million, of which $545.3 million was held outside of the United States.
 As of the end of the second quarter of fiscal 2019, the Company had a combined total borrowing capacity of $1.75 billion under the Credit Facility and the Securitization Program.
There were no borrowings outstanding and $3.0 million in letters of credit issued under the Credit Facility and $471.0 million in borrowings outstanding under the Securitization Program, resulting in approximately $1.28 billion of total availability as of December 29, 2018.
The Company currently expects to utilize availability under credit facilities to support working capital and other general corporate purposes to the extent such incremental borrowings do not impact the Company’s investment grade credit rating.
 During periods of weakening demand in the electronic components industry, the Company typically generates cash from operating activities.
Conversely, the Company is more likely to use operating cash flows for working capital requirements during periods of higher growth.
The Company generated $299.9 million in cash flows from operating activities over the trailing four fiscal quarters ended December 29, 2018 from continuing operations.
To the extent the cash balances held in foreign locations cannot be remitted back to the U.S. in a tax efficient manner, those cash balances are generally used for ongoing working capital, capital expenditure needs and to support acquisitions, and are currently expected to be permanently reinvested outside the U.S.
The Company is still evaluating the impact of repatriating any additional foreign cash as a result of the Act.
In addition, local government regulations may restrict the Company’s ability to move funds among various locations under certain circumstances.
Management does not believe such restrictions would limit the Company’s ability to pursue its intended business strategy.
Management believes that Avnet’s available borrowing capacity including capacity for the non-recourse sale of accounts receivable and the Company’s expected ability to generate operating cash flows in the future will be sufficient to meet its future liquidity needs.
Additionally, as the Company integrates PF, the Company expects to use cash for restructuring, integration and other expenses.
 In addition to continuing to make investments in acquisitions, as of December 29, 2018, the Company may repurchase up to an aggregate of $440.1 million of shares of the Company’s common stock through a $2.45 billion share repurchase program approved by the Board of Directors.
The Company may terminate or limit the share repurchase program at any time without prior notice.
Additionally, the Company currently expects to pay quarterly cash dividends on shares of its common stock, subject to approval of the Board of Directors.
