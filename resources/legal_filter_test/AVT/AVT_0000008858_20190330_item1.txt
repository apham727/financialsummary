 In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (the “FASB”) issued Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) No.
2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606) (“ASU 2014-09”, and collectively with its related subsequent amendments, “Topic 606”).
Topic 606 supersedes previous revenue recognition guidance and requires the Company to recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the Company expects to be entitled in exchange for such goods or services.
The Company adopted Topic 606 on July 1, 2018 using the modified retrospective transition method applied to those contracts which were not completed as of July 1, 2018.
Under this transition method, the Company’s results in the consolidated statements of operations for the third quarter and nine months ended March 30, 2019 are presented under Topic 606, while the comparative results for the third quarter and nine months ended March 31, 2018 were not retrospectively adjusted, as such results were recognized in accordance with the revenue recognition policy discussed under Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in Note 1 of the Company’s Fiscal 2018 Annual Report on Form 10-K.
 The adoption of Topic 606 did not have a material impact on the Company’s consolidated financial statements as of the adoption date and as of and for the nine months ended March 30, 2019.
For a nominal portion of the Company’s contracts where the accounting did change, the adoption of Topic 606 resulted in an increase to the opening balance of retained earnings of $2.0 million as of July 1, 2018.
For these contracts, the Company recognizes revenue over time as control of the goods transfers through the manufacturing process, rather than when the goods are delivered, title has transferred, and the risks and rewards of ownership are passed to the customer, as under previous revenue recognition guidance.
 Refer to Note 2 herein for further discussion regarding revenue recognition and related accounting policies.
 In March 2017, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No.

 In August 2017, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update 2017-12, Derivatives and Hedging (Topic 815) - Targeted Improvements to Accounting for Hedging Activities (“ASU 2017-12”), which improves the financial reporting of hedging relationships to better portray the economic results of an entity’s risk management activities in its financial statements and makes certain targeted improvements to simplify the qualification and application of hedge accounting compared to current GAAP.
The Company is currently evaluating the impact of the adoption of ASU 2017-12 on its consolidated financial statements.
 Prior to the adoption of Topic 606, the Company’s revenue recognition policy was in accordance with ASC Topic 605, Revenue Recognition.
Effective July 1, 2018, the Company adopted Topic 606 using the modified retrospective transition method, resulting in accounting policy changes surrounding revenue recognition which replace revenue recognition policies discussed in the Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in Note 1 of the Company’s Fiscal 2018 Annual Report on Form 10-K.
The adoption of Topic 606 did not have a material impact on the Company’s consolidated financial statements.
 Revenue is recognized at the point at which control of the underlying products are transferred to the customer, which includes determining whether products are distinct and separate performance obligations.
The Company does not have material product warranty obligations as the assurance type product warranties provided by the component manufacturers are passed through to the Company’s customers.
 For contracts related to the specialized manufacture of products for customers with no alternative use and for which the Company has an enforceable right to payment, including a reasonable profit margin, the Company recognizes revenue over time as control of the products transfer through the manufacturing process.
The contract assets associated with such specialized manufacturing products are not material as these contracts represent less than 2% of the Company’s total sales.
 Revenue is measured as the amount of consideration the Company expects to receive in exchange for transferring products.
Revenue is recorded net of customer discounts and rebates.
When the Company offers the right or has a history of accepting returns of product, historical experience is utilized to establish a liability for the estimate of expected returns and an asset for the right to recover the product expected to be returned.
These adjustments are made in the same period as the underlying sales transactions.
The Company has elected to treat shipping and handling of product as a fulfillment activity.
The practical expedient not to disclose information about remaining performance obligations has also been elected as these contracts have an original duration of one year or less.
The Company does not have any payment terms that exceed one year from the point it has satisfied the related performance obligations.

This incremental consideration received from the sale of the TS business as well as cash settlements from the resolution of indemnification claims and other cash reimbursements have been classified as cash flow from discontinued operations investing activities.
Income tax payments related to the gain on sale of the TS business have been classified as cash flow from discontinued operations operating activities.
 The following table presents the change in goodwill by reportable segment for the nine months ended March 30, 2019.
 The Company evaluates each quarter if facts and circumstances indicate that it is more likely than not that the fair value of its reporting units is less than their carrying value, which would require the Company to perform an interim goodwill impairment test.
During the third quarter of fiscal 2019, the Company concluded that an interim goodwill impairment test was not required.
 During the third quarter of fiscal 2018, the Company impaired all of the goodwill in the Americas reporting unit and recorded $181.4 million of goodwill impairment expense, which is classified within goodwill impairment expense in the Consolidated Statements of Operations.

 Many of the Company’s subsidiaries purchase and sell products in currencies other than their functional currencies.
This subjects the Company to the risks associated with fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates.
The Company reduces this risk by utilizing natural hedging (e.g., offsetting receivables and payables in the same foreign currency) as well as by creating offsetting positions through the use of derivative financial instruments, primarily forward foreign exchange contracts typically with maturities of less than 60 days (“economic hedges”), but no longer than one year.
The Company continues to have exposure to foreign currency risks to the extent they are not economically hedged.
The Company’s policy is to present derivative financial instruments with the same counterparty as either a net asset or liability when the right of offset exists.

 In connection with the sale of the TS business, a significant number of former employees became terminated vested employees under the Plan.
