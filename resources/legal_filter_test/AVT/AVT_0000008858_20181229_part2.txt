 As a result primarily of certain former manufacturing operations, the Company has incurred and may have future liability under various federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations, including those governing pollution and exposure to, and the handling, storage and disposal of, hazardous substances. For example, under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act of 1980, as amended, and similar state laws, the Company is and may be liable for the costs of cleaning up environmental contamination on or from certain of its current or former properties, and at off-site locations where the Company disposed of wastes in the past. Such laws may impose joint and several liability. Typically, however, the costs for clean up at such sites are allocated among potentially responsible parties based upon each party’s relative contribution to the contamination, and other factors.  
 Pursuant to SEC regulations, including but not limited to Item 103 of Regulation S-K, the Company regularly assesses the status of and developments in pending environmental and other compliance related legal proceedings to determine whether any such proceedings should be identified specifically in this discussion of legal proceedings, and has concluded that no particular pending legal proceeding requires public disclosure. Based on the information known to date, management believes that the Company has appropriately accrued in its consolidated financial statements for its share of the estimable costs of environmental and other compliance related matters.
