Sales taking into account these adjustments are referred to as “organic sales.”
Management also uses these non-GAAP measures to establish operational goals and, in many cases, for measuring performance for compensation purposes.
However, any analysis of results on a non-GAAP basis should be used as a complement to, and in conjunction with, results presented in accordance with GAAP.

 The following table presents reported and organic sales growth rates between fiscal 2018 and fiscal 2017 for the third quarters and first nine months of fiscal 2018.
 The following table presents the reconciliation of reported sales to organic sales for the first nine months of fiscal 2017.
   (1)    Includes PF acquired on October 17, 2016, which has operations in each Avnet region.
 Sales for the third quarter of fiscal 2018 were $4.80 billion, an increase of 8.0%, or $353.2 million, from the prior year third quarter sales of $4.44 billion.
Excluding the translation impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates, sales increased 2.4% over the prior year third quarter with both operating groups contributing to this increase.
 EC sales of $4.40 billion in the third quarter of fiscal 2018 increased $313.2 million or 7.7% from the prior year third quarter sales of $4.09 billion.
This increase was primarily driven by increased sales in Asia due to organic growth and in EMEA primarily due to the benefit from the weakening of the U.S. Dollar, partially offset by declines in the Americas region due to supplier channel and program changes.
PF sales for the third quarter of fiscal 2018 were $391.0 million, an increase of $40.0 million or 11.4% from the prior year third quarter sales of $351.0 million driven by growth in all three regions including the benefit from the weakening U.S. Dollar.
 Sales for the first nine months of fiscal 2018 were $13.98 billion, an increase of 8.9%, or $1.14 billion, as compared to sales of $12.83 billion for the first nine months of fiscal 2017.
This increase was primarily due to the acquisition of PF, which was acquired in the second quarter of fiscal 2017, and an overall increase in sales in EC as double-digit growth in the EMEA and Asia regions of EC offset a year to date decrease of 8.9% in the EC Americas region.
Organic sales for the first nine months of 2018 increased $765.8 million, or 5.8%, compared to the first nine months of fiscal 2017 primarily due to double-digit sales growth in EMEA and Asia regions, offset by a decline of 7.9% in the Americas region.
 Gross profit for the third quarter of fiscal 2018 was $653.5 million, an increase of $23.6 million, or 3.7%, from the third quarter of fiscal 2017 gross profit of $630.0 million primarily driven by the increase in sales.
Asia sales represented approximately 38% of the total EC sales in the third quarter of fiscal 2018 as compared with approximately 36% in the third quarter of fiscal 2017.
 Gross profit and gross profit margins were $1.87 billion and 13.4%, respectively, for the first nine months of fiscal 2018 as compared with $1.74 billion and 13.5%, respectively, for the first nine months of fiscal 2017.
 As of December 30, 2017, the $181.4 million in goodwill related to the Electronic Components Americas core reporting unit (the “Americas”) primarily represented goodwill allocated from the acquisitions of Bell Micro, G2 and Round 2, all of which occurred prior to fiscal 2011.
The allocation of goodwill to the Americas represented the expected synergies the Americas would realize from these historical acquisitions.
Once goodwill has been assigned to a reporting unit, for accounting purposes, the goodwill is no longer directly associated with the underlying acquisitions that the goodwill originated from, but rather the reporting unit to which it has been allocated.
 As a result of the interim impairment testing and related fair value estimate of the Americas as of the third quarter of fiscal 2018, the Company impaired all of the goodwill in the Americas and recorded $181.4 million of goodwill impairment expense in the third quarter of fiscal 2018.
See Note 4 “Goodwill and long-lived assets” to the Company’s consolidated financial statements included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.
 The Company recorded restructuring, integration and other expenses of $25.1 million during the third quarter of fiscal 2018.
The Company recorded $5.9 million of restructuring costs in the third quarter of fiscal 2018 in order to realize approximately $7.2 million in expected annualized operating cost savings once such restructuring actions initiated before the end of the third quarter of fiscal 2018 are completed.
The after tax impact of restructuring, integration and other expenses were $19.4 million and $0.16 per share on a diluted basis.
The after tax impact of restructuring, integration and other expenses for the first nine months of fiscal 2018 was $76.7 million and $0.63 per share on a diluted basis.

The decrease in interest expense in the third quarter and first nine months of fiscal 2018 compared to the third quarter and first nine months of fiscal 2017 was primarily related to the impact of the Company’s repayment of its outstanding term loans and borrowings on its revolving credit facilities, which were used to help fund the PF acquisition.

Refer to Note 9, “Pension Plan,” for further information on the pension settlement losses.
 Income from discontinued operations was $181.9 million and $253.8 million in the third quarter and the first nine months of fiscal 2017, respectively, due to the operating results of the TS business, which was sold in the third quarter of fiscal 2017.
Included in the income from discontinued operations in the third quarter and first nine months of fiscal 2017, was $217.1 million for the estimated gain on sale of TS, net of taxes.

With the exception of the Company’s debt transactions discussed herein, there are no material changes to this information outside of normal borrowings and repayments of long-term debt and operating lease payments.
The Company was in compliance with all covenants under the Credit Facility and the Program as of March 31, 2018.
Outstanding borrowings under such forms of debt at the end of third quarter of fiscal 2018 was $7.5 million.
 The Company held cash and cash equivalents of $430.1 million as of March 31, 2018, of which $396.3 million was held outside the United States.
As of July 1, 2017, the Company held cash and cash equivalents of $836.4 million, of which $619.5 million was held outside of the United States.

 During periods of weakening demand in the electronic components industry, the Company typically generates cash from operating activities.
Conversely, the Company is more likely to use operating cash flows for working capital requirements during periods of higher growth.
The Company used $98.5 million in cash flows from operating activities over the trailing four fiscal quarters ended March 31, 2018 for continuing operations.
To the extent the cash balances held in foreign locations cannot be remitted back to the U.S. in a tax efficient manner, those cash balances are generally used for ongoing working capital, capital expenditure needs and to support acquisitions, and are currently expected to be permanently reinvested outside the United States.
The Company is still evaluating the impact of repatriating any additional foreign cash as a result of the Act.
In addition, local government regulations may restrict the Company’s ability to move funds among various locations under certain circumstances.
Management does not believe such restrictions would limit the Company’s ability to pursue its intended business strategy.
Management believes that Avnet’s available borrowing capacity, its current cash on hand including the remaining proceeds and marketable securities from the sale of the TS business and the Company’s expected ability to generate operating cash flows in the future will be sufficient to meet its future liquidity needs.
Additionally, as the Company integrates PF and restructures to transform Avnet into an electronic components focused business, the Company expects to use cash for restructuring, integration and other expenses.
 In addition to continuing to make investments in acquisitions, as of March 31, 2018, the Company may repurchase up to an aggregate of $389.6 million of shares of the Company’s common stock through a $1.95 billion share repurchase program approved by the Board of Directors.
The Company may terminate or limit the share repurchase program at any time without prior notice.
Additionally, the Company currently expects to pay quarterly cash dividends on shares of its common stock, subject to approval of the Board of Directors.
