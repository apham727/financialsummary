 Management believes that providing this additional information is useful to readers to better assess and understand operating performance, especially when comparing results with prior periods or forecasting performance for future periods, primarily because management typically monitors the business both including and excluding these adjustments to GAAP results. Management also uses these non-GAAP measures to establish operational goals and, in many cases, for measuring performance for compensation purposes. However, any analysis of results on a non-GAAP basis should be used as a complement to, and in conjunction with, results presented in accordance with GAAP.

 Avnet operating income margin was 3.3% in the third quarter of fiscal 2019 as compared with a 1.2% operating loss margin in the third quarter of fiscal 2018.

Excluding these expenses from both periods, adjusted operating income margin was 3.8% in the third quarter of fiscal 2019 as compared to 3.6% in the third quarter of fiscal 2018. The increase in operating income margin is primarily due to the reduction in operating expenses from the Company’s restructuring and integration efforts, partially offset by a decline in sales and gross profit margin.

 Historically the Company has made, and expects to continue to make, strategic investments through acquisition activity to the extent the investments strengthen Avnet’s competitive position, further its business strategies and meet management’s return on capital thresholds.
