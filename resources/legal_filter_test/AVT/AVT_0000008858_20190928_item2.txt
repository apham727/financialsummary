Sales taking into account these adjustments are referred to as “organic sales.”
Management believes that providing this additional information is useful to readers to better assess and understand operating performance, especially when comparing results with prior periods or forecasting performance for future periods, primarily because management typically monitors the business both including and excluding these adjustments to GAAP results.
Management also uses these non-GAAP measures to establish operational goals and, in many cases, for measuring performance for compensation purposes.
However, any analysis of results on a non-GAAP basis should be used as a complement to, and in conjunction with, results presented in accordance with GAAP.

Integration costs are primarily related to the integration of acquired businesses including Farnell, the integration of certain regional and global businesses, and incremental costs incurred as part of the consolidation, relocation, sale and closure of distribution centers and office facilities.
Accelerated depreciation relates to the incremental depreciation expense incurred related to the shortening of the estimated useful life for certain information technology assets.

With the exception of the Company’s debt transactions discussed herein, there are no material changes to this information outside of normal borrowings and repayments of long-term debt and operating lease payments.
See Note 4, “Debt” to the Company’s consolidated financial statements included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for additional information on financing transactions including the Credit Facility, the Securitization Program, and other outstanding debt as of September 28, 2019.
The Company was in compliance with all covenants under the Credit Facility and the Securitization Program as of September 28, 2019 and June 29, 2019.
The Company has various lines of credit, financing arrangements and other forms of bank debt in the U.S. and various foreign locations to fund the short-term working capital, foreign exchange, overdraft and letter of credit needs of its wholly owned subsidiaries.
Outstanding borrowings under such forms of debt at the end of first quarter of fiscal 2020 was $0.6 million.
As an alternative form of financing outside of the United States, the Company sells certain of its trade accounts receivable on a non-recourse basis to third-party financial institutions pursuant to factoring agreements.
The Company accounts for these transactions as sales of receivables and presents cash proceeds as cash provided by operating activities in the consolidated statements of cash flows.
As of June 29, 2019, the Company held cash and cash equivalents of $546.1 million, of which $476.6 million was held outside of the United States.
As of the end of the first quarter of fiscal 2020, the Company had a combined total borrowing capacity of $1.75 billion under the Credit Facility and the Securitization Program.
There were no borrowings outstanding and $4.2 million in letters of credit issued under the Credit Facility and $338.1 million in borrowings outstanding under the Securitization Program, resulting in approximately $1.41 billion of total availability as of September 28, 2019.
Availability under the Securitization Program is subject to the Company having sufficient eligible trade accounts receivable to support desired borrowings.
The Company expects to redeem the $300.0 million of Notes due June 2020 either through the issuance of new notes or from available borrowing capacity under the Credit Facility.
During the first quarter of fiscal 2020, the Company had an average daily balance outstanding of approximately $50.6 million under the Credit Facility and approximately $488.4 million under the Securitization Program.

During periods of weakening demand in the electronic components industry, the Company typically generates cash from operating activities.
Conversely, the Company is more likely to use operating cash flows for working capital requirements during periods of higher growth.
The Company generated $871.7 million in cash flows from operating activities over the trailing four fiscal quarters ended September 28, 2019 from continuing operations.
To the extent the cash balances held in foreign locations cannot be remitted back to the U.S. in a tax efficient manner, those cash balances are generally used for ongoing working capital, capital expenditure needs and to support acquisitions.
In addition, local government regulations may restrict the Company’s ability to move funds among various locations under certain circumstances.
Management does not believe such restrictions would limit the Company’s ability to pursue its intended business strategy.
Management believes that Avnet’s available borrowing capacity including capacity for the non-recourse sale of accounts receivable and the Company’s expected ability to generate operating cash flows in the future will be sufficient to meet its future liquidity needs.
In addition to continuing to make investments in acquisitions, as of September 28, 2019, the Company may repurchase up to an aggregate of $593.3 million of shares of the Company’s common stock through a $2.95 billion share repurchase program approved by the Board of Directors.
The Company may terminate or limit the share repurchase program at any time without prior notice.
Additionally, the Company currently expects to pay quarterly cash dividends on shares of its common stock, subject to approval of the Board of Directors.
In August 2019, the Company’s Board of Directors authorized a $500 million increase in the Company’s existing share repurchase program, increasing the cumulative total of authorized share repurchases to $2.95 billion of the Company’s common stock.
The following table includes the Company’s monthly purchases of the Company’s common stock during the first quarter of fiscal 2020, under the share repurchase program, which is part of a publicly announced plan.
