●Sales adjusted for certain items that impact the year-over-year analysis, which includes the impact of certain acquisitions by adjusting Avnet’s prior periods to include the sales of acquired businesses, as if the acquisitions had occurred at the beginning of the earliest period presented. Sales taking into account these adjustments are referred to as “organic sales.”
Management believes that providing this additional information is useful to readers to better assess and understand operating performance, especially when comparing results with prior periods or forecasting performance for future periods, primarily because management typically monitors the business both including and excluding these adjustments to GAAP results. Management also uses these non-GAAP measures to establish operational goals and, in many cases, for measuring performance for compensation purposes. However, any analysis of results on a non-GAAP basis should be used as a complement to, and in conjunction with, results presented in accordance with GAAP.

Sales of $4.63 billion were down 9.0% year over year and 7.8% in constant currency as compared to prior year first quarter sales of $5.09 billion. Both operating groups in all three regions contributed to the year-over-year decline in sales as the global industry-wide slowdown resulted in weaker year over year demand.
The following table presents reported and organic sales growth rates between fiscal 2020 and fiscal 2019 for the first quarter of fiscal 2020.
Sales for the first quarter of fiscal 2020 were down $459.9 million, or 9.0%, from the prior year first quarter sales of $5.09 billion. Sales in constant currency decreased 7.8% over the prior year first quarter with all three regions of both operating groups contributing to the decline. These decreases are primarily due to the current industry-wide economic downturn.
EC sales of $4.29 billion in the first quarter of fiscal 2020 decreased $416.6 million or 8.8% from the prior year first quarter sales of $4.71 billion. EC sales in constant currency declined 7.7% in constant currency year over year. Farnell sales for the first quarter of fiscal 2020 were $335.8 million, a decrease of $43.2 million or 11.4% from the prior year first quarter sales of $379.1 million. Farnell sales in constant currency declined 9.0% year over year.
 On a regional basis, sales declined 4.4% in the Americas, 10.5% in EMEA in constant currency and 7.7% in Asia in constant currency. All the regional declines are primarily due to the industry-wide economic downturn impacting the demand for electronic components.
Comparatively, in the first quarter of fiscal 2019, restructuring, integration and other expenses were $14.8 million. The after-tax impact of restructuring, integration, and other expenses was $11.5 million and $0.10 per share on a diluted basis.

During the first quarter of fiscal 2020, the Company had $4.9 million of other income as compared with $1.9 million of other expense in the first quarter of fiscal 2019.

Outstanding borrowings under such forms of debt at the end of first quarter of fiscal 2020 was $0.6 million.
As an alternative form of financing outside of the United States, the Company sells certain of its trade accounts receivable on a non-recourse basis to third-party financial institutions pursuant to factoring agreements. The Company accounts for these transactions as sales of receivables and presents cash proceeds as cash provided by operating activities in the consolidated statements of cash flows.

Availability under the Securitization Program is subject to the Company having sufficient eligible trade accounts receivable to support desired borrowings. The Company expects to renew or replace the Securitization Program on similar terms, subject to market conditions, before its maturity in August 2020. The Company expects to redeem the $300.0 million of Notes due June 2020 either through the issuance of new notes or from available borrowing capacity under the Credit Facility.

During periods of weakening demand in the electronic components industry, the Company typically generates cash from operating activities. Conversely, the Company is more likely to use operating cash flows for working capital requirements during periods of higher growth. The Company generated $871.7 million in cash flows from operating activities over the trailing four fiscal quarters ended September 28, 2019 from continuing operations. 
Historically the Company has made, and expects to continue to make, strategic investments through acquisition activity to the extent the investments strengthen Avnet’s competitive position, further its business strategies and meet management’s return on financial thresholds. As the Company implements the operating cost savings restructuring plans, responds to current business environment challenges and pursues ways to become more efficient and cost effective, the Company expects to use cash for restructuring, integration and other expenses.
In addition to continuing to make investments in acquisitions, as of September 28, 2019, the Company may repurchase up to an aggregate of $593.3 million of shares of the Company’s common stock through a $2.95 billion share repurchase program approved by the Board of Directors. The Company may repurchase stock from time to time at the discretion of management, subject to strategic considerations, market conditions and other factors. The Company may terminate or limit the share repurchase program at any time without prior notice. The timing and actual number of shares repurchased will depend on a variety of factors such as share price, corporate and regulatory requirements, and prevailing market conditions. Additionally, the Company currently expects to pay quarterly cash dividends on shares of its common stock, subject to approval of the Board of Directors. During the first quarter of fiscal 2020, the Board of Directors approved a dividend of $0.21 per share, which resulted in $21.5 million of dividend payments during the quarter. 
In August 2019, the Company’s Board of Directors authorized a $500 million increase in the Company’s existing share repurchase program, increasing the cumulative total of authorized share repurchases to $2.95 billion of the Company’s common stock.
