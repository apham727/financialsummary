The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the condensed consolidated financial statements, including the related notes, appearing in Item 1 of Part 1 of this quarterly report on Form 10-Q, as well as our most recent annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018.
References to “Taitron,” the “Company,” “we,” “our” and “us” refer to Taitron Components Incorporated and its wholly owned and majority-owned subsidiaries, unless the context otherwise specifically defines.
These estimates have a significant impact on our valuation and reserve accounts relating to the allowance for sales returns, doubtful accounts, inventory reserves and deferred income taxes.
Revenue Recognition – Revenue is recognized upon shipment of the products, which is when legal transfer of title occurs and control of the product is transferred to the customer.
Sales returns for the three months ended September 30, 2019 and 2018 were $0 and $2,000, respectively and for the nine months ended September 30, 2019 and 2018 were $4,000 and $5,000, respectively.
The allowance for sales returns and doubtful accounts at September 30, 2019 and December 31, 2018 aggregated $40,000 and $38,000, respectively.
Inventory – Inventory, consisting principally of products held for resale, is recorded at the lower of cost (determined using the first in-first out method) or net realizable value.
We had inventory balances in the amount of $4,207,000 and $4,597,000 at September 30, 2019 and December 31, 2018, respectively, which is presented net of valuation allowances of $7,319,000 and $7,189,000, respectively.
In any case, actual amounts could be different from those estimated.
We are primarily focused on supplying ODM products for our OEM customer’s multi-year turn-key projects.
In accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, we have classified inventory as a current asset in our September 30, 2019, condensed consolidated financial statements representing approximately 42% of current assets and 30% of total assets.
However, if all or a substantial portion of the inventory was required to be immediately liquidated, the inventory would not be as readily marketable or liquid as other items included or classified as a current asset, such as cash.
Net sales in the third quarter of 2019 totaled $1,658,000 versus $1,902,000 in the comparable period for 2018, a decrease of $244,000 or 12.8% over the same period last year.
The decrease was primarily driven by a decrease of ODM project sales volume.
Gross profit for the third quarter of 2019 was $888,000 versus $846,000 in the comparable period for 2018, and gross margin percentage of net sales was 53.6% in the third quarter of 2019 versus 44.5% in the comparable period for 2018.
Selling, general and administrative expenses in the third quarter of 2019 totaled $566,000 versus $544,000 in the comparable period for 2018.
The $22,000 increase was primarily driven by an increase in salaries.
Other income, net of other expense, in the third quarter of 2019 was $188,000 versus $29,000 in the comparable period for 2018.
Other income for the three months ended September 30, 2019 was primarily derived from the gain on sale of our Mexico property of $160,000 and rental income of excess office space at our headquarters in Valencia, CA.
Income tax provision was $2,000 for both the third quarter of 2019 and 2018, as we do not expect significant taxable income for the year ending December 31, 2019.
Net income was $515,000 for the third quarter of 2019 versus $279,000 in the comparable period for 2018, an increase of $236,000 resulting from the reasons discussed above.
Nine Months Ended September 30, 2019 versus Nine Months Ended September 30, 2018.
Net sales in the nine months ended September 30, 2019 was $4,814,000 versus $5,707,000 in the comparable period for 2018, a decrease of $893,000 or 15.6% over the same period last year.
The decrease was driven by a decrease of ODM project sales volume.
Gross profit for the nine months ended September 30, 2019 was $2,406,000 versus $2,479,000 in the comparable period for 2018, and gross margin percentage of net sales was approximately 50% for the nine months ended September 30, 2018 and 43.4% for 2018, respectively.
The approximately 6.6% gross profit increase was driven by shipments of new higher gross margin ODM projects.
The $58,000 increase was primarily driven by an increase of $81,000 in salaries primarily for severance pay incurred during the second quarter of 2019, offset by a decrease of $18,000 in professional fees paid for engineering design services.
Other income, net of other expenses, in the nine months ended September 30, 2019 was $244,000 versus $106,000 in the comparable period for 2018.
Other income for the nine months ended September 30, 2019 was primarily derived from the gain on sale of our Mexico property of $160,000 and rental income of excess office space at our headquarters in Valencia, CA.
Income tax provision was $4,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2019 versus $5,000 in 2018, as we do not expect significant taxable income for the year ending December 31, 2019.
Net income was $955,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2019 versus $737,000 in the comparable period for 2018, an increase of $236,000 resulting from the reasons discussed above.
We historically have satisfied our liquidity requirements through cash generated from operations, short-term commercial loans, subordinated related party promissory notes and issuance of equity securities.
Cash flows provided by operating activities were $858,000 and $1,409,000 in the nine months ended September 30, 2019 and 2018, respectively.
The decrease of $551,000 in cash flows provided by operations compared with the prior period resulted from changes in operating assets and liabilities, primarily from inventory and accounts payable compared to the prior period.
Cash flows provided by investing activities were $2,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2019 and cash flows used in investing activities was $5,000 in the nine months ended September 30, 2018.
The increase to our cash dividends was based upon our November 2, 2018 announcement that our quarterly cash dividends increased by 20% from $0.025 per share to $0.03 per share.
We believe that funds generated from operations, existing cash balances and, if necessary, related party short-term loans, are likely to be sufficient to finance our working capital and capital expenditure requirements for the foreseeable future.
If these funds are not sufficient, we may secure new sources of asset-based lending on accounts receivables or issue debt or equity securities.
Otherwise, we may need to liquidate assets to generate the necessary working capital.
As of September 30, 2019, inventory represented approximately 42% of current assets and 30% of total assets.
However, it is likely to take over one year for the inventory to turn and therefore is likely not saleable within a one-year time frame.
Hence, inventory would not be as readily marketable or liquid as other items included in current assets, such as cash.
As of September 30, 2019, we had no off-balance sheet arrangements.
