Revenue Recognition – Revenue is recognized upon shipment of the products, which is when legal transfer of title occurs and control of the product is transferred to the customer. Reserves for sales allowances and customer returns are established based upon historical experience and our estimates of future returns. Sales returns for the three months ended September 30, 2019 and 2018 were $0 and $2,000, respectively and for the nine months ended September 30, 2019 and 2018 were $4,000 and $5,000, respectively. The allowance for sales returns and doubtful accounts at September 30, 2019 and December 31, 2018 aggregated $40,000 and $38,000, respectively. 
Net sales in the third quarter of 2019 totaled $1,658,000 versus $1,902,000 in the comparable period for 2018, a decrease of $244,000 or 12.8% over the same period last year. The decrease was primarily driven by a decrease of ODM project sales volume. 
Selling, general and administrative expenses in the third quarter of 2019 totaled $566,000 versus $544,000 in the comparable period for 2018. The $22,000 increase was primarily driven by an increase in salaries. 
Other income, net of other expense, in the third quarter of 2019 was $188,000 versus $29,000 in the comparable period for 2018. Other income for the three months ended September 30, 2019 was primarily derived from the gain on sale of our Mexico property of $160,000 and rental income of excess office space at our headquarters in Valencia, CA. 
Income tax provision was $2,000 for both the third quarter of 2019 and 2018, as we do not expect significant taxable income for the year ending December 31, 2019. 
Net income was $515,000 for the third quarter of 2019 versus $279,000 in the comparable period for 2018, an increase of $236,000 resulting from the reasons discussed above. 
Nine Months Ended September 30, 2019 versus Nine Months Ended September 30, 2018. 
Net sales in the nine months ended September 30, 2019 was $4,814,000 versus $5,707,000 in the comparable period for 2018, a decrease of $893,000 or 15.6% over the same period last year. The decrease was driven by a decrease of ODM project sales volume. 
Gross profit for the nine months ended September 30, 2019 was $2,406,000 versus $2,479,000 in the comparable period for 2018, and gross margin percentage of net sales was approximately 50% for the nine months ended September 30, 2018 and 43.4% for 2018, respectively. The approximately 6.6% gross profit increase was driven by shipments of new higher gross margin ODM projects. 
Selling, general and administrative expenses in the nine months ended September 30, 2019 totaled $1,712,000 versus $1,654,000 in the comparable period for 2018, an increase of $58,000 or 3.5% over the same period last year. The $58,000 increase was primarily driven by an increase of $81,000 in salaries primarily for severance pay incurred during the second quarter of 2019, offset by a decrease of $18,000 in professional fees paid for engineering design services. 
Other income, net of other expenses, in the nine months ended September 30, 2019 was $244,000 versus $106,000 in the comparable period for 2018. Other income for the nine months ended September 30, 2019 was primarily derived from the gain on sale of our Mexico property of $160,000 and rental income of excess office space at our headquarters in Valencia, CA. 
Income tax provision was $4,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2019 versus $5,000 in 2018, as we do not expect significant taxable income for the year ending December 31, 2019. 
Net income was $955,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2019 versus $737,000 in the comparable period for 2018, an increase of $236,000 resulting from the reasons discussed above. 
We historically have satisfied our liquidity requirements through cash generated from operations, short-term commercial loans, subordinated related party promissory notes and issuance of equity securities. 
We believe that funds generated from operations, existing cash balances and, if necessary, related party short-term loans, are likely to be sufficient to finance our working capital and capital expenditure requirements for the foreseeable future. If these funds are not sufficient, we may secure new sources of asset-based lending on accounts receivables or issue debt or equity securities. Otherwise, we may need to liquidate assets to generate the necessary working capital. 
Inventory is included and classified as a current asset. As of September 30, 2019, inventory represented approximately 42% of current assets and 30% of total assets. However, it is likely to take over one year for the inventory to turn and therefore is likely not saleable within a one-year time frame. Hence, inventory would not be as readily marketable or liquid as other items included in current assets, such as cash. 
As of September 30, 2019, we had no off-balance sheet arrangements. 
Item 2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds. - None
