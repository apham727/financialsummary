Revenue Recognition – Revenue is recognized upon shipment of the products, which is when legal transfer of title occurs and control of the product is transferred to the customer. Reserves for sales allowances and customer returns are established based upon historical experience and our estimates of future returns. Sales returns for the three months ended September 30, 2018 and 2017 were $2,000 and $6,000, respectively and for the nine months ended September 30, 2018 and 2017 were $5,000 and $154,000, respectively. The allowance for sales returns and doubtful accounts at September 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017 aggregated $45,000 and $40,000, respectively. 
Net sales in the third quarter of 2018 totaled $1,902,000 versus $1,679,000 in the comparable period for 2017, an increase of $223,000 or 13.3% over the same period last year. The increase was driven by an increase of ODM project sales volume. 
Gross profit for the third quarter of 2018 was $846,000 versus $768,000 in the comparable period for 2018, and gross margin percentage of net sales was 44.5% in the third quarter of 2018 versus 45.7% in the comparable period for 2017. The gross profit increase was driven by an increase of ODM project sales unit pricing. 
Selling, general and administrative expenses in the third quarter of 2018 totaled $544,000 versus $534,000 in the comparable period for 2017. The increase was driven by increased professional fees incurred for engineering services for our products. 
Other income, net of other expense, in the third quarter of 2018 was $29,000 versus $25,000 in the comparable period for 2017. Other income was primarily derived from the rental income of excess office space at our headquarters in Valencia, CA. 
Net income was $279,000 for the third quarter of 2018 versus $214,000 in the comparable period for 2017, an increase of $65,000 resulting from the reasons discussed above. 
Nine Months Ended September 30, 2018 versus Nine Months Ended September 30, 2017. 
Net sales in the nine months ended September 30, 2018 was $5,707,000 versus $5,778,000 in the comparable period for 2017, a decrease of $71,000 or 1.2% over the same period last year. The decrease was driven by a decrease in demand for ODM projects. 
Gross profit for the nine months ended September 30, 2018 was $2,479,000 versus $2,328,000 in the comparable period for 2017, and gross margin percentage of net sales was approximately 43.4% for the nine months ended September 30, 2018 and 40.3% for 2017, respectively. 
Interest expense, net of interest income, was $4,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2018 versus $29,000 in the comparable period for 2017. The decrease was driven by the reduction of outstanding debt obligations. See Note 4. 
Other income, net of other losses, in the nine months ended September 30, 2017 was $106,000 versus $85,000 in the comparable period for 2017. Other income was primarily derived from the rental income of excess office space at our headquarters in Valencia, CA. 
Income tax provision was $5,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2018 versus $3,000 in 2017, as we do not expect significant taxable income for the year ending December 31, 2018. 
Net income was $737,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2018 versus $656,000 in the comparable period for 2017, an increase of $81,000 resulting from the reasons discussed above. 
We have financed our operations with funds generated from operating activities and borrowings under our revolving credit facility. 
Cash flows provided by operating activities were $1,409,000 as opposed to $190,000 in the nine months ended September 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively. The increase of $1,219,000 in cash flows provided by operations compared with the prior period resulted from changes in operating assets and liabilities, primarily from inventory and accounts receivables compared to the prior period. 
Inventory is included in current assets; however, it will take over one year for the inventory to turn. Hence, inventory would not be as readily marketable or liquid as other items included in current assets, such as cash. 
We believe that funds generated from, or used in operations, in addition to existing cash balances are likely to be sufficient to finance our working capital and capital expenditure requirements for the foreseeable future. If these funds are not sufficient, we may secure new sources of short-term commercial loans, asset-based lending on accounts receivables or issue debt or equity securities. 
As of November 14, 2018, we had no off-balance sheet arrangements.
