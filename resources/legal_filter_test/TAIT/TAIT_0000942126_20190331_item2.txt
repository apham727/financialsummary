The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the condensed consolidated financial statements, including the related notes, appearing in Item 1 of Part 1 of this quarterly report on Form 10-Q, as well as our most recent annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018.
References to “Taitron,” the “Company,” “we,” “our” and “us” refer to Taitron Components Incorporated and its wholly owned and majority-owned subsidiaries, unless the context otherwise specifically defines.
These estimates have a significant impact on our valuation and reserve accounts relating to the allowance for sales returns, doubtful accounts, inventory reserves and deferred income taxes.
Revenue Recognition – Revenue is recognized upon shipment of the products, which is when legal transfer of title occurs and control of the product is transferred to the customer.
Sales returns for the three months ended March 31, 2019 and 2018 were $3,000 and $2,000, respectively.
The allowance for sales returns and doubtful accounts at March 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018 aggregated $39,000 and $38,000, respectively.
Inventory – Inventory, consisting principally of products held for resale, is recorded at the lower of cost (determined using the first in-first out method) or net realizable value.
We had inventory balances in the amount of $4,700,000 and $4,597,000 at March 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018, respectively, which is presented net of valuation allowances of $7,229,000 and $7,189,000, respectively.
We evaluate inventories to identify excess, high-cost, slow-moving or other factors rendering inventories as unmarketable at normal profit margins.
In any case, actual amounts could be different from those estimated.
We are primarily focused on supplying ODM products for our OEM customer’s multi-year turn-key projects.
As a result, we expect our components inventory will be more passively marketed and distributed online for clearance through our internet sales portal, however at potentially lower rates due to the pricing pressures normally attributed with online shopping.
In accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, we have classified inventory as a current asset in our March 31, 2019, condensed consolidated financial statements representing approximately 47% of current assets and 34% of total assets.
However, if all or a substantial portion of the inventory was required to be immediately liquidated, the inventory would not be as readily marketable or liquid as other items included or classified as a current asset, such as cash.
Net sales in the first quarter of 2019 totaled $1,384,000 versus $1,655,000 in the comparable period for 2018, a decrease of $271,000 or 16.4% over the same period last year.
The decrease was primarily driven by a decrease of ODM project sales volume.
Gross profit for the first quarter of 2019 was $683,000 versus $654,000 in the comparable period for 2018, and gross margin percentage of net sales was 49.4% in the first quarter of 2019 versus 39.5% in the comparable period for 2018.
The approximately 10% gross profit increase was driven by an increase of ODM project sales unit pricing contributing approximately 5% and shipments of new higher gross margin ODM products which contributed approximately 4% of the increase.
Selling, general and administrative expenses in the first quarter of 2019 totaled $530,000 versus $560,000 in the comparable period for 2018.
The $30,000 decrease was primarily driven by the decreases of $15,000 in professional services and $9,000 in commissions paid to our independent sales representatives.
Other income was primarily derived from the rental income of excess office space at our headquarters in Valencia, CA.
Income tax provision was $1,000 for the first quarter of 2019 versus $2,000 in 2018, as we do not expect significant taxable income for the year ending December 31, 2019.
Net income was $184,000 for the first quarter of 2019 versus $59,000 in the comparable period for 2018, an increase of $125,000 resulting from the reasons discussed above.
We historically have satisfied our liquidity requirements through cash generated from operations, short-term commercial loans, subordinated related party promissory notes and issuance of equity securities.
Cash flows provided by operating activities were $260,000 as opposed to $493,000 in the three months ended March 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively.
The decrease of $233,000 in cash flows provided by operations compared with the prior period resulted from changes in operating assets and liabilities, primarily from inventory and accounts payable compared to the prior period.
Cash flows used for investing activities were $191,000 and $3,000 for the three months ended March 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively.
Cash flows used for financing activities were $95,000 and $139,000 for the three months ended March 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively.
The decrease of $44,000 compared with the prior period was primarily due to $76,000 of stock options exercised and partially offset by $32,000 of increased cash dividend payments.
The increase to our cash dividends was based upon our November 2, 2018 announcement that our quarterly cash dividends increased by 20% from $0.025 per share to $0.03 per share.
We believe that funds generated from operations, existing cash balances and, if necessary, related party short-term loans, are likely to be sufficient to finance our working capital and capital expenditure requirements for the foreseeable future.
If these funds are not sufficient, we may secure new sources of asset-based lending on accounts receivables or issue debt or equity securities.
Otherwise, we may need to liquidate assets to generate the necessary working capital.
As of March 31, 2019, inventory represented approximately 47% of current assets and 34% of total assets.
However, it is likely to take over one year for the inventory to turn and therefore is likely not saleable within a one-year time frame.
Hence, inventory would not be as readily marketable or liquid as other items included in current assets, such as cash.
As of March 31, 2019, we had no off-balance sheet arrangements.
