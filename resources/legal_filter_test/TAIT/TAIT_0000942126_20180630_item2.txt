The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the condensed consolidated financial statements, including the related notes, appearing in Item 1 of Part 1 of this quarterly report on Form 10-Q, as well as our most recent annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2017.  
References to “Taitron,” the “Company,” “we,” “our” and “us” refer to Taitron Components Incorporated and its wholly owned and majority-owned subsidiaries, unless the context otherwise specifically defines. 
In accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, we have classified inventory as a current asset in our June 30, 2018, condensed consolidated financial statements representing approximately 49% of current assets and 34% of total assets. However, if all or a substantial portion of the inventory was required to be immediately liquidated, the inventory would not be as readily marketable or liquid as other items included or classified as a current asset, such as cash. We cannot assure you that demand in the discrete semiconductor market will increase and that market conditions will improve. Therefore, it is possible that further declines in our carrying values of inventory may result. 
Second quarter of 2018 versus 2017. 
Net sales in the second quarter of 2018 totaled $2,150,000 versus $1,773,000 in the comparable period for 2017, an increase of $377,000 or 21.3% over the same period last year. The increase was driven by an increase of ODM project sales volume. 
Gross profit for the second quarter of 2018 was $979,000 versus $757,000 in the comparable period for 2018, and gross margin percentage of net sales was 45.5% in the second quarter of 2018 versus 42.7% in the comparable period for 2017. The gross profit increase was driven by an increase of ODM project sales unit pricing. 
Selling, general and administrative expenses in the second quarter of 2018 totaled $550,000 versus $542,000 in the comparable period for 2017. The increase was driven by increased professional fees incurred for engineering services for our products. 
Other income, net of other expense, in the second quarter of 2018 was $29,000 versus $31,000 in the comparable period for 2017. Other income was primarily derived from the rental income of excess office space at our headquarters in Valencia, CA. 
Net income was $399,000 for the second quarter of 2018 versus $215,000 in the comparable period for 2017, an increase of $184,000 resulting from the reasons discussed above. 
Six Months Ended June 30, 2018 versus Six Months Ended June 30, 2017. 
Net sales in the six months ended June 30, 2018 was $3,805,000 versus $3,940,000 in the comparable period for 2017, a decrease of $135,000 or 3.4% over the same period last year. The decrease was driven by a decrease in demand for ODM components. 
Gross profit for the six months ended June 30, 2018 was $1,633,000 versus $1,630,000 in the comparable period for 2017, and gross margin percentage of net sales was approximately 42.9% for the six months ended June 30, 2018 and 41.4% for 2017, respectively. 
Other income, net of other losses, in the six months ended June 30, 2017 was $77,000 versus $60,000 in the comparable period for 2017. Other income was primarily derived from the rental income of excess office space at our headquarters in Valencia, CA. 
Income tax provision was $3,000 for the six months ended June 30, 2018 versus $1,000 in 2017, as we do not expect significant taxable income for the year ending December 31, 2018. 
Net income was $458,000 for the six months ended June 30, 2018 versus $514,000 in the comparable period for 2017, a decrease of $56,000 resulting from the reasons discussed above. 
We have financed our operations with funds generated from operating activities and borrowings under our revolving credit facility. 
Cash flows provided by operating activities were $785,000 as opposed to $70,000 in the six months ended June 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively. The increase of $715,000 in cash flows provided by operations compared with the prior period resulted from changes in operating assets and liabilities, primarily from inventory, accounts payables and accounts receivables compared to the prior period. 
Inventory is included in current assets; however, it will take over one year for the inventory to turn. Hence, inventory would not be as readily marketable or liquid as other items included in current assets, such as cash. 
We believe that funds generated from, or used in operations, in addition to existing cash balances are likely to be sufficient to finance our working capital and capital expenditure requirements for the foreseeable future. If these funds are not sufficient, we may secure new sources of short-term commercial loans, asset-based lending on accounts receivables or issue debt or equity securities. 
As of August 14, 2018, we had no off-balance sheet arrangements.
