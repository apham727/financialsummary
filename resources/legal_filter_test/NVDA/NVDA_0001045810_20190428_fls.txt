In June 2016, the FASB issued a new accounting standard to replace the incurred loss impairment methodology under current GAAP with a methodology that reflects expected credit losses and requires consideration of a broader range of reasonable and supportable information to inform credit loss estimates.
We will be required to use a forward-looking expected credit loss model for accounts receivable and other financial instruments, including available-for-sale debt securities.
We are currently evaluating the impact of this standard on our Consolidated Financial Statements.
Also, these forward-looking statements represent our estimates and assumptions only as of the date of this filing.
You should read this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q completely and with the understanding that our actual future results may be materially different from what we expect.
We hereby qualify our forward-looking statements by these cautionary statements.
Except as required by law, we assume no obligation to update these forward-looking statements publicly, or to update the reasons actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements, even if new information becomes available in the future.
