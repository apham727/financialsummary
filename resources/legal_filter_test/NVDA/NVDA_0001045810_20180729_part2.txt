Beginning August 2004, our Board of Directors authorized us to repurchase our stock.
In November 2016, the Board authorized an additional $2.00 billion under our repurchase program and extended it through December 2020.

As of July 29, 2018, we were authorized to repurchase additional shares of our common stock up to $1.16 billion through December 2020.
The program does not obligate NVIDIA to acquire any particular amount of common stock and the program may be suspended at any time at our discretion.
We had no share repurchase transactions during the second quarter of fiscal year 2019.
During the second quarter of fiscal year 2019, we issued one thousand shares of our common stock upon settlement of Convertible Notes submitted for conversion.
Subsequently, we received additional conversion notices for an aggregate of $11 million in principal amount of the Convertible Notes, which are expected to be settled in the third quarter of fiscal year 2019.
The actual number of shares issuable upon conversion will be determined based upon the terms of the Convertible Notes.
