All forward-looking statements included in this report are made as of the date hereof and are based on information available to us as of such date.

The performance and simplicity of our advanced, comprehensive solutions offer unprecedented levels of functionality, reliability and scalability.
We derive most of our revenue from professional audio conferencing products by promoting our products in the professional audio-visual channel.
We have extended our total addressable market from installed audio conferencing market to adjacent complementary markets – microphones, video collaboration and networked audio and video streaming.
We have achieved this through strategic technological acquisitions as well as by internal product development.
In June 2018, at our industry’s largest trade show in North America, we introduced new audio products including significant additions to our CONVERGE® 2 audio conferencing platform, ceiling microphone array product line, and wireless microphone systems in the newly FCC allocated 537-563 MHz range.
We also introduced new video solutions including economical new SKUs to our VIEW® AV Networking platform and a second-generation video cloud solution, COLLABORATE® Space.
During the six months ended June 30, 2018 seven more patents related to video synchronization, speech technology, integrated microphone array and ceiling or wall tile, echo cancellation with beamforming microphone array, audio distribution over local area networks, and USB to Bluetooth audio bridging were issued to us.
While focusing on strategic innovation that we believe will strengthen our competitive position, and accelerated product development, we have also planned and initiated a company-wide cost cutting programs.
Overall revenue declined in the three and six months ended June 30, 2018 when compared to the three months and six months ended June 30, 2017, with declines seen in all product categories.
Our gross profit margin decreased to 47% during the three months ended June 30, 2018 from 59% for the three months ended June 30, 2017.
The proportion of overhead costs absorbed into inventory has declined due to a sharp decline in our inventory purchasing activity causing increased amounts of overhead costs to be expensed.
We operate in a very dynamic and highly competitive industry which is dominated on the one hand by a few players with respect to certain products like traditional video conferencing appliances while on the other influenced heavily by a fragmented reseller market consisting of numerous regional and local players.
The industry is also characterized by the influx of venture capitalist funded start-ups and private companies keen to win market share even at the expense of mounting financial losses.
The audio-visual products market is characterized by intense competition and rapidly evolving technology.
Our competitors vary within each product category.
The adoption of Beamforming Microphone Array 2, along with Converge Pro 2, our new platform for professional audio conferencing, remains challenged in large part because of our competitors’ product offering that directly infringes our strategic patents.
The patent infringement also has had a material adverse effect on our revenue from ClearOne’s other products like wireless microphones, ceiling microphones and video products.
Our revenues in the near term may be materially adversely affected by the resignation of a large US distributor in June 2018.
Our strength in professional audio visual space is largely due to our industry leading conferencing technologies and the full suite of professional microphone products, especially Beamforming Microphone Arrays.
Despite our strong leadership position in the professional audio communications products market, we face challenges to revenue growth due to the infringement of our patents by competitors, the limited size of the market and pricing pressures from new competitors attracted to the commercial market.
During 2018, revenue from our video products has generally shown lesser decline than revenue from audio conferencing products.
We face intense competition in this market from well-established market leaders as well as emerging players rich with marketing funds.
We expect our strategy of combining Spontania, our cloud-based video conferencing product, Collaborate, our appliance-based media collaboration product and our high-end audio conferencing technology to distinguish us from our competitors' product offerings.
Most of our revenue from outside the U.S. is billed in US Dollars and is not exposed to any significant currency risk.
Our revenue decreased by $3.3 million, or 32%, to $7.0 million in 2018-Q2 compared to $10.3 million in 2017-Q2.
All product categories witnessed revenue declines with revenue declines of 35%, 15% and 30% for professional audio conferencing, unified communication end points and video products, respectively.
The share of professional audio communications products (which includes microphone products but not premium products) in our product mix declined from 73% in 2017-Q2 to 70% in 2018-Q2.
During 2018-Q2, revenue declined across all regions except China and Latin America.
The revenue declines for Asia Pacific including Middle East, Europe and Africa, and Americas were 16%, 10% and 41%, respectively.
Cost of goods sold (“COGS”) includes expenses associated with finished goods purchased from outsourced manufacturers, the manufacture of our products (including material and direct labor), our manufacturing and operations organization, property and equipment depreciation, warranty expense, freight expense, royalty payments, and the allocation of overhead expenses.
Our gross profit for 2018-Q2 was approximately $3.3 million or 47% compared to approximately $6.1 million, or 59%, for 2017-Q2.
The proportion of overheads absorbed into inventory has declined due to a sharp decline in our inventory purchasing activity causing increased amounts of overheads to be expensed as against being carried with our inventory.
Our gross profit for 2018-H1 was approximately $7.3 million or 52% compared to approximately $12.7 million, or 58%, for 2017-H1.
Our profitability in the near-term continues to depend significantly on our revenues from professional audio conferencing products.
We hold long-term inventory and if we are unable to sell our long-term inventory, our profitability might be affected by inventory write-offs and price mark-downs.
Our long-term inventory includes approximately $2.7 million of wireless microphones related finished goods and assemblies, $2.7 million of Converge Pro 2 products and about $1.1 million of raw materials that will be used for manufacturing professional audio conferencing products.
Any business changes that are adverse to these product lines could potentially impact our ability to sell these long-term inventory in addition to our current inventory.
Other income (expense), net, includes interest income, interest expense, and foreign currency changes.
Other income reduced in 2018-Q2 and 2018-H1 due to reduction in interest income caused by decline in the investment holdings and due to higher realized losses on liquidated investments.
During the six months ended June 30, 2018, we accrued income taxes at the forecasted effective tax benefit rate of 26.8% as compared to the forecasted effective tax rate of 127% used during the six months ended June 30, 2017.
The 100.2% decrease in the forecasted effective tax rate was primarily due to the reduction in U.S. federal corporate tax rates as a result of the enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act and losses in certain foreign jurisdictions which cannot be benefited, which had a greater impact on the effective rate in 2017 due to differences in forecasted income as compared to 2018.
In addition, a discrete tax expense of $64 thousand is primarily attributable to changes in income tax reserves related to an income tax audit in Hong Kong.
As of June 30, 2018, our cash and cash equivalents were approximately $4.1 compared to $5.6 million as of December 31, 2017.
Our working capital was $23.2 million and $23.3 million as of June 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017, respectively.
The decrease in cash used was primarily due to an increase in cash inflows due to change in operating assets and liabilities of $6.1 million partially offset by an increase in net loss by $2.7 million and decrease in non-cash charges of $0.6 million.
The increase was primarily due to an increase in proceeds from marketable securities net of purchases of approximately $3.1 million, partially offset by $2.4 million in capitalization of patent defense costs.
Capitalization of patent defense costs.
When we capitalize patent defense costs we amortize the costs over the remaining estimated useful life of the patent, which is 15 to 17 years.
During the six months ended June 30, 2018 we spent $2.4 million of legal costs related to the defense of our patents and capitalized the entire amount.
In addition, we expect to generate additional cash as our inventory levels are brought down to historical levels.
We believe all of these and effective management of working capital will provide the liquidity needed to meet our short-term and long-term operating requirements and finance our growth plans.
In addition to capital expenditures, we may use cash in the near future for selective infusions of technology, sales and marketing, infrastructure, and other investments to fuel our growth.
At June 30, 2018, we had inventory totaling $22.7 million, of which non-current inventory accounted for $8.4 million.
This compares to total inventories of $24.7 million and non-current inventory of $8.7 million as of December 31, 2017.
Our non-current inventory includes approximately $2.7 million of wireless microphones related finished goods and assemblies, $2.7 million of Converge Pro 2 products and about $1.1 million of raw materials that will be used for manufacturing professional audio conferencing products.
Any business changes that are adverse to these product lines could potentially impact our ability to sell these long-term inventory in addition to our current inventory.
We review the accounting policies used in reporting our financial results on a regular basis.
Except with respect to our revenue recognition practices included in Note 1.
“Business Description, Basis of Presentation and Significant Accounting Policies” under Item 1 of this Form 10-Q, there have been no changes to the critical accounting policies as explained in our 2017 Form 10-K.
