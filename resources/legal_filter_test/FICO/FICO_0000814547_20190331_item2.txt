We use analytics to help businesses automate, improve and connect decisions across their enterprise — an approach we commonly refer to as decision management.
Our predictive analytics, which includes the industry-standard FICO® Score, and our decision management systems leverage the use of big data and mathematical algorithms to predict, categorize, and describe consumer behavior in order to power hundreds of billions of customer decisions each year.
We also serve consumers through online services that enable people to purchase and understand their FICO® Scores, the standard measure of consumer credit risk in the U.S., and empower them to manage their financial health.
Most of our solutions address customer engagement, including customer acquisition, customer onboarding, customer servicing and management, and customer protection.
We also help businesses improve non-customer decisions such as streamlining transaction and claims processing, optimizing logistics, and identifying and quantifying security risk.
Our solutions enable users to make decisions that are more precise, consistent and agile, and that systematically advance business goals.
We derive a significant portion of our revenues from clients outside the U.S. International revenues accounted for 31% and 33% of total consolidated revenues for the quarters ended March 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively, and 34% of total consolidated revenues for each of the six months ended March 31, 2019 and 2018.

For our Applications and Decision Management Software segments, cloud business continues to grow as we pursue our cloud-first strategy.
Cloud revenues increased 6% to $66.8 million during the quarter ended March 31, 2019 from $63.1 million during the quarter ended March 31, 2018, and 9% to $130.2 million during the six months ended March 31, 2019 from $119.3 million during the six months ended March 31, 2018.
Operating income increased 5% to $48.5 million during the quarter ended March 31, 2019 from $46.4 million during the quarter ended March 31, 2018 and as a result, net earnings increased 7% to $33.4 million from $31.2 million.
We continue to enhance stockholder value by returning cash to stockholders through our stock repurchase program.
During the quarter and six months ended March 31, 2019, we repurchased approximately 0.2 million shares at a total repurchase price of $37.0 million and 0.6 million shares at a total repurchase price of $119.7 million, respectively.
As of March 31, 2019, we had $79.5 million remaining under our current stock repurchase program.
Management uses bookings as an indicator of our business performance.
Bookings represent contracts signed in the current reporting period that generate current and future revenue streams.
We consider contract terms, knowledge of the marketplace and experience with our customers, among other factors, when determining the estimated value of contract bookings.
While we disclose estimated revenue expected to be recognized in the future related to unsatisfied performance obligations in Note 8 to the accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements, we believe bookings amount is still a meaningful measure of our business as it includes estimated revenues omitted from Note 8, such as sales- or usage-based royalties derived from our software licenses, among others.
Bookings calculations have varying degrees of certainty depending on the revenue type and individual contract terms.
Our revenue types are transactional and maintenance, professional services and license.
Our estimate of bookings is as of the end of the period in which a contract is signed, and we do not update initial booking estimates in future periods for changes between estimated and actual results.
The following paragraphs discuss the key assumptions used to calculate bookings and the susceptibility of these assumptions to variability.
•Regulatory and other factors that affect the business environment in which our customers operate.
We calculate maintenance bookings directly from the terms stated in the contract.
We calculate professional services bookings as the estimated number of hours to complete a project multiplied by the rate per hour.
We estimate the number of hours based on our understanding of the project scope, conversations with customer personnel and our experience in estimating professional services projects.
Estimated bookings may differ from actual results primarily due to differences in the actual number of hours incurred.
These differences typically result from customer decisions to alter the mix of FICO and customer services resources used to complete a project.
Licenses are sold on a perpetual or term basis and bookings generally equal the fixed amount stated in the contract.
Transactional and maintenance bookings were 35% and 46% of total bookings for the quarters ended March 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively.
Scores segment revenues increased $17.3 million due to an increase of $15.8 million in our business-to-business scores revenue and $1.5 million in our business-to-consumer services revenue.

Revenues from these customers included amounts recorded in our other segments.
Decision Management Software segment revenues increased $14.5 million primarily attributable to an increase in services revenues related to our Optimization solutions and Decision Management Platform product, and an increase in license sales.
The quarter over quarter increase in cost of revenue expenses of $6.1 million was primarily attributable to increase in personnel and labor costs as a result of increased headcount.
Cost of revenues as a percentage of revenues was 31% during the quarter ended March 31, 2019, consistent with that incurred during the quarter ended March 31, 2018.
Cost of revenues as a percentage of revenues was 30% during the six months ended March 31, 2019, materially consistent with that incurred during the six months ended March 31, 2018.

Selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenues was 38% during the six months ended March 31, 2019, consistent with that incurred during the six months ended March 31, 2018.
Over the next several quarters, we expect selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenues will be consistent with that incurred during the quarter ended March 31, 2019.
Amortization of intangible assets consists of amortization expense related to intangible assets recorded in connection with acquisitions accounted for by the acquisition method of accounting.
Our finite-lived intangible assets, consisting primarily of completed technology and customer contracts and relationships, are being amortized using the straight-line method over periods ranging from four to fifteen years.
Amortization expense was $1.5 million during the quarter ended March 31, 2019 versus $1.7 million during the quarter ended March 31, 2018.
Amortization expense was $3.0 million during the six months ended March 31, 2019 versus $3.5 million during the six months ended March 31, 2018.
Over the next several quarters, we expect that amortization expense will be consistent with the amortization expense we recorded during the quarter ended March 31, 2019.
Interest expense includes primarily interest on the senior notes issued in May 2008, July 2010 and May 2018, as well as interest and credit facility fees on the revolving line of credit.
Our consolidated statements of income and comprehensive income include interest expense netted with interest income, which is derived primarily from the investment of funds in excess of our immediate operating requirements.
The quarter over quarter increase in interest expense of $2.9 million was primarily attributable to a higher average outstanding debt balance during the quarter ended March 31, 2019, as well as a higher average interest rate on our 2018 Senior Notes compared to that on our revolving line of credit.
Over the next several quarters, we expect net interest expense will be consistent with the net interest expense incurred during the quarter ended March 31, 2019.
The quarter over quarter $2.1 million increase in operating income was attributable to a $22.0 million increase in segment revenues and a $0.2 million decrease in amortization cost, partially offset by a $12.8 million increase in segment operating expenses, a $6.0 million increase in corporate expenses and a $1.3 million increase in share-based compensation cost.
At the segment level, the quarter over quarter $3.2 million increase in segment operating income was the result of a $17.5 million increase in our Scores segment operating income and a $0.7 million decrease in our Decision Management Software segment operating loss, partially offset by a $9.0 million decrease in our Applications segment operating income and a $6.0 million increase in corporate expense.
The quarter over quarter $9.0 million decrease in Applications segment operating income was due to a $4.7 million decrease in segment revenue and a $4.3 million increase in segment operating expenses.
The quarter over quarter $17.5 million increase in Scores segment operating income was due to a $17.3 million increase in segment revenue and a $0.2 million decrease in segment operating expenses.
Segment operating income as a percentage of segment revenue for Scores increased to 85% from 81% mainly due to an increase in sales of our higher-margin score products.

As of March 31, 2019, we had $76.9 million in cash and cash equivalents, which included $60.7 million held off-shore by our foreign subsidiaries.
We believe these balances, as well as available borrowings from our $400 million revolving line of credit and anticipated cash flows from operating activities, will be sufficient to fund our working and other capital requirements as well as the $28.0 million principal payment due in July 2019 on our senior notes issued in July 2010.
Under our current financing arrangements, we have no other significant debt obligations maturing over the next twelve months.
We may elect to use available cash and cash equivalents to fund such activities in the future.
In the event additional needs for cash arise, or if we refinance our existing debt, we may raise additional funds from a combination of sources, including the potential issuance of debt or equity securities.
Additional financing might not be available on terms favorable to us, or at all.
Our primary method for funding operations and growth has been through cash flows generated from operating activities.
The $32.6 million increase was primarily attributable to a $41.0 million decrease in proceeds, net of payments, from our revolving line of credit and an $8.0 million increase in taxes paid related to net share settlement of equity awards, partially offset by an $11.1 million increase in proceeds from issuance of treasury stock under employee stock plans and a $5.0 million decrease in repurchases of common stock.
In July 2018, our Board of Directors approved a stock repurchase program following the completion of our previous program.
This program was open-ended and authorized repurchases of shares of our common stock up to an aggregate cost of $250.0 million in the open market or in negotiated transactions.
Pursuant to the July 2018 program, we repurchased 150,000 shares of our common stock at a total repurchase price of $37.0 million and 575,000 shares of our common stock at a total repurchase price of $119.7 million during the quarter and six months ended March 31, 2019, respectively.
The 2010 Senior Notes require interest payments semi-annually and contain certain restrictive covenants, including the maintenance of a maximum consolidated net debt to consolidated EBITDA ratio of 3.00 and a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio of 2.50.
On May 8, 2018, we issued $400 million of senior notes in a private offering to qualified institutional investors (the “2018 Senior Notes”, and with the 2010 Senior Notes, the “Senior Notes”).
The purchase agreements for the 2010 Senior Notes and the indenture for the 2018 Senior Notes contain certain covenants typical of unsecured obligations.
As of March 31, 2019, the carrying value of the Senior Notes was $513.0 million and we were in compliance with all financial covenants under these obligations.
We prepare our consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.
Actual results may differ from these estimates.
Revenue is recognized when control of the promised goods or services is transferred to our customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which we expect to be entitled to in exchange for those goods or services.
See Note 8 to the accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements for further discussion on revenues.
Accounting for our acquisitions requires us to recognize, separately from goodwill, the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed at their acquisition-date fair values.
Goodwill as of the acquisition date is measured as the excess of consideration transferred and the net of the acquisition-date fair values of the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed.
While we use our best estimates and assumptions to accurately value assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the acquisition date, our estimates are inherently uncertain and subject to refinement.
As a result, during the measurement period, which may be up to one year from the acquisition date, we record adjustments to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed with the corresponding offset to goodwill.
In addition, uncertain tax positions and tax-related valuation allowances assumed in connection with a business combination are initially estimated as of the acquisition date.
We reevaluate these items quarterly based upon facts and circumstances that existed as of the acquisition date with any adjustments to our preliminary estimates being recorded to goodwill provided that we are within the measurement period.
We do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood there will be a material change in the future estimates.
For fiscal 2018, we performed a step zero qualitative analysis for our annual assessment of goodwill impairment.
Consequently, we did not perform a step one quantitative analysis and determined goodwill was not impaired for any of our reporting units for fiscal 2018.
If such tests indicate impairment, then we measure and record the impairment as the difference between the carrying value of the asset and the fair value of the asset.
Significant management judgment is required in forecasting future operating results used in the preparation of the projected cash flows.
We review the estimated remaining useful lives of our acquired intangible assets at each reporting period.
A reduction in our estimate of remaining useful lives, if any, could result in increased annual amortization expense in future periods.
We measure stock-based compensation cost at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and recognize it as expense, net of estimated forfeitures, over the vesting or service period, as applicable, of the stock award (generally three to four years).
We use the Black-Scholes valuation model to determine the fair value of our stock options and the Monte Carlo valuation model to determine the fair value of our market share units.
Our valuation models and generally accepted valuation techniques require us to make assumptions and to apply judgment to determine the fair value of our awards.
Historically, there have been no material changes in our estimates or assumptions.
We do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood there will be a material change in the future estimates or assumptions.
It was effective starting in our first quarter of fiscal 2018.
118 (“SAB 118”) in December 2017, which provides a measurement period that should not extend beyond one year from the Tax Act enactment date for companies to complete the accounting under FASB Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) 740, “Accounting for Income Taxes” (“ASC 740”).
Information regarding our adoption and prospective impacts of the Tax Act is included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for our fiscal year ended September 30, 2018.
We have not yet adopted an accounting policy in regard to GILTI.
We recognize and measure benefits for uncertain tax positions using a two-step approach.
The first step is to evaluate the tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return by determining if the technical merits of the tax position indicate it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained upon audit, including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes.
For tax positions more likely than not of being sustained upon audit, the second step is to measure the tax benefit as the largest amount more than 50% likely of being realized upon settlement.
Significant judgment is required to evaluate uncertain tax positions and they are evaluated on a quarterly basis.
A description of our accounting policies associated with tax-related contingencies and valuation allowances assumed as part of a business combination is provided under “Business Combinations” above.
We are subject to various proceedings, lawsuits and claims relating to products and services, technology, labor, stockholder and other matters.
If the potential loss is considered less than probable or the amount cannot be reasonably estimated, disclosure of the matter is considered.
The amount of loss accrual or disclosure, if any, is determined after analysis of each matter, and is subject to adjustment if warranted by new developments or revised strategies.
Due to uncertainties related to these matters, accruals or disclosures are based on the best information available at the time.
Significant judgment is required in both the assessment of likelihood and in the determination of a range of potential losses.
Historically, there have been no material changes in our estimates or assumptions.
We do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood there will be a material change in the future estimates.
We adopted ASU 2014-09 in the first quarter of our fiscal 2019 using the full retrospective method which required us to adjust each prior reporting period presented.
Under the new standard, we recognize revenue when control of the license is transferred to the customer, rather than at the date payments become due and payable when there are extended payment terms, or ratably over the term of the contract as required under the previous standard.
In addition, revenue attributable to a software license renewal is recognized at the beginning of the applicable renewal period rather than at the signing of the renewal agreement as required under the previous standard.
Additionally, under the new standard, when we enter into noncancellable contracts that provide unconditional rights to payment from our customers for services we have not yet completed or services we will provide in the near future, we present receivables — our unconditional rights to payments — and deferred revenues on a gross basis, rather than on a net basis.
Finally, under the new standard we capitalize and amortize contract acquisition costs such as commissions paid for SaaS cloud services contracts in excess of one year.
Following the adoption of ASU 2014-09, the revenue recognition for our other sales arrangements remained materially consistent with our historical practice.
Upon adoption of ASU 2014-09, we applied the standard’s practical expedients that permit the omission of prior-period information about our performance obligations.
See Note 1 to the accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements for further discussion on the impact of the standard adoption on our previously reported results.
