Forward-looking statements are qualified by some or all of these risk factors.
We use analytics to help businesses automate, improve and connect decisions across their enterprise, an approach we commonly refer to as decision management.
Our predictive analytics, which includes the industry-standard FICO® Score, and our decision management systems leverage the use of big data and mathematical algorithms to predict consumer behavior and power hundreds of billions of customer decisions each year.
We also serve consumers through online services that enable people to purchase and understand their FICO® Scores, the standard measure of consumer credit risk in the U.S., and empower them to manage their financial health.
Most of our solutions address customer engagement, including customer acquisition, customer onboarding, customer servicing and management, and customer protection.
We also help businesses improve noncustomer decisions such as transaction and claims processing.
Our solutions enable users to make decisions that are more precise, consistent and agile, and that systematically advance business goals.
We derive a significant portion of our revenues from clients outside the U.S. International revenues accounted for 33% and 34% of total consolidated revenues for the quarters ended June 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively, and 33% and 35% of total consolidated revenues for the nine months ended June 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively.

Arrangements with transactional or unit-based pricing accounted for 75% and 72% of our revenues during the quarters ended June 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively.
Arrangements with transactional or unit-based pricing accounted for 75% and 71% of our revenues during the nine months ended June 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively.
We continue to drive growth in our Scores segment.
Scores revenue increased 32% to $92.1 million during the quarter ended June 30, 2018 from $69.5 million during the quarter ended June 30, 2017, and 29% to $249.9 million during the nine months ended June 30, 2018 from $194.3 million during the nine months ended June 30, 2017.
Scores operating income increased 36% to $75.7 million during the quarter ended June 30, 2018 from $55.5 million during the quarter ended June 30, 2017, and 32% to $201.3 million during the nine months ended June 30, 2018 from $152.5 million during the nine months ended June 30, 2017.
During the quarter ended June 30, 2018, cloud revenues accounted for $58.1 million, or 35% of non-Scores revenues, compared to $51.2 million, or 32% during the quarter ended June 30, 2017.
During the nine months ended June 30, 2018, cloud revenues accounted for $177.6 million, or 35% of non-Scores revenues, compared to $151.1 million, or 31% during the nine months ended June 30, 2017.
Operating income increased 17% to $48.4 million for the quarter ended June 30, 2018 from $41.4 million during the quarter ended June 30, 2017 and as a result, net earnings increased 28% to $32.4 million from $25.2 million.
Operating income increased 17% to $136.4 million for the nine months ended June 30, 2018 from $116.4 million for the nine months ended June 30, 2017, and net earnings increased 4% to $91.9 million from $88.2 million primarily due to the increase in operating income, partially offset by the income tax expense related to enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act.
We continue to enhance stockholder value by returning cash to stockholders through our stock repurchase program.
During the quarter and nine months ended June 30, 2018, we repurchased approximately 0.6 million shares at a total repurchase price of $106.9 million and 1.4 million shares at a total repurchase price of $231.5 million, respectively.
As of June 30, 2018, we had $55.1 million remaining under our then-current stock repurchase program.
Management uses bookings as an indicator of our business performance.
Bookings represent contracts signed in the current reporting period that generate current and future revenue streams.
We consider contract terms, knowledge of the marketplace and experience with our customers, among other factors, when determining the estimated value of contract bookings.
Bookings calculations have varying degrees of certainty depending on the revenue type and individual contract terms.
Our revenue types are transactional and maintenance, professional services and license.
Our estimate of bookings is as of the end of the period in which a contract is signed, and we do not update initial booking estimates in future periods for changes between estimated and actual results.
The following paragraphs discuss the key assumptions used to calculate bookings and the susceptibility of these assumptions to variability.
•Regulatory and other factors that affect the business environment in which our customers operate.
We calculate maintenance bookings directly from the terms stated in the contract.
We calculate professional services bookings as the estimated number of hours to complete a project multiplied by the rate per hour.
We estimate the number of hours based on our understanding of the project scope, conversations with customer personnel and our experience in estimating professional services projects.
These differences typically result from customer decisions to alter the mix of FICO and customer services resources used to complete a project.
Licenses are sold on a perpetual or term basis and bookings generally equal the fixed amount stated in the contract.
Transactional and maintenance bookings were 43% and 39% of total bookings for the quarters ended June 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively.
Transactional and maintenance bookings were 41% and 37% of total bookings for the nine months ended June 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively.
License bookings were 12% and 18% of total bookings for the nine months ended June 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively.
Applications segment revenues increased $7.8 million primarily due to a $2.4 million increase in our Compliance solutions, a $2.1 million increase in our originations solutions, a $1.8 million increase in our customer management solutions, and a $1.4 million increase in our customer communications services.
The increases in our compliance, originations and customer management solutions were primarily attributable to an increase in transactional and license revenues.
The increase in customer communication services was primarily attributable to an increase in transactional revenue as a result of our continued growth in the mobile communication market.
Scores segment revenues increased $22.6 million due to an increase of $18.8 million in our business-to-business scores revenue and $3.8 million in our business-to-consumer services revenue.
The increase in business-to-business scores was primarily attributable to an increase in transactional scores in originations, primarily driven by a higher unit price in mortgage activities.
The increase in business-to-consumer services was primarily attributable to an increase in royalties derived from scores sold indirectly to consumers through credit reporting agencies.
During the quarters ended June 30, 2018 and 2017, revenues generated from our agreements with Experian accounted for 12% and 9%, respectively, of our total revenues, and revenues generated from our agreements with Equifax and TransUnion together accounted for 15% and 12%, respectively, of our total revenues.
Revenues from these customers included amounts recorded in our other segments.
Decision Management Software segment revenues decreased $1.9 million primarily attributable to a decrease in license revenue related to our FICO® Blaze Advisor® product.
Scores segment revenues increased $55.6 million due to an increase of $43.1 million in our business-to-business scores revenue and $12.5 million in our business-to-consumer services revenue.
The increase in business-to-business scores was primarily attributable to a $35.6 million increase in transactional scores in originations, primarily driven by a higher unit price in mortgage activities; as well as an $8.9 million increase in transactional scores in account management and prescreen, driven by higher transactional volume.
The increase in business-to-consumer services was primarily attributable to an increase in royalties derived from scores sold indirectly to consumers through credit reporting agencies.
During the nine months ended June 30, 2018 and 2017, revenues generated from our agreements with Experian accounted for 11% and 9%, respectively, of our total revenues, and revenues generated from our agreements with Equifax and TransUnion together accounted for 14% and 11%, respectively, of our total revenues.
Revenues from these customers included amounts recorded in our other segments.
Decision Management Software segment revenues decreased $8.7 million primarily attributable to a decrease in license revenue related to our FICO® Blaze Advisor®.
The increase was primarily attributable to a $3.3 million increase in facilities and infrastructure costs, driven by increased resource requirement due to expansion in our cloud infrastructure operations; a $2.7 million increase in personnel and labor costs; and a $2.0 million increase in direct materials cost.
Cost of revenues as a percentage of revenues was 30% during the quarter ended June 30, 2018, consistent with that incurred during the quarter ended June 30, 2017.
Cost of revenues expenses increased $19.3 million to $231.3 million during the nine months ended June 30, 2018 from $211.9 million during the nine months ended June 30, 2017.
The increase was primarily attributable to a $10.8 million increase in facilities and infrastructure costs and a $5.5 million increase in personnel and labor costs.
The increase in facilities and infrastructure costs was primarily attributable to increased resource requirement due to expansion in our cloud infrastructure operations.
Cost of revenues as a percentage of revenues was 31% during the nine months ended June 30, 2018, consistent with that incurred during the nine months ended June 30, 2017.
Over the next several quarters, we expect cost of revenues as a percentage of revenues will be consistent with that incurred during the quarter ended June 30, 2018.
Research and development expenses include personnel and related overhead costs incurred in the development of new products and services, including research of mathematical and statistical models and development of new versions of Applications and Decision Management Software products.
Research and development expenses increased $4.7 million to $32.5 million during the quarter ended June 30, 2018 from $27.8 million during the quarter ended June 30, 2017.
The increase was primarily attributable to an increase in labor and personnel costs as a result of our continued investment in cloud computing and SaaS, as well as other new products.
Research and development expenses as a percentage of revenues was 12% during the quarter ended June 30, 2018, consistent with that incurred during the quarter ended June 30, 2017.
Research and development expenses increased $13.4 million to $94.0 million during the nine months ended June 30, 2018 from $80.6 million during the nine months ended June 30, 2017, primarily attributable to our continued investment in cloud computing and SaaS, as well as other new products.
Research and development expenses as a percentage of revenues was 12% during the nine months ended June 30, 2018, consistent with that incurred during the nine months ended June 30, 2017.
Over the next several quarters, we expect research and development expenditures as a percentage of revenues will be consistent with that incurred during the quarter ended June 30, 2018.
Selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenues increased to 38% during the quarter ended June 30, 2018 from 37% during the quarter ended June 30, 2017.
The $14.6 million increase was primarily attributable to a $9.6 million increase in personnel and labor costs as a result of increased headcount, higher share-based compensation and incentive costs; as well as a $6.3 million increase in marketing and travel costs, primarily driven by a company-wide marketing event during the quarter ended June 30, 2018.
Selling, general and administrative expenses increased $30.5 million to $286.0 million during the nine months ended June 30, 2018 from $255.5 million during the nine months ended June 30, 2017, primarily attributable to an increase in personnel and labor costs as a result of increased headcount, higher share-based compensation and incentive costs.
Selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenues was 38% during the nine months ended June 30, 2018, consistent with that incurred during the nine months ended June 30, 2017.
Amortization of intangible assets consists of amortization expense related to intangible assets recorded in connection with acquisitions accounted for by the acquisition method of accounting.
Our finite-lived intangible assets, consisting primarily of completed technology and customer contracts and relationships, are being amortized using the straight-line method over periods ranging from four to fifteen years.
The quarter over quarter decrease in amortization expense of $1.8 million was primarily attributable to certain intangible assets associated with our HNC and Adeptra acquisitions becoming fully amortized in August and September 2017, respectively.
The year-to-date period over period decrease in amortization expense of $5.0 million was primarily attributable to certain intangible assets associated with our HNC and Adeptra acquisitions becoming fully amortized in August and September 2017, respectively.
Over the next several quarters, we expect that amortization expense will be consistent with the amortization expense we recorded during the quarter ended June 30, 2018.
There were no restructuring or acquisition-related expenses during the quarter and nine months ended June 30, 2018.
During both the quarter and nine months ended June 30, 2017, we incurred net charges totaling $4.5 million consisting of $1.7 million in facilities charges associated with vacating excess leased space in San Rafael and $2.8 million in employee separation costs due to the elimination of 79 positions throughout the Company.
Cash payment for all the facilities charges will be paid by the end of our fiscal 2020.
Cash payment for all the employee separation costs were paid before the end of the second quarter of fiscal 2018.
Interest expense includes primarily interest on the senior notes issued in May 2008, July 2010 and May 2018, as well as interest and credit facility fees on the revolving line of credit.
Our consolidated statements of income and comprehensive income include interest expense netted with interest income, which is derived primarily from the investment of funds in excess of our immediate operating requirements.
The quarter over quarter increase in interest expense of $1.6 million was primarily attributable to a higher average outstanding debt balance during the quarter ended June 30, 2018, as well as a higher average interest rate on our 2018 Senior Notes compared to that on our revolving line of credit.
Over the next several quarters, we expect net interest expense will be higher than the net interest expense incurred during the quarter ended June 30, 2018.
The effective income tax rate was 22.5% and 28.6% during the quarters ended June 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively, and 21.1% and 9.2% during the nine months ended June 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively.
The effective tax rate in any quarter can also be affected positively or negatively by adjustments that are required to be reported in the specific quarter of resolution.
We remeasured our deferred tax assets using a blended rate of 24.5% — by applying a pro-rated percentage of the number of days before and after the January 1, 2018 effective date — and recorded provisional charges for the remeasurement of the deferred tax assets of $5.6 million to our income tax expense related to long-term deferred tax assets and $4.4 million related to short-term deferred tax assets during the nine months ended June 30, 2018.
We are continuing to gather additional information to determine the final impact.
The quarter over quarter $6.9 million increase in operating income was attributable to a $28.6 million increase in segment revenues, a $4.5 million decrease in restructuring and acquisition-related cost and a $1.7 million decrease in amortization cost, partially offset by an $18.1 million increase in segment operating expenses, a $5.2 million increase in corporate expenses and a $4.6 million increase in share-based compensation cost.
At the segment level, the quarter over quarter $5.3 million increase in segment operating income was the result of a $20.2 million increase in our Scores segment operating income, partially offset by a $5.7 million increase in our Decision Management Software segment operating loss, a $5.2 million increase in corporate expense and a $4.0 million decrease in our Applications segment operating income.
The quarter over quarter $4.0 million decrease in Applications segment operating income was due to an $11.9 million increase in segment operating expenses, partially offset by a $7.9 million increase in segment revenue.
Segment operating income as a percentage of segment revenue for Applications decreased to 24% from 29% mainly due to an increase in personnel cost and an increase in facilities and infrastructure cost, both driven by increased resource requirement due to expansion in our cloud infrastructure operations, which was partially offset by an increase in sales of our higher-margin software products.
The quarter over quarter $20.2 million increase in Scores segment operating income was due to a $22.6 million increase in segment revenue, partially offset by a $2.4 million increase in segment operating expenses.
Segment operating income as a percentage of segment revenue for Scores increased to 82% from 80% mainly due to an increase in sales of our higher-margin score products.
The quarter over quarter $5.7 million increase in Decision Management Software segment operating loss was due to a $3.8 million increase in segment operating expenses and a $1.9 million decrease in segment revenue.
The year-to-date period over period increase of $20.0 million in operating income was attributable to a $73.7 million increase in segment revenues, a $5.0 million decrease in amortization cost and a $4.5 million decrease in restructuring and acquisition-related cost, partially offset by a $36.5 million increase in segment operating expenses, a $15.6 million increase in corporate expenses and an $11.1 million increase in share-based compensation cost.
At the segment level, the year-to-date period over period increase of $21.6 million in segment operating income was the result of a $48.7 million increase in our Scores segment operating income and a $4.6 million increase in our Applications segment operating income, partially offset by a $16.1 million increase in our Decision Management Software segment operating loss and a $15.6 million increase in corporate expenses.
The year-to-date period over period $4.6 million increase in Applications segment operating income was due to a $26.8 million increase in segment revenue, partially offset by a $22.2 million increase in segment operating expenses.
Segment operating income as a percentage of segment revenue for Applications was 26%, materially consistent with the nine months ended June 30, 2017.
The year-to-date period over period $48.7 million increase in Scores segment operating income was attributable to a $55.6 million increase in segment revenue, partially offset by a $6.9 million increase in segment operating expenses.
Segment operating income as a percentage of segment revenue for Scores increased to 81% from 78%, mainly due to an increase in sales of our higher-margin score products.
The year-to-date period over period $16.1 million increase in Decision Management Software segment operating loss was attributable to an $8.7 million decrease in segment revenue and a $7.4 million increase in segment operating expenses.
As of June 30, 2018, we had $119.9 million in cash and cash equivalents, which included $96.6 million held off-shore by our foreign subsidiaries.
We believe these balances, as well as available borrowings from our $400 million revolving line of credit and anticipated cash flows from operating activities, will be sufficient to fund our working and other capital requirements.
Under our current financing arrangements, we have no other significant debt obligations maturing over the next twelve months.
We may elect to use available cash and cash equivalents to fund such activities in the future.
In the event additional needs for cash arise, or if we refinance our existing debt, we may raise additional funds from a combination of sources, including the potential issuance of debt or equity securities.
Additional financing might not be available on terms favorable to us, or at all.
Our primary method for funding operations and growth has been through cash flows generated from operating activities.
Net cash provided by operating activities decreased to $163.1 million during the nine months ended June 30, 2018 from $171.4 million during the nine months ended June 30, 2017.
The $8.3 million decrease was mainly attributable to a $23.3 million decrease that resulted from timing of receipts and payments in our ordinary course of business, partially offset by an $11.1 million increase in non-cash share based compensation expense and a $3.7 million increase in net income.
Net cash used in investing activities increased to $26.7 million for the nine months ended June 30, 2018 from $15.6 million for the nine months ended June 30, 2017.
The $11.1 million increase was mainly attributable to a $9.4 million increase in purchases of property and equipment as well as a $2.5 million increase in purchases, net of proceeds from sale, of marketable securities.
Net cash used in financing activities increased to $117.8 million for the nine months ended June 30, 2018 from $102.8 million for the nine months ended June 30, 2017.
The $15.0 million increase was primarily attributable to a $150.0 million increase in payments, net of proceeds, on our revolving line of credit, a $113.2 million increase in repurchases of common stock, and a $10.6 million decrease in proceeds from issuance of treasury stock under employee stock plans, partially offset by a $269.0 million increase in proceeds, net of payments, from our senior notes.
In July 2016, our Board of Directors approved a stock repurchase program following the completion of our previous program.
This program was open-ended and authorized repurchases of shares of our common stock up to an aggregate cost of $250.0 million in the open market or in negotiated transactions.
In October 2017, our Board of Directors approved another stock repurchase program following the completion of the July 2016 program.
This program is open-ended and authorizes repurchases of shares of our common stock up to an aggregate cost of $250.0 million in the open market or in negotiated transactions.
Pursuant to the October 2017 program, we repurchased 563,196 shares of our common stock at a total repurchase price of $106.9 million during the quarter ended June 30, 2018, and pursuant to the July 2016 and October 2017 programs, we repurchased 1,359,117 shares of our common stock at a total repurchase price of $231.5 million during the nine months ended June 30, 2018.
We had $55.1 million remaining under the October 2017 authorization as of June 30, 2018.
The new program is open-ended and authorizes repurchases of shares of our common stock up to an aggregate cost of $250.0 million in the open market or in negotiated transactions.
On May 7, 2008, we issued $275 million of senior notes in a private placement to a group of institutional investors (the “2008 Senior Notes”).
On July 14, 2010, we issued $245 million of senior notes in a private placement to a group of institutional investors (the “2010 Senior Notes”).
The 2010 Senior Notes require interest payments semi-annually and contain certain restrictive covenants, including the maintenance of a maximum consolidated net debt to consolidated EBITDA ratio of 3.00 and a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio of 2.50.
On May 8, 2018, we issued $400 million of senior notes in a private offering to qualified institutional investors (the “2018 Senior Notes”, and with the 2008 Senior Notes and the 2010 Senior Notes, the “Senior Notes”).
The purchase agreements for the 2008 and 2010 Senior Notes and the indenture for the 2018 Senior Notes contain certain covenants typical of unsecured obligations.
As of June 30, 2018, the carrying value of the Senior Notes was $506.7 million and we were in compliance with all financial covenants under these obligations.
We prepare our consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.
Software license fee revenue is recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, software is made available to our customers, the fee is fixed or determinable and collection is probable.
The determination of whether fees are fixed or determinable and collection is probable involves the use of assumptions.
If at the outset of an arrangement we determine that the arrangement fee is not fixed or determinable, revenue is deferred until the arrangement fee becomes fixed or determinable, assuming all other revenue recognition criteria have been met.
If at the outset of an arrangement we determine that collectability is not probable, revenue is deferred until the earlier of when collectability becomes probable or the receipt of payment.
If there is uncertainty as to the customer’s acceptance of our deliverables, revenue is not recognized until the earlier of receipt of customer acceptance, expiration of the acceptance period, or when we can demonstrate we meet the acceptance criteria.
We evaluate contract terms and customer information to ensure that these criteria are met prior to our recognition of license fee revenue.
Revenues from post-contract customer support services, such as software maintenance, are recognized on a straight-line basis over the term of the support period.
The majority of our software maintenance agreements provide technical support as well as unspecified software product upgrades and releases when and if made available by us during the term of the support period.
Transactional-based revenue is recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, fees are fixed or determinable, and collection is probable.
Revenues from our credit scoring, data processing, data management and SaaS subscription services are recognized as these services are performed.
Revenues from transactional or unit-based license fees under software license arrangements, credit scoring, data processing, data management and SaaS subscription services agreements are recognized based on minimum contractual amounts or on system usage that exceeds minimum contractual amounts.
Certain of our transactional-based revenues are based on transaction or active account volumes as reported by our clients.
We provide consulting, training, model development and software integration services under both hourly-based time and materials and fixed-priced contracts.
Revenues from these services are generally recognized as the services are performed.
In such instances, management is required to estimate the total estimated hours of the project.
Adjustments to estimates are made in the period in which the facts requiring such revisions become known and, accordingly, recognized revenues and profits are subject to revisions as the contract progresses to completion.
Estimated losses, if any, are recorded in the period in which current estimates of total contract revenue and contract costs indicate a loss.
If substantive uncertainty related to customer acceptance of services exists, we defer the associated revenue until the contract is completed.
In arrangements where the professional services do not qualify for separate accounting from the license element, the combined software license and professional services revenue are recognized based on contract accounting using either the percentage-of-completion or completed-contract method.
If a deliverable does not have standalone value because the aforementioned criteria are not met, we combine it with the other applicable undelivered item(s) within the arrangement and account for the multiple deliverables as one combined unit of accounting.
For example, for hosting arrangements requiring a highly specialized and unique set of initial implementation and setup services prior to the commencement of hosting services, we typically conclude that these implementation or setup services do not have value to the customer on a stand-alone basis; therefore, we combine them with the hosting services as a combined unit of accounting.
Revenue is recognized upon commencement of our hosting services over the expected life of the customer relationship.
Gross vs. Net Revenue Reporting
We apply accounting guidance to determine whether we report revenue for certain transactions based upon the gross amount billed to the customer, or the net amount retained by us.
In accordance with the guidance we record revenue on a gross basis for sales in which we have acted as the principal and on a net basis for those sales in which we have in substance acted as an agent or broker in the transaction.
Accounting for our acquisitions requires us to recognize, separately from goodwill, the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed at their acquisition-date fair values.
Goodwill as of the acquisition date is measured as the excess of consideration transferred and the net of the acquisition-date fair values of the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed.
As a result, during the measurement period, which may be up to one year from the acquisition date, we record adjustments to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed with the corresponding offset to goodwill.
In addition, uncertain tax positions and tax-related valuation allowances assumed in connection with a business combination are initially estimated as of the acquisition date.
We reevaluate these items quarterly based upon facts and circumstances that existed as of the acquisition date with any adjustments to our preliminary estimates being recorded to goodwill provided that we are within the measurement period.
We do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood there will be a material change in the future estimates.
For fiscal 2017, we elected to proceed directly to the step one quantitative analysis for all of our reporting units, as three years had elapsed since the date of our previous quantitative valuation.
There was a substantial excess of fair value over carrying value for each of our reporting units and we determined goodwill was not impaired for any of our reporting units for fiscal 2017.
If such tests indicate impairment, then we measure and record the impairment as the difference between the carrying value of the asset and the fair value of the asset.
Significant management judgment is required in forecasting future operating results used in the preparation of the projected cash flows.
We review the estimated remaining useful lives of our acquired intangible assets at each reporting period.
A reduction in our estimate of remaining useful lives, if any, could result in increased annual amortization expense in future periods.
We measure stock-based compensation cost at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and recognize it as expense, net of estimated forfeitures, over the vesting or service period, as applicable, of the stock award (generally three to four years).
We use the Black-Scholes valuation model to determine the fair value of our stock options and the Monte Carlo valuation model to determine the fair value of our market share units.
Our valuation models and generally accepted valuation techniques require us to make assumptions and to apply judgment to determine the fair value of our awards.
Historically, there have been no material changes in our estimates or assumptions.
We do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood there will be a material change in the future estimates or assumptions.
We recognize and measure benefits for uncertain tax positions using a two-step approach.
The first step is to evaluate the tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return by determining if the technical merits of the tax position indicate it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained upon audit, including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes.
Significant judgment is required to evaluate uncertain tax positions and they are evaluated on a quarterly basis.
A description of our accounting policies associated with tax-related contingencies and valuation allowances assumed as part of a business combination is provided under “Business Combinations” above.
We are subject to various proceedings, lawsuits and claims relating to products and services, technology, labor, stockholder and other matters.
Significant judgment is required in both the assessment of likelihood and in the determination of a range of potential losses.
Historically, there have been no material changes in our estimates or assumptions.
We do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood there will be a material change in the future estimates.
ASU 2014-09 requires an entity to recognize the amount of revenue to which it expects to be entitled for the transfer of promised goods or services to customers.
ASU 2014-09 will replace most existing revenue recognition guidance in U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles when it becomes effective and permits the use of either the retrospective or cumulative effect transition method.
2016-08, “Principal versus Agent Considerations (Reporting Revenue versus Net)”, which clarifies the implementation guidance on principal versus agent considerations in the new revenue recognition standard.
2016-10, “Identifying Performance Obligations and Licensing”, which reduces the complexity when applying the guidance for identifying performance obligations and improves the operability and understandability of the license implementation guidance.
In May 2016, the FASB issued ASU No.
2016-12 “Narrow-Scope Improvements and Practical Expedients”, which amends the guidance on transition, collectability, noncash consideration and the presentation of sales and other similar taxes.
2016-20, “Technical Corrections and Improvements to Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers”, which makes minor corrections or minor improvements to the Codification that are not expected to have a significant effect on current accounting practice or create a significant administrative cost to most entities.
The amendments are intended to address implementation issues that were raised by stakeholders and provide additional practical expedients to reduce the cost and complexity of applying the new revenue standard.
Preliminarily, we plan to adopt Topic 606 in the first quarter of our fiscal 2019 using the retrospective transition method, and are continuing to evaluate the impact our pending adoption of Topic 606 will have on our consolidated financial statements.
