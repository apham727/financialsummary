In these condensed consolidated financial statements, Fair Isaac Corporation is referred to as “FICO,” “we,” “us,” “our,” or “the Company.”
We have prepared the accompanying unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial statements in accordance with the instructions to Form 10-Q and the applicable accounting guidance.
Consequently, we have not necessarily included in this Form 10-Q all information and footnotes required for audited financial statements.
In our opinion, the accompanying unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial statements in this Form 10-Q reflect all adjustments (consisting only of normal recurring adjustments, except as otherwise indicated) necessary for a fair presentation of our financial position and results of operations.
These unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements and notes thereto should be read in conjunction with our audited consolidated financial statements and notes thereto presented in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended September 30, 2017.
The interim financial information contained in this report is not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for any other interim period or for the entire fiscal year.
The condensed consolidated financial statements include the accounts of FICO and its subsidiaries.
For example, we use estimates in determining the collectibility of accounts receivable; the appropriate levels of various accruals; labor hours in connection with fixed-fee service contracts; the amount of our tax provision and the realizability of deferred tax assets.
We also use estimates in determining the remaining economic lives and carrying values of acquired intangible assets, property and equipment, and other long-lived assets.
In addition, we use assumptions to estimate the fair value of reporting units and share-based compensation.
Actual results may differ from our estimates.
In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued ASU No.
ASU 2014-09 requires an entity to recognize the amount of revenue to which it expects to be entitled for the transfer of promised goods or services to customers.
ASU 2014-09 will replace most existing revenue recognition guidance in U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles when it becomes effective and permits the use of either the retrospective or cumulative effect transition method.
The guidance also requires additional disclosure about the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from customer contracts.
2016-08, “Principal versus Agent Considerations (Reporting Revenue versus Net)” (“ASU 2016-08”), which clarifies the implementation guidance on principal versus agent considerations in the new revenue recognition standard.
2016-10, “Identifying Performance Obligations and Licensing” (“ASU 2016-10”), which reduces the complexity when applying the guidance for identifying performance obligations and improves the operability and understandability of the license implementation guidance.
In May 2016, the FASB issued ASU No.
2016-12 “Narrow-Scope Improvements and Practical Expedients” (“ASU 2016-12”), which amends the guidance on transition, collectability, noncash consideration and the presentation of sales and other similar taxes.
In December 2016, the FASB further issued ASU 2016-20, “Technical Corrections and Improvements to Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers” (“ASU 2016-20”), which makes minor corrections or minor improvements to the Codification that are not expected to have a significant effect on current accounting practice or create a significant administrative cost to most entities.
The amendments are intended to address implementation issues that were raised by stakeholders and provide additional practical expedients to reduce the cost and complexity of applying the new revenue standard.
This cross-functional implementation team has developed a project plan, which includes evaluating customer contracts across the organization, developing policies, processes and tools to report financial results, and implementing and evaluating our internal controls over financial reporting that will be necessary under the new standard.
We currently plan to adopt Topic 606 in the first quarter of our fiscal 2019 using the retrospective transition method.
Our ability to adopt Topic 606 using the full retrospective method is dependent on system readiness, and the completion of our analysis of information necessary to restate prior period financial statements.
As we continue to assess the new standard along with industry trends and additional interpretive guidance, we may adjust our implementation plan accordingly.
•Timing of revenue recognition of license revenue on term licenses and transactional revenue on guaranteed minimum fees related to our on-premises software products.
•Accounting for commissions under the new standard will result in the deferral of incremental commission costs for obtaining contracts.
We do not currently expect Topic 606 to have a significant effect on the timing of revenue recognition for our maintenance or professional services revenues, or SaaS contracts.
2016-02, “Leases (Topic 842)” (“ASU 2016-02”), which requires lessees to put most leases on their balance sheets but recognize the expenses on their income statements in a manner similar to current practice.
ASU 2016-02 states that a lessee would recognize a lease liability for the obligation to make lease payments and a right-to-use asset for the right to use the underlying asset for the lease term.
We are currently evaluating the timing of our adoption and the impact that the updated standard will have on our consolidated financial statements.
Fair value is defined as the price that would be received from the sale of an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date.
The accounting guidance establishes a three-level hierarchy for disclosure that is based on the extent and level of judgment used to estimate the fair value of assets and liabilities.
For the fair value of our derivative instruments and senior notes, see Note 3 and Note 7, respectively.
We use derivative instruments to manage risks caused by fluctuations in foreign exchange rates.
The primary objective of our derivative instruments is to protect the value of foreign-currency-denominated receivable and cash balances from the effects of volatility in foreign exchange rates that might occur prior to conversion to their respective functional currencies.
We principally utilize foreign currency forward contracts, which enable us to buy and sell foreign currencies in the future at fixed exchange rates and economically offset changes in foreign exchange rates.
We routinely enter into contracts to offset exposures denominated in the British pound and Euro.
Foreign-currency-denominated receivable and cash balances are remeasured at foreign exchange rates in effect on the balance sheet date with the effects of changes in foreign exchange rates reported in other income (expense), net.
The forward contracts are not designated as hedges and are marked to market through other income (expense), net.
Fair value changes in the forward contracts help mitigate the changes in the value of the remeasured receivable and cash balances attributable to changes in foreign exchange rates.
The foreign currency forward contracts were entered into on December 31, 2017 and September 30, 2017, respectively; therefore, their fair value was $0 on each of these dates.
Cost of revenues reflects our amortization of completed technology and selling, general and administrative expenses reflects our amortization of other intangible assets.
Intangible assets, gross were $112.1 million and $114.5 million as of December 31, 2017 and September 30, 2017, respectively.
On November 17, 2017, we amended our credit agreement with a syndicate of banks, increasing our borrowing capacity under the unsecured revolving line of credit to $600 million.
Proceeds from the credit facility can be used for working capital and general corporate purposes and may also be used for the refinancing of existing debt, acquisitions and the repurchase of our common stock.
The applicable margin for base rate borrowings ranges from 0% to 0.875% and for LIBOR borrowings ranges from 1.000% to 1.875%, and is determined based on our consolidated leverage ratio.
In addition, we must pay credit facility fees.
The credit facility contains certain restrictive covenants including maintaining a minimum fixed charge ratio of 2.5 and a maximum consolidated leverage ratio of 3.0, subject to a step up to 3.5 following certain permitted acquisitions.
The credit agreement also contains other covenants typical of unsecured facilities.
As of December 31, 2017, we had $420.0 million in borrowings outstanding at a weighted average interest rate of 2.655%, of which $350.0 million was classified as a long-term liability and recorded in long-term debt within the accompanying condensed consolidated balance sheets.
We were in compliance with all financial covenants under this credit facility as of December 31, 2017.
On May 7, 2008, we issued $275 million of senior notes in a private placement to a group of institutional investors (the “2008 Senior Notes”).
The Senior Notes require interest payments semi-annually and contain certain restrictive covenants, including the maintenance of consolidated net debt to consolidated EBITDA ratio and a fixed charge coverage ratio.
The purchase agreements for the Senior Notes also contain certain covenants typical of unsecured facilities.
As of December 31, 2017, we were in compliance with all financial covenants.
We measure the fair value of the Senior Notes based on Level 2 inputs, which include quoted market prices and interest rate spreads of similar securities.
The following table summarizes our restructuring accruals related to facility closures and employee separation charges.
The current portion and non-current portion is recorded in other accrued current liabilities and other long-term liabilities, respectively, within the accompanying condensed consolidated balance sheets.
The balance for all the facilities charges will be paid by the end of fiscal 2020.
The balance for all the employee separation costs will be paid by the end of the second quarter of fiscal 2018.
The effective income tax rate was 19.6% and (32.3)% during the quarters ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively.
The effective tax rate in any quarter can also be affected positively or negatively by adjustments that are required to be reported in the specific quarter of resolution.
The effective tax rate for the three months ended December 31, 2017 was significantly impacted by recording the impact of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the “Tax Act”), enacted on December 22, 2017 by the U.S. government.
The Tax Act reduces the federal corporate tax rate to 21.0% effective January 1, 2018.
In accordance with Section 15 of the Internal Revenue Code, we will utilize a blended rate of 24.5% for our fiscal 2018 tax year, by applying a prorated percentage of the number of days prior to and subsequent to the January 1, 2018 effective date.
We recorded provisional charges for the re-measurement of the deferred tax assets of $5.6 million to our income tax expense related to long-term deferred tax assets and $1.3 million related to short-term deferred tax assets during the quarter ended December 31, 2017.
On December 22, 2017, the SEC issued Staff Accounting Bulletin (“SAB 118”), which provides guidance on accounting for tax effects of the Tax Act.
SAB 118 provides a measurement period that should not extend beyond one year from the Tax Act enactment date for companies to complete the accounting under ASC 740.
In accordance with SAB 118, a company must reflect the income tax effects of those aspects of the Act for which the accounting under ASC 740 is complete.
To the extent that a company’s accounting for certain income tax effects of the Tax Act is incomplete but it is able to determine a reasonable estimate, it must record a provisional estimate to be included in the financial statements.
If a company cannot determine a provisional estimate to be included in the financial statements, it should continue to apply ASC 740 on the basis of the provision of the tax laws that were in effect immediately before the enactment of the Tax Act.
We are continuing to gather additional information to determine the final impact.
The total unrecognized tax benefit for uncertain tax positions is estimated to be approximately $6.1 million and $6.5 million at December 31, 2017 and September 30, 2017, respectively.
We have accrued interest of $0.4 million related to unrecognized tax benefits as of December 31, 2017 and September 30, 2017.
We maintain the 2012 Long-Term Incentive Plan (the “2012 Plan”) under which we grant equity awards, including stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock awards, stock unit awards and other stock-based awards.
All employees, consultants and advisors of FICO or any subsidiary, as well as all non-employee directors are eligible to receive awards under the 2012 Plan.
We also have awards currently outstanding under the 1992 Long-term Incentive Plan, which was adopted in February 1992 and expired in February 2012.
Stock option awards have a maximum term of seven years.
In general, stock option awards and restricted stock unit awards not subject to market or performance conditions vest annually over four years.
Restricted stock unit awards subject to market or performance conditions vest annually over three years based on the achievement of specified criteria.
We exclude the options to purchase shares of common stock in the computation of the diluted EPS where the exercise price of the options exceeds the average market price of our common stock as their inclusion would be antidilutive.
There were 3,000 options excluded for the quarter ended December 31, 2017.
We are organized into the following three operating segments, each of which is a reportable segment, to align with internal management of our worldwide business operations based on product offerings.
This segment includes pre-configured decision management applications designed for a specific type of business problem or process — such as marketing, account origination, customer management, fraud, collections and insurance claims management — as well as associated professional services.
These applications are available to our customers as on-premises software, and many are available as hosted, software-as-a-service (“SaaS”) applications through the FICO® Analytic Cloud.
Our Chief Executive Officer evaluates segment financial performance based on segment revenues and segment operating income.
Segment operating expenses consist of direct and indirect costs principally related to personnel, facilities, consulting, travel and depreciation.
Indirect costs are allocated to the segments generally based on relative segment revenues, fixed rates established by management based upon estimated expense contribution levels and other assumptions that management considers reasonable.
These income and expense items are not allocated because they are not considered in evaluating the segment’s operating performance.
Our Chief Executive Officer does not evaluate the financial performance of each segment based on its respective assets, nor capital expenditures where depreciation amounts are allocated to the segments from their internal cost centers as described above.
We are in disputes with certain customers regarding amounts owed in connection with the sale of certain of our products and services.
We also have had claims asserted by former employees relating to compensation and other employment matters.
We record litigation accruals for legal matters which are both probable and estimable.
For legal proceedings for which there is a reasonable possibility of loss (meaning those losses for which the likelihood is more than remote but less than probable), we have determined we do not have material exposure on an aggregate basis.
We continue to expand the pursuit of our business objective to become a leader in helping businesses automate and improve decisions across their enterprises, an approach that we commonly refer to as Decision Management, or “DM.” Our DM strategy is designed to enable us to increase our business by selling multiple products to clients, as well as to enable the development of custom client solutions that may lead to opportunities to develop new proprietary scores or other new proprietary products.
Our DM strategy is also increasingly focused on the delivery of our products through cloud-based deployments.
The market may be unreceptive to our general DM business approach, including being unreceptive to purchasing multiple products from us, unreceptive to our customized solutions, or unreceptive to our cloud-based offerings.
We derive a substantial portion of our revenues from a small number of products and services, and if the market does not continue to accept these products and services, our revenues will decline.
•inability to successfully sell our products in new vertical markets.
We expect that part of the growth that we seek to achieve through our DM strategy will be derived from the sale of DM products and service solutions in industries and markets we do not currently serve.
We also expect to grow our business by delivering our DM solutions through additional distribution channels.
Our growth and the success of our DM strategy depend upon our ability to develop and sell new products or suites of products, including the development and sale of our cloud-based product offerings.
In the past, we have experienced delays while developing and introducing new products and product enhancements, primarily due to difficulties developing models, acquiring data, and adapting to particular operating environments or certain client or other systems.
We have also experienced errors or “bugs” in our software products, despite testing prior to release of the products.
We rely on relatively few customers, as well as our contracts with the three major credit reporting agencies, for a significant portion of our revenues and profits.
Many of our customers are significantly larger than we are and may have greater bargaining power.
The businesses of our largest customers depend, in large part, on favorable macroeconomic conditions.
Most of our customers are relatively large enterprises, such as banks, credit card processors, insurance companies, healthcare firms, telecommunications providers, retailers and public agencies.
As a result, many of our customers and potential customers are significantly larger than we are and may have sufficient bargaining power to demand reduced prices and favorable nonstandard terms.
In addition, the U.S. and other key international economies have experienced in the past a downturn in which economic activity was impacted by falling demand for a variety of goods and services, restricted credit, poor liquidity, reduced corporate profitability, volatility in credit, equity and foreign exchange markets, bankruptcies and overall uncertainty with respect to the economy.
The European Union (“E.U.”) continues to face great economic uncertainty which could impact the overall world economy or various other regional economies.
The potential for economic disruption presents considerable risks to our business, including potential bankruptcies or credit deterioration of financial institutions with which we have substantial relationships.
We also derive a substantial portion of our revenues and operating income from our contracts with the three major credit reporting agencies, Experian, TransUnion and Equifax, and other parties that distribute our products to certain markets.
The loss of or a significant change in a relationship with one of these credit reporting agencies with respect to their distribution of our products or with respect to our myFICO® offerings, the loss of or a significant change in a relationship with a major customer, the loss of or a significant change in a relationship with a significant third-party distributor (including credit card processors), or the delay of significant revenues from these sources, could have a material adverse effect on our revenues and results of operations.
We rely on relationships with third parties for marketing, distribution and certain services.
If we experience difficulties in these relationships, our future revenues may be adversely affected.
Most of our products rely on distributors, and we intend to continue to market and distribute our products through existing and future distributor relationships.
Our Scores segment relies on, among others, Experian, TransUnion and Equifax.
In addition, certain of our distributors presently compete with us and may compete with us in the future, either by developing competitive products themselves or by distributing competitive offerings.
For example, Experian, TransUnion and Equifax have developed a credit scoring product to compete directly with our products and are collectively attempting to sell the product.
Competition from distributors or other sales and marketing partners could significantly harm sales of our products and services.
•we may experience additional or unexpected changes in how we are required to account for our acquisitions pursuant to U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, including arrangements we assume from an acquisition.
Acquisitions of businesses having a significant presence outside the U.S. will increase our exposure to the risks of conducting operations in international markets.
•charges to our operating results resulting from expenses incurred to effect the acquisition.
Substantially all of these costs will be accounted for as expenses that will decrease our net income and earnings per share for the periods in which those costs are incurred.
Charges to our operating results in any given period could differ substantially from other periods based on the timing and size of our future acquisitions and the extent of integration activities.
As part of our management approach, we implemented an ongoing reengineering initiative designed to grow revenues through strategic resource allocation and improve profitability through cost reductions.
•timing of orders for and deliveries of software systems.
Our products have long and variable sales cycles.
Large portions of our customer agreements are consummated in the weeks immediately preceding quarter end.
Before these agreements are consummated, we create and rely on forecasted revenues for planning, modeling and earnings guidance.
Any publicly-stated revenue or earnings projections are subject to this risk.
The failure to recruit and retain additional qualified personnel could hinder our ability to successfully manage our business.
The failure to obtain certain forms of model construction data from our customers or others could harm our business.
Our business requires that we develop or obtain a reliable source of sufficient amounts of current and statistically relevant data to analyze transactions and update our products.
In most cases, these data must be periodically updated and refreshed to enable our products to continue to work effectively in a changing environment.
We do not own or control much of the data that we require, most of which is collected privately and maintained in proprietary databases.
Customers and key business alliances provide us with the data we require to analyze transactions, report results and build new models.
Our DM strategy depends in part upon our ability to access new forms of data to develop custom and proprietary analytic tools.
We will continue to rely upon proprietary technology rights, and if we are unable to protect them, our business could be harmed.
This protection of our proprietary technology is limited, and our proprietary technology could be used by others without our consent.
In addition, patents may not be issued with respect to our pending or future patent applications, and our patents may not be upheld as valid or may not prevent the development of competitive products.
Some of our technologies were developed under research projects conducted under agreements with various U.S. government agencies or subcontractors.
Under these contracts with the U.S. government, the results of research may be made public by the government, limiting our competitive advantage with respect to future products based on our research.
Our business requires the storage, transmission and utilization of sensitive consumer and customer information.
Many of our products are provided by us through the Internet.
Security breaches could expose us to a risk of loss, the unauthorized disclosure of consumer or customer information, litigation, indemnity obligations and other liability.
Because the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access, or to sabotage systems, change frequently and generally are not recognized until launched against a target, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventative measures.
Malicious third parties may also conduct attacks designed to temporarily deny customers access to our services.
Security compromises experienced by our competitors, by our distributors, by our customers or by us may lead to public disclosures, which may lead to widespread negative publicity.
Protection from system interruptions is important to our business.
If we experience system interruptions, it could harm our business.
These interruptions can include software or hardware malfunctions, communication failures, outages or other failures of third party environments or service providers, fires, floods, earthquakes, power losses, equipment failures and other events beyond our control.
Our ability to increase our revenues will depend to some extent upon introducing new products and services.
If the marketplace does not accept these new products and services, our revenues may decline.
We have a significant share of the available market in portions of our Scores segment and for certain services in our Applications segment, specifically, the markets for account management services at credit card processors and credit card fraud detection software.
We believe much of the future growth of our business and the success of our DM strategy will rest on our ability to continue to expand into newer markets for our products and services.
Such areas are relatively new to our product development and sales and marketing personnel.
Products that we plan to market in the future are in various stages of development.
We cannot assure you that the marketplace will accept these products.
•influence and respond to emerging industry standards and other technological changes.
•cloud-based customer engagement and risk management solutions providers.
For example, certain of our fraud solutions products compete against other methods of preventing credit card fraud, such as credit cards that contain the cardholder’s photograph; smart cards; cardholder verification and authentication solutions; biometric measures on devices including fingerprint and face matching; and other card authorization techniques and user verification techniques.
Many of our anticipated competitors have greater financial, technical, marketing, professional services and other resources than we do, and industry consolidation is creating even larger competitors in many of our markets.
They may also be able to devote greater resources than we can to develop, promote and sell their products.
Many of these companies have extensive customer relationships, including relationships with many of our current and potential customers.
Furthermore, new competitors or alliances among competitors may emerge and rapidly gain significant market share.
For example, Experian, TransUnion and Equifax have formed an alliance that has developed a credit scoring product competitive with our products.
Our competitors may be able to sell products competitive to ours at lower prices individually or as part of integrated suites of several related products.
New legislation or regulations, or changes to existing laws and regulations, may also negatively impact our business and increase our costs of doing business.
•Use of data by creditors and consumer reporting agencies (e.g., the U.S. Fair Credit Reporting Act);
•Laws and regulations that limit the use of credit scoring models (e.g., state “mortgage trigger” or “inquiries” laws, state insurance restrictions on the use of credit-based insurance scores, and the E.U.
•Fair lending laws (e.g., the U.S.
•Privacy and security laws and regulations that limit the use and disclosure of personally identifiable information, require security procedures, or otherwise apply to the collection, processing, storage, use and transmission of protected data (e.g., the U.S. Financial Services Modernization Act of 1999, also known as the Gramm Leach Bliley Act; the E.U.
Data Protection Directive and the country-specific regulations that implement that directive; the U.S. Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act; the Cybersecurity Act of 2015; the U.S. Department of Commerce’s National Institute of Standards and Technology’s Cybersecurity Framework; and identity theft, file freezing, security breach notification and similar state privacy laws);
•Regulations and guidelines applicable to secondary market participants (e.g., Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac) that could have an impact on our products;
•Laws and regulations applicable to our customer communication clients and their use of our products and services (e.g., the Telemarketing Sales Rule, Telephone Consumer Protection Act and regulations promulgated thereunder);
•The application or extension of consumer protection laws, including implementing regulations (e.g., the Consumer Financial Protection Act, the Federal Trade Commission Act, the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act, the Servicemembers Civil Relief Act, the Military Lending Act, and the Credit Repair Organizations Act);
•Anti-bribery and corruption laws and regulations (e.g., the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act);
•Financial regulatory standards (e.g., Sarbanes-Oxley Act requirements to maintain and verify internal process controls, including controls for material event awareness and notification);
•Regulatory requirements for managing third parties (e.g., vendors, contractors, suppliers and distributors);
•Anti-money laundering laws and regulations (e.g., the Bank Secrecy Act and the USA Patriot Act);
•Laws and regulations regarding export controls as they apply to FICO products delivered in non-U.S. countries.
The laws and regulations above, and changes to them, could affect the demand for or profitability of our products, including scoring and consumer products.
New laws and regulations pertaining to our customers could cause them to pursue new strategies, reducing the demand for our products.
Our revenues depend, to a great extent, upon conditions in the banking (including consumer credit) and insurance industries.
 During fiscal 2017, 76% of our revenues were derived from sales of products and services to the banking and insurance industries.
Global economic uncertainty experienced in the U.S. and other key international economies in the past produced substantial stress, volatility, illiquidity and disruption of global credit and other financial markets, resulting in the bankruptcy or acquisition of, or government assistance to, several major domestic and international financial institutions.
The potential for disruptions presents considerable risks to our businesses and operations.
These risks include potential bankruptcies or credit deterioration of financial institutions, many of which are our customers.
Such disruption would result in a decline in the revenue we receive from financial and other institutions.
While the rate of account growth in the U.S. bankcard industry has been slow and many of our large institutional customers have consolidated in recent years, we have generated most of our revenue growth from our bankcard-related scoring and account management businesses by selling and cross-selling our products and services to large banks and other credit issuers.
As the banking industry continues to experience contraction in the number of participating institutions, we may have fewer opportunities for revenue growth due to reduced or changing demand for our products and services that support customer acquisition programs of our customers.
In addition, industry contraction could affect the base of recurring revenues derived from contracts in which we are paid on a per-transaction basis as formerly separate customers combine their operations under one contract.
While we are attempting to expand our sales of consumer credit, banking and insurance products and services into international markets, the risks are greater as these markets are also experiencing substantial disruption and we are less well-known in them.
Purchases of technology products and services and decisioning solutions are subject to adverse economic conditions.
When an economy is struggling, companies in many industries delay or reduce technology purchases, and we experience softened demand for our decisioning solutions and other products and services.
Any economic uncertainty can negatively affect the businesses and purchasing decisions of companies in the industries we serve.
The potential for disruptions presents considerable risks to our businesses and operations.
Whether or not recent or new legislative or regulatory initiatives or other efforts successfully stabilize and add liquidity to the financial markets, we may need to modify our strategies, businesses or operations, and we may incur additional costs in order to compete in a changed business environment.
•difficulties and delays in translating products and related documentation into foreign languages.
There can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully address each of these challenges in the near term.
Additionally, some of our business will be conducted in currencies other than the U.S. dollar.
Foreign currency transaction gains and losses are not currently material to our cash flows, financial position or results of operations.
However, an increase in our foreign revenues could subject us to increased foreign currency transaction risks in the future.
In addition to the risk of depending on international sales, we have risks incurred in having research and development personnel located in various international locations.
We currently have a substantial portion of our product development staff in international locations, some of which have political and developmental risks.
If such risks materialize, our business could be damaged.
These provisions include giving our board the ability to issue preferred stock and determine the rights and designations of the preferred stock at any time without stockholder approval.
The rights of the holders of our common stock will be subject to, and may be adversely affected by, the rights of the holders of any preferred stock that may be issued in the future.
The issuance of preferred stock, while providing flexibility in connection with possible acquisitions and other corporate purposes, could have the effect of making it more difficult for a third party to acquire, or discouraging a third party from acquiring, a majority of our outstanding voting stock.
We regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from such examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes.
