In March 2019, Xerox Corporation (“Xerox”) announced plans to create a new public holding company, Xerox Holdings Corporation (“Xerox Holdings”), by implementing a holding company reorganization (the “Reorganization”).
In the Reorganization, Xerox became a direct, wholly owned subsidiary of Xerox Holdings and Xerox Holdings became the successor issuer to Xerox.
Refer to Note 1 - Basis of Presentation, Corporate Reorganization, in the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding the Reorganization.
We refer to this analysis as "constant currency", “currency impact” or “the impact from currency.” This impact is calculated by translating current period activity in local currency using the comparable prior year period's currency translation rate.
This impact is calculated for all countries where the functional currency is the local country currency.
We do not hedge the translation effect of revenues or expenses denominated in currencies where the local currency is the functional currency.
Currency impact can be determined as the difference between actual growth rates and constant currency growth rates.
These declines were partially offset by the implementation of a large transactional IT sales arrangement from our XBS organization.
The decline in Equipment sales primarily reflected lower revenues from our mid-range products, which were impacted by organizational changes within the XBS sales organization, that continue to stabilize, as we transitioned a significant number of accounts from U.S. Enterprise in the first half of 2019.
Third quarter 2019 Net income attributable to Xerox Holdings increased $132 million as compared to third quarter 2018 primarily due to lower non-service retirement-related costs and Income tax expense as well as higher Equity in net income of unconsolidated affiliates.
Net income attributable to Xerox Holdings for the nine months ended September 30, 2019 increased $311 million as compared to the prior year period primarily due to higher Equity in net income of unconsolidated affiliates as well as lower Income tax expense and non-service retirement-related costs.
These benefits were partially offset by higher Restructuring and related costs.
Adjusted1 net income attributable to Xerox Holdings for the nine months ended September 30, 2019 increased $87 million as compared to the prior year period.
Cash flows provided by operating activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2019 were $895 million, as compared to $725 million in the prior year period primarily reflecting lower working capital2, increased dividends from equity investments, and lower cash payments for Transaction and related costs, net.
These benefits were partially offset by higher payments for restructuring related costs as well as taxes.
Cash used in investing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2019 was $68 million including capital expenditures of $48 million and acquisitions of $42 million partially offset by proceeds from the sale of non-core assets.
This impact gradually mitigated during the latter part of the second quarter and was much less of an impact in the third quarter.
We expect total revenues to decline approximately 7.9% in 2019, including an approximate 1.5-percentage point unfavorable impact from currency.
Additionally, we continue to expect share repurchases of at least $600 million and dividend payments to shareholders of $250 million in 2019 and we increased our expectations for full year 2019 cash flows from operations to be between $1,175 million and $1,275 million, up from between $1,150 million to $1,250 million, and decreased our expectations for capital expenditures to $75 million, down from $150 million.
During second quarter 2019, we entered into an arrangement to expand our existing sourcing relationship with HP Inc. (HP).
As part of the new arrangement, we will start sourcing certain A4 and entry-level A3 products from HP to diversify our supply chain.
Many of these devices will operate with our ConnectKey software, a key differentiator in the marketplace.
In addition, we will provide toner for both our printers included in this agreement and certain HP printers, which will allow us to add volume to our emulsion aggregation (EA) toner plant in Webster, NY.
Further, as part of our growth strategy to increase our penetration of the small-to-medium size business (SMB) market, Xerox will also become a Device as a Service (DaaS) partner for HP in the US.
We will be able to sell HP PCs, displays and accessories, with or without DaaS, to our US SMB clients.
Lastly, HP will also make DocuShare Flex, Xerox's cloud-based content management platform, available on commercial PCs distributed in the U.S., giving a major lift to our software growth strategy.
Refer to Note 23 - Subsequent Event in the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding these agreements as well as in our Current Report on form 8-K filed with the SEC on November 5, 2019.

The decrease for the nine months ended September 30, 2019 as compared to the prior year period, was driven by lower sales in North America, primarily reflecting the transitional impact associated with recently implemented organizational changes in our XBS sales organization, which continued to gradually stabilize in the third quarter 2019.
The organizational changes were part of our Project Own It transformation actions and include the transitioning of accounts to implement coverage changes, consolidation of real estate locations and the reduction of management layers.
•High-end - The increase in both the three and nine months ended September 30, 2019 as compared to the respective prior year periods, reflected higher sales of color systems associated with continued demand for our Iridesse production press and installs of our Versant production systems, as well as higher sales of iGen press in the U.S. in third quarter 2019.
These increases were partially offset by continued lower sales of black-and-white systems.
Additionally, revenues for the nine months ended September 30, 2019 were impacted by lower sales from our XBS sales organization, which continued to gradually stabilize from the impact of organizational changes that were part of our Project Own It transformation actions, (including the transitioning of accounts to implement coverage changes, consolidation of real estate locations and the reduction of management layers).
Installs include activity from Xerox Services and Xerox-branded products shipped to our XBS sales unit.
Detail by product group (see Geographic Sales Channels and Product and Offerings Definitions) is shown below.
•10% increase in color multifunction devices reflecting higher installs of ConnectKey devices primarily from our indirect channels in the U.S. partially offset by lower installs from EMEA.

•6% decrease in mid-range color installs reflecting lower installs of ConnectKey devices primarily in our Americas region.
The decrease was significantly impacted by lower activity as a result of the transactional impact associated with recently implemented organizational changes in our XBS sales organization (as part of our Project Own It transformation actions), which included the transitioning of accounts to implement coverage changes, consolidation of real estate locations and the reduction of management layers.
•16% decrease in mid-range black-and-white reflecting lower installs of ConnectKey devices primarily from indirect channels in the U.S. and from EMEA.
•1% decrease in high-end color installs reflecting lower activity from iGen primarily in EMEA, partially offset by continued strong demand for our Iridesse production press and higher installs of our Versant production and inkjet cut-sheet systems.

Prices in this product group can range from approximately $2,000 to $75,000+.
Prices for these systems can range from approximately $30,000 to $1,000,000+.
Xerox Services also includes Communication and Marketing Solutions that were previously excluded from our former MDS definition.
The increase also reflected lower Other Expenses, net, partially offset by higher Transaction and related costs, net, due to a prior year credit associated with recoveries from insurance and other vendors.
The increase also reflected a $5 million favorable impact from higher costs in the prior year related to the termination of certain IT projects.
SAG as a percentage of revenue of 23.3% decreased by 1.5-percentage points as compared to third quarter 2018, primarily reflecting the benefit from productivity and restructuring associated with our Project Own It transformation actions.
SAG of $513 million decreased $70 million as compared to third quarter 2018, reflecting productivity and restructuring savings associated with our Project Own It transformation actions as well as lower compensation and incentives (consistent with lower revenues); the decrease also includes the favorable impacts of approximately $6 million from translation currency and $5 million from higher costs in the prior year associated with the termination of certain IT projects.
Bad debt expense of $13 million was $3 million higher compared to third quarter 2018 and on a trailing twelve month basis (TTM) remained at less than one percent of total receivables.
SAG as a percentage of revenue for the nine months ended September 30, 2019 of 23.6% decreased by 1.5-percentage points as compared to the prior year period, primarily reflecting the benefit from productivity and restructuring associated with our Project Own It transformation actions.
SAG for the nine months ended September 30, 2019 of $1,580 million decreased $255 million as compared to the prior year period, reflecting productivity and restructuring savings associated with our Project Own It transformation actions as well as lower compensation and incentives (consistent with lower revenues); the decrease also includes favorable impacts of approximately $28 million from translation currency and $34 million from higher costs in the prior year related to the termination of certain IT projects and the accelerated depreciation associated with the exit of a surplus real estate facility.
Bad debt expense of $38 million was $3 million higher compared to the prior year period and on a trailing twelve month basis (TTM) remained at less than one percent of total receivables.
These costs were partially offset by $23 million of net reversals, primarily resulting from changes in estimated reserves from prior period initiatives as well as $6 million in favorable adjustments from the early termination of prior period impaired leases.
The implementation of our Project Own It initiatives as well as other business transformation initiatives is expected to result in significant cost savings in 2019 and future years.
However, expected savings associated with these initiatives may be offset to some extent by business disruption during the implementation phase and until the initiatives are fully implemented and stabilized.
Restructuring and related costs were $91 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2018 and included $104 million of severance costs related to headcount reductions of approximately 1,850 employees worldwide and $13 million of lease cancellation costs partially offset by $26 million of net reversals for changes in estimated reserves from prior period initiatives.
The restructuring reserve balance as of September 30, 2019 for all programs was $57 million, which is expected to be paid over the next twelve months.
Refer to Note 12 - Restructuring Programs in the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding our restructuring programs.

The reduction resulted from net attrition (attrition net of gross hires), of which a large portion is not expected to be backfilled, as well as the impact of organizational changes including employees transferred as part of the shared services arrangement entered into with HCL Technologies earlier this year.
Third quarter non-financing interest expense of $27 million was $1 million lower than third quarter 2018.
When combined with financing interest expense (Cost of financing), total interest expense decreased by $1 million from third quarter 2018 primarily due to a lower debt balance.
When combined with financing interest expense (Cost of financing), total interest expense decreased by $6 million from the prior year period primarily due to a lower debt balance.
Refer to Note 13 - Debt in the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements, for additional information regarding the interest expense.
Non-service retirement-related costs for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2019 decreased $35 million and $62 million, respectively, as compared to the prior year periods, primarily driven by the favorable impact of a 2018 amendment to our U.S. Retiree Health Plan and lower losses from pension settlements in the U.S.
Refer to Note 16 - Employee Benefit Plans in the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements, for additional information regarding non-service retirement-related costs.

We are required to recognize all derivative instruments as either assets or liabilities at fair value in the balance sheet.
As permitted, certain of these derivative contracts have been designated for hedge accounting treatment.
Certain of our derivatives that do not qualify for hedge accounting are effective as economic hedges.
These derivative contracts are likewise required to be recognized each period at fair value and therefore do result in some level of volatility.
The related cash flow impacts of all of our derivative activities are reflected as cash flows from operating activities.
By their nature, all derivative instruments involve, to varying degrees, elements of market and credit risk.
The market risk associated with these instruments resulting from currency exchange and interest rate movements is expected to offset the market risk of the underlying transactions, assets and liabilities being hedged.
We do not believe there is significant risk of loss in the event of non-performance by the counterparties associated with these instruments because these transactions are executed with a diversified group of major financial institutions.
Further, our policy is to deal with counterparties having a minimum investment grade or better credit rating.
Credit risk is managed through the continuous monitoring of exposures to such counterparties.
We have reported our financial results in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP).
These non-GAAP financial measures should be viewed in addition to, and not as a substitute for, the Company’s reported results prepared in accordance with GAAP.
