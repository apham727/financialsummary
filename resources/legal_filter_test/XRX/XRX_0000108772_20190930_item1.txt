References to “Xerox Holdings” refer to Xerox Holdings Corporation and its consolidated subsidiaries while references to “Xerox” refer to Xerox Corporation and its consolidated subsidiaries.
References herein to “we,” “us,” “our,” the “Company” refer collectively to both Xerox Holdings and Xerox unless the context suggests otherwise.
This is a combined report of Xerox Holdings and Xerox, which includes separate unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for each registrant.
You should read these Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Xerox's 2018 Annual Report.
Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements reflect the activity for both Xerox Holdings and Xerox for all periods presented, unless otherwise noted.
On March 6, 2019, the Xerox Board of Directors approved a reorganization (the “Reorganization”) of the Company's corporate structure into a holding company structure.
The Reorganization was subject to the approval of shareholders, which was obtained at the annual shareholders meeting held May 21, 2019.
On July 31, 2019, Xerox completed the Reorganization, pursuant to which Xerox became a direct, wholly-owned subsidiary of Xerox Holdings.
The business operations, directors and executive officers of the Company did not change as a result of the Reorganization.
Each share of Xerox Holdings Series A Preferred Stock has the same designations, rights, powers and preferences, and the same qualifications, limitations and restrictions as the shares of Xerox Series B Preferred Stock, with the addition of certain voting rights.
In addition, Xerox Holdings became a guarantor of Xerox’s existing Credit Facility.
Shares of Xerox Holdings common stock trade on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol “XRX”, formerly used by Xerox.
Subsequent to the Reorganization, Xerox Holdings contributed the Xerox Series B Preferred Stock it held to Xerox in exchange for additional capital and Xerox subsequently extinguished the Series B Preferred Stock.
The contribution and extinguishment were recorded at carrying value.
In March 2019, as part of Project Own It, we entered into a shared services arrangement with HCL Technologies (HCL) pursuant to which we are outsourcing certain global administrative and support functions, including, among others, selected information technology and finance functions (excluding accounting).
The transition of these functions to HCL is expected to take up to 18 months.
HCL is expected to make certain up-front and ongoing investments in software, tools and other technology to consolidate, optimize and automate the transferred functions with the goal of providing improved service levels and significant cost savings.
The shared services arrangement with HCL includes a total aggregate spending commitment by us of approximately $1.3 billion over the next 7 years.
The spending commitment excludes restructuring and related costs we are expected to incur in connection with the transition of the contemplated functions - refer to Note 12 - Restructuring Programs for additional information.
The transfer of employees associated with the HCL arrangement in certain countries is subject to compliance with works council and other employment regulatory requirements in those countries, which may delay the transfer as well as the expected savings from the arrangement.
We incurred net charges of approximately $38 and $68 for three and nine months ended September 30, 2019, respectively, associated with this arrangement.
The cost has been allocated to the various functional expense lines in the Condensed Consolidated Income Statements based on an assessment of the nature and amount of the costs incurred for the various transferred functions prior to their transfer to HCL.
This realignment included the combination and consolidation of certain sales units to better service customers consistently across the company.
Prior year amounts were also revised as follows to conform to the 2019 presentation.
Xerox Holdings and Xerox consider the applicability and impact of all Accounting Standards Updates (ASUs) issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB).
The ASUs listed below apply to both registrants.
ASUs not listed below were assessed and determined to be not applicable to the Consolidated Financial Statements of either registrant.
In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-13, Financial Instruments Credit Losses - Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments, with additional updates and amendments being issued in 2018 and 2019.
This update requires measurement and recognition of expected credit losses for financial assets on an expected loss model rather than an incurred loss model.
The update impacts financial assets including net investment in leases that are not accounted for at fair value through Net Income.
This update is effective for our fiscal year beginning January 1, 2020.
We continue to evaluate the impact of the adoption of ASU 2016-13, which is expected to primarily impact the estimation of our Allowance for doubtful accounts for Accounts Receivables and Finance Receivables.
In August 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-15, Intangibles - Goodwill and Other - Internal Use Software (Subtopic 350-40), Customer's Accounting for Implementation Costs Incurred in a Cloud Computing Arrangement That is a Service Contract.
This update aligns the requirements for capitalizing implementation costs incurred in a hosting arrangement that is a service contract with the requirements for capitalizing implementation costs incurred to develop or obtain internal-use software (and hosting arrangements that include an internal-use software license).
The update provides criteria for determining which implementation costs to capitalize as an asset related to the service contract and which costs to expense.
The capitalized implementation costs are required to be expensed over the term of the hosting arrangement.
This update is effective for our fiscal year beginning January 1, 2020.
On January 1, 2019, we adopted ASU 2016-02, Leases (ASC Topic 842).
This update, as well as additional amendments and targeted improvements issued in 2018 and early 2019, supersedes existing lease accounting guidance found under ASC 840, Leases (“ASC 840”) and requires the recognition of right-to-use assets and lease obligations by lessees for those leases originally classified as operating leases under prior lease guidance.
Effective with the adoption, leases are classified as either finance or operating, with classification affecting the pattern of expense recognition.
The accounting for lessors does not fundamentally change with this update except for changes to conform and align guidance to the lessee guidance, as well as to the revenue recognition guidance in ASU 2014-09.
Some of these conforming changes, such as those related to the definition of lease term and minimum lease payments, resulted in certain lease arrangements, that would have been previously accounted for as operating leases, to be classified and accounted for as sales-type leases with a corresponding up-front recognition of equipment sales revenue.
We also elected the package of practical expedients not to reassess prior conclusions related to contracts containing leases, lease classification and initial direct costs and the lessee practical expedient to combine lease and non-lease components for certain asset classes (real estate lease arrangements for offices and warehouses).
We elected the package of practical expedients from both the Lessee and Lessor prospective, to the extent applicable.
Lessee accounting - the adoption of this update resulted in an increase to assets and related liabilities of approximately $385 (approximately $440 undiscounted) primarily related to leases of facilities.
this update resulted in an increase to equipment sales for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2019 of approximately $9 and $20, respectively, in 2019 as compared to the prior year periods.
Refer to Note 3 - Adoption of New Leasing Standard - Lessee and Note 4 - Adoption of New Leasing Standard - Lessor for additional transitional disclosures related to the adoption of this standard.
Operating lease ROU assets and liabilities are recognized at the commencement date based on the present value of lease payments over the lease term.
Since the implicit rate for most of our leases is not readily determinable, we use our incremental borrowing rate based on the information available at the commencement date in determining the present value of lease payments.
The incremental borrowing rate is the rate of interest that we would have to pay to borrow, on a collateralized basis, an amount equal to the lease payments, in a similar economic environment and over a similar term.
The rate is dependent on several factors, including the lease term and currency of the lease payments.
Lease terms used to calculate the present value of lease payments generally do not include any options to extend, renew, or terminate the lease, as we do not have reasonable certainty at lease inception that these options will be exercised.
We have elected the short-term lease exception, therefore operating lease ROU assets and liabilities do not include leases with a lease term of twelve months or less.
The operating lease ROU asset also excludes lease incentives.
Lease expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
We have lease agreements with lease and non-lease components.
These components are accounted for separately for vehicle and equipment leases.
We account for the lease and non-lease components as a single lease component for real estate leases of offices and warehouses.
The assessment of possible impairment is based on our ability to recover the carrying value of the asset from the expected undiscounted future pre-tax cash flows of the related operations.
We have elected to include the carrying amount of operating lease liabilities in any tested asset group and include the associated operating lease payments in the undiscounted future pre-tax cash flows.
As of September 30, 2019, we have an additional real estate operating lease that has not yet commenced.
This operating lease has an obligation and corresponding ROU asset of $23 and will commence in December 2019 with a lease term of approximately 10 years.
Represents the future minimum operating lease payments expected to be made over the remaining balance of the year.
Xerox has one finance lease for equipment and related infrastructure within an outsourced warehouse supply arrangement in the U.S.
The Right-of-use asset balance associated with this finance lease of $7 is included in Land, buildings and equipment, net in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet.
For the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, operating lease expense, net of sublease income, were $147 and $161, respectively.
The remainder of any fixed payments, as well as the variable payments, are allocated to non-lease elements because the variable consideration for incremental page volume or usage is considered attributable to the delivery of those elements.
We believe five years is representative of the period during which the equipment is expected to be economically usable, with normal service, for the purpose for which it is intended.
We perform an analysis of the stand-alone selling price of equipment based on cash selling prices during the applicable period.
The cash selling prices are compared to the range of values determined for our leases.
The range of cash selling prices must be reasonably consistent with the lease selling prices in order for us to determine that such lease prices reflects stand-alone value.
The pricing interest rates generally equal the implicit rates within the leases, as corroborated by our comparisons of cash to lease selling prices noted above.
Profit at lease commencement on sales type leases was estimated to be approximately $86 and $76 for the three months ended September 30, 2019 and 2018, respectively, and approximately $206 and $221 for the nine months ended September 30, 2019 and 2018, respectively.
Includes revenues from maintenance agreements on sold equipment as well as revenues associated with service agreements sold through our channel partners as Xerox Partner Print Services (XPPS).
Primarily includes revenues from our Managed Services offerings (formerly our Managed Document Services arrangements).
Certain prior year amounts have been revised to conform to the current year presentation.
Refer to Note 1 - Basis of Presentation - Change in Presentation, for additional information.
Primarily reflects direct sales through bundled lease arrangements.
The balance of deferred incremental direct costs net of accumulated amortization at September 30, 2019 and December 31, 2018 was $162 and $172, respectively.
This amount is expected to be amortized over its estimated period of benefit, which we currently estimate to be approximately four years.
In addition, we also provide inducements to certain customers in various forms, including contractual credits, which are capitalized and amortized as a reduction of revenue over the term of the contract.
As of September 30, 2019 and December 31, 2018 amounts deferred associated with contract fulfillment costs and inducements were $13 and $12, respectively.
The related amortization for the three months ended September 30, 2019 and 2018 was $1 and $0, respectively and $4 and $3 for the nine months ended September 30, 2019 and 2018, respectively.
Xerox is focused on increasing its Small and Mid-sized (SMB) coverage through resellers and partners (including multi-brand dealers) and continued distribution acquisitions.
The purchase prices were all cash for 100% ownership of the acquired companies and were primarily allocated to Intangible assets, net and Goodwill.
Any adjustments to the allocations are not expected to be material.
Restricted cash primarily relates to escrow cash deposits made in Brazil associated with ongoing litigation.
Restricted cash amounts are classified in our Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets based on when the cash is expected to be contractually or judicially released.
Refer to Note 5 - Revenue for additional information on contract costs.
Amounts to be invoiced in the subsequent quarter for current services provided are included in amounts accrued.
Accounts receivable sales arrangements are utilized in the normal course of business as part of our cash and liquidity management.
The accounts receivable sold are generally short-term trade receivables with payment due dates of less than 60 days.
Of the accounts receivable sold and derecognized from our balance sheet, $94 and $131 remained uncollected as of September 30, 2019 and December 31, 2018, respectively.
The activity associated with these arrangements is not reflected in this disclosure, as payments under these arrangements have not been material and these are customer directed arrangements.
Finance receivables include sales-type leases and installment loans arising from the marketing of our equipment.
These receivables are typically collateralized by a security interest in the underlying assets.
Differences upon adoption were not material.
Refer to Note 2 - Recent Accounting Pronouncements for additional information.
Finance receivables include sales-type leases, direct financing leases and installment loans arising from the marketing of our equipment.
We generally establish customer credit limits and estimate the allowance for credit losses on a country or geographic basis.
Our policy and methodology used to establish our allowance for doubtful accounts has been consistently applied over all periods presented.
Prior year amounts have also been reclassified to conform to the current year presentation.
Prior year amounts have also been reclassified to conform to the current year presentation.
Prior year amounts have been recasted to conform to the current year presentation.
Prior year amounts have also been reclassified to conform to the current year presentation.
The transfer of equipment from our inventories to equipment subject to an operating lease is presented in our Condensed Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows in the operating activities section.
Equipment on operating leases and similar arrangements consists of our equipment rented to customers and depreciated to estimated salvage value at the end of the lease term.
Differences upon adoption were not material.
Refer to Note 2 - Recent Accounting Pronouncements for additional information.
2019 amount represents the future minimum revenues expected to be earned over the remaining balance of the year.
Total contingent rentals on operating leases, consisting principally of usage charges in excess of minimum contracted amounts, were $25 and $28 for the three months ended September 30, 2019 and 2018, respectively, and $80 and $89 for the nine months ended September 30, 2019 and 2018, respectively.
In addition, the Equity in net income (loss) of Fuji Xerox for the three months ended September 30, 2019 included no after-tax restructuring and other charges, while after-tax restructuring and other charges for the three months ended September 30, 2018 was $7.
After-tax restructuring and other charges for the nine months ended September 30, 2019 and 2018 were $19 and $90, respectively.
These costs were partially offset by $23 of net reversals, primarily resulting from changes in estimated reserves from prior period initiatives as well as $6 in favorable adjustments from the early termination of prior period impaired leases.
Includes retention related severance and bonuses for employees expected to continue working beyond their minimum notification period before termination.
Reflects estimated severance and other related costs we are contractually required to pay on employees transferred (approximately 2,200) as part of the shared service arrangement entered into with HCL Technologies.
Represents professional support services associated with our business transformation initiatives.
We use interest rate swap agreements to manage our interest rate exposure and to achieve a desired proportion of variable and fixed rate debt.
These derivatives may be designated as fair value hedges or cash flow hedges depending on the nature of the risk being hedged.
At September 30, 2019 and December 31, 2018, we had outstanding forward exchange and purchased option contracts with gross notional values of $982 and $1,103 respectively, with terms of less than 12 months.
Approximately 80% of the contracts at September 30, 2019 mature within three months, 10% mature in three to six months and 10% in six to twelve months.
The associated currency exposures being hedged at September 30, 2019 were materially consistent with our year-end currency exposures.
There has not been any material change in our hedging strategy.
The net asset fair value of these contracts were $4 and $8 as of September 30, 2019 and December 31, 2018, respectively.
The following is a summary of derivative gains (losses).
In addition, no amount was recorded for an underlying exposure that did not occur or was not expected to occur.
As of September 30, 2019, a net after-tax gain of $7 was recorded in Accumulated other comprehensive loss associated with our cash flow hedging activity.
Non-designated derivative instruments are primarily instruments used to hedge foreign currency-denominated assets and liabilities.
They are not designated as hedges since there is a natural offset for the remeasurement of the underlying foreign currency-denominated asset or liability.
For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2019 currency losses, net were $4 and $6, respectively, and for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2018 were $3 and $2, respectively.
The following table represents assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis.
The basis for the measurement at fair value in all cases is Level 2 – Significant Other Observable Inputs.
Fair value for our deferred compensation plan investments in mutual funds is based on quoted market prices for those funds.
Fair value for deferred compensation plan liabilities is based on the fair value of investments corresponding to employees’ investment selections.
The fair value amounts for Cash and cash equivalents and Accounts receivable, net, approximate carrying amounts due to the short maturities of these instruments.
The fair value of Short-term debt, including the current portion of long-term debt, and Long-term debt was estimated based on the current rates offered to us for debt of similar maturities (Level 2).
The difference between the fair value and the carrying value represents the theoretical net premium or discount we would pay or receive to retire all debt at such date.
Prior year amounts have been revised to reflect additional cost for previously excluded plans.
The non-U.S. plans net actuarial gain for 2018 reflects and out-of-period adjustment of $53 to correct an overstated benefit obligation for our U.K.
Funded Pension Plan at December 31, 2017.
The following table summarizes cash contributions to our defined benefit pension plans and retiree health benefit plans.
There are no mandatory contributions required in 2019 for our U.S. tax-qualified defined benefit plans to meet the minimum funding requirements.

The board of directors (the "Board") recently approved a change in the timing of our annual grant of awards from April to January to more closely align the grant date with the underlying performance period related to PSs.
The following is a summary of the program design and performance metrics effective for our January 2019 grant and grants thereafter, as approved by the Board.
Stock options were not awarded under the 2019 grant.
The fair value of our PSs is based upon the grant-date market price.
Compensation expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the vesting period, based on management's estimate of the number of shares expected to vest.
Shares granted through September 30, 2019 under this program were 714, with a corresponding weighted-average grant-date fair value of $22.62 per share.
The Absolute Share Price metric is based on Xerox's average closing price for the last 20 trading days of the performance period, inclusive of dividends during the three-year performance period.
The risk-free interest rate was based on the zero-coupon U.S. Treasury yield curve on the valuation date, with a maturity matched to the performance period.
The weighted-average of fair values used to record compensation expense as determined by the Monte Carlo simulation.
Compensation expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the vesting period based on the fair value determined by the Monte Carlo simulation and, except in cases of employee forfeiture, cannot be reversed regardless of performance.
Shares granted through September 30, 2019 under this program were 714.
Reclassified to Cost of sales - refer to Note 14 - Financial Instruments for additional information regarding our cash flow hedges.
Reclassified to Total Net Periodic Benefit Cost - refer to Note 16 - Employee Benefit Plans for additional information.
Represents our share of Fuji Xerox's benefit plan changes.
The decrease in the unreserved portion of the tax contingency, inclusive of any related interest, was primarily related to currency.
With respect to the unreserved tax contingency, the majority has been assessed by management as being remote as to the likelihood of ultimately resulting in a loss to the Company.
In connection with the above proceedings, customary local regulations may require us to make escrow cash deposits or post other security of up to half of the total amount in dispute, as well as, additional surety bonds and letters of credit, which include associated indexation.
Exposures related to labor matters are not material to the financial statements as of September 30, 2019 and December 31, 2018.
In February 2018, five complaints (the "Fuji Transaction Shareholder Lawsuits"), including four putative class actions (which have been consolidated), were filed by Xerox shareholders in the Supreme Court of the State of New York, County of New York (the "Court") in connection with the proposed transaction to combine Xerox and Fuji Xerox (the “Fuji Transaction”).
The plaintiffs allege, among other things, that Xerox's directors breached their fiduciary duties in negotiating, approving, and purportedly making false and misleading disclosures about the Fuji Transaction, and that Fujifilm aided and abetted those breaches.
The complaint in one of the actions further alleges that Xerox and the director defendants engaged in common law fraud by purportedly failing to disclose information about the joint venture agreements between Xerox and Fujifilm.
One of the Fuji Transaction Shareholder Lawsuits was brought by Darwin Deason, a Xerox shareholder ("Deason I").
Another complaint was filed by Mr. Deason against Xerox and its directors in the same Court on March 2, 2018 ("Deason II") alleging that defendants breached their fiduciary duties by refusing Mr. Deason’s request for a waiver of the deadline for nomination of a new slate of Xerox directors.
In Deason II, Mr. Deason sought to enjoin Xerox and its directors from enforcing Xerox’s advance notice by-laws, thereby allowing Mr. Deason to proceed with the nominations, as well as costs, fees, and other relief.
On April 27, 2018, the Court issued decisions and orders granting plaintiffs’ preliminary injunction motions, which (i) enjoined Xerox from “taking any further action to consummate the change of control transaction between Xerox and Fuji that was announced on January 31, 2018 pending a final determination of the claims asserted in the underlying action;” (ii) enjoined Xerox from enforcing its advance notice bylaw provision requiring shareholders to nominate directors for election at the 2018 annual shareholder meeting by December 11, 2017; and (iii) required Xerox to waive such advance notice bylaw provision to permit the noticing of a slate of director nominees for election at the 2018 annual shareholder meeting, and denying defendants’ motions to dismiss.
On May 1, 2018, Xerox entered into a Director Appointment, Nomination and Settlement Agreement (the “Initial Settlement Agreement”) with Mr. Deason and Carl C. Icahn and certain of his affiliates who were also Xerox shareholders (the "Icahn Group"), among others, that would have resolved Deason I, Deason II and the pending proxy contest in connection with Xerox’s 2018 Annual Meeting of Shareholders.
The Initial Settlement Agreement expired by its terms on May 3, 2018 without becoming effective.
On May 7, 2018, defendants filed with the Supreme Court of the State of New York, Appellate Division, First Judicial Department, notices of appeal of, and motions to stay pending appeal, the lower Court’s decision and order.
At a hearing before the appellate court on May 7, 2018, the appellate court ruled that the appeals would be heard on an expedited basis and granted a partial interim stay allowing Xerox and Fujifilm to take steps to seek regulatory approvals related to the Fuji Transaction pending a ruling from the appellate court on defendants’ motions to stay pending appeal.
On May 13, 2018, a second Director Appointment, Nomination and Settlement Agreement (the "Final Settlement Agreement") with respect to Deason I, Deason II and the pending proxy contest in connection with Xerox's 2018 Annual Meeting of Shareholders that was initiated by the Icahn Group was signed on behalf of Mr. Deason, the Icahn Group and all defendants except Fujifilm, and a memorandum of understanding regarding settlement of the putative class case was signed by all defendants except Fujifilm.
The Court entered a stipulation of discontinuance as to the settling parties in Deason II on May 14, 2018, and agreed on June 22, 2018 to do the same in Deason I.
On June 19, 2018, the putative class plaintiffs filed a motion for preliminary approval of a stipulation of settlement that would resolve the claims asserted by the plaintiffs in the putative class case against all defendants, other than Fujifilm.
On June 22, 2018, the Court entered an order denying a joint motion by the putative class plaintiffs and the settling defendants to dissolve the injunction in the putative class case as against the settling defendants, and entered an order denying Fujifilm’s motion to dissolve the injunctions in the putative class case and Deason I in their entirety.
On July 16, 2018, the Court held a hearing concerning the putative class plaintiffs’ motion for preliminary approval of the settlement in the putative class case.
On August 2, 2018, the Appellate Division entered orders recognizing the Xerox defendants’ withdrawal of their appeal in the Deason cases and denying all appellants’ motions to stay pending determination of appeals in the Deason and putative class cases.
On September 21, 2018, putative class plaintiffs filed a motion for certification of a settlement class and a motion to transmit notice of the proposed settlement to the proposed class.
On October 17, 2018, derivative plaintiff Carmen Ribbe and Fujifilm filed oppositions to the putative class plaintiffs’ motion to transmit notice to the proposed class.
On October 16, 2018, the Appellate Division entered a decision and order reversing the Court’s rulings, ordering that the claims brought against Fujifilm in the cases by Mr. Deason and the purported class be dismissed, and further ordering that the preliminary injunction of the proposed Fuji Transaction be dissolved (the “Appellate Decision and Order”).
On November 15, 2018, the putative class plaintiffs filed with the Appellate Division a motion seeking the opportunity to reargue Fujifilm’s appeal or, in the alternative, for leave to appeal the Appellate Decision and Order to the New York State Court of Appeals.
On December 6, 2018, pursuant to the Appellate Decision and Order, the Court entered a judgment dismissing the complaints against Fujifilm in Deason I and the putative class case.
The Court further issued orders denying the putative class plaintiffs’ motion for class certification, without prejudice to renewing the motion after the outcome of any appeals of the Appellate Decision and Order.
On January 8, 2019, the Court entered an order staying all further proceedings in Deason I and the putative class case until thirty days after exhaustion of appeals, including any appeals to the New York State Court of Appeals, of the Appellate Decision and Order.
On January 9, 2019, the Court entered an order denying the putative class plaintiffs’ motion to transmit notice to the proposed class, without prejudice to renewal of their motion at a later time.
On October 31, 2018 and January 3, 2019, respectively, Xerox and the Xerox director defendants in the putative class case filed with the Appellate Division a request and motion seeking an extension, until after any decision regarding approval of settlement of the putative class action, of the deadline by which to perfect their appeal of the Court’s April 27, 2018 decision and order.
On May 16, 2019, the Appellate Division entered an order granting the motion and extended the deadline until the October 2019 Term.
On February 21, 2019, the Appellate Division issued an order denying the putative class plaintiffs’ motion seeking to reargue Fujifilm’s appeal or, in the alternative, for leave to appeal the Appellate Decision and Order to the New York State Court of Appeals.
No further notice of appeal was filed, and the Appellate Decision and Order became final and unappealable on March 26, 2019.
On May 3, 2019, putative class plaintiffs filed a renewed motion for approval of the form of a notice to putative class members.
On May 6, 2019, putative class plaintiffs filed a renewed motion for class certification and notice of motion to approve class settlement and proposed final approval order.
On May 24, 2019, the Court entered an order approving the form notice and proposed manner of its dissemination.
On June 6, 2019, the Court entered an order pursuant to which plaintiffs submitted their motion to approve attorneys’ fees and expenses on July 19, 2019; requiring filing of any objections to or opt-outs from the proposed putative class settlement by August 9, 2019; and setting September 6, 2019 for its hearing on putative class plaintiffs’ motion for class certification and settlement approval.
The hearing took place, and on September 12, 2019, the Court entered a decision and order denying both motions.
At this time, however, it is premature to make any conclusion regarding the probability of incurring material losses in these lawsuits.
On April 11, 2019, Carmen Ribbe filed a putative derivative and class action stockholder complaint in the Supreme Court of the State of New York for New York County, naming as defendants Xerox, current Board members Gregory Q.
putative derivative claims on behalf of Xerox for breach of fiduciary duty against the members of the Xerox Board who approved Xerox’s entry into agreements to settle the Deason and In re Xerox Corporation Consolidated Shareholder Litigation (“XCCSL”) actions (described above).
Plaintiff also alleges that the current Board members breached their fiduciary duties by allegedly rejecting plaintiff’s January 14, 2019 shareholder demand on the Board to remedy harms arising from entry into the Deason and XCCSL settlements.
The new complaint further includes direct claims for breach of fiduciary duty on behalf of a putative class of current Xerox stockholders other than Mr. Deason, Mr. Icahn, and their affiliated entities (the “Ribbe Class”) against the defendants for causing Xerox to enter into the Deason and XCCSL settlements, which plaintiff alleges perpetuated control of Xerox by Mr. Icahn and Mr. Deason and denied the voting franchise of Xerox shareholders.
Defendants accepted service of the complaint as of May 16, 2019.
On June 4, 2019, the Court entered an order setting a briefing schedule for defendants’ motions to dismiss the complaint.
On July 12, 2019, plaintiff filed a motion to preclude defendants from referencing in their motions to dismiss the formation of, or work by, the committee of the Board established to investigate plaintiff’s shareholder demand.
On July 18, 2019, the Court denied plaintiff’s motion and adjourned sine die the deadline by which defendants must file any motions to dismiss the complaint.
Xerox will vigorously defend against this matter.
At this time, it is premature to make any conclusion regarding the probability of incurring material losses in this litigation.
At a conference on September 24, 2018, the Court stayed all discovery pending resolution of Xerox’s motion to dismiss.
Xerox filed its motion to dismiss on October 1, 2018.
On March 12, 2019, the Court entered a scheduling order setting various case deadlines.
Xerox filed its answer denying the claims on March 15, 2019.
Discovery has commenced and is ongoing.
On June 24, 2019 and August 12, 2019, the Court entered stipulated revised scheduling orders extending certain case deadlines.
At this time, however, it is premature to make any conclusion regarding the probability of incurring material losses in this litigation.
The lawsuit alleged that Xerox Corporation, Xerox State Healthcare, LLC and ACS State Healthcare (collectively “the Defendants”) violated the Texas Medicaid Fraud Prevention Act in the administration of ACS State Healthcare’s contract with the Texas Department of Health and Human Services (“HHSC”).
The State alleged that the Defendants made false representations of material facts regarding the processes, procedures, implementation and results regarding the prior authorization of orthodontic claims.
The State referenced the amount in controversy as exceeding hundreds of millions of dollars.
The Defendants filed their Answer in June 2014 denying all allegations.
In August 2017, the State of Texas filed a Second Amended Petition, which made substantially similar allegations and sought similar remedies as the original lawsuit.
On October 23, 2017, Xerox Corporation filed a Motion for Summary Judgment seeking judgment in Xerox's favor on all claims against it.
