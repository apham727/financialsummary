      •   the factors that differentiate us from our competitors.
Readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on such statements, which speak only as of the date of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.

We are a leading semiconductor company that designs, develops and markets high-performance power solutions.
Incorporated in 1997, MPS’s core strengths include deep system-level and applications knowledge, strong analog design expertise and an innovative proprietary process technology.
These combined strengths enable MPS to deliver highly integrated monolithic products that offer energy efficient, cost-effective, easy-to-use solutions for systems found in computing and storage, automotive, industrial, communications and consumer applications.
Our mission is to reduce total energy consumption in our customers' systems with green, practical and compact solutions.
We believe that we differentiate ourselves by offering solutions that are more highly integrated, smaller in size, more energy efficient, more accurate with respect to performance specifications and, consequently, more cost-effective than many competing solutions.
We plan to continue to introduce new products within our existing product families, as well as in new innovative product categories.
We work with third parties to manufacture and assemble our integrated circuits ("ICs").
For the three months ended March 31, 2019 and 2018, our revenue from sales to customers in Asia was 87% and 88%, respectively.
We derive a majority of our revenue from the sales of our DC to DC converter products which serve the computing and storage, automotive, industrial, communications and consumer markets.
Revenue for the three months ended March 31, 2019 was $141.4 million, an increase of $12.2 million, or 9.5%, from $129.2 million for the three months ended March 31, 2018.
This increase was driven by higher sales in all of our end markets except for the consumer market.
Revenue from the computing and storage market for the three months ended March 31, 2019 increased $8.2 million, or 26.5%, from the same period in 2018.
This increase was primarily driven by strength in the high-performance notebook market.
This increase was primarily driven by higher sales of products for infotainment, safety and connectivity applications.
Revenue from the industrial market increased $3.8 million, or 21.6%, from the same period in 2018.
This increase was primarily driven by higher sales in power source and security products.
Revenue from the communications market increased $6.4 million, or 40.8%, from the same period in 2018.
Revenue from the consumer market decreased $9.0 million, or 19.1%, from the same period in 2018.
This decrease was primarily due to softness in demand for high volume consumer-related products, particularly those sold in the greater China region, as well as lower sales from chargers and gaming products.
This decrease was partially offset by higher demand for home appliance products.
Cost of revenue was $63.4 million, or 44.8% of revenue, for the three months ended March 31, 2019, and $57.7 million, or 44.6% of revenue, for the three months ended March 31, 2018.
The $5.7 million increase in cost of revenue was primarily due to a 13% increase in overall unit shipments and a 6% increase in the average direct cost of units shipped.
The increase in cost of revenue was partially offset by a $1.6 million decrease in warranty expense and a $1.1 million decrease in inventory write-downs.
The decrease was primarily due to lower expenses incurred on an ongoing lawsuit in which we are the plaintiff.
Interest and other income, net, was $3.3 million for the three months ended March 31, 2019, compared with $0.4 million for the three months ended March 31, 2018.
The increase was primarily due to an increase of $2.1 million in income related to changes in the value of the deferred compensation plan investments, a decrease of $0.3 million in amortization of premium on available-for-sale securities, an increase of $0.2 million in interest income as a result of higher investment balances and yields, and a decrease of $0.2 million in foreign currency exchange loss.
The income tax provision for interim periods is generally determined using an estimate of our annual effective tax rate and adjusted for discrete items, if any, in the relevant period.
Each quarter the estimate of the annual effective tax rate is updated, and if our estimated tax rate changes, a cumulative adjustment is made.
The income tax benefit for the three months ended March 31, 2019 was $1.1 million, or 4.5% of pre-tax income.
 The income tax expense for the three months ended March 31, 2018 was $0.6 million, or 2.8% of pre-tax income.
 For the three months ended March 31, 2019 and 2018, our effective tax rate included the estimated impact of $15.5 million and $12.4 million, respectively, related to the GILTI provisions that was included as additional subpart F income, which was accounted for as a period cost.
As of March 31, 2019, $114.4 million of cash and cash equivalents and $82.2 million of short-term investments were held by our international subsidiaries.
For the three months ended March 31, 2019, we repatriated $75 million of cash from our Bermuda subsidiary to the U.S.
The proceeds are primarily used to fund our cash dividend payments and real estate purchases.
Earnings from other foreign subsidiaries will continue to be indefinitely reinvested.
The significant components of our working capital are cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments, accounts receivable, inventories and other current assets, reduced by accounts payable, accrued compensation and related benefits, and other accrued liabilities.
The $17.9 million decrease in working capital was due to an $11.2 million increase in current liabilities, coupled with a $6.7 million decrease in current assets.
The increase in current liabilities was primarily due to an increase in accounts payable and other accrued liabilities.
The decrease in current assets was primarily due to a decrease in short-term investments, which was partially offset by an increase in cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, inventories and other current assets.
For the three months ended March 31, 2019, net cash provided by operating activities was $38.8 million, primarily due to our net income adjusted for certain non-cash items, including depreciation and amortization and stock-based compensation, and a net decrease of $4.8 million from the changes in our operating assets and liabilities.
The increase in inventories was primarily driven by an increase in finished goods to meet current demand and future growth.
The increase in accrued liabilities was primarily driven by an increase in employee contributions to the deferred compensation plan.
For the three months ended March 31, 2018, net cash provided by operating activities was $16.3 million, primarily due to our net income adjusted for certain non-cash items, including depreciation and amortization and stock-based compensation, and a net decrease of $23.9 million from the changes in our operating assets and liabilities.
The increase in accounts receivable was primarily driven by timing of shipments in the last month of the quarter.
The increase in inventories was primarily driven by an increase in strategic wafer and die inventories as well as an increase in finished goods to meet current demand and future growth.
 For the three months ended March 31, 2019, net cash used in investing activities was $30.8 million, primarily due to purchases of property and equipment of $58.4 million, which included the purchase of a building and land in Kirkland, Washington for $52.3 million, and net contributions to the deferred compensation plan of $1.0 million.
Cash used in investing activities was partially offset by proceeds from maturities and sales of investments of $28.1 million and sales of property and equipment of $1.5 million.
For the three months ended March 31, 2019, net cash used in financing activities was $0.8 million, primarily reflecting $12.8 million used to pay dividends to our stockholders and dividend equivalents to our employees who hold RSUs, which was partially offset by $12.0 million of cash proceeds from vesting of RSUs and issuance of shares through our employee stock purchase plan.
For the three months ended March 31, 2018, net cash provided by financing activities was $1.0 million, primarily reflecting $9.4 million of cash proceeds from vesting of RSUs and issuance of shares through our employee stock purchase plan, partially offset by $8.3 million used to pay dividends to our stockholders and dividend equivalents to our employees who hold RSUs.
We have a dividend program pursuant to which we intend to pay quarterly cash dividends on our common stock.
In addition, outstanding RSU awards contain rights to receive dividend equivalents, which entitle employees who hold RSUs to the same dividend value per share as holders of common stock.
Dividend equivalents accumulated on the underlying RSUs are forfeited if the employees do not fulfill their service requirement and the awards do not vest.
We anticipate that cash used for future dividends and dividend equivalent payments, as well as payments for the one-time deemed repatriation transition tax and other expenditures, will come from our current domestic cash, cash generated from ongoing U.S. operations, and cash repatriated from our Bermuda subsidiary.
Earnings from other foreign subsidiaries will continue to be indefinitely reinvested.
Although cash requirements will fluctuate based on the timing and extent of many factors such as those discussed above, we believe that cash generated from operations, together with the liquidity provided by existing cash balances and short-term investments, will be sufficient to satisfy our liquidity requirements for the next 12 months.
Our outstanding purchase commitments primarily consist of wafer purchases, assembly and other manufacturing services, construction services and license arrangements.
As of March 31, 2019, the outstanding balance under our purchase commitments was $79.1 million, compared with $61.4 million as of December 31, 2018.
As of March 31, 2019, the outstanding liability was $22.1 million.
Other long-term obligations include long-term liabilities reflected on our Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets, which primarily consist of the deferred compensation plan liabilities and accrued dividend equivalents.
Our other contractual obligations have not changed significantly from those disclosed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018.
As of March 31, 2019, we had no off-balance sheet arrangements as defined in Item 303(a)(4) of the Securities and Exchange Commission’s Regulation S-K.
