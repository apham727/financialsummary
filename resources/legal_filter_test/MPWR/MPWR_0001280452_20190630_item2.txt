We are a leading semiconductor company that designs, develops and markets high-performance power solutions.
Incorporated in 1997, MPSâ€™s core strengths include deep system-level and applications knowledge, strong analog design expertise and an innovative proprietary process technology.
These combined strengths enable MPS to deliver highly integrated monolithic products that offer energy-efficient, cost-effective, easy-to-use solutions for systems found in computing and storage, automotive, industrial, communications and consumer applications.
Our mission is to reduce total energy consumption in our customers' systems with green, practical and compact solutions.
We believe that we differentiate ourselves by offering solutions that are more highly integrated, smaller in size, more energy-efficient, more accurate with respect to performance specifications and, consequently, more cost-effective than many competing solutions.
We plan to continue to introduce new products within our existing product families, as well as in new innovative product categories.
We work with third parties to manufacture and assemble our integrated circuits ("ICs").
Our revenue from direct or indirect sales to customers in Asia was 89% for both the three months ended June 30, 2019 and 2018, and 88% for both the six months ended June 30, 2019 and 2018.
