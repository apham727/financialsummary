This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, that have been made pursuant to and in reliance on the provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements include, among others, statements concerning:
      •   the factors that differentiate us from our competitors.    
We work with third parties to manufacture and assemble our integrated circuits (“ICs”). This has enabled us to limit our capital expenditures and fixed costs, while focusing our engineering and design resources on our core strengths. 
Except for the changes related to revenue recognition discussed in Note 1 and Note 2 to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements, there have been no other significant changes in our critical accounting policies and estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2018, as compared to those disclosed in the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2017. 
Revenue for the three months ended September 30, 2018 was $160.0 million, an increase of $31.1 million, or 24.1%, from $128.9 million for the three months ended September 30, 2017. This increase was driven by higher sales in all of our end markets except for the consumer market. Overall unit shipments increased by 22% due to higher market demand, and average sales prices increased by 2% from the same period in 2017.  
Revenue from the computing and storage market for the three months ended September 30, 2018 increased $18.6 million, or 64.2%, from the same period in 2017. This increase was primarily driven by strength in the solid-state drive storage, cloud computing and high-performance notebook markets. Revenue from the automotive market increased $6.9 million, or 53.9%, from the same period in 2017. This increase was primarily driven by higher sales of products for infotainment, safety and connectivity applications. Revenue from the industrial market increased $8.5 million, or 52.1%, from the same period in 2017. This increase was primarily driven by higher sales in power source, security and meter products. Revenue from the communications market increased $3.8 million, or 24.6%, from the same period in 2017. This increase was primarily driven by higher demand in networking applications. Revenue from the consumer market decreased $6.8 million, or 12.4%, from the same period in 2017. This decrease was primarily due to softness in demand for high volume consumer related products, particularly those sold in the greater China region. This decrease was partially offset by higher demand for products related to home appliance, specialty lighting and internet-of-things applications. 
Revenue for the nine months ended September 30, 2018 was $428.9 million, an increase of $87.4 million, or 25.6%, from $341.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2017. This increase was driven by higher sales in all of our end markets. Overall unit shipments increased by 17% due to higher market demand, and average sales prices increased by 6% from the same period in 2017. 
Revenue from the computing and storage market for the nine months ended September 30, 2018 increased $41.5 million, or 56.0%, from the same period in 2017. This increase was primarily driven by strength in the solid-state drive storage, cloud computing and high-performance notebook markets. Revenue from the automotive market increased $19.8 million, or 52.1%, from the same period in 2017. This increase was primarily driven by higher sales of products for infotainment, safety and connectivity applications. Revenue from the industrial market increased $14.8 million, or 31.7%, from the same period in 2017. This increase was primarily driven by higher sales in power source, security and meter products. Revenue from the communications market increased $2.7 million, or 5.6%, from the same period in 2017. This increase was primarily driven by higher demand in networking applications. Revenue from the consumer market increased $8.6 million, or 6.4%, from the same period in 2017. This increase was primarily driven by higher demand for products related to home appliance, specialty lighting and internet-of-things applications, partially offset by softness in demand for high volume consumer related products, particularly those sold in the greater China region. 
Cost of revenue was $71.0 million, or 44.4% of revenue, for the three months ended September 30, 2018, and $58.1 million, or 45.0% of revenue, for the three months ended September 30, 2017. The $12.9 million increase in cost of revenue was primarily due to a 22% increase in overall unit shipments, partially offset by a 4% decrease in the average direct cost of units shipped. The increase in cost of revenue was also driven by a $3.7 million increase in inventory write-downs and a $1.0 million net increase in warranty expenses. 
Gross margin was 55.6% for the three months ended September 30, 2018, compared with 55.0% for the three months ended September 30, 2017. The increase in gross margin was primarily due to increased sales of higher margin products, lower labor and manufacturing overhead costs and lower amortization expense due to certain intangible assets being fully amortized, partially offset by higher inventory write-downs and net warranty expenses as a percentage of revenue. 
Cost of revenue was $190.8 million, or 44.5% of revenue, for the nine months ended September 30, 2018, and $154.4 million, or 45.2% of revenue, for the nine months ended September 30, 2017. The $36.4 million increase in cost of revenue was primarily due to a 17% increase in overall unit shipments, coupled with a 2% increase in the average direct cost of units shipped. The increase in cost of revenue was also driven by an $8.7 million increase in inventory write-downs. 
Gross margin was 55.5% for the nine months ended September 30, 2018, compared with 54.8% for the nine months ended September 30, 2017. The increase in gross margin was primarily due to increased sales of higher margin products, lower labor and manufacturing overhead costs and lower amortization expense due to certain intangible assets being fully amortized, partially offset by higher inventory write-downs as a percentage of revenue. 
Litigation expense was $0.3 million for both the three months ended September 30, 2018 and 2017. Litigation expense was $1.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2018, compared with $0.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2017. The increase was primarily due to increased expenses on our ongoing lawsuits. 
For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2018, our effective tax rate included the estimated impact of $18.4 million and $46.2 million, respectively, related to the GILTI provisions that was included as additional subpart F income, which was accounted for as a period cost. In addition, during the first quarter of 2018, we paid the 2018 installment of $1.9 million related to the deemed repatriation transition tax liability. As of September 30, 2018, $1.9 million of the transition tax liability was recorded in current accrued liabilities and $20.1 million was recorded in long-term income tax liabilities on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet. 
The income tax provision for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2017 was $1.4 million, or 5.8% of pre-tax income, and $3.1 million, or 5.5% of pre-tax income, respectively. The effective tax rate differed from the federal statutory rate primarily because foreign income generated by our subsidiaries in Bermuda and China was taxed at lower rates. In addition, the effective tax rate was impacted by changes in the valuation allowance primarily related to stock-based compensation. 
As of September 30, 2018, we had cash and cash equivalents of $131.1 million and short-term investments of $216.8 million, compared with cash and cash equivalents of $82.8 million and short-term investments of $216.3 million as of December 31, 2017. As of September 30, 2018, $100.6 million of cash and cash equivalents and $108.0 million of short-term investments were held by our international subsidiaries. As a result of the enactment of the 2017 Tax Act, we currently plan to repatriate cash from our Bermuda subsidiary to fund our future expenditures in the U.S. Earnings from other foreign subsidiaries will continue to be indefinitely reinvested. 
For the nine month ended September 30, 2018, net cash provided by operating activities was $93.9 million, primarily due to our net income adjusted for certain non-cash items, including depreciation and amortization and stock-based compensation, and a net decrease of $41.9 million from the changes in our operating assets and liabilities. The increase in accounts receivable was primarily driven by increased sales and the timing of shipments in the last month of the quarter. The increase in inventories was primarily driven by an increase in strategic wafer and die inventories as well as an increase in finished goods to meet current demand and future growth. The increase in accounts payable was primarily driven by increased inventory and capital asset purchases to meet future demand. For the nine months ended September 30, 2017, net cash provided by operating activities was $80.4 million, primarily due to our net income adjusted for certain non-cash items, including depreciation and amortization and stock-based compensation, and a net decrease of $25.1 million from the changes in our operating assets and liabilities. The increase in accounts receivable was primarily driven by higher sales and outstanding balances with certain customers with longer payment terms. The increase in inventories was primarily driven by an increase in strategic wafer and die inventories as well as an increase in finished goods to meet current demand and future growth. The increase in accounts payable was primarily driven by increased inventory and capital asset purchases to meet future demand. The increase in accrued liabilities was primarily driven by an increase in employee contributions to the deferred compensation plan and warranty expenses.  
For the nine months ended September 30, 2018, net cash used in financing activities was $21.7 million, primarily reflecting $34.4 million used to pay dividends to our stockholders and dividend equivalents to our employees who hold RSUs, partially offset by $12.7 million of cash proceeds from vesting of RSUs and issuance of shares through our employee stock purchase plan. For the nine months ended September 30, 2017, net cash used in financing activities was $22.7 million, primarily reflecting $25.3 million used to pay dividends to our stockholders and dividend equivalents to our employees who hold RSUs, partially offset by $2.8 million of cash proceeds from stock option exercises and issuance of shares through our employee stock purchase plan. 
We have a dividend program pursuant to which we intend to pay quarterly cash dividends on our common stock. In addition, outstanding RSU awards contain rights to receive dividend equivalents, which entitle employees who hold RSUs to the same dividend value per share as holders of common stock. The dividend equivalents are accumulated and paid to the employees when the underlying RSUs vest. Dividend equivalents accumulated on the underlying RSUs are forfeited if the employees do not fulfill their service requirement and the awards do not vest. For the nine months ended September 30, 2018, we paid dividends and dividend equivalents totaling $34.4 million. For the nine months ended September 30, 2017, we paid dividends and dividend equivalents totaling $25.3 million. 
In February 2018, our Board of Directors approved an increase in our quarterly cash dividends from $0.20 per share to $0.30 per share, effective for the dividends declared in the first quarter of 2018. 
We anticipate that cash used for future dividends and dividend equivalent payments, as well as payments for the one-time deemed repatriation transition tax and other expenditures, will come from our current domestic cash and cash generated from ongoing U.S. operations, as well as cash to be repatriated from our Bermuda subsidiary. Earnings from other foreign subsidiaries will continue to be indefinitely reinvested. 
Although cash requirements will fluctuate based on the timing and extent of many factors such as those discussed above, we believe that cash generated from operations, together with the liquidity provided by existing cash balances and short-term investments, will be sufficient to satisfy our liquidity requirements for the next 12 months.  
Our outstanding purchase commitments primarily consist of wafer purchases from our foundries, assembly services and license arrangements. As of September 30, 2018, the outstanding balance under our purchase commitments was $67.7 million, compared with $52.6 million as of December 31, 2017. 
Other long-term obligations include long-term liabilities reflected in our Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets, which primarily consist of the deferred compensation plan liabilities and accrued dividend equivalents. As of September 30, 2018, the outstanding obligations were $36.3 million, compared with $33.0 million as of December 31, 2017. 
Our other contractual obligations have not changed significantly from those disclosed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2017.
