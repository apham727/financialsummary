We are a leading semiconductor company that designs, develops and markets high-performance power solutions.
Founded in 1997, MPS’s core strengths include deep system-level and applications knowledge, strong analog design expertise and an innovative proprietary process technology.
These combined strengths enable MPS to deliver highly integrated monolithic products that offer energy efficient, cost-effective, easy-to-use solutions for systems found in consumer, computing and storage, industrial, automotive and communications applications.
Our mission is to reduce total energy consumption in our customers' systems with green, practical and compact solutions.
We believe that we differentiate ourselves by offering solutions that are more highly integrated, smaller in size, more energy efficient, more accurate with respect to performance specifications and, consequently, more cost-effective than many competing solutions.
We plan to continue to introduce new products within our existing product families, as well as in new innovative product categories.
We work with third parties to manufacture and assemble our integrated circuits (“ICs”).
Our revenue from direct or indirect sales to customers in Asia was 89% for both the three months ended September 30, 2018 and 2017, and 88% and 89% for the nine months ended September 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively.
We derive a majority of our revenue from the sales of our DC to DC converter products which serve the consumer, computing and storage, industrial, automotive and communications markets.
Revenue for the three months ended September 30, 2018 was $160.0 million, an increase of $31.1 million, or 24.1%, from $128.9 million for the three months ended September 30, 2017.
This increase was driven by higher sales in all of our end markets except for the consumer market.
Revenue from the computing and storage market for the three months ended September 30, 2018 increased $18.6 million, or 64.2%, from the same period in 2017.
This increase was primarily driven by strength in the solid-state drive storage, cloud computing and high-performance notebook markets.

This increase was primarily driven by higher sales in power source, security and meter products.
Revenue from the consumer market decreased $6.8 million, or 12.4%, from the same period in 2017.
This decrease was primarily due to softness in demand for high volume consumer related products, particularly those sold in the greater China region.
This decrease was partially offset by higher demand for products related to home appliance, specialty lighting and internet-of-things applications.
Revenue for the nine months ended September 30, 2018 was $428.9 million, an increase of $87.4 million, or 25.6%, from $341.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2017.

In addition, cost of revenue includes amortization for acquisition-related intangible assets.
Cost of revenue was $71.0 million, or 44.4% of revenue, for the three months ended September 30, 2018, and $58.1 million, or 45.0% of revenue, for the three months ended September 30, 2017.
The increase in cost of revenue was also driven by a $3.7 million increase in inventory write-downs and a $1.0 million net increase in warranty expenses.
Cost of revenue was $190.8 million, or 44.5% of revenue, for the nine months ended September 30, 2018, and $154.4 million, or 45.2% of revenue, for the nine months ended September 30, 2017.
The $36.4 million increase in cost of revenue was primarily due to a 17% increase in overall unit shipments, coupled with a 2% increase in the average direct cost of units shipped.

Interest and other income, net, was $2.7 million for the three months ended September 30, 2018, compared with $1.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2017.
The increase was primarily due to an increase of $0.9 million in foreign currency exchange gain, an increase of $0.2 million in interest income as a result of higher investment balances and yields, and a decrease of $0.2 million in amortization of premium on available-for-sale securities.
The increase was primarily due to an increase of $1.4 million in foreign currency exchange gain, an increase of $0.7 million in interest income as a result of higher investment balances and yields, and a decrease of $0.4 million in amortization of premium on available-for-sale securities, which was partially offset by a decrease of $1.0 million in income related to changes in the value of the deferred compensation plan investments.
These amounts remained as estimates and, as permitted by Staff Accounting Bulletin No.
118, they will be refined through December 2018 based on our ongoing analysis of data and tax positions along with new guidance from regulators and interpretation of the law.

As of September 30, 2018, we had cash and cash equivalents of $131.1 million and short-term investments of $216.8 million, compared with cash and cash equivalents of $82.8 million and short-term investments of $216.3 million as of December 31, 2017.
As of September 30, 2018, $100.6 million of cash and cash equivalents and $108.0 million of short-term investments were held by our international subsidiaries.
The $88.6 million increase in working capital was due to a $108.2 million increase in current assets, partially offset by a $19.6 million increase in current liabilities.
The increase in current assets was primarily due to an increase in cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable and inventories.
The increase in current liabilities was primarily due to an increase in accounts payable, accrued compensation and related benefits, and other accrued liabilities.
For the nine month ended September 30, 2018, net cash provided by operating activities was $93.9 million, primarily due to our net income adjusted for certain non-cash items, including depreciation and amortization and stock-based compensation, and a net decrease of $41.9 million from the changes in our operating assets and liabilities.
The increase in inventories was primarily driven by an increase in strategic wafer and die inventories as well as an increase in finished goods to meet current demand and future growth.
The increase in accounts payable was primarily driven by increased inventory and capital asset purchases to meet future demand.
For the nine months ended September 30, 2017, net cash provided by operating activities was $80.4 million, primarily due to our net income adjusted for certain non-cash items, including depreciation and amortization and stock-based compensation, and a net decrease of $25.1 million from the changes in our operating assets and liabilities.
The increase in accounts receivable was primarily driven by higher sales and outstanding balances with certain customers with longer payment terms.
The increase in inventories was primarily driven by an increase in strategic wafer and die inventories as well as an increase in finished goods to meet current demand and future growth.
The increase in accounts payable was primarily driven by increased inventory and capital asset purchases to meet future demand.
The increase in accrued liabilities was primarily driven by an increase in employee contributions to the deferred compensation plan and warranty expenses.
For the nine months ended September 30, 2018, net cash used in financing activities was $21.7 million, primarily reflecting $34.4 million used to pay dividends to our stockholders and dividend equivalents to our employees who hold RSUs, partially offset by $12.7 million of cash proceeds from vesting of RSUs and issuance of shares through our employee stock purchase plan.
For the nine months ended September 30, 2017, net cash used in financing activities was $22.7 million, primarily reflecting $25.3 million used to pay dividends to our stockholders and dividend equivalents to our employees who hold RSUs, partially offset by $2.8 million of cash proceeds from stock option exercises and issuance of shares through our employee stock purchase plan.
We have a dividend program pursuant to which we intend to pay quarterly cash dividends on our common stock.
In addition, outstanding RSU awards contain rights to receive dividend equivalents, which entitle employees who hold RSUs to the same dividend value per share as holders of common stock.
The dividend equivalents are accumulated and paid to the employees when the underlying RSUs vest.
Dividend equivalents accumulated on the underlying RSUs are forfeited if the employees do not fulfill their service requirement and the awards do not vest.
For the nine months ended September 30, 2018, we paid dividends and dividend equivalents totaling $34.4 million.
For the nine months ended September 30, 2017, we paid dividends and dividend equivalents totaling $25.3 million.
In February 2018, our Board of Directors approved an increase in our quarterly cash dividends from $0.20 per share to $0.30 per share, effective for the dividends declared in the first quarter of 2018.
We anticipate that cash used for future dividends and dividend equivalent payments, as well as payments for the one-time deemed repatriation transition tax and other expenditures, will come from our current domestic cash and cash generated from ongoing U.S. operations, as well as cash to be repatriated from our Bermuda subsidiary.
Earnings from other foreign subsidiaries will continue to be indefinitely reinvested.
Although cash requirements will fluctuate based on the timing and extent of many factors such as those discussed above, we believe that cash generated from operations, together with the liquidity provided by existing cash balances and short-term investments, will be sufficient to satisfy our liquidity requirements for the next 12 months.
Our outstanding purchase commitments primarily consist of wafer purchases from our foundries, assembly services and license arrangements.
As of September 30, 2018, the outstanding balance under our purchase commitments was $67.7 million, compared with $52.6 million as of December 31, 2017.
During the first quarter of 2018, we paid the 2018 installment of $1.9 million.
As of September 30, 2018, the outstanding liability was $22.0 million.
Other long-term obligations include long-term liabilities reflected in our Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets, which primarily consist of the deferred compensation plan liabilities and accrued dividend equivalents.
