We are a leading semiconductor company that designs, develops and markets high-performance power solutions.
Incorporated in 1997, MPS’s core strengths include deep system-level and applications knowledge, strong analog design expertise and an innovative proprietary process technology.
These combined strengths enable MPS to deliver highly integrated monolithic products that offer energy-efficient, cost-effective, easy-to-use solutions for systems found in computing and storage, automotive, industrial, communications and consumer applications.
Our mission is to reduce total energy consumption in our customers' systems with green, practical and compact solutions.
We believe that we differentiate ourselves by offering solutions that are more highly integrated, smaller in size, more energy-efficient, more accurate with respect to performance specifications and, consequently, more cost-effective than many competing solutions.
We plan to continue to introduce new products within our existing product families, as well as in new innovative product categories.
We work with third parties to manufacture and assemble our integrated circuits (“ICs”).
Our revenue from direct or indirect sales to customers in Asia was 90% and 89% for the three months ended September 30, 2019 and 2018, respectively, and 89% and 88% for the nine months ended September 30, 2019 and 2018, respectively.
We derive a majority of our revenue from the sales of our DC to DC converter products which serve the computing and storage, automotive, industrial, communications and consumer markets.
There have been no significant changes in our critical accounting policies and estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2019, as compared to those disclosed in the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018.
Revenue for the three months ended September 30, 2019 was $168.8 million, an increase of $8.8 million, or 5.5%, from $160.0 million for the three months ended September 30, 2018.
This increase was driven by higher sales in the automotive, industrial, and computing and storage markets.
Overall unit shipments increased by 6% due to higher market demand, and average sales prices were essentially flat compared to the same period in 2018.
For the three months ended September 30, 2019, revenue from the automotive market increased $4.6 million, or 23.5%, from the same period in 2018.
This increase was primarily driven by higher sales of products for infotainment applications.
Revenue from the industrial market increased $4.0 million, or 16.1%, from the same period in 2018.
This increase was primarily driven by higher sales in power source and security products.
Revenue from the computing and storage market increased $5.1 million, or 10.8%, from the same period in 2018.
This increase was primarily driven by strength in the high-performance notebook market, which was partially offset by lower demand in the solid-state drive storage market.
Revenue from the communications market decreased $0.4 million, or 2.0%, from the same period in 2018.
This decrease was primarily driven by lower demand for routers and wireless applications, partially offset by higher demand in infrastructure sales including 5G network.
Revenue from the consumer market decreased $4.6 million, or 9.4%, from the same period in 2018.
This decrease was partially offset by higher demand for home appliance products.
This increase was driven by higher sales in all of our end markets except for the consumer market.
For the nine months ended September 30, 2019, revenue from the communications market increased $12.5 million, or 24.8%, from the same period in 2018.
Revenue from the industrial market increased $11.1 million, or 18.0%, from the same period in 2018.
This increase was primarily driven by higher sales in power source and security products.
Revenue from the computing and storage market increased $18.0 million, or 15.6%, from the same period in 2018.
This increase was primarily driven by strength in the high-performance notebook market, which was partially offset by lower demand in the solid-state drive storage market.
Revenue from the automotive market increased $8.3 million, or 14.4%, from the same period in 2018.
This increase was primarily driven by higher sales of products for infotainment applications.
Revenue from the consumer market decreased $17.6 million, or 12.3%, from the same period in 2018.
This decrease was partially offset by higher demand for mobile phone and home appliance products.
Cost of revenue was $75.7 million, or 44.8% of revenue, for the three months ended September 30, 2019, and $71.0 million, or 44.4% of revenue, for the three months ended September 30, 2018.
The $4.7 million increase in cost of revenue was primarily due to a 6% increase in overall unit shipments and a 6% increase in the average direct cost of units shipped.
The increase in cost of revenue was partially offset by a decrease in inventory write-downs and warranty expenses.
Cost of revenue was $206.8 million, or 44.8% of revenue, for the nine months ended September 30, 2019, and $190.8 million, or 44.5% of revenue, for the nine months ended September 30, 2018.
The $16.0 million increase in cost of revenue was primarily due to a 12% increase in overall unit shipments and a 5% increase in the average direct cost of units shipped.
The increase in cost of revenue was partially offset by a decrease in inventory write-downs and warranty expenses.
Litigation expense for these periods was primarily attributable to an ongoing lawsuit in which we are the plaintiff.
Interest and other income, net, was $2.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2019, compared with $2.7 million for the three months ended September 30, 2018.
The decrease was primarily due to a decrease of $0.6 million in income related to changes in the value of the deferred compensation plan investments and a decrease of $0.5 million in foreign currency exchange gains.
The increase was primarily due to an increase of $1.7 million in income related to changes in the value of the deferred compensation plan investments, a $0.7 million gain from the sale of a parcel of land, net of certain capitalized costs and selling expenses, and an increase of $0.6 million in interest income as a result of higher investment balances and yields.
These favorable changes were partially offset by a decrease of $0.9 million in foreign currency exchange gains.
The income tax provision for interim periods is generally determined using an estimate of our annual effective tax rate and adjusted for discrete items, if any, in the relevant period.
Each quarter the estimate of the annual effective tax rate is updated, and if our estimated tax rate changes, a cumulative adjustment is made.
The income tax expense for the three months ended September 30, 2019 was $2.8 million, or 8.6% of pre-tax income.

For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2018, our effective tax rates included the estimated impact of $18.4 million and $46.2 million, respectively, related to the GILTI provisions.
As of September 30, 2019, we had cash and cash equivalents of $205.2 million and short-term investments of $213.5 million, compared with cash and cash equivalents of $172.7 million and short-term investments of $204.6 million as of December 31, 2018.
As of September 30, 2019, $141.5 million of cash and cash equivalents and $124.0 million of short-term investments were held by our international subsidiaries.
For the nine months ended September 30, 2019, we repatriated $75 million of cash from our Bermuda subsidiary to the U.S.
The proceeds were primarily used to fund real estate purchases and cash dividend payments.
We anticipate that earnings from other foreign subsidiaries will continue to be indefinitely reinvested.
As of September 30, 2019, we had working capital of $524.3 million, compared with working capital of $500.4 million as of December 31, 2018.
The increase in current assets was primarily due to an increase in cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments and other current assets.
The increase in current liabilities was primarily due to an increase in accounts payable, accrued compensation and related benefits and other accrued liabilities.
For the nine months ended September 30, 2019, net cash provided by operating activities was $155.3 million, primarily due to our net income adjusted for certain non-cash items, including depreciation and amortization and stock-based compensation, and a net increase of $10.6 million from the changes in our operating assets and liabilities.
The increase in other accrued liabilities was primarily driven by an increase in employee contributions to the deferred compensation plan and an increase in operating lease liabilities.
For the nine month ended September 30, 2018, net cash provided by operating activities was $93.9 million, primarily due to our net income adjusted for certain non-cash items, including depreciation and amortization and stock-based compensation, and a net decrease of $41.9 million from the changes in our operating assets and liabilities.
The increase in inventories was primarily driven by an increase in strategic wafer and die inventories as well as an increase in finished goods to meet current demand and future growth.
The increase in accounts payable was primarily driven by increased inventory and capital asset purchases to meet future demand.
For the nine months ended September 30, 2019, net cash used in investing activities was $88.1 million, primarily due to purchases of property and equipment of $87.1 million, which included the purchase of a building and land in Kirkland, Washington for $52.3 million, net purchases of short-term investments of $7.6 million and net contributions to the deferred compensation plan of $1.8 million.
These cash outflows were partially offset by proceeds from sales of property and equipment of $9.3 million.
For the nine months ended September 30, 2019, net cash used in financing activities was $31.0 million, primarily reflecting $48.6 million used to pay dividends to our stockholders and dividend equivalents to our employees who hold RSUs, which was partially offset by $17.8 million of cash proceeds from the vesting of RSUs and the issuance of shares through our employee stock purchase plan.
For the nine months ended September 30, 2018, net cash used in financing activities was $21.7 million, primarily reflecting $34.4 million used to pay dividends to our stockholders and dividend equivalents to our employees who hold RSUs, which was partially offset by $12.7 million of cash proceeds from the vesting of RSUs and the issuance of shares through our employee stock purchase plan.
We anticipate that cash used for future dividends and dividend equivalent payments, as well as payments for the one-time deemed repatriation transition tax and other expenditures, will come from our domestic cash, cash generated from ongoing U.S. operations, and cash repatriated from our Bermuda subsidiary.
Earnings from other foreign subsidiaries will continue to be indefinitely reinvested.
Although cash requirements will fluctuate based on the timing and extent of many factors such as those discussed above, we believe that cash generated from operations, together with the liquidity provided by existing cash balances and short-term investments, will be sufficient to satisfy our liquidity requirements for the next 12 months.
Our outstanding purchase commitments primarily consist of wafer purchases, assembly and other manufacturing services, construction services and license arrangements.
As of September 30, 2019, the outstanding balance under our purchase commitments was $70.9 million, compared with $61.4 million as of December 31, 2018.
Our long-term obligations include long-term liabilities reflected on our Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets, which primarily consist of the deferred compensation plan liabilities and accrued dividend equivalents.
Our other contractual obligations have not changed significantly from those disclosed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018.
