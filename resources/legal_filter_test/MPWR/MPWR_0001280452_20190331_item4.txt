Our management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures pursuant to Rule 13a-15(e) and Rule 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.
Effective January 1, 2019, we adopted ASU No.
We have implemented additional business processes and control activities, primarily related to the analysis of lease contracts, recognition of the right-of-use assets and lease liabilities, and presentation and disclosure, in order to monitor and maintain appropriate controls over financial reporting.
In designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, management recognizes that any set of controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives.
In addition, the design of disclosure controls and procedures must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and that management is required to apply its judgment in evaluating the benefits of possible controls and procedures relative to their costs.
