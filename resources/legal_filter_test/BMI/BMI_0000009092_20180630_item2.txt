Municipal water, the largest category by sales volume, includes mechanical and ultrasonic (electronic) water meters and related technologies and services used by municipal water utilities as the basis for generating water and wastewater revenues.
The key market for the Company’s municipal water meter products is North America, primarily the United States, because most of the Company's meters are designed and manufactured to conform to standards promulgated by the American Water Works Association.
The majority of water meters sold by the Company continue to be mechanical in nature.
In recent years, the Company has made inroads in selling ultrasonic water meters.
In the municipal water category, sales of water meters and related technologies and services are also commonly referred to as residential or commercial water meter sales, the latter referring to larger sizes of water meters.
Meters equipped with radio technology (endpoints) receive flow measurement data from encoder registers attached to the water meter, which is encrypted and transmitted via radio frequency to a receiver that collects and formats the data appropriately for water utility billing systems.
These remotely read, or mobile, systems are either automatic meter reading (AMR) systems, where a vehicle equipped for meter reading purposes, including a radio receiver, computer and reading software, collects the data from utilities’ meters; or fixed network advanced metering infrastructure (AMI) systems, where data is gathered utilizing a network of permanent data collectors or gateway receivers that are always active or listening for the radio transmission from the utilities’ meters.
AMI systems eliminate the need for utility personnel to drive through service territories to collect data from the meters.
ORION Migratable makes the migration to fixed network easier for utilities that prefer to start with mobile reading and later adopt fixed network communications, allowing utilities to choose a solution for their current needs and be positioned for their future operational changes.
ORION Cellular eliminates the need for utility-owned fixed network infrastructure, allows for rapid deployment and decreases ongoing maintenance.
The Company’s BEACON AMA Managed Solution is the latest in metering technology.
BEACON AMA combines the BEACON analytical software suite with proven ORION technologies using two-way fixed and cellular networks in a managed solution, improving utilities’ visibility of their water consumption and eliminating the need for costly utility-managed infrastructure.
The BEACON AMA secure, cloud-hosted software suite includes a customizable dashboard, the ability to establish alerts for specific conditions, and consumer engagement tools that allow end water customers to view and manage their water usage activity.
Benefits to the utility include improved customer service, increased visibility through faster leak detection, the ability to promote and quantify the effects of its water conservation efforts, and easier compliance reporting.
Water meter replacement and the adoption and deployment of new technology comprise the majority of water meter product sales, including radio products.
Over the last decade, there has been a growing trend in the conversion from manually read water meters to radio technology.
This conversion rate is accelerating and contributes to an increased water meter and radio solutions base of business.
The Company estimates that approximately 55% to 60% of water meters installed in the United States have been converted to a radio solutions technology.
The Company’s strategy is to fulfill customers’ metering expectations and requirements with its proprietary meter reading systems or other systems available through its alliance partners in the marketplace.
Flow instrumentation products serve flow measurement and control applications across a broad industrial spectrum, occasionally leveraging the same technologies used in the municipal water category.
The Company’s specific flow measurement and control applications and technologies serve the flow measurement market through both customized and standard flow instrumentation solutions.
This system-wide scrutiny has heightened the focus on flow instrumentation in industrial process, manufacturing, commercial fluid, building automation, and precision engineering applications where flow measurement and control are critical.
An industry leader in both mechanical and electrical flow metering technologies, the Company offers one of the broadest flow measurement, control and communication portfolios in the market.
The portfolio carries respected brand names including Recordall®, E-Series, ORION, Hedland®, Dynasonics®, Blancett®, and Research Control®, and includes eight of the ten major flow meter technologies.
Customers rely on the Company for application-specific solutions that deliver accurate, timely and dependable flow data and control essential for product quality, cost control, safer operations, regulatory compliance, and more sustainable operations.
Specifically, AMI and AMA technologies enable water utilities to capture readings from each meter at more frequent and variable intervals.
Similar to the electric utility industry’s conversion to solid-state meters in recent years, the water utility industry is beginning the conversion from mechanical to ultrasonic meters.
There are approximately 52,000 water utilities in the United States and the Company estimates that approximately 55% to 60% of them have converted to a radio solutions technology.
Flow measurements are critical to provide a baseline and quantify reductions as customers attempt to reduce consumption.
Once water usage is better understood, a strategy for water-use reduction can be developed with specific water-reduction initiatives targeted to those areas where water reduction is most viable.
With the Company’s technology, customers have found costly leaks, pinpointed equipment in need of repair, and identified areas for process improvements.

In 2011, the Company introduced AMA as a hardware and software solution for water and gas utilities, and then in early 2014 launched its new BEACON AMA system, as a managed solution, which it believes will help maintain the Company's position as a market leader.
Since its inception, sales of BEACON AMA have continued to grow with large cities and private water utilities selecting BEACON AMA and the Company’s industry-leading water meters.
The Company continues to seek opportunities for additional revenue enhancement.
For instance, the Company is periodically asked to oversee and perform field installation of its products for certain customers.
The Company also supports its product and technology sales with the sale of extended service programs that provide additional services beyond the standard warranty.
In recent years, the Company has sold ORION radio technology to natural gas utilities for installation on their gas meters.
Most recently, the introduction of the BEACON AMA system opens the door to “software as a service” revenues.
The Company’s net sales for the three months ended June 30, 2018 increased $9.4 million, or 9.0%, to $113.6 million compared to $104.2 million during the same period in 2017.
Municipal water sales represented 77.5% of sales in the second quarter of 2018 compared to 76.8% in the second quarter of 2017.
These sales increased $7.9 million, or 9.9%, to $88.0 million in the second quarter of 2018 from $80.1 million in the second quarter of 2017.
The increase was due to higher prices and increased domestic volumes sold of newer technologies in meters and related radios as well as higher service revenue.
 Flow instrumentation products represented 22.5% of sales for the three months ended June 30, 2018 compared to 23.2% during the same period in 2017.
These sales increased $1.5 million, or 6.2%, to $25.6 million from $24.1 million in the same period last year.
Selling, engineering and administration expenses for the three months ended June 30, 2018 increased $1.0 million, or 4.1%, to $25.2 from $24.2 million in the second quarter of 2017.
Operating earnings for the second quarter of 2018 decreased $0.5 million, or 3.0%, to $16.3 million compared to $16.8 million in the same period in 2017.
Other pension and postretirement costs were $8.0 million compared to $0.2 million in the second quarter of 2017.
Initial distributions were made from the plan in the second quarter resulting in this non-cash charge.
Final distributions are expected to be made in the third quarter of 2018 which will result in an additional settlement charge, currently estimated to be $10.5 million.
The decrease between years was due primarily to the lower Federal tax rate, which declined from 35% in 2017 to 21% in 2018.
As a result of the above-mentioned items, net earnings for the three months ended June 30, 2018 were $6.2 million, or $0.21 per diluted share, compared to $10.6 million, or $0.36 per diluted share, for the same period in 2017.
The Company’s net sales for the six months ended June 30, 2018 increased $12.9 million, or 6.3%, to $218.7 million compared to $205.8 million during the same period in 2017.
These sales increased $10.2 million, or 6.4%, to $168.5 million from $158.3 million in 2017 and were driven by higher prices and increased domestic volumes sold of newer technologies in meters and related radios as well as higher service revenue.
Offsetting this somewhat were lower volumes of commercial meters sold.
Flow instrumentation products represented 23.0% of sales for the six months ended June 30, 2018, the same as the first six months of 2017.
Gross margin as a percentage of sales was 35.8% for the first six months of 2018 compared to 38.7% in the same period in 2017.
Selling, engineering and administration expenses for the six months ended June 30, 2018 increased $2.6 million, or 5.3%, to $51.9 million from $49.3 million in the same period in 2017.
Other pension and postretirement costs were $8.0 million for the first six months of 2018 compared to $0.3 million in the same period in 2017.
Initial distributions were made from the plan in the second quarter resulting in this non-cash charge.
Final distributions are expected to be made in the third quarter of 2018 which will result in an additional settlement charge, currently estimated to be $10.5 million.
The decrease between years was due almost entirely to the lower Federal tax rate, which declined from 35% in 2017 to 21% in 2018.
As a result of the above-mentioned items, net earnings for the six months ended June 30, 2017 were $13.7 million, or $0.47 per diluted share, compared to $19.4 million, or $0.67 per diluted share, for the same period in 2017.
The main sources of liquidity for the Company are cash from operations and borrowing capacity.
Cash provided by operations was $25.2 million for the first six months of 2018 compared to $37.3 million through the first six months of 2017.
Receivables increased from $58.2 million at December 31, 2017 to $65.3 million at June 30, 2018.
Generally, receivable balances are lower at year-end than at other times of the year due to seasonality in the Company’s business.
Inventories at June 30, 2018 were $85.7 million, only a slight change from $85.2 million at December 31, 2017.
Net property, plant and equipment decreased slightly from $93.6 million at December 31, 2017 to $92.7 million at June 30, 2018.
This was the net effect of depreciation expense, offset somewhat by $5.2 million of capital expenditures in the first six months of 2018.
Intangible assets decreased to $59.1 million at June 30, 2018 from $59.3 million at December 31, 2017 due to normal amortization expense, offset by an increase of $3.7 million related to the acquisition of IMS.
The acquisition was also the main reason for the increase in goodwill from $67.4 million on December 31, 2017 to $71.1 million on June 30, 2018.
Short-term debt at June 30, 2018 decreased to $42.4 million from $44.6 million at December 31, 2017 due to the timing of cash needs.
Payables and other current liabilities of $28.1 million at June 30, 2018 decreased from $28.6 million at December 31, 2017.
These balances were impacted by the timing of purchases and payments.
Accrued compensation and employee benefits decreased to $9.6 million at June 30, 2018 from $15.5 million at December 31, 2017 due to payments made in the first two quarters of 2018 related to 2017 earned employee incentives, offset somewhat by provisions made for 2018 employee incentives earned to date.
Income and other taxes payable increased to $1.4 million at June 30, 2018 from $1.1 million at December 31, 2017.
Other long-term liabilities increased to $13.7 million compared to $4.1 million on December 31, 2017.
The increase was due primarily to higher deferred revenue associated with the Beacon AMA offering.
The overall increase in total shareholders’ equity from $277.5 million at December 31, 2017 to $288.5 million at June 30, 2018 was the net effect of net earnings and stock options exercised, offset by dividends paid and repurchased stock.
The Company’s financial condition remains strong.
In June 2018, the Company amended its May 2012 credit agreement with its primary lender to extend until September 2021 the $125.0 million line of credit that supports commercial paper (up to $70.0 million) and includes $5.0 million of a Euro line of credit.
While the facility is unsecured, there are a number of financial covenants with which the Company must comply, and the Company was in compliance as of June 30, 2018.
The Company believes that its operating cash flows, available borrowing capacity, and its ability to raise capital provide adequate resources to fund ongoing operating requirements, future capital expenditures and the development of new products.
The Company had $90.7 million of unused credit lines available at June 30, 2018.
The Company is subject to contingencies related to environmental laws and regulations.
