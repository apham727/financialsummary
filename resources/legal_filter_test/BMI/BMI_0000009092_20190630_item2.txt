The largest geographic market for the Company’s municipal water products is North America, primarily the United States, because most of the Company's meters are designed and manufactured to conform to standards promulgated by the American Water Works Association.
The majority of water meters sold by the Company continue to be mechanical in nature; however, ultrasonic meters are gaining in penetration due to a variety of factors, including their ability to maintain near absolute measurement accuracy over their useful life.
Meters equipped with radio technology (endpoints) receive flow measurement data from battery-powered encoder registers attached to the water meter, which is encrypted and transmitted via radio frequency to a receiver that collects and formats the data appropriately for water utility usage and billing systems.
These remotely read systems are classified as either automatic meter reading (AMR) systems, where a vehicle equipped for meter reading purposes, including a radio receiver, computer and reading software, collects the data from utilities’ meters; or advanced metering infrastructure (AMI) systems, where data is gathered utilizing a network (either fixed or cellular) of data collectors or gateway receivers that are able to receive radio data transmission from the utilities’ meters.
AMI systems eliminate the need for utility personnel to drive through service territories to collect data from the meters.
These systems provide the utilities with more frequent and diverse data from their meters at specified intervals.
The ORION® branded family of radio endpoints provides water utilities with a range of industry-leading options for meter reading.
ORION Migratable makes the migration to fixed network easier for utilities that prefer to start with mobile reading and later adopt fixed network communications, allowing utilities to choose a solution for their current needs and be positioned for their future operational changes.
ORION Cellular eliminates the need for utility-owned fixed network infrastructure, allows for gradual or full deployment, and decreases ongoing maintenance.
The Company’s BEACON Advanced Metering Analytics (AMA) software suite improves the utilities’ visibility of their water and water usage.
BEACON AMA is a secure, cloud-hosted software suite that includes a customizable dashboard, and has the ability to establish alerts for specific conditions.
It also allows for consumer engagement tools that permit end water users (such as homeowners) to view and manage their water usage activity.
Benefits to the utility include improved customer service, increased visibility through faster leak detection, the ability to promote and quantify the effects of its water conservation efforts, and easier compliance reporting.
Water meter replacement and the adoption and deployment of new technology comprise the majority of water meter product sales, including radio products.
Over the last decade, there has been a growing trend in the conversion from manually read water meters to meters with radio technology.
This conversion rate is accelerating, with the Company estimating that approximately 60% of water meters installed in the United States have been converted to a radio solution technology.
The Company’s proprietary radio products (i.e.
Flow instrumentation products are used in flow measurement and control applications across a broad industrial spectrum, occasionally leveraging the same technologies used in the municipal water category.
Specialized communication protocols that control the entire flow measurement process and mandatory certifications drive these markets.
This system-wide scrutiny has heightened the focus on flow instrumentation in industrial process, manufacturing, commercial fluid, building automation and precision engineering applications where flow measurement and control are critical.
A leader in both mechanical and static (ultrasonic) flow metering technologies for industrial markets, the Company offers one of the broadest flow measurement, control and communication portfolios in the market.
This portfolio carries respected brand names including Recordall®, Hedland®, Dynasonics®, Blancett®, and Research Control®, and includes eight of the ten major flow meter technologies.
Customers rely on the Company for application-specific solutions that deliver accurate, timely and dependable flow data and control essential for product quality, cost control, safer operations, regulatory compliance and more sustainable operations.
The Company's products are sold throughout the world through employees, resellers and representatives.
Increasingly, customers in the water utility market are interested in more frequent and diverse data collection.
Specifically, AMI technology enables water utilities to capture readings from each meter at more frequent and variable intervals.
There are approximately 52,000 water utilities in the United States and the Company estimates that approximately 60% of them have converted to a radio solution.
In addition, the water utility industry is beginning the conversion from mechanical to static (ultrasonic) meters.
On April 2, 2018, the Company acquired 100% of the outstanding stock of IMS of Odessa, Florida, which was one of the Company's distributors serving Florida.

In the first quarter of 2019, the Company made a contingent payment of $1.0 million related to the May 1, 2017 acquisition of 100% of the outstanding common stock of D-Flow.
There is an additional $2.0 million of contingent payments related to the D-Flow acquisition that is anticipated to be made in 2019 which is recorded in payables on the Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheet at June 30, 2019.
As the industry continues to evolve, the Company has been at the forefront of innovation across metering, radio and software technologies in order to meet its customers’ increasing expectations for accurate and actionable data.

The Company’s net sales for the three months ended June 30, 2019 were $103.5 million compared to $113.6 million during the same period in 2018.
Sales into the municipal water market were $79.5 million, a decrease of 9.7% from the prior year’s $88.0 million.
The sales decline resulted from customer deferral of orders in order to obtain the latest version of advanced technology products including ORION Cellular LTE-M endpoints, where customer pilots and testing continue without issue.
In addition, newly developed three and four-inch commercial E-Series® Ultrasonic water meters are now expected to begin shipping later this year.
Finally, prior year municipal water sales included a large Middle East order, which did not repeat.
The Company did benefit from continued positive sales mix reflecting a higher percentage of meters with radios, ultrasonic meters and SaaS revenue associated with data collection and software analytics.
The improvement was largely the result of the improved municipal water product and regional sales mix as well as the benefit of pricing and lower year-over-year commodity costs, including brass.
Other pension and postretirement costs in the second quarter of 2018 included a settlement charge of $8.2 million in connection with the planned termination of the Company’s pension plan, which was finalized in 2018.
