Each common share of stock equals $1 par value; therefore, the number of common shares is the same as the dollar value. 
Historically, the Company maintained a non-contributory defined benefit pension plan that covered substantially all U.S. employees who were employed on December 31, 2011. After that date, no further benefits were accrued in this plan. For the frozen pension plan, benefits were based primarily on years of service and, for certain individuals, levels of compensation. In 2018, the Company completed the termination of the non-contributory defined benefit pension plan. 
The Company disclosed in its financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2018 that it estimated it would pay $0.4 million in other postretirement benefits in 2019 based on actuarial estimates. As of June 30, 2019, $0.2 million of such benefits have been paid. The Company continues to believe that its estimated payments for the full year are reasonable. However, such estimates contain inherent uncertainties because cash payments can vary significantly depending on the timing of postretirement medical claims and the collection of the retirees’ portion of certain costs. The amount of benefits paid in calendar year 2019 will not impact the expense for postretirement benefits for 2019. 
This accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) component resulted from an international pension plan settlement. 
On April 2, 2018, the Company acquired 100% of the outstanding stock of Innovative Metering Solutions, Inc. (IMS) of Odessa, Florida, which was one of the Company's distributors serving Florida. Acquisitions are accounted for under the purchase method, and accordingly, the results of operations were included in the Company's financial statements from the date of acquisition. The IMS acquisition did not have a material impact on the Company's consolidated financial statements or the notes thereto. 
The total purchase consideration was approximately $12.0 million, which included $7.7 million in cash, a $0.3 million working capital adjustment, a balance sheet holdback of $0.7 million and settlement of $3.3 million of pre-existing Company receivables. The working capital adjustment was settled in the second quarter of 2018 and the balance sheet holdback was paid in the second quarter of 2019. The Company's allocation of the purchase price at March 31, 2019 included $3.8 million of receivables, $0.8 million of inventories, $0.1 million of machinery and equipment, $3.6 million of intangibles and $3.7 million of goodwill. The intangible assets acquired are customer relationships with an estimated average useful life of 10 years. The allocation of the purchase price to the assets acquired was based upon the estimated fair values at the date of acquisition. As of March 31, 2019, the Company had completed its analysis for estimating the fair value of the assets acquired with no additional adjustments.  
In the first quarter of 2019, the Company made a contingent payment of $1.0 million related to the May 1, 2017 acquisition of 100% of the outstanding common stock of D-Flow Technology AB (“D-Flow”). There is an additional $2.0 million of contingent payments related to the D-Flow acquisition that is anticipated to be made in 2019 which is recorded in payables on the Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheet at June 30, 2019. 
In the normal course of business, the Company is named in legal proceedings. There are currently no material legal proceedings pending with respect to the Company. 
The Company applies the accounting standards for fair value measurements and disclosures for its financial assets and financial liabilities. The carrying amounts of cash, receivables and payables in the financial statements approximate their fair values due to the short-term nature of these financial instruments. Short-term debt is comprised of notes payable drawn against the Company's lines of credit and commercial paper. Because of its short-term nature, the carrying amount of the short-term debt also approximates fair value. Included in other assets are insurance policies on various individuals who were previously employed by the Company. The carrying amounts of these insurance policies approximate their fair value. 
In August 2018, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) No. 2018-14 “Compensation - Retirement Benefits - Defined Benefit Plans - General (Subtopic 715-20),” which modifies the annual disclosure requirements for defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plans. This ASU as modified added and deleted specific disclosures in an effort to improve the usefulness for financial statement users while also reducing unnecessary costs for companies. The ASU is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2020 with early adoption being permitted in any interim reporting period within the annual reporting period. The Company is currently assessing the impact of adopting ASU No. 2018-14. 
In January 2017, the FASB issued ASU No. 2017-04 “Intangibles - Goodwill and Other (Topic 350).” The update requires a single-step quantitative test to measure potential impairment based on the excess of a reporting unit's carrying amount over its fair value. A qualitative assessment can still be completed first for an entity to determine if a quantitative impairment test is necessary. The ASU is effective on a prospective basis for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2019 and interim periods thereafter. Early adoption is permitted for interim or annual goodwill impairment tests performed on testing dates after January 1, 2017. The Company adopted ASU No. 2017-04 on January 1, 2019. The adoption of this standard did not have any impact on the Company’s financial statements.  
In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-13 “Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326),” which amends the accounting for credit losses on purchased financial assets and available-for-sale debt securities with credit deterioration. This ASU requires the measurement of all expected credit losses for financial assets, including accounts receivables, held at the reporting date based upon current conditions, historical experience and reasonable forecasts. This ASU is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2019, and early adoption is allowed in any interim reporting period within the annual reporting period. The Company is currently assessing the impact of adopting ASU No. 2016-13. 
In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02 “Leases (Topic 842),” which requires lessees to record most leases on their balance sheets. Lessees initially recognize a lease liability (measured at the present value of the lease payments over the lease term) and a right-of-use asset (measured at the lease liability amount, adjusted for lease prepayments, lease incentives received and the lessee's initial direct costs). Lessees can make an accounting policy election not to recognize ROU assets and lease liabilities for leases with a lease term of 12 months or less as long as the leases do not include options to purchase the underlying assets that the lessee is reasonably certain to exercise. The standard includes the use of a modified retrospective approach for leases that exist or are entered into after the beginning of the earliest comparative period in the financial statements. Full retrospective application is prohibited. In July 2018, the FASB issued ASU No. 2018-11 “Targeted Improvements (Topic 842).” This ASU provides for an optional method of transition which allows companies to adopt the new leasing standard with a cumulative effect adjustment to reinvested earnings. The Company adopted the new leasing standard with the optional transition methodology as of January 1, 2019. For a complete discussion of the adoption of ASU No. 2016-02 and ASU No. 2018-11, see Note 12 “Leases” in the Unaudited Notes to Consolidated Condensed Financial Statements. 
Revenue for sales of products and services is derived from contracts with customers. The products and services promised in contracts include the sale of municipal water and flow instrumentation products, such as flow meters and radios, software access and other ancillary services. Contracts generally state the terms of sale, including the description, quantity and price of each product or service. Since the customer typically agrees to a stated rate and price in the contract that does not vary over the life of the contract, the majority of the Company's contracts do not contain variable consideration. The Company establishes a provision for estimated warranty and returns as well as certain after sale costs as discussed in Note 2 "Additional Financial Information Disclosures" in the Unaudited Notes to Consolidated Condensed Financial Statements. 
The Company performs its obligations under a contract by shipping products or performing services in exchange for consideration. The Company typically invoices its customers as soon as control of an asset is transferred and a receivable to the Company is established. The Company, however, recognizes a contract liability when a customer prepays for goods or services and the Company has not transferred control of the goods or services. 
As of June 30, 2019, the Company had certain contracts where there were unsatisfied performance obligations. For contracts recorded as contract liabilities, $17.4 million was the aggregate amount of the transaction price allocated to performance obligations that were unsatisfied or partially unsatisfied as of the end of the reporting period. The Company estimates that revenue recognized from satisfying those performance obligations will be approximately $3.9 million in 2019, $1.7 million in each year from 2020 through 2024 and $5.0 million thereafter.  
A performance obligation is a promise in a contract to transfer a distinct good or service to the customer, and is the unit of measurement in Topic 606. At contract inception, the Company assesses the products and services promised in its contracts with customers. The Company then identifies performance obligations to transfer distinct products or services to the customer. In order to identify performance obligations, the Company considers all of the products or services promised in the contract regardless of whether they are explicitly stated or are implied by customary business practices. 
The Company's performance obligations are satisfied at a point in time or over time as work progresses. Revenue from products and services transferred to customers at a single point in time accounted for 96.1% and 97.3% of net sales for the three-month periods ended June 30, 2019 and 2018, respectively. Revenue from products and services transferred to customers at a single point in time accounted for 96.3% and 97.4% of net sales for the six-month periods ended June 30, 2019 and 2018, respectively. The majority of the Company's revenue recognized at a point in time is for the sale of municipal and flow instrumentation products. Revenue from these contracts is recognized when the customer is able to direct the use of and obtain substantially all of the benefits from the product which generally coincides with title transfer during the shipping process. 
Revenue from services transferred to customers over time accounted for 3.9% and 2.7% of net sales for the three-month periods ended June 30, 2019 and 2018, respectively. Revenue from services transferred to customers over time accounted for 3.7% and 2.6% of net sales for the six-month periods ended June 30, 2019 and 2018, respectively. The majority of the Company's revenue that is recognized over time relates to the BEACON® AMA software as a service. 
On January 1, 2019, the Company adopted ASU No. 2016-02 and ASU No. 2018-11 using the optional transition method. Under this transition method, comparative periods will continue to be reported in accordance with prior lease guidance under ASC 840 Leases. The Company has elected certain practical expedients permitted under the transition guidance, which, among other things, allows the Company to carry forward historical lease classifications.
