Management, with the participation of the Company’s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, has evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of the disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as of the end of the period covered by this report.
Based on that evaluation, as detailed below, management concluded that the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures are not effective.
Beginning January 1, 2018, we implemented ASC 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers.
These included the development of new policies based on the five-step model provided in the new revenue standard, new training, ongoing contract review requirements, and gathering of information provided for disclosures.
As disclosed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2017, we concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was not effective for the item noted below.
Long-lived Asset Impairment Testing.
Based on management’s testing and evaluation, we determined that we did not design and maintain effective internal control over the step one goodwill impairment testing that we performed in accordance with ASC 350, Intangibles – Goodwill and Other and ASC 360, Property, Plant, and Equipment, as of April 30, 2017 and December 31, 2017, respectively.
Specifically, the Company’s review control did not operate at a sufficient level of precision to identify the improper assumptions used in our impairment analyses.
We concluded that this lack of review in sufficient detail of the analyses was a material weakness in our internal controls.
We wrote off the JDL reporting unit goodwill in the second quarter of 2017 and have no remaining recorded goodwill.
To address the above, we are in the process of designing new review controls to value our business units to ensure that goodwill and long-lived asset impairment analyses are completed in a timely manner and in enough detail to operate at a sufficient level of precision to identify improper assumptions.
Additionally, controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more people, or by management override of the control.
Over time, controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
