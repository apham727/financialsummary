In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606).
Under the new standard, revenue is recognized when a customer obtains control of promised goods or services in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services.
On July 1, 2018, the Company adopted Topic 606 and related amendments (ASU 2015-14, Deferral of the Effective Date; ASU 2016-08, Principal versus Agent Considerations; ASU 2016-10, Identifying Performance Obligations and Licensing, ASU 2016-12, Narrow-Scope Improvements and Practical Expedients and ASU 2016-20, Technical Corrections and Improvements to Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers) using the modified retrospective method applied to all contracts that are not completed at the date of initial application (i.e., July 1, 2018).
Results for reporting periods beginning after July 1, 2018 are presented under Topic 606, while prior period amounts are not adjusted and continue to be reported in accordance with historic accounting standards under Topic 605.
There was no impact on the opening retained earnings as of July 1, 2018 due to the adoption of Topic 606.
Under Topic 605, the gross amount of accrued revenue reserves for price adjustments and other revenue reserves of $141.7 million was included within accounts receivable, net as of June 30, 2018.

•The Company has elected to exclude sales, use, value added, and some excise taxes, if applicable, from the measurement of the transaction price.
The transaction price excludes sales and other similar taxes.
The transaction price is calculated as selling price net of variable considerations, such as distributor price adjustments.
In determining the transaction price, the Company evaluates whether the price is subject to refund or adjustment to determine the net consideration that is expected to be entitled.
The Company elected the practical expedient to not disclose the value of unsatisfied performance obligations for (i) contracts with an original expected length of one year or less and (ii) contracts for which we recognize revenue at the amount to which we have the right to invoice for services performed.
Specific customer returns and allowances are considered within this estimate.
Accounts receivable related to consigned inventory is recognized when the customer takes title to such inventory from its consigned location, at which point inventory is relieved, title transfers, and the Company has a legally enforceable right to collection under the terms of the agreement with the related customers.

Level 2 - Observable inputs other than quoted prices included in Level 1, such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active, or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the asset or liability.
The Company’s Level 2 assets and liabilities consist of U.S. Treasury securities, agency securities, corporate debt securities, certificates of deposit, commercial paper and foreign currency forward contracts that are valued using quoted market prices or are determined using a yield curve model based on current market rates.

In circumstances involving a change of control of the Company followed by a downgrade of the rating of the 2027 Notes, the 2023 Notes or the 2018 Notes, the Company would be required to make an offer to repurchase the affected notes at a purchase price equal to 101% of the aggregate principal amount of such notes, plus accrued and unpaid interest.

The 1996 Plan was adopted by the board of directors to provide the grant of incentive stock options, non-statutory stock options, restricted stock units (“RSUs”), and market stock units (“MSUs”) to employees, directors, and consultants.
Pursuant to the 1996 Plan, the exercise price for incentive stock options and non-statutory stock options is determined to be the fair market value of the underlying shares on the date of grant.
RSUs granted to employees typically vest ratably over a four-year period and are converted into shares of the Company's common stock upon vesting, subject to the employee's continued service to the Company over that period.
RSUs granted after August 2017 will continue to vest post-employment at the Company for certain individuals satisfying specific eligibility requirements.
The fair value of options granted to employees under the 1996 Plan is estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option valuation model.
There were no stock options granted in the three months ended September 29, 2018 or September 23, 2017.
As of September 29, 2018, there was no unrecognized stock compensation from unvested stock options.
The fair value of RSUs and other awards under the Company’s 1996 Plan is estimated using the value of the Company’s common stock on the date of grant, reduced by the present value of dividends expected to be paid on the Company’s common stock prior to vesting.
The Company also estimates forfeitures at the time of grant and makes revisions to forfeitures on a quarterly basis.
The weighted-average fair value of RSUs and other awards granted was $54.98 and $41.69 per share for the three months ended September 29, 2018 and September 23, 2017, respectively.
The Company withheld shares totaling $7.5 million in value as a result of employee withholding taxes based on the value of the RSUs on their vesting date for the three months ended September 29, 2018.
As of September 29, 2018, there was $187.7 million of unrecognized compensation expense related to 6.2 million unvested RSUs and other awards, which is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of approximately 3.0 years.
Employees are granted rights to acquire common stock under the 2008 ESPP.
As of September 29, 2018 and September 23, 2017, there was $3.5 million and $2.9 million, respectively, of unrecognized compensation expense related to the 2008 ESPP.
Basic earnings (loss) per share are computed using the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period.
Diluted earnings (loss) per share incorporates the incremental shares issuable upon the assumed exercise of stock options, assumed release of unvested RSUs and other awards as well as MSUs, and assumed issuance of common stock under the 2008 ESPP using the treasury stock method.
For the three months ended September 29, 2018 and September 23, 2017, no stock awards were determined to be anti-dilutive and therefore none were excluded from the calculation of diluted earnings per share.
