The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements of Maxim Integrated Products, Inc. and all of its majority-owned subsidiaries (collectively, the “Company” or “Maxim Integrated”) included herein have been prepared by the Company pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”).
In the opinion of management, all adjustments of a normal recurring nature which were considered necessary for fair presentation have been included.
The year-end condensed consolidated balance sheet data were derived from audited consolidated financial statements but do not include all disclosures required by GAAP.
Accordingly, every fifth or sixth fiscal year will be a 53-week fiscal year.
Fiscal year 2017 was a 52-week fiscal year and fiscal year 2018 is a 53-week fiscal year.
The second quarter of fiscal year 2017 was a 13-week quarter and the second quarter of fiscal year 2018 was a 14-week quarter.
In August 2017, the FASB issued ASU 2017-12, Derivatives and Hedging (Topic 815), which is intended to improve accounting for hedging activities by expanding and refining hedge accounting for both nonfinancial and financial risk components and aligning the recognition and presentation of the effects of the hedging instrument and the hedged item in the financial statements.
There was no material change to the Company's consolidated financial statements as a result of this adoption.
This adoption was on a prospective basis and therefore had no impact on prior periods.
In January 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-01, Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities, which provides guidance for the recognition, measurement, presentation, and disclosure of financial assets and liabilities.
The application of this ASU will be by means of a cumulative-effect adjustment to the balance sheet.
The amendments related to equity securities without readily determinable fair values (including disclosure requirements) will be applied prospectively to equity investments that exist as of the date of adoption.
ASU 2016-02 requires a dual approach for lessee accounting under which a lessee would account for leases as finance leases or operating leases.
Both finance leases and operating leases will result in the lessee recognizing a right-of use asset and a corresponding lease liability.
For finance leases, the lessee would recognize interest expense and amortization of the right-of-use asset, and for operating leases, the lessee would recognize a straight-line total lease expense.
In March 2017, the FASB issued ASU 2017-07, Improving the Presentation of Net Periodic Pension Cost and Net Periodic Postretirement Benefit Cost, which requires employers that offer or maintain defined benefit plans to disaggregate the service component from the other components of net benefit cost and provides guidance on presentation of the service component and the other components of net benefit cost in the statement of operations.
In May 2017, the FASB issued ASU 2017-09, Compensation-Stock Compensation (Topic 718), Scope of Modification Accounting.
The amendments in this standard provide guidance about which changes to the terms or conditions of a share-based payment award require an entity to apply modification accounting in Topic 718.

Level 3 - Unobservable inputs to the valuation methodology that are significant to the measurement of the fair value of the assets or liabilities.

Pursuant to the 1996 Plan, the exercise price for incentive stock options and non-statutory stock options is determined to be the fair market value of the underlying shares on the date of grant.
RSUs granted to employees typically vest over a four-year period and are converted into shares of the Company's common stock upon vesting, subject to the employee's continued service to the Company over that period.
RSUs granted after August 2017 will continue to vest post-employment at the Company for certain individuals satisfying specific eligibility requirements.

As of March 31, 2018, there was less than $0.1 million of total unrecognized stock compensation cost related to less than 0.1 million unvested stock options, which is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of approximately 0.3 years.

The Company also estimates forfeitures at the time of grant and makes revisions to forfeitures on a quarterly basis.
The weighted-average fair value of RSUs and other awards granted was $54.81 and $42.30 per share for the three months ended March 31, 2018 and March 25, 2017, respectively and $44.49 and $37.02 per share for the nine months ended March 31, 2018 and March 25, 2017, respectively.
