The major end-markets in which our products are sold are the Automotive, Communications and Data Center, Computing, Consumer and Industrial markets.
Based on this definition, our most critical accounting policies include revenue recognition, which impacts the recording of net revenues; valuation of inventories, which impacts costs of goods sold and gross margins; the assessment of recoverability of long-lived assets, which impacts impairment of long-lived assets; assessment of recoverability of intangible assets and goodwill, which impacts impairment of goodwill and intangible assets; accounting for income taxes, which impacts the income tax provision; and assessment of litigation and contingencies, which impacts charges recorded in cost of goods sold, selling, general and administrative expenses and income taxes.
Except for the accounting policies and estimates outlined under Part I, Item 1.
Net revenues were $638.5 million and $575.7 million for the three months ended September 29, 2018 and September 23, 2017, respectively.
Revenue from consumer products was up 13%, primarily driven by higher sales of wearables, smartphones and other consumer products.

During the three months ended September 29, 2018 and September 23, 2017, approximately 89% and 89% of net revenues, respectively, were derived from customers outside of the United States.
While less than 1.0% of our sales are denominated in currencies other than U.S. dollars, we enter into foreign currency forward contracts to mitigate our risks on firm commitments and net monetary assets denominated in foreign currencies.
The impact of changes in foreign exchange rates on our revenue and results of operations for the three months ended September 29, 2018 and September 23, 2017 was immaterial.
Our gross margin percentages were 67.4% and 64.9% for the three months ended September 29, 2018 and September 23, 2017, respectively.
Research and development expenses were $112.7 million and $108.6 million for the three months ended September 29, 2018 and September 23, 2017, respectively, which represented 17.7% and 18.9% of net revenues for each respective period.
The $4.1 million increase was primarily attributable to an increase in salaries and related expenses.
Selling, general and administrative expenses were $81.5 million and $73.7 million for the three months ended September 29, 2018 and September 23, 2017, respectively, which represented 12.8% and 12.8% of net revenues for each respective period.

SEC Commission Staff Accounting Bulletin No.
No adjustment to the provisional Transition Tax charge was made in the first quarter of fiscal year 2019 as the Company continues to gather information and analyze available guidance to more precisely compute the amount of the Transition Tax.
The Act reduced the federal statutory tax rate from 35% to 21%, effective January 1, 2018, which resulted in a fiscal year 2018 federal statutory tax rate of 28.1% for the Company (average of a 35% rate for the first half of fiscal year 2018 and a 21% rate for the second half of fiscal year 2018).
The Act contains Global Intangible Low-Taxed Income (“GILTI”) provisions, which first impact the Company in fiscal year 2019.
The Company has elected to treat tax generated by the GILTI provisions as a period expense.
The Company’s federal statutory tax rate for the first quarter of fiscal year 2019 is 21%.
The Company’s effective tax rate for the three months ended September 29, 2018 of 15.5% was lower than the statutory rate primarily due to earnings of foreign subsidiaries, generated primarily by the Company's international operations managed in Ireland, that were taxed at lower rates, partially offset by tax expense related to GILTI.
The Company’s federal statutory tax rate for the first quarter of fiscal year 2018 was 35%.
The Act did not impact the federal statutory tax rate and income tax provision for the first quarter of fiscal year 2018 because it was enacted after the end of that quarter.
The Company’s effective tax rate for the three months ended September 23, 2017 of 14.6% was lower than the statutory rate primarily due to earnings of foreign subsidiaries, generated primarily by the Company's international operations managed in Ireland, that were taxed at lower rates, and a $2.0 million discrete benefit for excess tax benefits generated by the settlement of share-based awards, partially offset by share-based compensation for which no tax benefit is expected and $3.9 million of discrete interest accruals for unrecognized tax benefits.
At September 29, 2018 and June 30, 2018, our current quarter backlog was approximately $417.6 million and $441.1 million, respectively.
In backlog, we include orders with customer request dates within the next three months.
As is customary in the semiconductor industry, these orders may be canceled in most cases without penalty to customers.
All backlog numbers have been adjusted for estimated future distribution ship and debit pricing adjustments.
Cash provided by operating activities was $207.2 million in the three months ended September 29, 2018, a decrease of $12.5 million compared with the three months ended September 23, 2017.
This decrease was due primarily to an increase of $23.6 million in accounts receivable and an increase of $12.6 million in other current assets, offset by an increase in income before provision for income taxes, which resulted from higher revenue and improved gross margin.
Investing cash flows consist primarily of net investment purchases and maturities and capital expenditures.
The change was due primarily to purchasing $525.4 million less available-for-sale-securities and an increase of $301.8 million in proceeds from the maturity of available-for-sale securities during the three months ended September 29, 2018 compared to the three months ended September 23, 2017.
Net cash used in financing activities increased by approximately $72.3 million for the three months ended September 29, 2018 compared to the three months ended September 23, 2017.
The increase was primarily due to an increase of $37.2 million in repurchases of our common stock and a $26.4 million increase in dividends paid to stockholders during the three months ended September 29, 2018.
We anticipate that the available funds and cash generated from operations will be sufficient to meet cash and working capital requirements, including the anticipated level of capital expenditures, common stock repurchases, debt repayments and dividend payments for at least the next twelve months.
On November 21, 2013, we completed a public offering of $500 million aggregate principal amount of the Company's 2.5% senior unsecured and unsubordinated notes due on November 15, 2018 (“2018 Notes”).

As of September 29, 2018, we had not borrowed any amounts from this credit facility.
