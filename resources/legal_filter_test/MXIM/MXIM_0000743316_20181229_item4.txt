Our management, with the participation of our chief executive officer (“CEO”) and our chief financial officer (“CFO”), evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the “Exchange Act”) as of December 29, 2018.
Our management, including the CEO and the CFO, has concluded that the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of December 29, 2018.
A system of internal control over financial reporting is intended to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of consolidated financial statements in accordance with GAAP, and no control system, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide absolute assurance.
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect financial statement errors and misstatements.
None.
