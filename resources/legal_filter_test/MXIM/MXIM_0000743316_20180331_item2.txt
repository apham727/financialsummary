Based on this definition, our most critical accounting policies include revenue recognition, which impacts the recording of net revenues; valuation of inventories, which impacts costs of goods sold and gross margins; the assessment of recoverability of long-lived assets, which impacts impairment of long-lived assets; assessment of recoverability of intangible assets and goodwill, which impacts impairment of goodwill and intangible assets; accounting for income taxes, which impacts the income tax provision; and assessment of litigation and contingencies, which impacts charges recorded in cost of goods sold, selling, general and administrative expenses and income taxes.
Net revenues were $648.6 million and $581.2 million for the three months ended March 31, 2018 and March 25, 2017, respectively.

Net revenues were $1,846.9 million and $1,693.6 million for the nine months ended March 31, 2018 and March 25, 2017, respectively.
Revenue from industrial products was up 15%, driven by higher sales of control and automation products and other industrial products.
Revenue from consumer products was also up 5%, primarily due to higher shipments of products for smartphones.
The increase in revenue was also partially driven by the 14-week second quarter of fiscal year 2018 compared to the 13-week second quarter of fiscal year 2017.
During the three months ended March 31, 2018 and March 25, 2017, approximately 88% and 89% of net revenues, respectively, were derived from customers outside of the United States.
While less than 1.0% of our sales are denominated in currencies other than U.S. dollars, we enter into foreign currency forward contracts to mitigate our risks on firm commitments and net monetary assets denominated in foreign currencies.
Our gross margin percentages were 65.4% and 63.1% for the three months ended March 31, 2018 and March 25, 2017, respectively.
Our gross margin increased by 2.3 percentage points, primarily due to implementation of cost reduction initiatives and improved factory utilization.

On December 22, 2017 legislation, commonly referred to as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the “Act”), was enacted.
The primary impact of the Act in fiscal year 2018 is a reduction of our federal statutory tax rate from 35% to 28.1% (average of a 35% rate for the first half of fiscal year 2018 and a 21% rate for the second half of fiscal year 2018) and taxation of the higher of the accumulated unremitted earnings of our foreign subsidiaries as of November 2, 2017 or December 31, 2017 (“Repatriation Tax”).
The Act allows us to elect to pay the Repatriation Tax in eight annual interest free installments beginning in September 2018, although for accounting purposes the entire tax was recorded in the second quarter of fiscal year 2018.
We made a reasonable estimate of the Repatriation Tax and therefore recorded a provisional Repatriation Tax charge of $236.9 million in the second quarter of fiscal year 2018.
No adjustment to the provisional Repatriation Tax charge was made in the third quarter of fiscal year 2018 as we continue to gather information and analyze the available guidance to more precisely compute the amount of the Repatriation Tax.
In the three and nine months ended March 31, 2018, we recorded an income tax provision of $28.7 million and $328.0 million, respectively, compared to $30.2 million and $75.7 million for the three and nine months ended March 25, 2017, respectively.
Our effective tax rate for the three months ended March 31, 2018 was lower than the statutory rate primarily due to earnings of foreign subsidiaries, generated primarily by our international operations managed in Ireland, that were taxed at lower rates, and $4.6 million of discrete excess tax benefits generated by the settlement of share-based awards, partially offset by $5.1 million of discrete interest accruals for unrecognized tax benefits.
Our effective tax rate for the nine months ended March 31, 2018 was higher than the statutory rate primarily due to a $236.9 million discrete provisional charge for the Repatriation Tax, a $13.7 million discrete charge to remeasure deferred taxes as of the enactment date of the Act, and $13.1 million of discrete interest accruals for unrecognized tax benefits, partially offset by earnings of foreign subsidiaries, generated primarily by our international operations managed in Ireland, that were taxed at lower rates, and $8.3 million of discrete excess tax benefits generated by the settlement of share-based awards.
Our effective tax rate for the three and nine months ended March 25, 2017 was lower than the statutory rate primarily due to earnings of foreign subsidiaries, generated primarily by our international operations managed in Ireland, that were taxed at lower rates, and $4.3 million and $9.5 million of discrete excess tax benefits generated by the settlement of share-based awards in the three and nine months ended March 25, 2017, respectively, partially offset by stock-based compensation for which no tax benefit is expected and $3.6 million and $10.4 million of discrete interest accruals for unrecognized tax benefits in the three and nine months ended March 25, 2017, respectively.
At March 31, 2018 and June 24, 2017, our current quarter backlog was approximately $436.0 million and $389.1 million, respectively.
In backlog, we include orders with customer request dates within the next three months.
As is customary in the semiconductor industry, these orders may be canceled in most cases without penalty to customers.
All backlog numbers have been adjusted for estimated future distribution ship and debit pricing adjustments.
Cash provided by operating activities was $672.8 million in the nine months ended March 31, 2018, an increase of $136.1 million compared with the nine months ended March 25, 2017.
This increase was due primarily to an increase of $117.2 million in income before provision for income taxes, which resulted from higher revenue and improved gross margin.
Investing cash flows consist primarily of net investment purchases and maturities and capital expenditures.
The increase was due primarily to a $722.0 million increase in purchases of available-for-sale-securities, partially offset by $397.5 million increase in proceeds from maturity of available-for-sale securities during the nine months ended March 31, 2018.
Net cash used in financing activities decreased by approximately $84.7 million for the nine months ended March 31, 2018 compared to the nine months ended March 25, 2017.
This was partially offset by $104.0 million in higher repurchases of our common stock and a $40.2 million increase in dividends paid to stockholders during the nine months ended March 31, 2018.
We anticipate that the available funds and cash generated from operations will be sufficient to meet cash and working capital requirements, including the anticipated level of capital expenditures, common stock repurchases, debt repayments and dividend payments for at least the next twelve months.
On June 15, 2017, we completed a public offering of $500 million aggregate principal amount of our 3.45% senior unsecured and unsubordinated notes due on June 15, 2027 (“2027 Notes”).

The estimated fair value of outstanding long-term debt is $1,485 million and $1,516 million as of March 31, 2018 and June 24, 2017, respectively.
As of March 31, 2018, we did not have any material off-balance-sheet arrangements, as defined in Item 303(a)(4)(ii) of SEC Regulation S-K.
The stock repurchase authorization does not have an expiration date and the pace of repurchase activity will depend on factors such as current stock price, levels of cash generation from operations, cash requirements, and other factors.
The Company's prior repurchase authorization was cancelled and superseded by this new repurchase authorization.
In the fiscal quarter ended March 31, 2018, the Company repurchased approximately 2.1 million shares of its common stock for approximately $127.7 million.
As of March 31, 2018, the Company had remaining authorization of $746.4 million for future share repurchases.
