The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements of Maxim Integrated Products, Inc. and all of its majority-owned subsidiaries (collectively, the “Company” or “Maxim Integrated”) included herein have been prepared by the Company pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”).
The year-end condensed consolidated balance sheet data were derived from audited consolidated financial statements but do not include all disclosures required by GAAP.
Accordingly, every fifth or sixth fiscal year will be a 53-week fiscal year.
Fiscal year 2018 was a 53-week fiscal year and fiscal year 2019 is a 52-week fiscal year.
The second quarter of fiscal year 2019 was a 13-week quarter and the second quarter of fiscal year 2018 was a 14-week quarter.
In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued Accounting Standard Update ("ASU") 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606).
Under the new standard, revenue is recognized when a customer obtains control of promised goods or services in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services.
On July 1, 2018, the Company adopted Topic 606 and related amendments (ASU 2015-14, Deferral of the Effective Date; ASU 2016-08, Principal versus Agent Considerations; ASU 2016-10, Identifying Performance Obligations and Licensing, ASU 2016-12, Narrow-Scope Improvements and Practical Expedients and ASU 2016-20, Technical Corrections and Improvements to Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers) using the modified retrospective method applied to all contracts that are not completed at the date of initial application (i.e., July 1, 2018).
Results for reporting periods beginning after July 1, 2018 are presented under Topic 606, while prior period amounts are not adjusted and continue to be reported in accordance with historic accounting standards under Topic 605.
There was no impact on the opening retained earnings as of July 1, 2018 due to the adoption of Topic 606.
Under Topic 605, the gross amount of accrued revenue reserves for price adjustments and other revenue reserves of $141.7 million was included within accounts receivable, net as of June 30, 2018.
The adoption of Topic 606 has no impact on the total cash flows from operating, investing, or financing activities on the Condensed Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows.
•The Company does not disclose the value of unsatisfied performance obligations for (i) contracts with an original expected length of one year or less and (ii) contracts for which the Company recognizes revenue at the amount to which it has the right to invoice for services performed.
•The Company has elected to exclude sales, use, value added, and some excise taxes, if applicable, from the measurement of the transaction price.
The transaction price excludes sales and other similar taxes.
The Company recognizes revenue for sales to direct customers and distribution customers ("distributors") when a customer obtains control of promised goods or services in an amount that reflects the consideration which the Company expects to receive in exchange for those goods or services.
The transaction price is calculated as selling price net of variable considerations, such as distributor price adjustments.
In determining the transaction price, the Company evaluates whether the price is subject to refund or adjustment to determine the net consideration to which it is expected to be entitled.
The Company elected the practical expedient to not disclose the value of unsatisfied performance obligations for (i) contracts with an original expected length of one year or less and (ii) contracts for which it recognizes revenue at the amount to which it has the right to invoice for services performed.
Specific customer returns and allowances are considered within this estimate.
Accounts receivable related to consigned inventory is recognized when the customer takes title to such inventory from its consigned location, at which point inventory is relieved, title transfers, and the Company has a legally enforceable right to collection under the terms of the agreement with the related customers.
Customers are generally required to pay for products and services within the Company’s standard terms, which is net 30 days from the date of invoice.
The Company does not have any significant financing components greater than one year.
Historically, such differences have not been material.
To date, actual distributor claims activity has been materially consistent with the estimates that the Company has made based on its historical rates.
SEC Disclosure Update and Simplification.
In August 2018, the SEC adopted a final rule under SEC Release No.
33-10532, Disclosure Update and Simplification, which amends certain disclosure requirements that were redundant and outdated.
The rule also requires registrants to include in their interim financial statements a reconciliation of changes in stockholders' equity in the notes or as a separate statement.
The Company has adopted the final rule as of December 29, 2018, and has included a reconciliation of the changes in stockholders' equity in this Form 10-Q.
ASU 2016-02 requires a dual approach for lessee accounting under which a lessee would account for leases as finance leases or operating leases.
Both finance leases and operating leases will result in the lessee recognizing a right-of-use asset and a corresponding lease liability.
For finance leases, the lessee would recognize interest expense and amortization of the right-of-use asset, and for operating leases, the lessee would recognize a straight-line total lease expense.
Level 1 - Quoted (unadjusted) prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
Level 2 - Observable inputs other than quoted prices included in Level 1, such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active, or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the asset or liability.
The Company’s Level 2 assets and liabilities consist of U.S. Treasury securities, agency securities, corporate debt securities, certificates of deposit, commercial paper and foreign currency forward contracts that are valued using quoted market prices or are determined using a yield curve model based on current market rates.
Level 3 - Unobservable inputs to the valuation methodology that are significant to the measurement of the fair value of the assets or liabilities.
The Company's Level 3 assets and liabilities consist of acquisition related contingent consideration liabilities.
During the six months ended December 29, 2018 and the year ended June 30, 2018, there were no transfers in or out of Level 3 from other levels in the fair value hierarchy.
There were no assets or liabilities measured at fair value on a non-recurring basis as of December 29, 2018 and June 30, 2018 other than impairments of long-lived assets.

The Company has established a program that primarily utilizes foreign currency forward contracts to offset the risks associated with the effects of certain foreign currency exposures.
The Company does not use these foreign currency forward contracts for trading purposes.
The Company designates certain forward contracts as hedging instruments pursuant to Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) 815, Derivatives and Hedging (“ASC 815”).

On June 15, 2017, the Company completed a public offering of $500 million aggregate principal amount of the Company's 3.45% senior unsecured and unsubordinated notes due in June 2027 (“2027 Notes”), with an effective interest rate of 3.5%.
Interest on the 2027 Notes is payable semi-annually in arrears on June 15 and December 15 of each year, commencing on December 15, 2017.
The net proceeds of this offering were approximately $495.2 million, after issuing at a discount and deducting paid expenses.
On November 21, 2013, the Company completed a public offering of $500 million aggregate principal amount of the Company’s 2.5% coupon senior unsecured and unsubordinated notes due in November 2018 (“2018 Notes”), with an effective interest rate of 2.6%.
Interest on the 2018 Notes is payable semi-annually in arrears on May 15 and November 15 of each year, commencing on May 15, 2014.

On March 18, 2013, the Company completed a public offering of $500 million aggregate principal amount of the Company’s 3.375% senior unsecured and unsubordinated notes due in March 2023 (“2023 Notes”), with an effective interest rate of 3.5%.
Interest on the 2023 Notes is payable semi-annually in arrears on March 15 and September 15 of each year.
The net proceeds of this offering were approximately $490.0 million, after issuing at a discount and deducting paid expenses.
The debt indentures that govern the 2027 Notes and the 2023 Notes include covenants that limit the Company's ability to grant liens on its facilities and to enter into sale and leaseback transactions, which could limit the Company's ability to secure additional debt funding in the future.
In circumstances involving a change of control of the Company followed by a downgrade of the rating of the 2027 Notes or the 2023 Notes, the Company would be required to make an offer to repurchase the affected notes at a purchase price equal to 101% of the aggregate principal amount of such notes, plus accrued and unpaid interest.
Amortized discount and expenses, as well as interest expense associated with the notes, were $11.2 million and $12.4 million during the three months ended December 29, 2018 and December 30, 2017, respectively.
Amortized discount and expenses, as well as interest expense associated with the notes, were $23.6 million and $24.7 million, respectively, during the six months ended December 29, 2018 and December 30, 2017.
The estimated fair value of the Company’s outstanding debt obligations was approximately $955 million as of December 29, 2018.
The estimated fair value of the debt is based primarily on observable market inputs and is a Level 2 measurement.
The Company recorded interest expense of $11.7 million and $12.5 million during the three months ended December 29, 2018, and December 30, 2017, respectively.
The Company recorded interest expense of $24.6 million and $25.1 million during the six months ended December 29, 2018 and December 30, 2017, respectively.
As of December 29, 2018, the Company had access to a $350 million senior unsecured revolving credit facility with certain institutional lenders that expires on June 27, 2019.
The facility fee is at a rate per annum that varies based on the Company’s index debt rating and any advances under the credit agreement will accrue interest at a base rate plus a margin based on the Company’s index debt rating.
The credit agreement required the Company to comply with certain covenants, including a requirement that the Company maintain a ratio of debt to EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization) of not more than 3 to 1 and a minimum interest coverage ratio (EBITDA divided by interest expense) greater than 3.5 to 1.
As of December 29, 2018, the Company had not borrowed any amounts from this credit facility and was in compliance with all debt covenants.
For the balance of the Company’s financial instruments, cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable and other accrued liabilities, the carrying amounts approximate fair value due to their short maturities.
At December 29, 2018, the Company had one stock incentive plan, the Company's 1996 Stock Incentive Plan (the “1996 Plan”) and one employee stock purchase plan, the 2008 Employee Stock Purchase Plan (the “2008 ESPP”).
The 1996 Plan was adopted by the board of directors to provide the grant of incentive stock options, non-statutory stock options, restricted stock units (“RSUs”), and market stock units (“MSUs”) to employees, directors, and consultants.
Pursuant to the 1996 Plan, the exercise price for incentive stock options and non-statutory stock options is determined to be the fair market value of the underlying shares on the date of grant.
RSUs granted to employees typically vest ratably over a four-year period and are converted into shares of the Company's common stock upon vesting, subject to the employee's continued service to the Company over that period.
RSUs granted after August 2017 will continue to vest post-employment at the Company for certain individuals satisfying specific eligibility requirements.
MSUs granted to employees typically vest over a four-year cliff period and are converted into shares of the Company's common stock upon vesting, subject to the employee's continued service to the Company over that period.
The number of shares that are released at the end of the performance period can range from zero to a maximum cap depending on the Company's performance.
MSUs granted after August 2017 will continue to vest post-employment at the Company for certain individuals satisfying specific eligibility requirements.
The expenses included in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income for RSUs include expenses related to MSUs of $2.9 million and $2.2 million for the three months ended December 29, 2018 and December 30, 2017, respectively and $5.3 million and $3.6 million for the six months ended December 29, 2018 and December 30, 2017, respectively.
The fair value of options granted to employees under the 1996 Plan is estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option valuation model.
There were no stock options granted in the three and six months ended December 29, 2018 and December 30, 2017.
As of December 29, 2018, there was no unrecognized stock compensation from unvested stock options.
The fair value of RSUs and other awards under the Company’s 1996 Plan is estimated using the value of the Company’s common stock on the date of grant, reduced by the present value of dividends expected to be paid on the Company’s common stock prior to vesting.
The Company also estimates forfeitures at the time of grant and makes revisions to forfeitures on a quarterly basis.
The weighted-average fair value of RSUs and other awards granted was $50.90 and $50.36 per share for the three months ended December 29, 2018 and December 30, 2017, respectively, and 54.71 and $42.41 per share for the six months ended December 29, 2018 and December 30, 2017, respectively.
The Company withheld shares totaling $5.9 million and $13.4 million, respectively, in value as a result of employee withholding taxes based on the value of RSUs on vesting date for the three and six months ended December 29, 2018.
As of December 29, 2018, there was $170.4 million of unrecognized compensation expense related to 5.7 million unvested RSUs and other awards, which is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of approximately 2.9 years.
The weighted-average fair value of MSUs granted was $75.48 and $51.03 per share for the six months ended December 29, 2018 and December 30, 2017, respectively.
As of December 29, 2018, there was $35.0 million of unrecognized compensation expense related to 1.1 million unvested MSUs, which is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of approximately 2.9 years.
Employees are granted rights to acquire common stock under the 2008 ESPP.
As of December 29, 2018 and December 30, 2017, there was $8.6 million and $6.5 million, respectively, of unrecognized compensation expense related to the 2008 ESPP.
Basic earnings (loss) per share are computed using the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period.
Diluted earnings (loss) per share incorporates the incremental shares issuable upon the assumed exercise of stock options, assumed release of unvested RSUs and other awards as well as MSUs, and assumed issuance of common stock under the 2008 ESPP using the treasury stock method.
For the three months ended December 30, 2017 and December 29, 2018, there were approximately 4.8 million and zero stock awards, respectively, that were determined to be anti-dilutive and therefore excluded from the calculation of diluted earnings per share.
For the six months ended December 29, 2018 and December 30, 2017, no stock awards were determined to be anti-dilutive and therefore none were excluded from the calculation of diluted earnings per share.
280, Segment Reporting (“ASC 280”), the Company considers operating segments to be components of the Company’s business for which separate financial information is available that is evaluated regularly by the Company’s Chief Operating Decision Maker in deciding how to allocate resources and in assessing performance.
The Chief Operating Decision Maker for the Company was assessed and determined to be the CEO.
Accordingly, the Company has determined that it has a single operating and reportable segment.

In the three and six months ended December 29, 2018, the Company recorded an income tax provision of $50.8 million and $87.0 million, respectively, compared to $272.9 million and $299.4 million for the three and six months ended December 30, 2017, respectively.
SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin No.
During the measurement period, the Company gathered additional information and analyzed available guidance to more precisely compute the amount of the Transition Tax.
In the second quarter of fiscal year 2019 the Company completed this work and recorded a discrete $22.1 million measurement period adjustment for the Transition Tax, which increased the Company’s effective tax rate for the three and six months ended December 29, 2018 by 12.1% and 5.3%, respectively.
The Act reduced the federal statutory tax rate from 35% to 21%, effective January 1, 2018, which resulted in a fiscal year 2018 federal statutory tax rate of 28.1% for the Company (average of a 35% rate for the first half of fiscal year 2018 and a 21% rate for the second half of fiscal year 2018).
The Act included Global Intangible Low-Taxed Income (“GILTI”) provisions, which impact the Company in fiscal year 2019.
The Company has elected to treat tax generated by the GILTI provisions as a period expense.
The Company’s effective tax rate for the three and six months ended December 30, 2017 was higher than the statutory rate primarily due to a $236.9 million discrete provisional charge for the Transition Tax, a $13.7 million discrete charge to remeasure deferred taxes as of the enactment date of the Act, $4.2 million and $8 million discrete charges for interest accruals for unrecognized tax benefits in the three and six months ended December 30, 2017, respectively, partially offset by earnings of foreign subsidiaries, generated primarily by the Company's international operations managed in Ireland, that were taxed at lower rates.
The $444.0 million primarily relates to matters involving federal taxation of cross-border transactions.
The Company disagreed with the proposed transfer pricing adjustments and related penalties, and in September 2016, the Company filed a protest to challenge the proposed adjustments and request a conference with the Appeals Office of the IRS.
In June 2018, the Company made advance payments for audit and post-audit years tax of $140.7 million and interest of $37.4 million.
These payments will reduce the accrual of interest on audit and post-audit years tax deficiencies that would be owed if the preliminary understanding is finalized.

The Company also recorded $41.9 million of goodwill in connection with this acquisition.
The goodwill is not deductible for tax purposes.
The Company monitors the recoverability of goodwill recorded in connection with acquisitions, by reporting unit, annually, or more often if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable.
No indicators or instances of impairment were identified in the six months and fiscal year ended December 29, 2018 and June 30, 2018, respectively.
