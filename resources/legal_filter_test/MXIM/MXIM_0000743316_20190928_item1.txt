•the practical expedient to combine lease and non-lease components. 
The Company also elected an accounting policy in which it will not apply the recognition requirements to leases with an initial term of 12 months or less. 
Effective June 30, 2019, the first day of adoption, the Company recognized $61.0 million of operating lease right-of-use assets and $65.2 million of operating lease liabilities on its Consolidated Balance Sheet. The adoption of the standard had an immaterial impact on retained earnings. 
The Company determines if an arrangement is, or contains, a lease at inception. Lease right-of-use (ROU) assets are recorded as other assets, short-term lease obligations are recorded as accrued expenses and long-term lease obligations are recorded as other liabilities on the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheet. The Company’s classes of assets include real estate leases, equipment leases, and vehicle leases.
Lease ROU assets and lease liabilities are recognized based on the present value of future minimum lease payments over the lease term at commencement date. When discount rates implicit in leases cannot be readily determined, the Company uses its incremental borrowing rate based on information available at commencement date in determining the present value of future payments.
Lease terms may include options to extend or terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain that the Company will exercise such option. Lease expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term. The Company elected to combine lease and non-lease components for all asset classes. In addition, the Company does not apply the recognition requirements to leases with lease terms of 12 months or less. 
Level 1 - Quoted (unadjusted) prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
Level 2 - Observable inputs other than quoted prices included in Level 1, such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active, or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the asset or liability. 
Level 3 - Unobservable inputs to the valuation methodology that are significant to the measurement of the fair value of the assets or liabilities.
The Company's Level 3 assets and liabilities consist of acquisition-related contingent consideration liabilities.

At September 28, 2019, the Company had one stock incentive plan, the Company's 1996 Stock Incentive Plan (the “1996 Plan”) and one employee stock purchase plan, the 2008 Employee Stock Purchase Plan (the “2008 ESPP”). The 1996 Plan was adopted by the Board of Directors to provide the grant of incentive stock options, non-statutory stock options, restricted stock units (“RSUs”), and market stock units (“MSUs”) to employees, directors, and consultants. 
Pursuant to the 1996 Plan, the exercise price for incentive stock options and non-statutory stock options is determined to be the fair market value of the underlying shares on the date of grant. Options typically vest ratably over a four-year period measured from the date of grant. Options generally expire no later than seven years after the date of grant, subject to earlier termination upon an optionee's cessation of employment or service.
RSUs granted to employees typically vest ratably over a four-year period and are converted into shares of the Company's common stock upon vesting, subject to the employee's continued service to the Company over that period. RSUs granted after August 2017 will continue to vest post-employment at the Company for certain individuals satisfying specific eligibility requirements.
The fair value of options granted to employees under the 1996 Plan is estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option valuation model. 
There were no stock options granted in the three months ended September 28, 2019 and September 29, 2018. 
As of September 28, 2019, there was no unrecognized stock compensation from unvested stock options.
The fair value of RSUs and other awards under the Company’s 1996 Plan is estimated using the value of the Company’s common stock on the date of grant, reduced by the present value of dividends expected to be paid on the Company’s common stock prior to vesting. The Company also estimates forfeitures at the time of grant and makes revisions to forfeitures on a quarterly basis.
The weighted-average fair value of RSUs and other awards granted was $47.61 and $54.98 per share for the three months ended September 28, 2019 and September 29, 2018, respectively.
The Company withheld shares totaling $9.9 million in value as a result of employee withholding taxes based on the value of RSUs on their vesting date for the three months ended September 28, 2019. Total payments for employees’ tax obligations to taxing authorities are reflected as financing activities within the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.
As of September 28, 2019, there was $193.4 million of unrecognized compensation expense related to 5.8 million unvested RSUs and other awards, which is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of approximately 3.0 years. 
As of September 28, 2019, there was $37.1 million of unrecognized compensation expense related to 1.0 million unvested MSUs, which is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of approximately 3.0 years.
