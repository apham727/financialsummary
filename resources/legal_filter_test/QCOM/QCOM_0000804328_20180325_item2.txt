This information should be read in conjunction with the condensed consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto included in “Part I, Item 1” of this Quarterly Report and with “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” for the year ended September 24, 2017 contained in our 2017 Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Although forward-looking statements in this Quarterly Report reflect our good faith judgment, such statements can only be based on facts and factors currently known by us.
Readers are urged not to place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date of this Quarterly Report.
We undertake no obligation to revise or update any forward-looking statements in order to reflect any event or circumstance that may arise after the date of this Quarterly Report.
•We continue to invest significant resources toward advancements primarily in support of 4G- and 5G-based technologies as well as other technologies to extend the demand for our products and generate new or expanded licensing opportunities, including within adjacent industry segments outside traditional cellular industries, such as automotive, the Internet of Things (IoT) and networking.
•On November 6, 2017, Broadcom Limited (Broadcom) announced an unsolicited proposal to acquire all of the outstanding shares of our common stock (collectively with Broadcom’s subsequent proposal, the Proposed Transaction).
On March 4, 2018, the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS) issued an Interim Order Regarding the Proposed Acquisition of Qualcomm, Inc. by Broadcom Limited stating that there were national security risks to the United States that arose as a result of, and in connection with, the Proposed Transaction, and prohibiting Qualcomm from accepting or taking any action in furtherance of accepting the Proposed Transaction or any other proposed merger, acquisition or takeover agreement with Broadcom.
We develop and commercialize foundational technologies and products used in mobile devices and other wireless products, including network equipment, broadband gateway equipment and consumer electronics devices.
Our reportable segments are operated by QUALCOMM Incorporated and its direct and indirect subsidiaries.
Substantially all of our products and services businesses, including QCT, and substantially all of our engineering, research and development functions, are operated by Qualcomm Technologies, Inc. (QTI), a wholly-owned subsidiary of QUALCOMM Incorporated, and QTI’s subsidiaries.
QTL is operated by QUALCOMM Incorporated, which owns the vast majority of our patent portfolio.
Neither QTI nor any of its subsidiaries has any right, power or authority to grant any licenses or other rights under or to any patents owned by QUALCOMM Incorporated.
The increases in equipment and services revenues in the second quarter and first six months of fiscal 2018 were primarily due to increases in QCT and QSI revenues.
The decreases in licensing revenues in the second quarter and first six months of fiscal 2018 were primarily due to decreases in QTL revenues, partially offset by the reduction to licensing revenues of $974 million recorded in the second quarter of fiscal 2017 related to the BlackBerry arbitration decision.
The dollar increases in research and development expenses in the second quarter and first six months of fiscal 2018 were primarily attributable to increases of $19 million and $160 million, respectively, in costs related to the development of integrated circuit technologies, including 5G technology and radio frequency front-end (RFFE) technologies from our RF360 Holdings joint venture, which was formed in the second quarter of fiscal 2017.
The increase in research and development expenses in the first six months of fiscal 2018 was partially offset by a $30 million impairment charge on certain intangible assets recorded in the first quarter of fiscal 2017.
Selling, general and administrative expenses included $145 million and $250 million in the second quarter and first six months of fiscal 2018, respectively, related to litigation costs, an increase of $102 million and $171 million, respectively.
The remaining dollar increases in selling, general and administrative expenses in the second quarter and first six months of fiscal 2018 were primarily attributable to increases of $77 million in each period in other professional fees and $63 million and $65 million, respectively, in costs related to other legal matters, all of which were primarily driven by Broadcom’s withdrawn takeover proposal, and $14 million and $38 million, respectively, in employee-related expenses, which included our RF360 Holdings joint venture.
Other expenses in the second quarter and first six months of fiscal 2018 included $310 million in restructuring and restructuring-related charges related to our Cost Plan.
Other expenses in the first six months of fiscal 2018 also included a $1.2 billion charge related to the European Commission (EC) fine.
Other expenses in the second quarter of fiscal 2017 consisted of $53 million in foreign currency losses related to the Korea Fair Trade Commission (KFTC) fine, which was accrued in the first quarter of fiscal 2017, and $25 million in restructuring and restructuring-related charges related to our Strategic Realignment Plan.
Other expenses in the first six months of fiscal 2017 consisted of a $921 million charge related to the KFTC fine, including related foreign currency losses, and $33 million in restructuring and restructuring-related charges related to our Strategic Realignment Plan.
In the first quarter of fiscal 2017, we began divesting a substantial portion of our marketable securities portfolio in order to finance, in part, the proposed acquisition of NXP.
As a result, we recorded net realized gains and impairment losses on such marketable securities that we sold and expected to sell before their anticipated recovery, respectively, in fiscal 2017.
The net losses on foreign currency transactions in the second quarter and first six months of fiscal 2018 were primarily attributable to currency exchange rate movements on amounts accrued for the EC and Taiwan Fair Trade Commission (TFTC) fines.
January 1, 2018, implementing a modified territorial tax system and imposing a one-time repatriation tax on deemed repatriated earnings and profits of U.S.-owned foreign subsidiaries (the Toll Charge).
We recorded a $15 million net tax benefit discretely in the second quarter of fiscal 2018 related to refining estimates associated with the estimated Toll Charge and the estimated impact of remeasurement of U.S. deferred tax assets and liabilities.
Our annual effective tax rate is estimated to be approximately 438% for fiscal 2018 as compared to the 18% effective income tax rate for fiscal 2017, primarily as a result of the estimated charge of $5.95 billion recorded to income tax expense in the first six months of fiscal 2018 related to the combined effect of the Toll Charge, the remeasurement of deferred tax assets and liabilities and our decision to no longer indefinitely reinvest certain foreign earnings.
Tax benefits from foreign income taxed at rates lower than rates in the U.S. are expected to be approximately 31% in fiscal 2018, compared to 32% in fiscal 2017, primarily due to the lower U.S federal statutory income tax rate enacted by the Tax Legislation, partially offset by lower estimated U.S. revenues primarily related to decreased royalty revenues from Apple’s contract manufacturers and the other licensee in dispute.
The annual effective tax rate of 18% for fiscal 2017 reflected the KFTC and TFTC fines (see “Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements, Note 6.
The effective tax rate for the second quarter of fiscal 2018 was lower than the estimated annual effective tax rate primarily resulting from the estimated charge of $5.96 billion recorded discretely to income tax expense in the first quarter of fiscal 2018 related to the effects of certain components of the Tax Legislation and the EC fine recorded in the first quarter of fiscal 2018, as well as the $15 million net tax benefit recorded discretely in the second quarter of fiscal 2018 related to refining estimates associated with the Tax Legislation.
The effective tax rates of 13% and 17% for the second quarter and first six months of fiscal 2017, respectively, reflected tax benefits from foreign income taxed at rates lower than rates in the U.S. of 25% and 20%, respectively, primarily resulting from the reduction to our United States revenues related to the BlackBerry arbitration decision, as well as the KFTC fine recorded in the first six months of fiscal 2017.
We believe that it is reasonably possible that the total amounts of unrecognized tax benefits at March 25, 2018 may increase or decrease in the next 12 months.
These examinations are at various stages with respect to assessments, claims, deficiencies and refunds, many of which are open for periods after fiscal 2000.
As of March 25, 2018, we believe that adequate amounts have been reserved for based on facts known.
The following should be read in conjunction with the financial results for the second quarter and first six months of fiscal 2018 for each reportable segment included in this Quarterly Report in “Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements, Note 7.
The increases in QCT revenues in the second quarter and first six months of fiscal 2018 were primarily due to increases in equipment and services revenues.
The increases in equipment and services revenues in the second quarter and first six months of fiscal 2018 were primarily due to increases in RFFE product revenues of $314 million and $748 million, respectively, primarily driven by revenues from our RF360 Holdings joint venture, which was formed in the second quarter of fiscal 2017, and increases of $99 million and $374 million, respectively, related to higher MSM and accompanying PM unit shipments.
The increases in equipment and services revenues in the second quarter and first six months of fiscal 2018 were partially offset by decreases of $51 million and $179 million, respectively, resulting from the net impact of lower average selling prices and favorable product mix, and decreases in connectivity product revenues of $97 million and $100 million, respectively.
QCT EBT as a percentage of revenues in the second quarter and first six months of fiscal 2018 increased primarily due to increases in gross margin percentage and the favorable impact of higher revenues relative to operating expenses.
QCT accounts receivable decreased by 14% in the first six months of fiscal 2018 from $1.81 billion to $1.56 billion, primarily due to a 16% decline in revenues in the second quarter of fiscal 2018 compared to the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017, partially offset by the timing of integrated circuit shipments.
QCT inventories decreased by 12% in the first six months of fiscal 2018 from $2.02 billion to $1.77 billion primarily due to a decrease in the overall quantity of units on hand.
QTL results in the second quarter and first six months of fiscal 2018 were negatively impacted by our continued dispute with Apple and its contract manufacturers (who are Qualcomm licensees), as well as the previously disclosed dispute with another licensee.
We did not record any revenues in the first six months of fiscal 2018 for royalties due on sales of Apple’s or the other licensee’s products.
Royalty revenues related to the products of Apple’s contract manufacturers and the other licensee in dispute were approximately $970 million and $1.7 billion in the second quarter and first six months of fiscal 2017, respectively.
The decreases in QTL revenues in the second quarter and first six months of fiscal 2018 were also attributable to lower royalty revenues recognized related to devices sold in prior periods.
Excluding the impact of these items, QTL revenues in the second quarter and first six months of fiscal 2018 increased primarily due to increases in revenues per reported unit.
QTL revenues for the first six months of fiscal 2018 were also positively impacted by an increase in reported sales of CDMA-based products (including multi-mode products that also implement OFDMA).
QTL EBT as a percentage of revenues in the second quarter and first six months of fiscal 2018 decreased primarily due decreases in QTL revenues and increases in selling, general and administrative expenses resulting from higher litigation costs.
certain other licensees and sales of certain unlicensed products.
While we have reached agreements with many licensees, negotiations with certain other licensees and unlicensed companies are ongoing, particularly in emerging regions, including China, and additional litigation may become necessary if negotiations fail to resolve the relevant issues.
The increases in QSI EBT in the second quarter and first six months of fiscal 2018 were primarily due to the impact of $26 million and $36 million, respectively, resulting from the net impact of higher revenues and higher costs associated with certain development contracts with one of our equity method investees and increases of $25 million and $37 million, respectively, in net realized gains on investments.
The increase in QSI EBT in the second quarter of fiscal 2018 was partially offset by an increase of $10 million in impairment losses on investments.
•Decisions by certain companies to utilize our competitors’ integrated circuit products in all or a portion of their devices.
For example, commencing with the iPhone 7 (which was released in September 2016), we are no longer the sole supplier of modems for new iPhone product launches, as Apple utilizes modems from one of our competitors in a portion of such devices.
We expect that in the future Apple will utilize our competitors’ modems in a portion of or potentially all iPhones.
Accordingly, QCT revenues from modem sales for iPhones declined in fiscal 2017 and may continue to decline in the future, in part depending on the extent of Apple’s utilization of competitors’ modems and the mix of the various versions of its products that are sold.
Overall QCT revenues, as well as profitability, may similarly decline unless offset by sales of integrated circuit products to other customers, including those outside of traditional cellular industries, such as the Internet of Things (IoT), automotive and networking.
On February 20, 2018, we announced that Qualcomm River Holdings reached an agreement with NXP to increase to $127.50 per share its previously announced cash tender offer to acquire all of the issued and outstanding common shares of NXP, for estimated total cash consideration to be paid to NXP’s shareholders of $44 billion.
The transaction is subject to receipt of regulatory approvals from the Ministry of Commerce in the People’s Republic of China (MOFCOM) and other closing conditions.
In May 2017, we issued an aggregate principal amount of $11.0 billion of unsecured floating- and fixed-rate notes with varying maturities, of which a portion will be used to fund the purchase price and other related transactions.
We have also secured $3.0 billion in committed financing through a 2018 Revolving Credit Facility, which is available to, in part, finance the transaction.
The remaining amount will be funded with cash held by our foreign entities, which will result in the use of a substantial portion of our cash and cash equivalents.
Qualcomm River Holdings and NXP may terminate the Purchase Agreement under certain circumstances.
If the Purchase Agreement is terminated in certain circumstances, including termination by NXP to enter into a superior proposal for an alternative acquisition transaction or a termination following a change of recommendation by NXP’s board of directors, NXP will be required to pay Qualcomm River Holdings a termination fee of $1.25 billion.
If the Purchase Agreement is terminated under certain circumstances involving the failure to obtain the required regulatory approvals or the failure of NXP to complete certain pre-closing reorganization steps in all material respects, Qualcomm River Holdings will be required to pay NXP a termination fee of $2.0 billion.
Under Amendment No.
2, in addition to its existing rights, NXP will be entitled to receive the termination fee (i) if the Purchase Agreement is terminated in accordance with its terms for any reason (subject to certain exceptions) and, at the time of any such termination, approval by MOFCOM, or in any jurisdiction where the parties’ previously obtained clearance will expire or where the applicable antitrust authority has required or requested a resubmission for clearance, has not been received, or (ii) at any time after July 25, 2018 if, at such time, approval by MOFCOM, or in any jurisdiction where the parties’ previously obtained clearance will expire or where the applicable antitrust authority has required or requested a resubmission for clearance, has not been received.
In November 2016, as required by the Purchase Agreement, we entered into four letters of credit for an aggregate amount of $2.0 billion pursuant to which NXP will have the right to draw amounts to fund the potential termination fee payable to NXP.
Each letter of credit is required to be fully cash collateralized in an amount equal to 100% of its face value through deposits with the issuers of the letters of credit.
At March 25, 2018, the letters of credit were fully collateralized through bank time and demand deposits.
The net increase in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities was primarily due to net cash provided by operating activities and $1.2 billion of net issuances of our outstanding commercial paper debt, partially offset by $1.7 billion in cash dividends paid, $425 million in payments to repurchase shares of our common stock and $411 million in capital expenditures.
Total cash provided by operating activities was impacted by continued actions taken by Apple and its contract manufacturers, as well as the previously disclosed dispute with another licensee, who did not report or pay royalties due in the first six months of fiscal 2018.
Our days sales outstanding, on a consolidated basis, increased to 61 days at March 25, 2018 as compared to 56 days at September 24, 2017 primarily due to the timing of the collection of payments from certain of our licensees.
The decrease in inventories was primarily due to a decrease in the overall quantity of units on hand.
Our 2016 Amended and Restated Revolving Credit Facility provides for unsecured revolving facility loans, swing line loans and letters of credit in the aggregate amount of $5.0 billion, of which $530 million and $4.47 billion will expire in February 2020 and November 2021, respectively.
Our 2018 Revolving Credit Facility provides for unsecured delayed-draw revolving facility loans in the aggregate amount of $3.0 billion.
Proceeds from the 2018 Revolving Credit Facility, if drawn, will be used to finance, in part, the proposed acquisition of NXP.
We have an unsecured commercial paper program, which provides for the issuance of up to $5.0 billion of commercial paper.
Proceeds from the term loan facilities, if drawn, will be used to finance, in part, the proposed acquisition of NXP.
In May 2017, we issued an aggregate principal amount of $11.0 billion in nine tranches of unsecured floating- and fixed-rate notes, with maturity dates starting in 2019 through 2047.
Net proceeds from the issuance of the notes of $10.95 billion are intended to be used to fund a portion of the purchase price of our planned acquisition of NXP and other related transactions and also for general corporate purposes.
Our 2019 floating-rate notes, 2020 floating-rate notes, 2019 fixed-rate notes and 2020 fixed-rate notes issued in May 2017 for an aggregate principal amount of $4.0 billion are subject to a special mandatory redemption at a price equal to 101% of the aggregate principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest to, but excluding, the date of such mandatory redemption.
The redemption is required on the first to occur of (i) the termination of the NXP purchase agreement or (ii) if the NXP transaction has not closed, by June 1, 2018.
In May 2015, we issued an aggregate principal amount of $10.0 billion in eight tranches of unsecured floating- and fixed-rate notes, with $1.5 billion maturing in 2018 and the remaining with maturity dates in 2020 through 2045.
The amount and timing of such additional borrowings will be subject to a number of factors, including the cash flow generated by United States-based entities, acquisitions and strategic investments, acceptable interest rates and changes in corporate income tax law, among other factors.
Additional information regarding our outstanding debt at March 25, 2018 is provided in this Quarterly Report in “Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements, Note 5.
The Tax Legislation, which was signed into law during the first quarter of fiscal 2018, resulted in an estimated $5.3 billion charge related to the Toll Charge.
In the first six months of fiscal 2018, we repurchased and retired 6.8 million shares of our common stock for $425 million, before commissions.
At March 25, 2018, $1.2 billion remained authorized for repurchase under our stock repurchase program.
As a result of our proposed acquisition of NXP and the pending use of our cash and marketable securities, we currently expect to repurchase shares in the next few years to offset dilution from the issuance of common stock under our employee benefit plans.
On April 17, 2018, we announced a cash dividend of $0.62 per share on our common stock, payable on June 20, 2018 to stockholders of record as of the close of business on May 30, 2018.
We intend to continue to use cash dividends as a means of returning capital to stockholders, subject to capital availability and our view that cash dividends are in the best interests of our stockholders.
We have no significant contractual obligations not fully recorded on our consolidated balance sheets or fully disclosed in the notes to our condensed consolidated financial statements.
Additional information regarding our financial commitments at March 25, 2018 is provided in this Quarterly Report in “Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements, Note 3.
Income Taxes,” “Note 5.
Commitments and Contingencies” and “Note 8.
Acquisitions.”
Information regarding recent accounting pronouncements and the impact of those pronouncements, if any, on our consolidated financial statements is provided in this Quarterly Report in “Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements, Note 1.
You should also consider the other information set forth in this Quarterly Report and in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended September 24, 2017 in evaluating our business and our prospects, including but not limited to our financial statements and the related notes and “Part I, Item 2.
Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.”
Our proposed acquisition of NXP Semiconductors N.V. involves a number of risks, including, among others, the risk that we fail to complete the acquisition, regulatory risks, risks associated with our use of a significant portion of our cash and our taking on significant indebtedness, other financial risks, integration risks, and risk associated with the reactions of customers, suppliers and employees.
certain exceptions, and NXP’s material compliance with its covenants, in the Purchase Agreement; and (vi) the completion of certain internal reorganization steps with respect to NXP and the disposition of certain non-core assets of NXP.
We cannot provide assurance that the conditions to the completion of the proposed transaction will be satisfied, and if the proposed transaction is not completed, we would not realize any of the expected benefits.
The final regulatory approval required in connection with the proposed transaction may not be obtained or may contain materially burdensome conditions.
If any conditions or changes to the structure of the proposed transaction are required to obtain this regulatory approval, they may have the effect of jeopardizing or delaying completion of the proposed transaction or reducing our anticipated benefits.
•we could be required to pay a termination fee to NXP of $2.0 billion;
The proposed transaction will be our largest acquisition to date, by a significant margin.
The benefits we expect to realize from the proposed transaction will depend, in part, on our ability to integrate the businesses successfully and efficiently.
Our revenues depend on commercial network deployments, expansions and upgrades of CDMA, OFDMA and other communications technologies; our customers’ and licensees’ sales of products and services based on these technologies; and customers’ demand for our products and services.
•we are unable to drive the adoption of our products and services into networks and devices, including devices beyond traditional cellular applications, based on CDMA, OFDMA and other communications technologies.
designs; scalability; and the ability of the system technology to meet customers’ immediate and future network requirements.
Additionally, the semiconductor industry has experienced and may continue to experience consolidation, which could result in significant changes to the competitive landscape.
•continue to develop brand recognition to effectively compete against better known companies in computing and other consumer driven segments and to deepen our presence in significant emerging regions.
We derive a significant portion of our consolidated revenues from a small number of customers and licensees.
One of our largest customers purchases our Mobile Data Modem (MDM) products, which do not include our integrated application processor technology and which have lower revenue and margin contributions than our combined modem and application processor products.
To the extent such customer takes device share from our other customers who purchase our integrated modem and application processor products, our revenues and margins may be negatively impacted.
decide not to purchase (either directly or through their contract manufacturers), or to reduce or discontinue their purchases of, our integrated circuit products.
Any such reduction in revenues would also impact our cash resources available for other purposes, such as research and development.
In addition, in connection with our participation in SDOs, we, like other patent owners, generally have made contractual commitments to such organizations to license those of our patents that would necessarily be infringed by standard-compliant products as set forth in those commitments.
Some SDOs, courts and governmental agencies have adopted and may in the future adopt some or all of these interpretations or proposals in a manner adverse to our interests, including in litigation to which we may not be a party.
Our business, particularly our licensing business, may suffer as a result of adverse rulings in government investigations or proceedings.
Changes in our patent licensing practices, whether due to governmental investigations, private legal proceedings challenging those practices or otherwise, could adversely impact our business and results of operations.
We rely primarily on patent, copyright, trademark and trade secret laws, as well as nondisclosure and confidentiality agreements, international treaties and other methods, to protect our proprietary information, technologies and processes, including our patent portfolio.
Policing unauthorized use of our products, technologies and proprietary information is difficult and time consuming.
The steps we have taken have not always prevented, and we cannot be certain the steps we will take in the future will prevent, the misappropriation or unauthorized use of our proprietary information and technologies, particularly in foreign countries where the laws may not protect our proprietary intellectual property rights as fully or as readily as United States laws or where the enforcement of such laws may be lacking or ineffective.
We expect that the European Union will adopt a unitary patent system in the next few years that may broadly impact that region’s patent regime.
In addition, we cannot be certain that the laws and policies of any country or the practices of any standards bodies, foreign or domestic, with respect to intellectual property enforcement or licensing or the adoption of standards, will not be changed in the future in a way detrimental to our licensing program or to the sale or use of our products or technologies.
Our growth increasingly depends on our ability to extend our technologies, products and services into new and expanded product areas, such as RFFE, and adjacent industry segments outside of traditional cellular industries, such as automotive, IoT and networking, among others.
Our research, development and other investments in these new and expanded product areas and industry segments, and related technologies, products and services, as well as in our existing technologies, products and services and new technologies, such as 5G, may not generate operating income or contribute to future results of operations that meet our expectations.
In particular, our future growth significantly depends on new and expanded product areas, such as RFFE, and adjacent industry segments, such as automotive, IoT (including the connected home, smart cities, wearables, voice and music and robotics), data center, networking, computing and machine learning, among others; our ability to develop leading and cost-effective technologies, products and services for new and expanded product areas and adjacent industry segments; and third parties incorporating our technology, products and services into devices used in these product areas and industry segments.
Accordingly, we intend to continue to make substantial investments in these new and expanded product areas and adjacent industry segments, and in developing new products, services and technologies for these product areas and industry segments.
There are numerous risks associated with our operation and control of manufacturing facilities of our joint venture with TDK, RF360 Holdings, including a higher portion of fixed costs relative to a fabless model, environmental compliance and liability, exposure to natural disasters, timely supply of equipment and materials and manufacturing difficulties.
Manufacturing facilities are characterized by a higher portion of fixed costs relative to a fabless model.
In less favorable industry environments, in particular, we may be faced with a decline in the utilization rates of our manufacturing facilities due to decreases in demand for our products.
During such periods, our manufacturing facilities could operate at lower capacity levels, while the fixed costs associated with full capacity continue to be incurred, resulting in lower gross profit.
We are also required to obtain and maintain environmental permits from governmental authorities for certain of our operations.
We cannot make assurances that we will be at all times in compliance with such laws, regulations and permits.
Certain environmental laws impose strict, and in certain circumstances, joint and several, liability on current or previous owners or operators of real property for the cost of investigation, removal or remediation of hazardous substances.
Certain of these laws also assess liability on persons who arrange for hazardous substances to be sent to disposal or treatment facilities when such facilities are found to be contaminated.
In addition, we could also be held liable for consequences arising out of human exposure to hazardous substances or other environmental damage.
If tsunamis, flooding, earthquakes, volcanic eruptions or other natural disasters, or geopolitical conflicts, were to damage, destroy or disrupt our manufacturing facilities, it could disrupt our operations, delay new production and shipments of inventory or result in costly repairs, replacements or other costs.
In addition, natural disasters or geopolitical conflicts may result in disruptions in transportation, distribution channels or supply chains, or significant increases in the prices of raw materials.
If the supply-demand balance is disrupted, it may considerably increase costs of manufacturing due to increased prices we pay for raw materials or fuel.
From time to time, suppliers may extend lead times, limit the amounts supplied to us or increase prices due to capacity constraints or other factors.
Further, it may be difficult or impossible to substitute one piece of equipment for another or replace one type of material with another.
A failure by our suppliers to deliver our requirements could result in disruptions to our manufacturing operations.
We own a very strong portfolio of issued and pending patents related to 3G, 4G, 5G and other technologies.
It is critical that we continue to evolve our patent portfolio, particularly in 5G.
In addition, new connectivity and other services are emerging that rely on devices that may or may not be used on traditional cellular networks, such as devices used in the IoT and automotive industry segments.
Standards, even de facto standards, that develop as these technologies mature, in particular those that do not include a base level of interoperability, may impact our ability to obtain royalties at all or that are equivalent to those that we receive for products used in cellular communications.
Further, the licenses granted to and from us under a number of our license agreements include only patents that are either filed or issued prior to a certain date.
As a result, there are agreements with some licensees where later patents are not licensed by or to us.
Additionally, certain of our license agreements (including essentially all of our recent agreements in China) are effective for a specified term.
In order to license or to obtain a license to such later patents after the expiration of a specified term, or to receive royalties after the specified time period, we will need to extend or modify such license agreements or enter into new license agreements with such licensees.
Accordingly, to the extent not renewed on their terms or by election for an additional (generally multi-year) period, if applicable, we will need to extend or modify such license agreements or enter into new license agreements with such licensees more frequently than we have done historically.
might not be able to renew those license agreements, or enter into new license agreements, in the future without affecting the material terms and conditions of our license agreements with such licensees, and such modifications or new agreements may negatively impact our revenues.
If there is a delay in renewing a license agreement prior to its expiration, there would be a delay in our ability to recognize revenues related to that licensee’s product sales.
•natural disasters or geopolitical conflicts, particularly in Asia, impacting our suppliers.
Although we have long-term contracts with our suppliers, many of these contracts do not provide for long-term capacity commitments.
One or more of our suppliers or potential alternate suppliers may manufacture CDMA- or OFDMA-based integrated circuits that compete with our products.
In addition, we may not receive reasonable pricing, manufacturing or delivery terms from our suppliers.
Certain legal matters, including certain claims by other companies that we infringe their intellectual property, are described more fully in this Quarterly Report in “Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements, Note 6.
On January 16, 2018, we announced a cost plan designed to align our cost structure to our long-term margin targets.
As part of this plan, we will implement a series of targeted reductions across our businesses to reduce annual costs by $1 billion, excluding incremental costs resulting from any future acquisition of a business.
We expect these cost reductions to be fully captured in fiscal 2019.
Regulations in the United States require that we determine whether certain materials used in our products, referred to as conflict minerals, originated in the Democratic Republic of the Congo or an adjoining country (collectively, the Covered Countries), or were from recycled or scrap sources.
Other countries or regions may impose similar requirements in the future.
The verification and reporting requirements, in addition to customer demands for conflict free sourcing, impose additional costs on us and on our suppliers and may limit the sources or increase the prices of materials used in our products.
Further, if we are unable to determine that the conflict minerals used in our products do not directly or indirectly finance or benefit armed groups in the Covered Countries, we may face challenges with our customers that place us at a competitive disadvantage, and our reputation may be harmed.
Similarly, other laws and regulations have been adopted or proposed that require additional transparency regarding the employment practices of our suppliers, and any failure to maintain responsible sourcing practices could also adversely affect our relationships with customers and our reputation.
Our use of open source software may harm our business.
Certain of our software and our suppliers’ software may contain or may be derived from “open source” software, and we have seen, and believe we will continue to see, an increase in customers requesting that we develop products, including software associated with our integrated circuit products, that incorporate open source software elements and operate in an open source environment, which, under certain open source licenses, may offer accessibility to a portion of a product’s source code and may expose related intellectual property to adverse licensing conditions.
certain obligations on us if we were to distribute derivative works of the open source software.
For example, these obligations may require us to make source code for the derivative works available to our customers in a manner that allows them to make such source code available to their customers or license such derivative works under a particular type of license that is different than what we customarily use to license our software.
In the past, securities class action litigation has been brought against a company following periods of volatility in the market price of its securities.
Securities litigation could result in substantial uninsured costs and divert management’s attention and our resources.
Certain legal matters, including certain securities litigation brought against us, are described more fully in this Quarterly Report in “Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements, Note 6.
The fair values of our investments are subject to fluctuation based primarily on market price volatility, as well as the underlying operations of the associated investment, among other things.
The sensitivity of and risks associated with the market value of our investment portfolio are described more fully in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for our fiscal year ended September 24, 2017 and in “Part I, Item 3.
Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk” in this Quarterly Report.
