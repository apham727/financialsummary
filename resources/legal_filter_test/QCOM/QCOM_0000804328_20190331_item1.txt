Financial Statement Preparation.
These condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (GAAP) for interim financial information and the instructions to Rule 10-01 of Regulation S-X.
Accordingly, they do not include all of the information and notes required by GAAP for complete financial statements.
In the opinion of management, the interim financial information includes all normal recurring adjustments necessary for a fair statement of the results for the interim periods.
These condensed consolidated financial statements are unaudited and should be read in conjunction with our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2018.
Operating results for interim periods are not necessarily indicative of operating results for an entire fiscal year.
We operate and report using a 52-53 week fiscal year ending on the last Sunday in September.
Each of the three-month and six-month periods ended March 31, 2019 and March 25, 2018 included 13 weeks and 26 weeks, respectively.
Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current year presentation.
As previously disclosed, in connection with the preparation of our condensed consolidated financial statements for the three months ended December 30, 2018, we identified an immaterial error related to the recognition of certain royalty revenues of our QTL (Qualcomm Technology Licensing) segment in the quarterly and annual periods in fiscal 2018 and third and fourth quarters and annual period in fiscal 2017.
A summary of revisions to certain previously reported financial information presented herein for comparative purposes is included in Note 11.
At March 31, 2019, total unrecognized compensation expense related to nonvested restricted stock units granted prior to that date was $1.4 billion, which is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 2.2 years.
At March 31, 2019, we had outstanding 30.4 million restricted stock units that contain only a service requirement and 3.1 million stock options that contain only a service requirement.
Adoption of this new accounting guidance most significantly impacts the timing of sales-based royalty revenues, which are the vast majority of our QTL segment’s revenues.
Prior to adoption, we recognized sales-based royalties as revenues in the period in which such royalties were reported by licensees, which was after the conclusion of the quarter in which the licensees’ sales occurred and when all other revenue recognition criteria had been met.
Since we do not invoice for sales-based royalties estimated and recognized in any given quarter until after the conclusion of that quarter (which is generally the following quarter when such royalties are reported by licensees), revenues recognized from sales-based royalties results in unbilled receivables (included in accounts receivable, net on the consolidated balance sheet).
The adoption of ASC 606 did not otherwise have a material impact.
The new accounting guidance also impacts the timing of recognizing certain customer incentives, which are recorded as a reduction to revenues in the period that the related revenues are earned.
Under the new accounting guidance, we estimate the amount of all customer incentives.
Adoption of the new accounting guidance had no impact to net cash provided (used) by operating, financing or investing activities on our condensed consolidated statement of cash flows for the six months ended March 31, 2019.
In November 2016, the FASB issued new accounting guidance that requires companies to include restricted cash and cash equivalents as a component in total cash and cash equivalents on the statement of cash flows.
As a result, the consolidated statement of cash flows no longer reflects transfers between cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash and cash equivalents.
We adopted the new accounting guidance in the first quarter of fiscal 2019 using the retrospective transition method, which results in certain amounts in fiscal 2018 being adjusted to conform to the new accounting guidance.
This includes restricted cash and cash equivalents held during fiscal 2018 related to funds deposited as collateral for outstanding letters of credit in connection with a then proposed acquisition.
Restricted cash and cash equivalents related to the outstanding letters of credit totaled $2.0 billion at the end of the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017 and second quarter of fiscal 2018.
There was no impact of this change on the activity presented on the condensed consolidated statement of cash flows for the six months ended March 25, 2018.
Recent Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet Adopted.
Accounting Policy Update.
We also generate revenues by performing software hosting, software development and other services and from other product sales.
Revenues from providing services are typically recognized over time as our performance obligation is satisfied.
Revenues from providing services were less than 5% of total revenues for all periods presented.
Substantially all of QCT’s revenues consist of equipment revenues that are recognized at a point in time, and substantially all of QTL’s revenues represent licensing revenues that are recognized over time.
Revenues recognized from performance obligations satisfied (or partially satisfied) in previous periods were $398 million and $394 million for the three and six months ended March 31, 2019, respectively, and primarily relate to certain customer incentives, QTL royalty revenues recognized related to devices sold in prior periods and revenues related to a development contract with one of our equity method investees.
Unearned revenues (which are considered contract liabilities) consist primarily of license fees for intellectual property with continuing performance obligations.
In the six months ended March 31, 2019, we recognized revenues of $258 million that were recorded as unearned revenues at October 1, 2018.
Our remaining performance obligations are primarily comprised of certain customer contracts for which QTL received license fees upfront.
At March 31, 2019, we had $1.8 billion of remaining performance obligations, of which $235 million, $470 million, $423 million, $416 million and $193 million was expected to be recognized as revenues for the remainder of fiscal 2019 and each of the subsequent four years from fiscal 2020 through 2023, respectively, and $77 million thereafter.
Prior to the adoption of the new accounting guidance in the first quarter of fiscal 2019, investments in non-marketable equity securities were recorded at cost less impairment, if any, with any losses resulting from an impairment recognized in investment and other income, net.
Beginning in fiscal 2019, investments in non-marketable equity securities are recorded at cost, less impairments (if any), adjusted for observable price changes in orderly transactions for identical or similar securities (if any).
All gains and losses on investments in non-marketable equity securities, realized and unrealized, are recognized in investment and other income, net.
Accounts receivable at March 31, 2019 and September 30, 2018 included approximately $960 million related to the short payment in the second quarter of fiscal 2017 of royalties reported by and deemed collectible from Apple’s contract manufacturers.
This same amount was recorded in customer-related liabilities (in other current liabilities) for Apple, since we do not have the contractual right to offset these amounts.
On April 16, 2019, we entered into settlement agreements with Apple and its contract manufacturers to dismiss all outstanding litigation between the parties, and as a result, these amounts were settled (Note 12).
In the second quarter of fiscal 2019, non-marketable debt and equity securities (non-cash consideration) with an aggregate fair value of $98 million were received related to a development contract with one of our equity method investees.
Since contract revenues were no longer constrained, such amount was recognized as revenues from a previously satisfied performance obligation in the second quarter of fiscal 2019.
In addition, in the second quarter of fiscal 2019, non-marketable equity securities (non-cash consideration) with a fair value of $53 million were received in connection with the sale of certain assets as part of the Cost Plan (Note 8).
Beginning on August 4, 2019, for a period of 60 days, we have the option to acquire (and the minority owner has the option to sell) the minority ownership interest in the RF360 Holdings joint venture for $1.15 billion, and we expect one of such options to be exercised during this period.
At March 31, 2019 and September 30, 2018, the accreted value of such amount was included in other current liabilities.
Reclassifications from accumulated other comprehensive income included adjustments of $51 million to the opening retained earnings balance as a result of the adoption of new accounting guidance in the first quarter of fiscal 2019 related to financial instruments and hedge instruments (Note 1).
Other income in the three months ended March 31, 2019 included a $43 million gain due to the partial recovery of a fine imposed in fiscal 2009 resulting from our appeal of the Korea Fair Trade Commission (KFTC) decision (Note 6), partially offset by $25 million in net restructuring and restructuring-related charges related to our Cost Plan (Note 8).
Other expenses in the six months ended March 31, 2019 included $204 million in net restructuring and restructuring-related charges related to our Cost Plan, partially offset by a $43 million gain due to the partial recovery of a fine we previously paid to the KFTC and a $31 million gain related to a favorable legal settlement.
Other expenses in the three months ended March 25, 2018 consisted of $310 million in restructuring and restructuring-related charges related to our Cost Plan.
Other expenses in the six months ended March 25, 2018 also included a $1.2 billion charge related to the European Commission (EC) fine (Note 6).
As a result, without considering the effects of the agreements with Apple and its contract manufacturers signed in April 2019 (Note 12), substantially all of our income is in the U.S. and qualifies for preferential treatment as FDII, and the impact of GILTI and BEAT are negligible.
Upon adoption of new accounting guidance in the first quarter of fiscal 2019, we recorded a deferred tax asset of approximately $2.6 billion, primarily related to the distributed intellectual property, with an adjustment to opening retained earnings (Note 1).
Our second quarter of fiscal 2019 results reflected an estimated annual effective income tax rate of approximately 6% benefit for fiscal 2019, which included the impact of the tax benefit of $570 million (which was recorded discretely in the first quarter) due to establishing new U.S. net deferred tax assets from making certain check-the-box elections and excluded the effects of the agreements with Apple and its contract manufacturers signed in April 2019.
The annual effective tax rate for fiscal 2018 was also impacted by the termination fee paid to NXP Semiconductors N.V. (NXP), the EC fine, settlement with the Taiwan Fair Trade Commission (TFTC), allocation of expenses to our U.S. operations and new Singapore tax incentives.
The effective tax rate of 18% for the second quarter of fiscal 2019 was higher than the estimated annual effective tax rate of 6% benefit primarily due to the tax benefit of $570 million, which was recorded discretely in the first quarter.
Unrecognized tax benefits were $228 million and $217 million at March 31, 2019 and September 30, 2018, respectively.
These examinations are at various stages with respect to assessments, claims, deficiencies and refunds, many of which are open for periods after fiscal 2000.
As of March 31, 2019, we believe that adequate amounts have been reserved for based on facts known.
Stock Repurchase Program.
The stock repurchase program has no expiration date.
In September 2018, we entered into three accelerated share repurchase agreements (ASR Agreements) with three financial institutions under which we paid an aggregate of $16.0 billion upfront and received an initial delivery of 178.4 million shares of our common stock, which were retired.
The final number of shares to be repurchased will be based on the volume-weighted average stock price of our common stock during the terms of the transactions, less a discount and subject to adjustments pursuant to the terms and conditions of the ASR Agreements and will also be retired upon delivery to us.
The ASR Agreements are scheduled to terminate in early September 2019, but may terminate earlier in certain circumstances.
At settlement, one or more of the financial institutions may be required to deliver additional shares of common stock to us, or under certain circumstances, we may be required to deliver shares of common stock or make a cash payment to one or more of the financial institutions, with the method of settlement at our election.
In the six months ended March 31, 2019 and March 25, 2018, we repurchased and retired 16.8 million and 6.8 million shares for $1.0 billion and $425 million, respectively, before commissions.
At March 31, 2019, $7.8 billion remained authorized for repurchase under our stock repurchase program.
We have an Amended and Restated Revolving Credit Facility (Revolving Credit Facility) that provides for unsecured revolving facility loans, swing line loans and letters of credit in an aggregate amount of up to $5.0 billion, of which $530 million and $4.47 billion will expire in February 2020 and November 2021, respectively.
Proceeds from the Revolving Credit Facility, if drawn, are expected to be used for general corporate purposes.
The margins over the reserve-adjusted Eurocurrency Rate and the Base Rate will be 0.805% and 0.00% per annum, respectively.
At March 31, 2019 and September 30, 2018, we had not borrowed any funds under the Revolving Credit Facility.
We have an unsecured commercial paper program, which provides for the issuance of up to $5.0 billion of commercial paper.
Net proceeds from this program are used for general corporate purposes.
Maturities of commercial paper can range from 1 day to up to 397 days.
At March 31, 2019 and September 30, 2018, we had $1.0 billion of outstanding commercial paper included in short-term debt with a weighted-average interest rate of 2.74% and 2.35%, respectively, which included fees paid to the commercial paper dealers, and weighted-average remaining days to maturity of
29 days and 16 days, respectively.
The carrying value of the outstanding commercial paper approximated its estimated fair value at March 31, 2019 and September 30, 2018.
At March 31, 2019 and September 30, 2018, the aggregate fair value of the notes, based on Level 2 inputs, was approximately $15.4 billion and $15.1 billion, respectively.
We may redeem the outstanding fixed-rate notes at any time in whole, or from time to time in part, at specified make-whole premiums as defined in the applicable form of note.
We may not redeem the outstanding floating-rate notes prior to maturity.
The obligations under the notes rank equally in right of payment with all of our other senior unsecured indebtedness and will effectively rank junior to all liabilities of our subsidiaries.
At March 31, 2019, we had outstanding interest rate swaps with an aggregate notional amount of $1.8 billion related to the May 2015 Notes, which effectively converted approximately 43% and 50% of the fixed-rate notes due in 2020 and 2022, respectively, into floating-rate notes.
The net gains and losses on the interest rate swaps, as well as the offsetting gains or losses on the related fixed-rate notes attributable to the hedged risks, are recorded as interest expense in the current period.
We did not enter into interest rate swaps in connection with issuance of the May 2017 Notes.
The effective interest rates for the notes include the interest on the notes, amortization of the discount, which includes debt issuance costs, and if applicable, adjustments related to hedging.
Interest is payable in arrears quarterly for the floating-rate notes and semi-annually for the fixed-rate notes.
Cash interest paid related to our commercial paper program and long-term debt, net of cash received from the related interest rate swaps, was $281 million and $317 million in the six months ended March 31, 2019 and March 25, 2018, respectively.
Debt Covenants.
The Revolving Credit Facility requires that we comply with certain covenants, including one financial covenant to maintain a ratio of consolidated earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization to consolidated interest expense, as defined in each of the respective agreements, of not less than three to one at the end of each fiscal quarter.
additional indebtedness ranking equal to the notes, paying dividends, issuing securities or repurchasing securities issued by us or our subsidiaries.
At March 31, 2019 and September 30, 2018, we were in compliance with the applicable covenants under the Revolving Credit Facility.

On July 17, 2017, Compal, Foxconn, Pegatron and Wistron each filed third-party complaints for contractual indemnity against Apple seeking to join Apple as a party to the action.
On July 18, 2017, Apple filed an answer to these third-party complaints acknowledging its indemnity agreements and consenting to be joined.

Other Commitments.
At March 31, 2019, we committed to fund certain strategic investments up to $226 million, of which $32 million is expected to be funded in fiscal 2020.
The remaining commitments do not have fixed funding dates and are subject to certain conditions.
Commitments represent the maximum amounts to be funded under these arrangements; actual funding may be in lesser amounts or not at all.

Beginning in the first quarter of fiscal 2019, all research and development costs associated with 5G technologies are included in segment results.
Additionally, beginning in the first quarter of fiscal 2019, certain research and development costs associated with early research and development that were historically included in our QCT segment are allocated to our QTL segment.

Revenues and operating results related to the Small Cells business were included in nonreportable segments through the end of fiscal 2018.
Prior period segment information has not been adjusted to conform to the new segment presentation as such adjustments are insignificant.
In the second quarter of fiscal 2018, we announced a Cost Plan designed to align our cost structure to our long-term margin targets.
As part of this plan, we initiated a series of targeted actions across our businesses with the objective to reduce annual costs by $1 billion, excluding incremental costs resulting from any future acquisition of a business.
Actions taken under this plan have been completed and have resulted in us achieving substantially all of this target in fiscal 2019 based on our run rate exiting the second quarter of fiscal 2019, excluding litigation costs that are in excess of the baseline spend.
This consisted of restructuring-related charges of $156 million, primarily related to asset impairment charges (and included a $45 million net gain from the sale of certain assets related to wireless electric vehicle charging applications and the sale of our mobile health nonreportable segment), and restructuring charges of $48 million, primarily related to severance and consulting costs.
Since inception of the Cost Plan, we have incurred a total of $892 million in net restructuring and restructuring-related charges.
The remaining restructuring and restructuring-related charges to be incurred related to the plan are expected to be negligible.
The restructuring accrual, a portion of which was included in payroll and other benefits related liabilities with the remainder included in other current liabilities, is expected to be substantially paid within the next 12 months.
At March 31, 2019 and September 30, 2018, the restructuring accrual was $25 million and $83 million, respectively.
There were no transfers of marketable securities into or out of Level 3 during the six months ended March 31, 2019 and March 25, 2018.

Assets Measured and Recorded at Fair Value on a Nonrecurring Basis.
During the six months ended March 31, 2019, certain intangible assets and goodwill were written down to their estimated fair values (Note 8).
We also measured certain non-marketable equity securities received as non-cash consideration at fair value on a nonrecurring basis (Note 2).
The estimation of fair value required the use of significant unobservable inputs, and as a result, the fair value measurements were classified as Level 3.
During the six months ended March 31, 2019 and March 25, 2018, we did not have any other significant assets or liabilities that were measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis.
Debt securities with no single maturity date included auction rate securities.
During the three and six months ended March 31, 2019, there were no realized gains or losses on sales of available-for-sale debt securities, and during the three and six months ended March 25, 2018, gross realized gains were $11 million.
As of March 31, 2019 and September 30, 2018, unrealized gains and losses on available for sale debt securities were negligible.
As of September 30, 2018, available-for-sale securities also included equity securities with a fair value of $167 million, including an unrealized gain of $63 million.
We revised certain prior period financial statements for an immaterial error related to the recognition of certain royalty revenues of our QTL segment (Note 1).
A summary of revisions to our previously reported financial statements presented herein for comparative purposes is included below (in millions, except per share data).
Revised Consolidated Balance Sheet.
Revised Consolidated Statements of Operations.
Revised Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income (Loss).
We revised our condensed consolidated statement of cash flows for the six months ended March 25, 2018 for this correction, which had no impact to net cash provided by operating activities in the period.
QTL segment results were revised for this correction (Note 7), which resulted in a decrease in QTL revenues and EBT (earnings before income taxes) of $41 million for the three months ended March 25, 2018 and $74 million for the six months ended March 25, 2018.
On April 16, 2019, we entered into settlement agreements with Apple and its contract manufacturers to dismiss all outstanding litigation between the parties.
We also entered into a six-year global patent license agreement with Apple, effective as of April 1, 2019, which includes an option for Apple to extend for two additional years, and a multi-year chipset supply agreement with Apple.
While we continue to assess the accounting impacts of the agreements, we currently expect to record revenues from previously satisfied performance obligations in the third quarter of fiscal 2019 resulting from the settlement, consisting of a payment from Apple and the release of our obligations to pay or refund Apple and the contract manufacturers certain customer-related liabilities.
Such event is considered a nonrecognized subsequent event.
Information regarding certain legal proceedings is provided in this Quarterly Report in “Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements, Note 6.
