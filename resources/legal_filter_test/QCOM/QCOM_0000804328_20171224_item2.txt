This information should be read in conjunction with the condensed consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto included in “Part I, Item 1” of this Quarterly Report and with “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” for the year ended September 24, 2017 contained in our 2017 Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Although forward-looking statements in this Quarterly Report reflect our good faith judgment, such statements can only be based on facts and factors currently known by us.
Readers are urged not to place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date of this Quarterly Report.
We undertake no obligation to revise or update any forward-looking statements in order to reflect any event or circumstance that may arise after the date of this Quarterly Report.
•We continue to invest significant resources toward advancements primarily in support of 4G- and 5G-based technologies as well as other technologies to extend the demand for our products and generate new or expanded licensing opportunities, including within adjacent industry segments outside traditional cellular industries, such as automotive, the Internet of Things (IoT) and networking.
We develop and commercialize foundational technologies and products used in mobile devices and other wireless products, including network equipment, broadband gateway equipment and consumer electronics devices.
Our reportable segments are operated by QUALCOMM Incorporated and its direct and indirect subsidiaries.
Substantially all of our products and services businesses, including QCT, and substantially all of our engineering, research and development functions, are operated by Qualcomm Technologies, Inc. (QTI), a wholly-owned subsidiary of QUALCOMM Incorporated, and QTI’s subsidiaries.
QTL is operated by QUALCOMM Incorporated, which owns the vast majority of our patent portfolio.
Neither QTI nor any of its subsidiaries has any right, power or authority to grant any licenses or other rights under or to any patents owned by QUALCOMM Incorporated.
The increase in equipment and services revenues was primarily due to an increase in QCT revenues.
The decrease in licensing revenues was primarily due to a decrease in QTL revenues.
The dollar increase in research and development expenses was primarily attributable to an increase of $141 million in costs related to the development of integrated circuit technologies, including 5G technology and radio frequency front-end (RFFE) technologies from our RF360 Holdings joint venture, which was formed in the second quarter of fiscal 2017, and related software products, partially offset by a $30 million impairment charge on certain intangible assets recorded in the first quarter of fiscal 2017.
Other expenses in the first quarter of fiscal 2018 consisted of a $1.2 billion charge related to the European Commission fine.
Other expenses in the first quarter of fiscal 2017 consisted of a $868 million charge related to the Korea Fair Trade Commission (KFTC) fine and $8 million in restructuring and restructuring-related charges related to our Strategic Realignment Plan.
The increase in interest expense was primarily attributable to the issuance of an aggregate principal amount of $11.0 billion of unsecured floating- and fixed-rate notes in May 2017.
substantial portion of our marketable securities portfolio in order to finance, in part, the proposed acquisition of NXP.
As a result, we recognized net realized gains and impairment losses on such marketable securities that we sold and expected to sell before their anticipated recovery, respectively, in fiscal 2017.
Accordingly, our federal statutory income tax rate for fiscal 2018 reflects a blended rate of approximately 25%.
We have preliminarily accounted for the effects of the Tax Legislation, which resulted in a charge of $5.9 billion to income tax expense in the first quarter of fiscal 2018, comprised of $5.3 billion related to the estimated Toll Charge and $562 million resulting from the estimated impact of remeasurement of U.S. deferred tax assets and liabilities that existed at the end of fiscal 2017 at a lower enacted corporate income tax rate.
Our annual effective tax rate was also impacted by the $1.2 billion fine related to the EC investigation, which is not deductible for tax purposes and is attributable to a foreign jurisdiction.
Tax benefits from foreign income taxed at rates lower than rates in the U.S. are expected to be approximately 20% in fiscal 2018, compared to 32% in fiscal 2017, primarily due to the lower U.S federal statutory income tax rate enacted by the Tax Legislation, partially offset by lower estimated U.S. revenues primarily related to decreased royalty revenues from Apple’s contract manufacturers.
The annual effective tax rate of 18% for fiscal 2017 reflected the KFTC and TFTC fines (see “Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements, Note 6.
The effective tax rate for the first quarter of fiscal 2018 was higher than the estimated annual effective tax rate primarily resulting from the estimated charge of $6.0 billion recorded to income tax expense in the first quarter of fiscal 2018 related to the effects of certain components of the Tax Legislation, as well as the $1.2 billion fine related to the EC investigation.
The effective tax rate of 22% for the first quarter of fiscal 2017 reflected tax benefits from foreign income taxed at rates lower than rates in the U.S. of 15%, as well as the $868 million charge related to the KFTC fine.
We believe that it is reasonably possible that the total amounts of unrecognized tax benefits at December 24, 2017 may increase or decrease in the next 12 months.
These examinations are at various stages with respect to assessments, claims, deficiencies and refunds, many of which are open for periods after fiscal 2000.
As of December 24, 2017, we believe that adequate amounts have been reserved for based on facts known.
The following should be read in conjunction with the financial results for the first quarter of fiscal 2018 for each reportable segment included in this Quarterly Report in “Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements, Note 7.
The increase in QCT revenues was due to a corresponding fluctuation in equipment and services revenues.
The increase in equipment and services revenues was primarily due to an increase in revenues related to RFFE products of $433 million, primarily due to revenues from our RF360 Holdings joint venture, which was formed in the second quarter of fiscal 2017, and an increase of $285 million related to higher MSM and accompanying PM unit shipments, primarily resulting from an increase in shipments to Apple.
QCT EBT as a percentage of revenues increased primarily due to an increase in gross margin percentage and the favorable impact of higher revenues relative to operating expenses.
QCT inventories decreased by 8% in the first quarter of fiscal 2018 from $2.02 billion to $1.85 billion primarily due to a decrease in the overall quantity of units on hand.
QTL results were negatively impacted by our continued dispute with Apple and its contract manufacturers (who are Qualcomm licensees), as well as the previously disclosed dispute with another licensee.
We did not record any revenues in the first quarter of fiscal 2018 for royalties due on sales of Apple’s or the other licensee’s products.
Revenues related to the products of Apple’s contract manufacturers and the other licensee in dispute comprised approximately $740 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2017.
Excluding the impact of these disputes, QTL revenues increased primarily as a result of increases in reported sales of CDMA-based products (including multi-mode products that also implement OFDMA) and revenues per reported unit.
QTL EBT as a percentage of revenues decreased primarily due to the decrease in QTL revenues and an increase in selling, general and administrative expenses resulting from higher legal costs and bad debt expense related to a licensee that is facing significant financial difficulties.
QTL revenues and EBT also continued to be impacted negatively by units that we believe are not being reported by certain other licensees and sales of certain unlicensed products.
While we have reached agreements with many licensees, negotiations with certain other licensees and unlicensed companies are ongoing, particularly in emerging regions, including China, and additional litigation may become necessary if negotiations fail to resolve the relevant issues.
The increase in QSI EBT was primarily due to the net impact of $10 million resulting from higher revenues and costs associated with certain development contracts with one of our equity method investees and the combined impact of $22 million resulting from higher net realized gains on investments and lower impairment losses.
•On January 16, 2018, we announced a cost reduction plan designed to align our cost structure to our long-term margin targets.
As part of this plan, we will implement a series of targeted reductions across our businesses to reduce annual costs by $1 billion, excluding incremental costs resulting from any future acquisition of a business.
We expect these cost reductions to be fully captured in fiscal 2019.
We are in the process of finalizing our plan, as well as the restructuring and restructuring-related costs we expect to incur to execute our plan.
Such contract manufacturers did not fully report and did not pay royalties due on sales of Apple products.
We have taken action against Apple’s contract manufacturers, to compel such licensees to pay the required royalties, and against Apple, as described more fully elsewhere in this Quarterly Report in “Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements, Note 6.” Additionally, the other licensee in dispute did not report or pay royalties due in the first quarter of fiscal 2018.
We did not record any revenues in the first quarter of fiscal 2018 for royalties due on sales of Apple’s or the other licensee’s products, and as a result, QTL revenues and EBT were negatively impacted by these continued disputes.
•Decisions by certain companies to utilize our competitors’ integrated circuit products in all or a portion of their devices.
For example, commencing with the iPhone 7 (which was released in September 2016), we are no longer the sole supplier of modems for new iPhone product launches, as Apple utilizes modems from one of our competitors in a portion of such devices.
We expect that in the future Apple will utilize our competitors’ modems in a portion of (or potentially all) iPhones.
Accordingly, QCT revenues from modem sales for iPhones declined in fiscal 2017 and may continue to decline in the future, in part depending on the extent of Apple’s utilization of competitors’ modems and the mix of the various versions of its products that are sold.
Overall QCT revenues, as well as profitability, may similarly decline unless offset by sales of integrated circuit products to other customers, including those outside of traditional cellular industries, such as the Internet of Things (IoT), automotive and networking.
On October 27, 2016, we announced a definitive agreement under which Qualcomm River Holdings will acquire NXP.
Pursuant to the definitive agreement, Qualcomm River Holdings has commenced a tender offer to acquire all of the issued and outstanding common shares of NXP for $110 per share in cash, for estimated total cash consideration to be paid to NXP’s shareholders of $38 billion.
The transaction is subject to receipt of regulatory approvals in various jurisdictions and other closing conditions.
The transaction is expected to close in early 2018.
In May 2017, we issued an aggregate principal amount of $11.0 billion of unsecured floating- and fixed-rate notes with varying maturities, of which a portion will be used to fund the purchase price and other related transactions.
In addition, we have secured $4.0 billion in committed financing through a Term Loan Facility, which is expected to be drawn on at the close of the NXP transaction.
The remaining amount will be funded with cash held by our foreign entities, which will result in the use of a substantial portion of our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities.
If the definitive agreement is terminated by NXP in certain circumstances, NXP will be required to pay Qualcomm River Holdings a termination fee of $1.25 billion.
If the definitive agreement is terminated by Qualcomm River Holdings under certain circumstances involving the failure to obtain the required regulatory approvals or the failure of NXP to complete certain pre-closing reorganization steps in all material respects, Qualcomm River Holdings will be required to pay NXP a termination fee of $2.0 billion.
In November 2016, as required by the definitive agreement, we entered into four letters of credit for an aggregate amount of $2.0 billion pursuant to which NXP will have the right to draw amounts to fund the potential termination fee payable to NXP.
Each letter of credit is required to be fully cash collateralized in an amount equal to 100% of its face value through deposits with the issuers of the letters of credit.
Total cash provided by operating activities increased primarily due to changes in working capital related to decreases in accounts receivable and inventories.
Total cash provided by operating activities was also impacted by continued actions taken by Apple and its contract manufacturers, as well as the previously disclosed dispute with another licensee, who did not report or pay royalties due in the first quarter of fiscal 2018.
The decrease in accounts receivable and the related days sales outstanding were primarily due to the timing of integrated circuit shipments and the collection of receivables related to integrated circuits.
The decrease in days sales outstanding was also attributable to the timing of the collection of payments from certain of our licensees.
The decrease in inventories was primarily due to a decrease in the overall quantity of units on hand.
We have an unsecured commercial paper program, which provides for the issuance of up to $5.0 billion of commercial paper.
Proceeds from the Term Loan Facility, if drawn, will be used to finance, in part, the proposed acquisition of NXP.
In May 2017, we issued an aggregate principal amount of $11.0 billion in nine tranches of unsecured floating- and fixed-rate notes, with maturity dates starting in 2019 through 2047.
Net proceeds from the issuance of the notes of $10.95 billion are intended to be used to fund a portion of the purchase price of our planned acquisition of NXP and other related transactions and also for general corporate purposes.
Our 2019 floating-rate notes, 2020 floating-rate notes, 2019 fixed-rate notes and 2020 fixed-rate notes issued in May 2017 for an aggregate principal amount of $4.0 billion are subject to a special mandatory redemption at a price equal to 101% of the aggregate principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest to, but excluding, the date of such mandatory redemption.
The redemption is required on the first to occur of (i) the termination of the NXP purchase agreement or (ii) April 25, 2018 (which reflects a second automatic extension of the original expiration date of October 27, 2017 in accordance with the NXP purchase agreement, and as such date may be further extended in accordance with the NXP purchase agreement to a date on or prior to June 1, 2018).
In May 2015, we issued an aggregate principal amount of $10.0 billion in eight tranches of unsecured floating- and fixed-rate notes, with $1.5 billion maturing in 2018 and the remaining with maturity dates in 2020 through 2045.
The amount and timing of such additional borrowings will be subject to a number of factors, including the cash flow generated by United States-based entities, acquisitions and strategic investments, acceptable interest rates and changes in corporate income tax law, among other factors.
Additional information regarding our outstanding debt at December 24, 2017 is provided in this Quarterly Report in “Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements, Note 5.
The Tax Legislation, which was signed into law during the first quarter of fiscal 2018, resulted in an estimated $5.3 billion charge related to the Toll Charge.
In the first quarter of fiscal 2018, we repurchased and retired 3.7 million shares of our common stock for $225 million, before commissions.
At December 24, 2017, $1.4 billion remained authorized for repurchase under our stock repurchase program.
As a result of our proposed acquisition of NXP and the pending use of our cash and marketable securities, we currently expect to repurchase shares in the next few years to offset dilution from the issuance of common stock under our employee benefit plans.
In the first quarter of fiscal 2018, we paid cash dividends totaling $844 million, or $0.57 per share.
On January 12, 2018, we announced a cash dividend of $0.57 per share on our common stock, payable on March 21, 2018 to stockholders of record as of the close of business on February 28, 2018.
We intend to continue to use cash dividends as a means of returning capital to stockholders, subject to capital availability and our view that cash dividends are in the best interests of our stockholders.
We believe our current cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, our expected cash flow generated from operations and our expected financing activities will satisfy our working and other capital requirements, for at least the next 12 months based on our current business plans.
Recent and expected working and other capital requirements, in addition to the above matters, also include the items described below.
We have no significant contractual obligations not fully recorded on our consolidated balance sheets or fully disclosed in the notes to our condensed consolidated financial statements.
Additional information regarding our financial commitments at December 24, 2017 is provided in this Quarterly Report in “Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements, Note 3.
Income Taxes,” “Note 5.
Commitments and Contingencies” and “Note 8.
Acquisitions.”
Information regarding recent accounting pronouncements and the impact of those pronouncements, if any, on our consolidated financial statements is provided in this Quarterly Report in “Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements, Note 1.
You should also consider the other information set forth in this Quarterly Report and in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended September 24, 2017 in evaluating our business and our prospects, including but not limited to our financial statements and the related notes and “Part I, Item 2.
Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.”
We are subject to a disruptive takeover proposal.
Broadcom Limited has made an unsolicited proposal to acquire all of our outstanding common stock and has commenced a proxy contest to replace our Board of Directors with Broadcom nominees.
Responding to Broadcom’s unsolicited proposal and proxy contest may divert management attention and may require us to incur significant costs.
Our proposed acquisition of NXP Semiconductors N.V. involves a number of risks, including, among others, the risk that we fail to complete the acquisition, in a timely manner or at all, regulatory risks, risks associated with our use of a significant portion of our cash and our taking on significant indebtedness, other financial risks, integration risks, and risk associated with the reactions of customers, suppliers and employees.
The regulatory approvals required in connection with the proposed transaction may not be obtained or may contain materially burdensome conditions.
transaction or reducing our anticipated benefits.
See the Risk Factor entitled “There are risks associated with our indebtedness.”
•we could be required to pay a termination fee to NXP of $2.0 billion;
The proposed transaction will be our largest acquisition to date, by a significant margin.
The benefits we expect to realize from the proposed transaction will depend, in part, on our ability to integrate the businesses successfully and efficiently.
Our revenues depend on commercial network deployments, expansions and upgrades of CDMA, OFDMA and other communications technologies; our customers’ and licensees’ sales of products and services based on these technologies; and customers’ demand for our products and services.
networks, our customers and licensees and other third parties to incorporate these technologies into new device types and into industries beyond traditional cellular communications, such as automotive, the internet of things (IoT) (including the connected home, smart cities, wearables, voice and music and robotics), data center, networking, computing, and machine learning, among others.
We are also impacted by consumers’ rates of replacement of smartphones and other computing devices.
•we are unable to drive the adoption of our products and services into networks and devices, including devices beyond traditional cellular applications, based on CDMA, OFDMA and other communications technologies.
•continue to develop brand recognition to effectively compete against better known companies in computing and other consumer driven segments and to deepen our presence in significant emerging geographic regions.
Companies that promote standards that are neither CDMA- nor OFDMA-based (e.g., GSM) as well as companies that design integrated circuits based on CDMA, OFDMA, Wi-Fi or their derivatives are generally competitors or potential competitors.
Examples (some of which are strategic partners of ours in other areas) include Advanced Micro Devices, Inc., Broadcom Limited, Cirrus Logic, Cypress Semiconductor Corporation, HiSilicon Technologies, Intel, Marvell Technology, Maxim Integrated Products, MediaTek, Microchip Technology Inc., Murata Manufacturing Co., Ltd., Nordic Semiconductor,
We derive a significant portion of our consolidated revenues from a small number of customers and licensees.
Any such reduction in revenues would also impact our cash resources available for other purposes, such as research and development.
Accordingly, if current industry dynamics and concentrations continue, our QCT segment’s revenues will continue to depend largely upon, and be impacted by, future purchases, and the timing and size of any such future purchases, by these significant customers.
One of our largest customers purchases our Mobile Data Modem (MDM) products, which do not include our integrated application processor technology and which have lower revenue and margin contributions than our combined modem and application processor products.
To the extent such customer takes device share from our other customers who purchase our integrated modem and application processor products, our revenues and margins may be negatively impacted.
If we fail to effectively partner or continue partnering with these companies, or with their partners or customers, they may decide not to purchase (either directly or through their contract manufacturers), or to reduce or discontinue their purchases of, our integrated circuit products.
products that achieve and sustain customer acceptance.
Reductions in the average selling prices of wireless devices sold by our significant licensees, without a sufficient increase in the volumes of such devices sold, would generally have an adverse effect on our licensing revenues.
Any such reduction in revenues would also impact our cash resources available for other purposes, such as research and development.
In addition, in connection with our participation in SDOs, we, like other patent owners, generally have made contractual commitments to such organizations to license those of our patents that would necessarily be infringed by standard-compliant products as set forth in those commitments.
Some SDOs, courts and governmental agencies have adopted and may in the future adopt some or all of these interpretations or proposals in a manner adverse to our interests, including in litigation to which we may not be a party.
Our business, particularly our licensing business, may suffer as a result of adverse rulings in government investigations or proceedings.
See also the Risk Factor entitled “Changes in our patent licensing practices, whether due to governmental investigations, private legal proceedings challenging those practices or otherwise, could adversely impact our business and results of operations.”
Changes in our patent licensing practices, whether due to governmental investigations, private legal proceedings challenging those practices or otherwise, could adversely impact our business and results of operations.
including our patent portfolio.
Policing unauthorized use of our products, technologies and proprietary information is difficult and time consuming.
The steps we have taken have not always prevented, and we cannot be certain the steps we will take in the future will prevent, the misappropriation or unauthorized use of our proprietary information and technologies, particularly in foreign countries where the laws may not protect our proprietary intellectual property rights as fully or as readily as United States laws or where the enforcement of such laws may be lacking or ineffective.
Some industry participants who have a vested interest in devaluing patents in general, or standard-essential patents in particular, have mounted attacks on certain patent systems, increasing the likelihood of changes to established patent laws.
We expect that the European Union will adopt a unitary patent system in the next few years that may broadly impact that region’s patent regime.
In addition, we cannot be certain that the laws and policies of any country or the practices of any standards bodies, foreign or domestic, with respect to intellectual property enforcement or licensing or the adoption of standards, will not be changed in the future in a way detrimental to our licensing program or to the sale or use of our products or technologies.
Our growth increasingly depends on our ability to extend our technologies, products and services into new and expanded product areas, such as RFFE, and adjacent industry segments outside of traditional cellular industries, such as automotive, IoT and networking, among others.
Our research, development and other investments in these new and expanded product areas and industry segments, and related technologies, products and services, as well as in our existing technologies, products and services and new technologies, such as 5G, may not generate operating income or contribute to future results of operations that meet our expectations.
In particular, our future growth significantly depends on new and expanded product areas, such as RFFE, and adjacent industry segments, such as automotive, IoT (including the connected home, smart cities, wearables, voice and music and robotics), data center, networking, computing and machine learning, among others; our ability to develop leading and cost-effective technologies, products and services for new and expanded product areas and adjacent industry segments; and third parties incorporating our technology, products and services into devices used in these product areas and industry segments.
Accordingly, we intend to continue to make substantial investments in these new and expanded product areas and adjacent industry segments, and in developing new products, services and technologies for these product areas and industry segments.
There are numerous risks associated with our operation and control of manufacturing facilities of our joint venture with TDK, RF360 Holdings, including a higher portion of fixed costs relative to a fabless model, environmental compliance and liability, exposure to natural disasters, timely supply of equipment and materials and manufacturing difficulties.
Manufacturing facilities are characterized by a higher portion of fixed costs relative to a fabless model.
In less favorable industry environments, in particular, we may be faced with a decline in the utilization rates of our manufacturing facilities due to decreases in demand for our products.
During such periods, our manufacturing facilities could operate at lower capacity levels, while the fixed costs associated with full capacity continue to be incurred, resulting in lower gross profit.
We are subject to many environmental, health and safety laws and regulations in each jurisdiction in which we operate our manufacturing facilities, which govern, among other things, emissions of pollutants into the air, wastewater discharges, the use and handling of hazardous substances, waste disposal, the investigation and remediation of soil and ground water contamination and the health and safety of our employees.
We are also required to obtain and maintain environmental permits from governmental authorities for certain of our operations.
We cannot make assurances that we will be at all times in compliance with such laws, regulations and permits.
Certain environmental laws impose strict, and in certain circumstances, joint and several, liability on current or previous owners or operators of real property for the cost of investigation, removal or remediation of hazardous substances.
Certain of these laws also assess liability on persons who arrange for hazardous substances to be sent to disposal or treatment facilities when such facilities are found to be contaminated.
In addition, we could also be held liable for consequences arising out of human exposure to hazardous substances or other environmental damage.
If tsunamis, flooding, earthquakes, volcanic eruptions or other natural disasters or geopolitical conflicts were to damage, destroy or disrupt our manufacturing facilities, it could disrupt our operations, delay new production and shipments of inventory or result in costly repairs, replacements or other costs.
In addition, natural disasters or geopolitical conflicts may result in disruptions in transportation, distribution channels or supply chains, or significant increases in the prices of raw materials.
Our manufacturing operations depend on securing raw materials and other supplies in adequate quality and quantity in a timely manner from multiple suppliers, and in some cases, we rely on a limited number of suppliers, particularly in Asia.
If the supply-demand balance is disrupted, it may considerably increase costs of manufacturing due to increased prices we pay for raw materials or fuel.
From time to time, suppliers may extend lead times, limit the amounts supplied to us or increase prices due to capacity constraints or other factors.
Further, it may be difficult or impossible to substitute one piece of equipment for another or replace one type of material with another.
A failure by our suppliers to deliver our requirements could result in disruptions to our manufacturing operations.
We own a very strong portfolio of issued and pending patents related to 3G, 4G, 5G and other technologies.
It is critical that we continue to evolve our patent portfolio, particularly in 5G.
In addition, new connectivity and other services are emerging that rely on devices that may or may not be used on traditional cellular networks, such as devices used in the IoT and automotive industry segments.
Standards, even de facto standards, that develop as these technologies mature, in particular those that do not include a base level of interoperability, may impact our ability to obtain royalties at all or that are equivalent to those that we receive for products used in cellular communications.
Further, the licenses granted to and from us under a number of our license agreements include only patents that are either filed or issued prior to a certain date.
As a result, there are agreements with some licensees where later patents are not licensed by or to us.
Additionally, certain of our license agreements (including essentially all of our recent agreements in China) are effective for a specified term.
In order to license or to obtain a license to such later patents or after the expiration of a specified term, or to receive royalties after the specified time period, we will need to extend or modify such license agreements or enter into new license agreements with such licensees.
Accordingly, to the extent not renewed on their terms or by election for an additional (generally multi-year) period, if applicable, we will need to extend or modify such license agreements or enter into new license agreements with such licensees more frequently than we have done historically.
We might not be able to renew those license agreements, or enter into new license agreements, in the future without affecting the material terms and conditions of our license agreements with such licensees, and such modifications or new agreements may negatively impact our revenues.
If there is a delay in renewing a license agreement prior to its expiration, there would be a delay in our ability to recognize revenues related to that licensee’s product sales.
Our QCT segment primarily utilizes a fabless production model, which means that we do not own or operate foundries for the production of silicon wafers from which our integrated circuits are made.
Other than the manufacturing facilities we now operate through our recently formed RF360 Holdings joint venture, we rely on independent third-party suppliers to perform the manufacturing and assembly, and most of the testing, of our integrated circuits.
Our suppliers are also responsible for the procurement of most of the raw materials used in the production of our integrated circuits.
We employ both turnkey and two-stage manufacturing models to purchase our integrated circuits.
Under the turnkey model, our foundry suppliers are responsible for delivering fully assembled and tested integrated circuits.
•natural disasters or geopolitical conflicts, particularly in Asia, impacting our suppliers.
One or more of our suppliers or potential alternate suppliers may manufacture CDMA- or OFDMA-based integrated circuits that compete with our products.
In addition, we may not receive reasonable pricing, manufacturing or delivery terms from our suppliers.
Certain legal matters, including certain claims by other companies that we infringe their intellectual property, are described more fully in this Quarterly Report in “Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements, Note 6.
On January 16, 2018, we announced a cost reduction plan designed to align our cost structure to our long-term margin targets.
As part of this plan, we will implement a series of targeted reductions across our businesses to reduce annual costs by $1 billion, excluding incremental costs resulting from any future acquisition of a business.
We expect these cost reductions to be fully captured in fiscal 2019.
National, state and local environmental laws and regulations affect our operations around the world.
We are also subject to laws and regulations impacting the manufacturing operations of our RF360 Holdings joint venture.
See the Risk Factor entitled “There are numerous risks associated with our operation and control of manufacturing facilities of our joint venture with TDK, RF360 Holdings, including high fixed costs, environmental compliance and liability, exposure to natural disasters, timely supply of equipment and materials and manufacturing difficulties.”
Regulations in the United States require that we determine whether certain materials used in our products, referred to as conflict minerals, originated in the Democratic Republic of the Congo or an adjoining country (collectively, the Covered Countries), or were from recycled or scrap sources.
Other countries or regions may impose similar requirements in the future.
The verification and reporting requirements, in addition to customer demands for conflict free sourcing, impose additional costs on us and on our suppliers and may limit the sources or increase the prices of materials used in our products.
Further, if we are unable to determine that the conflict minerals used in our products do not directly or indirectly finance or benefit armed groups in the Covered Countries, we may face challenges with our customers that place us at a competitive disadvantage, and our reputation may be harmed.
Similarly, other laws and regulations have been adopted or proposed that require additional transparency regarding the employment practices of our suppliers, and any failure to maintain responsible sourcing practices could also adversely affect our relationships with customers and our reputation.
Our use of open source software may harm our business.
Certain of our software and our suppliers’ software may contain or may be derived from “open source” software, and we have seen, and believe we will continue to see, an increase in customers requesting that we develop products, including software associated with our integrated circuit products, that incorporate open source software elements and operate in an open source environment, which, under certain open source licenses, may offer accessibility to a portion of a product’s source code and may expose related intellectual property to adverse licensing conditions.
For example, these obligations may require us to make source code for the derivative works available to our customers in a manner that allows them to make such source code available to their customers or license such derivative works under a particular type of license that is different than what we customarily use to license our software.
or marketable securities and may reduce our earnings as a result of any impairment charges that we record to reduce recorded values of marketable securities to their fair values.
In the past, securities class action litigation has been brought against a company following periods of volatility in the market price of its securities.
Securities litigation could result in substantial uninsured costs and divert management’s attention and our resources.
Certain legal matters, including certain securities litigation brought against us, are described more fully in this Quarterly Report in “Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements, Note 6.
We maintain an extensive investment portfolio of varied holdings, which are generally classified as available-for-sale and are therefore recorded on our consolidated balance sheet at fair value, with unrealized gains or losses reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income.
The fair values of our investments are subject to fluctuation based primarily on market price volatility, as well as the underlying operations of the associated investment, among other things.
The sensitivity of and risks associated with the market value of our investment portfolio are described more fully in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for our fiscal year ended September 24, 2017 and “Part I, Item 3.
Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk” in this Quarterly Report.
There are risks associated with our indebtedness.
•increasing our vulnerability to interest rate fluctuations to the extent a portion of our debt has variable interest rates.
On December 22, 2017, tax reform legislation known as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the Tax Legislation) was enacted in the United States.
We have tax incentives in Singapore provided that we meet specified employment and other criteria, and as a result of the expiration of these incentives, our Singapore tax rate increased in fiscal 2017 and is expected to increase again in fiscal 2027.
Global, regional or local economic conditions that impact the mobile communications industry or the other industries in which we operate could negatively affect the demand for our products and services and our customers’ or licensees’ products and services, which may negatively affect our revenues.
We may not be able to attract and retain qualified employees.
Our future success depends largely upon the continued service of our executive officers and other key management and technical personnel, and on our ability to continue to identify, attract, retain and motivate them, which may become increasingly difficult given the uncertainty created by Broadcom’s unsolicited bid to acquire the Company and in an environment of cost reductions.
revenues are highly dependent on technological and product innovations.
The market for employees in our industry is extremely competitive.
Further, existing immigration laws make it more difficult for us to recruit and retain highly skilled foreign national graduates of universities in the United States, making the pool of available talent even smaller.
If we are unable to attract and retain qualified employees, our business may be harmed.
•Foreign exchange hedging transactions that we engage in to reduce the impact of currency fluctuations may require the payment of structuring fees, limit the U.S. dollar value of royalties from licensees’ sales that are denominated in foreign currencies, cause earnings volatility if the hedges do not qualify for hedge accounting and expose us to counterparty risk if the counterparty fails to perform.
Failures in our products or services or in the products or services of our customers or licensees, including those resulting from security vulnerabilities, defects or errors, could harm our business.
