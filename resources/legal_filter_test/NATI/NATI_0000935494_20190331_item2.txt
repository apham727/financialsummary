This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”).
For more than 40 years, National Instruments Corporation (the "Company", "we", "us" or "our") has enabled engineers and scientists around the world to accelerate productivity, innovation and discovery.
Our software-centric platform provides an advanced approach through integration of software and modular hardware to create automated test and automated measurement systems.
We believe our long-term track record of innovation and our differentiated platform help support the success of our customers, employees, suppliers and stockholders.
We have been profitable in every year since 1990.
We sell to a large number of customers in a wide variety of industries.
We strive to increase our already broad customer base and to grow our large order business by serving a large market on many computer platforms, through a global marketing and distribution network.
We also seek to acquire new technologies and expertise from time to time to open new opportunities for our existing product portfolio.
To maintain a high level of customer satisfaction we strive to offer innovative, modular and integrated products through a global sales and support network.
We strive to maintain a high degree of backwards compatibility across different platforms to preserve the customer’s investment in our products.
In this time of intense global competition, we believe that it is crucial that we continue to offer products with high quality and reliability, and that our products provide cost-effective solutions for our customers.
Our product strategy is to provide superior products by leveraging generally available technology, supporting open architectures on multiple platforms and leveraging our core technologies across multiple products.
We distribute and sell our software and hardware products primarily through a direct sales organization.
We also use independent distributors, original equipment manufacturers, value-added resellers, system integrators, and consultants to market and sell our products.
We have sales offices in the U.S. and sales offices and distributors in key international markets.
Sales outside of the Americas accounted for approximately 61% and 62% of our net sales during the three month periods ended March 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively.
We believe that our long-term growth and success depend on delivering high quality software and hardware products on a timely basis.
Accordingly, we focus significant efforts on research and development.
Many of the industries we serve have historically been cyclical and have experienced periodic downturns.
In assessing our business, we consider the trends in the Global Purchasing Managers’ Index (“PMI”), global industrial production as well as industry reports on the specific vertical industries that we target.
In the three month period ended March 31, 2019, the average of the Global PMI was 50.7 which is indicative of expansion in the industrial sector, and the average of the new order element of the Global PMI was 50.0 which is a neutral reading.
We remain cautious about economic uncertainty indicated by the weakening PMI during early 2019.
Despite the weakening PMI, we continue to see growth in our orders above $20,000 which we believe reflects our focus on developing highly differentiated products, particularly for complex test and measurement systems.
Since the first quarter of 2017 we have been taking steps to reduce our overall employee headcount in an effort to shift and centralize activities, improve efficiencies, and rebalance our resources on higher return activities.
We incurred $2 million in severance and other restructuring-related charges, net of tax during the three months ended March 31, 2019.
The timing and scope of any future headcount reductions will vary.
During early 2019, we saw a slightly appreciated U.S dollar index with a mix of appreciation and devaluation in the currency markets where we do business.
In the markets where we have our largest exposure to foreign currency, the Eurozone and China, the U.S. dollar appreciated against the Euro by approximately 2% and devalued against the Chinese yuan by approximately 2%.
See “Results of Operations” below for additional discussion on the impact of foreign exchange rates on our business for the three month period ended March 31, 2019.
We have hedging programs in place to help mitigate the risks associated with foreign currency risks.
Net Sales.
The following table sets forth our net sales for the three month periods ending March 31, 2019 and 2018 along with the changes between the corresponding periods.
Orders with a value greater than $20,000, increased by 6% year over year during the three months ended March 31, 2019, compared to the year over year increase of 7% in the three month period ended March 31, 2018.
A significant factor in the continued expansion of our large orders in the three months ended March 31, 2019 was strong demand for our system-level offerings, particularly in applications related to semiconductor validation and production test.
The increase in software maintenance sales was primarily related to recent growth in our software offerings, and consequently, billings for annual renewals of software maintenance programs during the trailing 12 months.
During the three month periods ended March 31, 2019 and 2018, large orders were 59% and 56% of our total orders, respectively.
The following table sets forth our net sales by geographic region for the three month periods ended March 31, 2019 and 2018 along with the changes between the corresponding periods and the region’s percentage of total net sales.
We expect sales outside of the Americas to continue to represent a significant portion of our net sales.
In order to provide a framework for assessing how our underlying business performed excluding the effects of foreign currency fluctuations between periods, we compare the percentage change in our results from period to period using constant currency disclosure.
To calculate the change in constant currency, current and comparative prior period results for entities reporting in currencies other than U.S.
Dollars are converted into U.S.
Dollars at constant exchange rates (i.e., the average rates in effect during the three month period ended March 31, 2018).
The following table presents this information, along with the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates on sales denominated in local currencies, for the three month period ended March 31, 2019.
To help protect against changes in U.S. dollar equivalent value caused by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates of forecasted foreign currency cash flows resulting from international sales, we have instituted a foreign currency cash flow hedging program.
We hedge portions of our forecasted net sales denominated in foreign currencies with average rate forward contracts.
During the three month periods ended March 31, 2019 and 2018, these hedges had the effect of increasing our net sales by $1.7 million and decreasing our net sales by $2.6 million, respectively.
The following table sets forth our gross profit and gross profit as a percentage of net sales for the three month periods ended March 31, 2019 and 2018 along with the percentage changes in gross profit for the corresponding periods.
For the three month periods ended March 31, 2019 and 2018, the change in exchange rates had the effect of decreasing our cost of sales by $1.3 million and increasing our cost of sales by $2.0 million, respectively.
To help protect against changes in our cost of sales caused by a fluctuation in foreign currency exchange rates of forecasted foreign currency cash flows, we have a foreign currency cash flow hedging program.
We hedge portions of our forecasted costs of sales denominated in foreign currencies with average rate forward contracts.
During the three month periods ended March 31, 2019 and 2018, these hedges had the effect of decreasing our cost of sales by less than $0.1 million and decreasing our cost of sales by $0.3 million, respectively.
During the three months ended March 31, 2019 our backlog increased by $10 million.
Operating Expenses.
The following table sets forth our operating expenses for the three month periods ended March 31, 2019 and 2018 along with the percentage changes between the corresponding periods and the line item as a percentage of total net sales.
We capitalized $2 million of software development costs in the three month period ended March 31, 2019, compared to $8 million in the three month period ended March 31, 2018, which had the effect of increasing our operating expenses by $6 million.
We believe that our long-term growth and success depends on developing high quality software and hardware products on a timely basis.
In the second quarter of 2018,we began moving toward more frequent releases for many of our software products.
Specifically, for many of our software development projects, we started applying agile development methodologies which are characterized by a more dynamic development process with more frequent and iterative revisions to a product release's features and functions as the software is being developed.
Operating Income.
For the three month periods ended March 31, 2019 and 2018, operating income was $23 million and $28 million, respectively, a decrease of 17%.
As a percentage of net sales, operating income was 7.5% and 9.0% for the three month periods ended March 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively.
The decrease in operating income in absolute dollars for the three month period ended March 31, 2019, compared to the three month period ended March 31, 2018, is attributable to the factors discussed in Net Sales, Gross Profit and Operating Expenses above.
Interest Income.
For the three month periods ended March 31, 2019 and 2018, interest income was $2.2 million and $1.0 million, respectively.
We are seeing improving yields for high quality investment alternatives that comply with our corporate investment policy.
We utilize foreign currency forward contracts to hedge our foreign denominated net foreign currency balance sheet positions to help protect against the change in value caused by a fluctuation in foreign currency exchange rates.
We typically hedge up to 90% of our outstanding foreign denominated net receivable or payable positions and typically limit the duration of these foreign currency forward contracts to approximately 90 days.
The gain or loss on these derivatives as well as the offsetting gain or loss on the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk is recognized in current earnings under the line item “Net foreign exchange gain.” Our hedging strategy decreased our foreign exchange gain by $(0.2) million and $(1.8) million in the three month periods ended March 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively.
The following tables provide details with respect to the amount of GAAP charges related to stock-based compensation, amortization of acquisition intangibles, acquisition related transaction costs, restructuring charges, and capitalization and amortization of internally developed software costs that were recorded in the line items indicated below (in thousands).
◦Cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments decreased by $51 million.
Additional analysis of the changes in our cash flows for the three month period ended March 31, 2019 compared to the three month period ended March 31, 2018 are discussed below.
The decrease in accounts receivable is primarily related to seasonal variations in our quarterly net sales.
◦Inventory increased by $11 million to $205 million at March 31, 2019, from $194 million at December 31, 2018.
Inventory turns were 1.6 and 1.8 at March 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018, respectively.
◦Accrued compensation decreased by $11 million which can be attributed to payments related to our company profit sharing and bonus plans.
◦The current portion of deferred revenue increased by $3 million, which was primarily related to the timing of annual renewals of our enterprise licensing agreements.
The following table summarizes our cash flow results for the three months ended March 31, 2019 and 2018.
Operating Activities Cash provided by operating activities for the three month period ended March 31, 2019 increased by $2 million compared to the same period in 2018.
This was primarily attributable to a net sale of short-term investments of $21 million compared to a net purchase of short-term investments of $42 million during the same period in 2018, and a $10 million purchase of an interest in an equity-method investee.
The net sale of short-term investments was primarily to fund repurchases of our common stock under our share repurchase program.
The increase in cash outflows used in investing activities was partially offset by a decrease in capitalized software development costs of $5 million compared to the same period in 2018.
Financing Activities Cash used by financing activities increased by $49 million for the three month period ended March 31, 2019 compared to the same period in 2018.
This was primarily related to an increase of $46 million in cash outflows used to repurchase 1,035,098 shares of our common stock and a $3 million increase in cash outflows related to the increase in our quarterly dividend offset by a $1 million increase in proceeds from issuance of our common stock from our employee stock purchase plan.
Information related to our contractual obligations as of December 31, 2018 can be found in “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Contractual Obligations,” in Part II-Item 7 of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018 filed with the SEC on February 21, 2019 (the “2018 Form 10-K”).
At March 31, 2019, there were no material changes outside the ordinary course of business to our contractual obligations from those reported in our 2018 Form 10-K. See Note 8 - Leases for additional information regarding our non-cancellable operating lease obligations as of March 31, 2019.
On May 9, 2013, we entered into the Loan Agreement with the Lender.
On October 29, 2015, we entered into the Amendment with the Lender, which amended our Loan Agreement to among other things, (i) increase the unsecured revolving line of credit from $50.0 million to $125.0 million, (ii) extend the maturity date of the line of credit from May 9, 2018 to October 29, 2020, and (iii) provide us with an option to request increases to the line of credit of up to an additional $25.0 million in the aggregate, subject to consent of the Lender and terms and conditions to be mutually agreed between us and the Lender.
On April 27, 2018, we entered into the Second Amendment with the Lender, which amends the Loan Agreement, as amended by the Amendment, to, among other things, (i) reduce the revolving line of credit from $125.0 million to $5.0 million, (ii) reduce the letter of credit sublimit under the line of credit from $10.0 million to $5.0 million, and (iii) require us and our subsidiaries to comply with certain of the affirmative and negative covenants under the Loan Agreement only if loans are outstanding under the Loan Agreement or if we have not reimbursed any drawing under a letter of credit issued under the Loan Agreement within five business days following the request of the Lender.
Proceeds of loans made under the Loan Agreement may be used for working capital and other general corporate purposes.
We may prepay the loans under the Loan Agreement in whole or in part at any time without premium or penalty.
Certain of our existing and future material domestic subsidiaries are required to guaranty our obligations under the Loan Agreement.
At March 31, 2019, we did not have any relationships with any unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships, such as entities often referred to as structured finance entities, which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off-balance sheet arrangements.
We believe that our existing cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments, together with cash generated from operations as well as from the purchase of common stock through our employee stock purchase plan will be sufficient to cover our working capital needs, capital expenditures, investment requirements, commitments, payment of dividends to our stockholders and repurchases of our common stock for at least the next 12 months.
We may also seek to pursue additional financing or to raise additional funds by seeking an increase in our unsecured revolving line of credit under our Loan Agreement or selling equity or debt to the public or in private transactions from time to time.
If we raise additional funds by issuing additional equity or convertible debt securities, the ownership percentages of our existing stockholders would be reduced.
In addition, the equity or debt securities that we issue may have rights, preferences or privileges senior to those of our common stock.
•the level of stock purchases under our employee stock purchase plan.
See Note 1 – Basis of presentation in Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
At March 31, 2019, there were 2,964,902 shares available for repurchase under our repurchase plan approved on April 21, 2010.
