National Instruments Corporation (the “Company”, “we”, “us” or “our”) designs, manufactures and sells systems to engineers and scientists that accelerate productivity, innovation and discovery.
Our software defined platform provides integrated software and modular hardware that speeds the development of automated test and automated measurement systems.
We believe our long-term vision and focus on technology supports the success of our customers, employees, suppliers and stockholders.
We sell to a large number of customers in a wide variety of industries.
We have been profitable in every year since 1990.
We strive to increase our already broad customer base and to grow our large order business by serving a large market on many computer platforms, through a global marketing and distribution network.
To maintain a high level of customer satisfaction we strive to offer innovative, modular and integrated products through a global sales and support network.
We strive to maintain a high degree of backwards compatibility across different platforms to preserve the customer’s investment in our products.
In this time of intense global competition, we believe that it is crucial that we continue to offer products with high quality and reliability, and that our products provide cost-effective solutions for our customers.
Our product strategy is to provide superior products by leveraging generally available technology, supporting open architectures on multiple platforms and leveraging our core technologies across multiple products.
We distribute and sell our software and hardware products primarily through a direct sales organization.
We also use independent distributors, OEMs, VARs, system integrators, and consultants to market and sell our products.
We have sales offices in the U.S. and sales offices and distributors in key international markets.
Sales outside of the Americas accounted for approximately 62% of our net sales during each of the three months ended June 30, 2018 and 2017, and approximately 62% and 61% of our net sales during the six months ended June 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively.
We believe that our long-term growth and success depend on delivering high quality software and hardware products on a timely basis.
Many of the industries we serve have historically been cyclical and have experienced periodic downturns.
In assessing our business, we consider the trends in the Global Purchasing Managers’ Index (“PMI”), global industrial production as well as industry reports on the specific vertical industries that we target.
For the three months ended June 30, 2018, the average of the Global PMI was 53.2 and the average of the new order element of the Global PMI was 53.4.
Although these readings are indicative of expansion in the industrial sector we are unable to predict whether the industrial economy, as measured by the PMI, will remain above the neutral reading of 50, strengthen or contract during the remainder of 2018.
We are optimistic about our long-term position in the industry through the sustained differentiation we deliver to our customers through our platform-based approach.
We continue to see growth in our orders above $20,000 which we believe reflects our focus on developing highly differentiated products, particularly for complex test and measurement systems.
In the second quarter of 2018, we saw a 6% year over year increase from orders under $20,000 and a 16% year over year increase from orders over $20,000.
Since the first quarter of 2017, we have been taking steps to reduce our overall employee headcount in an effort to reduce job duplication, shift and centralize activities, improve efficiencies, and rebalance our resources on higher return activities.
In connection with these activities, we expect to incur an additional $3 million to $5 million in severance and other restructuring-related charges, net of tax, by the end of 2018, most of which we expect to incur in the third quarter of 2018.
During the second quarter of 2018, we saw a broad appreciation in the value of the U.S. dollar against the local currency in many of the currency markets where we do business.
In particular, we noted a sharp appreciation of the U.S. dollar against the Euro and against the Chinese yuan.
Despite the broad appreciation of the U.S dollar, we continue to see strength in the overall industrial economy, as measured by the PMI.
See “Results of Operations” below for additional discussion on the impact of foreign exchange rates on our business for the three and six months ended June 30, 2018.
We have hedging programs in place to help mitigate the risks associated with foreign currency risks.
However, there can be no assurance the hedges will offset more than a portion of the financial impact resulting from movements in the foreign currency markets in which we do business.
The following table sets forth our net sales for the three and six months ended June 30, 2018 and 2017 along with the changes between the corresponding periods.
The year over year increase in software maintenance for each of the three and six months ended June 30, 2018 was driven by increased adoption of our software platform and changes to the renewal pricing of annual software maintenance for many of our products.
Orders with a value greater than $20,000 increased by 16% year over year during the three months ended June 30, 2018, compared to the year over year increase of 10% in the three months ended June 30, 2017.
June 30, 2018 and 2017, orders with a value greater than $20,000 increased by 11% year over year.
A significant factor in the continued expansion of these orders in the three and six months ended June 30, 2018, compared to the comparable periods in 2017 was strong demand for data acquisition hardware and software products, including enterprise-wide licensing agreements, indicating broader adoption of our platform.
During the three months ended June 30, 2018 and 2017, orders over $20,000 were 58% and 56% of our total orders, respectively, and for the six months ended June 30, 2018 and 2017, these orders were 57% and 55% of our total orders, respectively.
The following table sets forth our net sales by geographic region for the three and six months ended June 30, 2018 and 2017 along with the changes between the corresponding periods and the region’s percentage of total net sales.
We expect sales outside of the Americas to continue to represent a significant portion of our net sales.
We intend to continue to expand our international operations by increasing our presence in existing markets, adding a presence in some new geographical markets and continuing the use of distributors to sell our products in some countries.
In order to provide a framework for assessing how our underlying business performed excluding the effects of foreign currency fluctuations between periods, we compare the percentage change in our results from period to period using constant currency disclosure.
To calculate the change in constant currency, current and comparative prior period results for entities reporting in currencies other than U.S.
Dollars are converted into U.S.
Dollars at constant exchange rates (i.e., the average rates in effect during the three and six months ended June 30, 2017).
The following tables present this information, along with the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates on sales denominated in local currencies, for the three and six months ended June 30, 2018.
To help protect against changes in U.S. dollar equivalent value caused by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates of forecasted foreign currency cash flows resulting from international sales, we maintain a foreign currency cash flow hedging program.
We hedge portions of our forecasted net sales denominated in foreign currencies with average rate forward contracts.
During the three months ended June 30, 2018 and 2017, these hedges had the effect of decreasing our net sales by $1.3 million and increasing our net sales by $0.7 million, respectively.
During the six months ended June 30, 2018 and 2017, these hedges had the effect of decreasing our net sales by $3.9 million and increasing our net sales by $2.7 million, respectively.
The following table sets forth our gross profit and gross profit as a percentage of net sales for the three and six months ended June 30, 2018 and 2017 along with the percentage changes in gross profit for the corresponding periods.
Increase in net sales attributable to software licenses and maintenance was driven by increased adoption of our software platform and changes to the renewal pricing of annual software maintenance for many of our products.
For the six months ended June 30, 2018 and 2017, the change in exchange rates had the effect of increasing our cost of sales by $3.9 million and decreasing our cost of sales by $1.4 million, respectively.
To help protect against changes in our cost of sales caused by a fluctuation in foreign currency exchange rates of forecasted foreign currency cash flows, we have a foreign currency cash flow hedging program.
We hedge portions of our forecasted costs of sales denominated in foreign currencies with average rate forward contracts.
During the three months ended June 30, 2018 and 2017, these hedges had the effect of decreasing our cost of sales by $0.3 million and increasing our cost of sales by $0.4 million, respectively.
During the six months ended June 30, 2018 and 2017, these hedges had the effect of decreasing our cost of sales by $0.6 million and increasing our cost of sales by $1 million, respectively.
Operating Expenses.
The following table sets forth our operating expenses for the three and six months ended June 30, 2018 and 2017 along with the percentage changes between the corresponding periods and the line item as a percentage of total net sales.
In the three months ended June 30, 2018, we capitalized $3.9 million of software development costs compared to $13.7 million in the three months ended June 30, 2017.
In the second quarter of 2018, we began moving toward more frequent releases for many of our software products.
Specifically, for many of our software development projects we started applying agile development methodologies which are characterized by a more dynamic development process with more frequent and iterative revisions to a product release's features and functions as the software is being developed.
These increases were partially offset by a decrease in outside services and travel-related expenses of $2 million compared to the six months ended June 30, 2017.
We believe that our long-term growth and success depends on developing high quality software and hardware products on a timely basis.
We are focused on leveraging recent investments in research and development and in our field sales force and taking actions to help ensure that those resources are concentrated in areas and on initiatives that will contribute to future growth in our business.
Operating Income.
For the three months ended June 30, 2018 and 2017, operating income was $37 million and $29 million, respectively, an increase of 29%.
As a percentage of net sales, operating income was 10.8% and 9.0% for the three months ended June 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively.
For the six months ended June 30, 2018 and 2017, operating income was $65 million and $51 million, respectively, an increase of 28%.
The increases in operating income in absolute dollars for the three months ended June 30, 2018, compared to the three months ended June 30, 2017, and for the six months ended June 30, 2018, compared to the six months ended June 30, 2017, are attributable to the factors discussed in Net Sales, Gross Profit and Operating Expenses above.
Interest Income.
For the three months ended June 30, 2018 and 2017, interest income was $1.3 million and $0.5 million, respectively.
We continue to see improving yields for high quality investment alternatives that comply with our corporate investment policy.
We expect yields in these types of investments to increase moderately during the remainder of 2018.
We utilize foreign currency forward contracts to hedge our foreign denominated net foreign currency balance sheet positions to help protect against the change in value caused by a fluctuation in foreign currency exchange rates.
We typically hedge up to 90% of our outstanding foreign denominated net receivable or payable positions and typically limit the duration of these foreign currency forward contracts to approximately 90 days.
The gain or loss on these derivatives as well as the offsetting gain or loss on the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk is recognized in current earnings under the line item “Net foreign exchange gain (loss).” Our hedging strategy decreased our foreign exchange loss by $1.6 million and decreased our foreign exchange gain by $0.6 million in the three months ended June 30, 2018 and June 30, 2017, respectively.
Our hedging strategy increased our foreign exchange loss by $0.2 million and decreased our foreign exchange gain by $3.2 million in the six months ended June 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively.
The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act was enacted on December 22, 2017.
We recognized a provisional amount of $69.9 million, which was included as a component of income tax expense from continuing operations during the twelve months ended December 31, 2017.
The following tables provide details with respect to the amount of GAAP charges related to stock-based compensation, amortization of acquisition intangibles, acquisition transaction costs, restructuring charges, and capitalization and amortization of internally developed software costs that were recorded in the line items indicated below (in thousands).
Our principal sources of liquidity include cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities, as well as the cash flows generated from our operations.
◦Inventory increased by $9 million to $193 million at June 30, 2018, from $185 million at December 31, 2017.
Inventory turns were 1.7 at June 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017.
The increase in inventory was primarily attributable to an increase in raw materials.
◦The current portion of deferred revenue increased by $5 million, primarily due to a $16 million increase in our current deferred revenue during the first six months of 2018, primarily related to increased software billings, and the timing of renewals of certain enterprise-wide software licensing agreements.
This increase was partially offset by a $9 million decrease due to the adoption of the new revenue standard on January 1, 2018 and a $2 million decrease related to changes in foreign currency exchange rates.
◦Other current liabilities decreased by $9 million which was primarily related to changes in the fair value of our foreign currency forward exchange contracts.
The following table summarizes our cash flow results for the six months ended June 30, 2018 and 2017.
This increase was due to a $12 million increase in net income and a $2 million increase in cash provided by operating assets and liabilities.
Investing Activities Cash used for investing activities for the six months ended June 30, 2018 increased by $51 million compared to the same period in 2017.
This was primarily attributable to a net purchase of short-term investments of $90 million compared to a net purchase of short-term investments of $32 million during the same period in 2017, driven by favorable increases in the yields offered by our short-term investments.
Investing cash outflows related to capitalized software development decreased by $13 million compared to the same period in 2017 due to a decrease in development costs eligible for capitalization related to a recent shift for several of our software projects to a more iterative software development cycle.
This was primarily due to a $6 million increase in cash outflows related to the increase in our quarterly dividend offset by a $1 million increase in proceeds from issuance of our common stock from our employee stock purchase plan.
Information related to our contractual obligations as of December 31, 2017 can be found in “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Contractual Obligations,” in Part II-Item 7 of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2017 filed with the SEC on February 22, 2018 (the “2017 Form 10-K”).
At June 30, 2018, there were no material changes outside the ordinary course of business to our contractual obligations (including non-cancellable operating leases) from those reported in our 2017 Form 10-K.
On October 29, 2015, we entered into a First Amendment to Loan Agreement (the “Amendment”) with the Lender, which amended our Loan Agreement to among other things, (i) increase the unsecured revolving line of credit from $50.0 million to $125.0 million, (ii) extend the maturity date of the line of credit from May 9, 2018 to October 29, 2020, and (iii) provide us with an option to request increases to the line of credit of up to an additional $25.0 million in the aggregate, subject to consent of the Lender and terms and conditions to be mutually agreed between us and the Lender.
On April 27, 2018, we entered into a Second Amendment to Loan Agreement (the "Second Amendment") which amended the Loan Agreement, as amended by the Amendment to, among other things, (i) reduce the revolving line of credit from $125.0 million to $5.0 million, (ii) reduce the letter of credit sublimit under the line of credit from $10.0 million to $5.0 million , and (iii) require the us and our subsidiaries to comply with certain of the affirmative and negative covenants under the Loan Agreement only if loans are outstanding under the Loan Agreement or if we have not reimbursed any drawing under a letter of credit issued under the Loan Agreement within five business days following the request of the Lender.
Proceeds of loans made under the Loan Agreement may be used for working capital and other general corporate purposes.
We may prepay the loans under the Loan Agreement in whole or in part at any time without premium or penalty.
Certain of our existing and future material domestic subsidiaries are required to guaranty our obligations under the Loan Agreement.
At June 30, 2018, we did not have any relationships with any unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships, such as entities often referred to as structured finance entities, which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off-balance sheet arrangements.
We believe that our existing cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments, together with cash generated from operations as well as from the purchase of common stock through our employee stock purchase plan will be sufficient to cover our working capital needs, capital expenditures, investment requirements, commitments, payment of dividends to our stockholders and repurchases of our common stock for at least the next 12 months.
We may also seek to pursue additional financing or to raise additional funds by seeking an increase in our unsecured revolving line of credit under our Loan Agreement or selling equity or debt to the public or in private transactions from time to time.
If we raise additional funds by issuing additional equity or convertible debt securities, the ownership percentages of our existing stockholders would be reduced.
In addition, the equity or debt securities that we issue may have rights, preferences or privileges senior to those of our common stock.
