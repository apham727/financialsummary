The ASU will replace the incurred loss impairment methodology under current GAAP with a methodology that reflects expected credit losses and requires consideration of a broader range of reasonable and supportable information to inform credit loss estimates.
We will be required to use a forward-looking expected credit loss model for accounts receivables and other financial instruments.
This ASU requires instruments measured at amortized cost to be presented at the net amount expected to be collected.
Entities are also required to record allowances for available-for-sale debt securities rather than reduce the carrying amount.
We do not plan to adopt the ASU earlier than our required effective date of January 1, 2020.
We expect that the adoption of the ASU will not have a material impact on our financial statements.
This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”).
