The accompanying unaudited consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto for the year ended December 31, 2018, included in our annual report on Form 10-K, filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
In our opinion, the accompanying consolidated financial statements reflect all adjustments (consisting only of normal recurring items) considered necessary to present fairly our financial position at June 30, 2019 and December 31, 2018, the results of our operations and comprehensive income for three and six months ended June 30, 2019 and 2018, the cash flows for the six months ended June 30, 2019 and 2018 and the statement of stockholder's equity for the three and six months ended June 30, 2019.
These financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States.
Leases will be classified as finance or operating, with classification affecting the pattern and classification of expense recognition in the income statement.
We adopted the new lease standard on January 1, 2019 and used the effective date as our date of initial adoption.
Consequently, financial information will not be updated and the disclosures required under the new standard will not be provided for earlier periods.
Upon adoption, we recognized lease liabilities of approximately $52 million, with corresponding ROU assets of the same amount, based on the present value of the remaining minimum rental payments under current leasing standards for our existing operating leases.
Additionally, we also reclassified approximately $19 million from "Property, plant and equipment, net" to "Operating lease right-of-use assets" related to prepaid leasehold land.
We elected the 'package of practical expedients', which permits us not to reassess under the new standard our prior conclusions about lease identification, lease classification and initial direct costs.
We elected the short-term lease recognition exemption for all leases that qualify.
This means, for those leases that qualify, we will not recognize ROU assets or lease liabilities, and this includes not recognizing ROU assets or lease liabilities for existing short-term leases of those assets in transition.
We also elected the practical expedient to not separate lease and non-lease components for our office leases.
In August 2018, the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") issued Release No.
33-10532 that amends and clarifies certain financial reporting requirements.
We adopted this new rule beginning with our financial reporting for the quarter ended March 31, 2019.
2016-13, Financial Instruments—Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments.
The ASU will replace the incurred loss impairment methodology under current GAAP with a methodology that reflects expected credit losses and requires consideration of a broader range of reasonable and supportable information to inform credit loss estimates.
We will be required to use a forward-looking expected credit loss model for accounts receivables and other financial instruments.
This ASU requires instruments measured at amortized cost to be presented at the net amount expected to be collected.
Entities are also required to record allowances for available-for-sale debt securities rather than reduce the carrying amount.
We do not plan to adopt the ASU earlier than our required effective date of January 1, 2020.
We expect that the adoption of the ASU will not have a material impact on our financial statements.
The impact of this new guidance on our accounting policies and financial statements is described below.
Additionally, in the first quarter of 2019, we granted performance-based restricted stock units to certain executives under our 2015 Equity Incentive Plan ("PRSUs").
The impact of the new equity awards on our accounting policies is described below.
There were no other significant changes in our accounting policies during the six months ended June 30, 2019 compared to the significant accounting policies described in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018.
Stock-based compensation costs are based on the fair value on the date of grant for all restricted stock units ("RSUs") and on the date of enrollment for the employee stock purchase plan.
We recognize compensation expense ratably over the requisite service period of the awards.
PRSUs are RSU awards that vest based on a market condition, currently our stockholder return relative to the total stockholder return of the companies included in the Russell 2000 Index at the end of a three-year performance period.
Up to 200% of the full target number of shares subject to each PRSU award are eligible to be earned after the completion of the three-year performance period based on our total stockholder return relative to the total stockholder return of the Russell 2000 Index at the end of the performance period.
The fair values of rights under employee stock purchase plans are estimated using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model.
The fair values of PRSUs are estimated using a Monte Carlo simulation.
The determination of fair value of the PRSUs is affected by our stock price and a number of assumptions including the expected volatility, expected dividend yield and the risk-free interest rate.
Our expected volatility at the date of grant was based on the historical volatilities of our stock and the companies included in the Russell 2000 Index over the performance period.
Refer to Note 11 – Authorized shares of common and preferred stock and stock-based compensation plans for additional information on our equity-based compensation programs.
We determine whether an arrangement is a lease at inception.
Operating leases are included in operating lease right-of-use ("ROU") assets and operating lease liabilities (current and non-current) on our consolidated balance sheet.
Finance leases are included in property and equipment, other current liabilities, and other long-term liabilities in our consolidated balance sheet.
As none of our leases provide an implicit rate we use our incremental borrowing rate based on the information available as of the commencement date.
The operating lease ROU assets also includes any lease payments made and excludes lease incentives and initial direct costs incurred.
Our lease terms may include options to extend or terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain that we will exercise that option.
We have lease agreements with lease and non-lease components.
For office leases we account for the lease and non-lease components as a single lease component.
For certain leases, such as equipment and vehicles, we account for the lease and non-lease components separately.
Additionally, for certain equipment leases, we apply a portfolio approach to effectively account for the operating lease ROU assets and liabilities.
Refer to Note 8 - Leases for additional information on our leasing activities.
Stock awards to acquire 861,000 shares and 697,800 shares for the three months ended June 30, 2019 and 2018, respectively, and 395,800 shares and 350,800 shares for the six months ended June 30, 2019 and 2018, respectively, were excluded in the computations of diluted EPS because the effect of including the stock awards would have been anti-dilutive.
Revenue is recognized upon transfer of control of the promised products or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration we expect to receive in exchange for those products or services.
We enter into contracts that can include various combinations of our products or services, which are generally capable of being distinct and accounted for as separate performance obligations.
Revenue is recognized net of allowances for returns and any taxes collected from customers, which are subsequently remitted to governmental authorities.
Amounts collected in advance of services being provided are accounted for as deferred revenue.
Nearly all of our deferred revenue balance is related to extended hardware and software maintenance contracts.
Payment terms and conditions vary by contract type, although payment is typically due within 30 to 90 days of contract inception.
In instances where the timing of revenue recognition differs from the timing of invoicing, we have determined our contracts generally do not include a significant financing component.
The primary purpose of our invoicing terms is to provide customers with simplified and predictable ways of purchasing our products and services, not to receive financing from our customers, such as invoicing at the beginning of a subscription term with a portion of the revenue recognized ratably over the contract period, or to provide customers with financing, such as multi-year on-premises licenses that are invoiced annually with revenue recognized upfront.
For the six months ended June 30, 2019, revenue recognized from performance obligations satisfied in prior periods (for example, due to changes in transaction price) was not material.
Amounts recognized as revenue in excess of amounts billed are recorded as unbilled receivables.
Unbilled receivables which are anticipated to be invoiced in the next twelve months are included in "accounts receivable, net" on the consolidated balance sheet.
Based on the nature of our contracts with customers, we do not typically recognize unbilled receivables related to revenues recognized in excess of amounts billed.
Revenue expected to be recognized in any future period related to remaining performance obligations, excluding revenue pertaining to contracts that have an original expected duration of one year or less, and excluding contracts where revenue is recognized as invoiced, was approximately $58 million as of June 30, 2019.
Since we typically invoice customers at contract inception, this amount is included in our current and non-current deferred revenue balances.
As of June 30, 2019, we expect to recognize approximately 25% of the revenue related to these unsatisfied performance obligations during the remainder of 2019, 40% during 2020, and 35% thereafter.
We have determined that certain sales incentive programs meet the requirements to be capitalized.
Capitalized incremental costs related to initial contracts and renewals are amortized over the same period because the commissions paid on both the initial contract and renewals are commensurate with one another.
Total capitalized costs to obtain a contract were immaterial during the periods presented and are included in other long-term assets on our consolidated balance sheets.
•We generally expense sales commissions when incurred because the amortization period would have been one year or less.
•We do not disclose the value of unsatisfied performance obligations for (i) contracts with an original expected length of one year or less and (ii) contracts for which we recognize revenue at the amount to which we have the right to invoice for services performed.
We do not consider the time value of money for contracts with original durations of one year or less.
The carrying value of our equity method investments was $13 million as of June 30, 2019.
Our proportionate share of the income from equity-method investments was not material for the periods presented.
We define fair value to be the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date.
When determining the fair value measurements for assets and liabilities required or permitted to be recorded at fair value, we consider the principal or most advantageous market that market participants may use when pricing the asset or liability.
We value our available-for-sale short-term investments based on pricing from third party pricing vendors, who may use quoted prices in active markets for identical assets (Level 1 inputs) or inputs other than quoted prices that are observable either directly or indirectly (Level 2 inputs) in determining fair value.
We classify all of our fixed income available-for-sale securities as having Level 2 inputs.
The valuation techniques used to measure the fair value of our financial instruments having Level 2 inputs were derived from non-binding market consensus prices that are corroborated by observable market data, quoted market prices for similar instruments, or pricing models, such as discounted cash flow techniques.
Short-term investments available-for-sale consists of debt securities issued by states of the U.S. and political subdivisions of the U.S., corporate debt securities and debt securities issued by U.S. government organizations and agencies.
All of our short-term investments available-for-sale have contractual maturities of less than 60 months.
We consider counterparty credit risk in the valuation of our derivatives.
However, counterparty credit risk did not impact the valuation of our derivatives during the six months ended June 30, 2019.
There were no transfers in or out of Level 1 or Level 2 during the six months ended June 30, 2019.
As of June 30, 2019, our short-term investments did not include sovereign debt from any country other than the United States.
We did not have any items that were measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis at June 30, 2019 and December 31, 2018.
The carrying value of net accounts receivable, accounts payable, and long-term debt contained in the consolidated balance sheets approximates fair value.
We recognize all of our derivative instruments as either assets or liabilities in our statement of financial position at fair value.
The accounting for changes in the fair value (i.e., gains or losses) of a derivative instrument depends on whether it has been designated and qualifies as part of a hedging relationship and further, on the type of hedging relationship.
We have operations in approximately 50 countries.
Sales outside of the Americas accounted for approximately 61% and 62% of our net sales during the three months ended June 30, 2019 and 2018, and approximately 61% and 62% of our net sales during the six months ended June 30, 2019 and 2018, respectively.
These financial risks are monitored and managed by us as an integral part of our overall risk management program.
We maintain a foreign currency risk management strategy that uses derivative instruments (foreign currency forward contracts) to help protect our earnings and cash flows from fluctuations caused by the volatility in currency exchange rates.
The vast majority of our foreign sales are denominated in the customers’ local currency.
We purchase foreign currency forward contracts as hedges of forecasted sales that are denominated in foreign currencies and as hedges of foreign currency denominated financial assets or liabilities.
These contracts are entered into to help protect against the risk that the eventual dollar-net-cash inflows resulting from such sales or firm commitments will be adversely affected by changes in exchange rates.
We also purchase foreign currency forward contracts as hedges of forecasted expenses that are denominated in foreign currencies.
These contracts are entered into to help protect against the risk that the eventual dollar-net-cash outflows resulting from foreign currency operating and cost of sales expenses will be adversely affected by changes in exchange rates.
We designate foreign currency forward contracts as cash flow hedges of forecasted net sales or forecasted expenses.
In addition, we hedge our foreign currency denominated balance sheet exposures using foreign currency forward contracts that are not designated as hedging instruments.
None of our derivative instruments contain a credit-risk-related contingent feature.
To help protect against the reduction in value caused by a fluctuation in foreign currency exchange rates of forecasted foreign currency cash flows resulting from international sales over the next one to three years, we have instituted a foreign currency cash flow hedging program.
We hedge portions of our forecasted net sales and forecasted expenses denominated in foreign currencies with forward contracts.
For forward contracts, when the dollar strengthens significantly against the foreign currencies, the change in the present value of future foreign currency cash flows may be offset by the change in the fair value of the forward contracts designated as hedges.
We purchase foreign currency forward contracts for up to 100% of our forecasted exposures in selected currencies (primarily in Euro, Japanese yen, Hungarian forint, British pound, Malaysian ringgit, Korean won and Chinese yuan) and limit the duration of these contracts to 36 months or less.
For derivative instruments that are designated and qualify as a cash flow hedge, the effective portion of the gain or loss on the derivative is reported as a component of accumulated OCI and reclassified into earnings in the same line item (net sales, operating expenses, or cost of sales) associated with the forecasted transaction and in the same period or periods during which the hedged transaction affects earnings.
Gains and losses on the derivative representing either hedge ineffectiveness or hedge components excluded from the assessment of effectiveness are recognized in current earnings or expenses during the current period and are classified as a component of “net foreign exchange gain (loss).” Hedge effectiveness of foreign currency forwards designated as cash flow hedges are measured by comparing the hedging instrument’s cumulative change in fair value from inception to maturity to the forecasted transaction’s terminal value.
The contracts in the foregoing table had contractual maturities of 18 months or less and 24 months or less at June 30, 2019 and December 31, 2018, respectively.
At June 30, 2019, we expect to reclassify $6.5 million of gains on derivative instruments from accumulated OCI to net sales during the next twelve months when the hedged international sales occur, $0.2 million of losses on derivative instruments from accumulated OCI to cost of sales during the next twelve months when the cost of sales are incurred and $0.1 million of losses on derivative instruments from accumulated OCI to operating expenses during the next twelve months when the hedged operating expenses occur.
Expected amounts are based on derivative valuations at June 30, 2019.
The gains and losses recognized in earnings due to hedge ineffectiveness were not material for each of the six months ended June 30, 2019 and 2018 and are included as a component of net income under the line item “net foreign exchange loss.”
Other derivatives not designated as hedging instruments consist primarily of foreign currency forward contracts that we use to hedge our foreign denominated net receivable or net payable positions to help protect against the change in value caused by a fluctuation in foreign currency exchange rates.
We typically attempt to hedge up to 90% of our outstanding foreign denominated net receivables or net payables and typically limit the duration of these foreign currency forward contracts to approximately 90 days or less.
The gain or loss on the derivatives as well as the offsetting gain or loss on the hedge item attributable to the hedged risk is recognized in current earnings under the line item “net foreign exchange loss.” As of June 30, 2019 and December 31, 2018, we held foreign currency forward contracts that were not designated as hedging instruments with a notional amount of $47 million and $71 million, respectively.
The following tables present the fair value of derivative instruments on our Consolidated Balance Sheets at June 30, 2019 and December 31, 2018, respectively.
Software development costs capitalized for the three months ended June 30, 2019 and 2018 were $2.2 million and $3.9 million, respectively, and related amortization expense was $6.9 million and $6.8 million, respectively.
For the six months ended June 30, 2019 and 2018, capitalized software development costs were $4.6 million and $11.9 million, respectively, and related amortization expense was $13.8 million and $12.9 million, respectively.
Capitalized software development costs for the three months ended June 30, 2019 and 2018 included costs related to stock-based compensation of $0.0 million and $0.2 million, respectively.
For the six months ended June 30, 2019 and 2018, capitalized software development costs included costs related to stock-based compensation of $0.1 million and $0.5 million, respectively.
The related amounts in the table above are net of fully amortized assets.
Amortization of capitalized software development costs is computed on an individual product basis for those products available for market and is recognized based on the product’s estimated economic life, generally three to six years.
The excess purchase price over the fair value of assets acquired is recorded as goodwill.
As we have one operating segment comprised of components with similar economic characteristics, we allocate goodwill to one reporting unit for goodwill impairment testing.
Our annual impairment test is performed in the fourth quarter of each year.
No impairment of goodwill was identified during the six months ended June 30, 2019 or the twelve months ended December 31, 2018.
We have operating leases for corporate offices, automobiles, and certain equipment.
Our leases have remaining terms of 1 year to 95 years, some of which may include options to extend the leases for up to 9 years, and some of which may include options to terminate the leases within 1 year.
Amounts related to finance lease activities and income from leasing activities were not material for the periods presented.
As of June 30, 2019, we have additional operating leases, that have not commenced during the period, which were not material.
Valuation allowances are established when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to amounts which are more likely than not to be realized.
We had a valuation allowance of $80 million at June 30, 2019 and December 31, 2018.
A majority of the valuation allowance is related to the deferred tax assets of National Instruments Hungary Kft.
We had $8.3 million and $9.8 million of unrecognized tax benefits at June 30, 2019 and December 31, 2018, respectively, all of which would affect our effective income tax rate if recognized.
We recorded a gross increase in unrecognized tax benefits of $0.2 million and $0.4 million for the three and six months ended June 30, 2019, respectively, as a result of the tax positions taken during these and prior periods.
We recorded a gross decrease in unrecognized tax benefits of $2.0 million for each of the three and six months ended June 30, 2019, as a result of closing open tax years.
As of June 30, 2019, it is reasonably possible that we will recognize tax benefits in the amount of $1.5 million in the next twelve months due to the closing of open tax years.
As of June 30, 2019, we had approximately $0.8 million accrued for interest related to uncertain tax positions.
The tax years 2012 through 2019 remain open to examination by the major taxing jurisdictions to which we are subject.
Our provision for income taxes reflected an effective tax rate of 13% and 11% for the three months ended June 30, 2019 and 2018, respectively, and 12% and 14% for the six months ended June 30, 2019 and 2018, respectively.
In addition, our research and development activities in Hungary benefit from a tax law in Hungary that provides for an enhanced deduction for qualified research and development expenses.
The tax position of our Hungarian operations resulted in income tax benefits of $1.6 million and $2.9 million for the three months ended June 30, 2019 and 2018, respectively, and $2.6 million and $4.6 million for the six months ended June 30, 2019 and 2018, respectively.
Earnings from our operations in Malaysia are free of tax under a tax holiday effective January 1, 2013.
This tax holiday expires in 2027.
The income tax benefits of the tax holiday for the three and six months ended June 30, 2019 were approximately $0.8 million and $1.3 million, respectively.
The income tax benefits of the tax holiday for the three and six months ended June 30, 2018 were approximately $0.5 million and $1.1 million, respectively.
The impact of the tax holiday on a per share basis for each of the three and six months ended June 30, 2019 and June 30, 2018 was a benefit of $0.01 per share.
Following approval by the Company’s Board of Directors and stockholders, on May 14, 2013, the Company’s certificate of incorporation was amended to increase the authorized shares of common stock by 180,000,000 shares to a total of 360,000,000 shares.
As a result of this amendment, the total number of shares which the Company is authorized to issue is 365,000,000 shares, consisting of (i) 5,000,000 shares of preferred stock, par value $0.01 per share, and (ii) 360,000,000 shares of common stock, par value $0.01 per share.
Our stockholders approved our 2005 Incentive Plan (the “2005 Plan”) in May 2005.

Vesting of ten-year awards may accelerate based on the Company’s previous year’s earnings and growth but ten-year awards cannot accelerate to vest over a period of less than five years.
There were 3,362,304 shares of common stock that were reserved but not issued under the 2005 Plan as of May 11, 2010.
Our stockholders approved our 2010 Incentive Plan (the “2010 Plan”) on May 11, 2010.

The 2015 Plan, administered by the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors, provides for the granting of incentive awards in the form of restricted stock and RSUs to employees, directors and consultants of the Company and employees and consultants of any parent or subsidiary of the Company and such awards may be subject to performance-based vesting conditions.
Vesting of ten-year awards may accelerate based on the Company’s previous year’s earnings and growth but ten-year awards cannot accelerate to vest over a period of less than five years.
There were 1,933,363 shares available for grant under the 2015 Plan at June 30, 2019.
During the six months ended June 30, 2019, we granted PRSUs to certain executives under our 2015 Plan.
Refer to the "Summary of Significant Accounting Policies" in Note 1 - Basis of presentation for additional discussion regarding the impact of these grants on our accounting policies and related estimates.
Our employee stock purchase plan permits substantially all domestic employees and employees of designated subsidiaries to acquire our common stock at a purchase price of 85% of the lower of the market price at the beginning or the end of the purchase period.
Employees may designate up to 15% of their compensation for the purchase of common stock under this plan.
On May 9, 2017, our stockholders approved an additional 3,000,000 shares for issuance under our employee stock purchase plan.
At June 30, 2019, we had 1,525,607 shares of common stock reserved for future issuance under this plan.
We issued 469,437 shares under this plan in the six months ended June 30, 2019 and the weighted average purchase price was $37.59 per share.
During the six months ended June 30, 2019, we did not make any changes in accounting principles or methods of estimates with respect to such plan.
We have 5,000,000 authorized shares of preferred stock.
On January 21, 2004, our Board of Directors designated 750,000 of these shares as Series A Participating Preferred Stock in conjunction with the adoption of a Preferred Stock Rights Agreement which expired on May 10, 2014.
There were no shares of preferred stock issued and outstanding at June 30, 2019.

We did not repurchase any shares during the six months ended June 30, 2018.
At June 30, 2019, there were 1,850,402 shares remaining available for repurchase under this program.
This repurchase program does not have an expiration date.
We operate as one operating segment.
Operating segments are defined as components of an enterprise for which separate financial information is evaluated regularly by the chief operating decision maker, who is our chief executive officer, in deciding how to allocate resources and in assessing performance.
Our chief operating decision maker evaluates our financial information and resources and assesses the performance of these resources on a consolidated basis.
Since we operate in one operating segment, all required financial segment information can be found in the condensed consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto.
We sell our products in three geographic regions which consist of Americas, EMEIA and APAC.
Our sales to these regions share similar economic characteristics, similar product mix, similar customers, and similar distribution methods.
Statements of Income.
Based on the billing location of the customer, total sales outside the U.S. for the three months ended June 30, 2019 and 2018 were $211 million and $222 million, respectively, and $409 million and $422 million for the six months ended June 30, 2019 and 2018, respectively.
Total property and equipment, net, outside the U.S. was $119 million as of June 30, 2019 and $132 million at December 31, 2018, respectively.
The Loan Agreement provided for a $50 million unsecured revolving line of credit with a scheduled maturity date of May 9, 2018 (the “Maturity Date”).
On October 29, 2015, we entered into a First Amendment to Loan Agreement (the “Amendment”) with the Lender, which amended our Loan Agreement to among other things, (i) increase the unsecured revolving line of credit from $50 million to $125 million, (ii) extend the Maturity Date of the line of credit from May 9, 2018 to October 29, 2020, and (iii) provide us with an option to request increases to the line of credit of up to an additional $25 million in the aggregate, subject to consent of the Lender and terms and conditions to be mutually agreed between us and the Lender.
On April 27, 2018, we entered into a Second Amendment to Loan Agreement (the "Second Amendment") which amended the Loan Agreement, as amended by the Amendment to, among other things, (i) reduce the revolving line of credit from $125.0 million to $5.0 million, (ii) reduce the letter of credit sublimit under the line of credit from $10.0 million to $5.0 million and (iii) require us and our subsidiaries to comply with certain of the affirmative and negative covenants under the Loan Agreement only if loans are outstanding under the Loan Agreement or if we have not reimbursed any drawing under a letter of credit issued under the Loan Agreement within five business days following the request of the Lender.
Principal, together with all accrued and unpaid interest, is due and payable on the Maturity Date.
We are also obligated to pay a quarterly commitment fee, payable in arrears, based on the available commitments at a rate of 0.18% to 0.30%, with such rate determined based on the ratio described above.
The affirmative covenants include, among other things, delivery of financial statements, compliance certificates and notices; payment of taxes and other obligations; maintenance of existence; maintenance of properties and insurance; and compliance with applicable laws and regulations.
As of June 30, 2019, we were in compliance with all applicable covenants in the Loan Agreement.
The Loan Agreement contains customary events of default including, among other things, payment defaults, breaches of covenants or representations and warranties, cross-defaults with certain other indebtedness, bankruptcy and insolvency events, judgment defaults and change in control events, subject to grace periods in certain instances.
Upon an event of default, the lender may declare all or a portion of the outstanding obligations payable by us to be immediately due and payable and exercise other rights and remedies provided for under the Loan Agreement.
Proceeds of loans made under the Loan Agreement may be used for working capital and other general corporate purposes.
We may prepay the loans under the Loan Agreement in whole or in part at any time without premium or penalty.
Certain of our existing and future material domestic subsidiaries are required to guaranty our obligations under the Loan Agreement.
As of June 30, 2019, we had no outstanding borrowings under this line of credit.
During the three and six months ended June 30, 2019 and June 30, 2018, we incurred no interest expense.
As of June 30, 2019 and June 30, 2018, the weighted-average interest rate on the revolving line of credit was 3.4% and 3.2%, respectively.
As of June 30, 2019, we had non-cancelable purchase commitments with various suppliers of customized inventory and inventory components totaling approximately $6.9 million over the next twelve months.
Since the first quarter of 2017, we have been taking steps to reduce our overall employee headcount in an effort to minimize job duplication or evaluate where we should shift and centralize activities, improve efficiencies, and rebalance our resources on higher return activities.
The timing and scope of our headcount reductions will vary.
The restructuring liability of $3.1 million at June 30, 2019 relating to our restructuring activity is recorded in the “accrued compensation” line item of our consolidated balance sheet.
We are not currently a party to any material litigation.
However, in the ordinary course of our business, we have in the past, are currently and will likely become involved in various legal proceedings, claims, and regulatory, tax or government inquiries and investigations, and could incur uninsured liability in any one or more of them.
No assurances can be given with respect to the extent or outcome of any investigation, litigation or dispute.
On July 24, 2019, our Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.25 per common share, payable on September 3, 2019, to stockholders of record on August 12, 2019.
We are not currently a party to any material litigation.
However, in the ordinary course of our business, we have in the past, are currently and will likely become involved in various legal proceedings, claims, and regulatory, tax or government inquiries and investigations, and could incur uninsured liability in any one or more of them.
No assurances can be given with respect to the extent or outcome of any investigation, litigation or dispute.
The risks described below are not the only risks that we face.
See “Current business outlook” in this Form 10-Q for information regarding recent business conditions.
•fluctuations in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar;
•the burdens of complying with a wide variety of foreign laws.
Moreover, there can be no assurance that our international sales will continue at existing levels or grow in accordance with our efforts to increase foreign market penetration.
In many foreign countries, particularly in those with developing economies, it is common to engage in business practices that are prohibited by U.S. regulations applicable to us such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act.
We must also comply with various import and export regulations.
The application of these various regulations depends on the classification of our products which can change over time as such regulations are modified or interpreted.
Additionally, the regulatory environment in some countries is very restrictive as their governments try to protect their local economy and value of their local currency against the U.S. dollar.
We plan to continue to make significant investments in research, development, and marketing for new and existing products and technologies.
We have made and expect to make significant investments in software development related to the new and enhanced features of our products.
These investments involve a number of risks as the commercial success of such efforts depend on many factors, including our ability to anticipate and respond to innovation, achieve the desired technological fit, and be effective with our marketing and distribution efforts.
As has occurred in the past and as may be expected to occur in the future, we have experienced significant delays between the announcement and the commercial availability of new products.
Our Reported Financial Results May be Adversely Affected by Changes in Accounting Principles Generally Accepted in the U.S. We prepare our financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S.
These accounting principles are subject to interpretation by the FASB and the Securities and Exchange Commission.
For example, in February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02, Leases, as amended, supersedes nearly all existing U.S. GAAP lease guidance and which became effective for us for our fiscal year beginning January 1, 2019.
•increasing labor costs.
No assurance can be given that our efforts to mitigate these risks will be successful.
•concentration of inventory increasing the risks associated with fire, natural disasters and logistics disruptions to customer order fulfillment.
Our Financial Performance is Subject to Risks Associated with Changes in the Value of the U.S. Dollar versus Local Currencies.
The vast majority of our sales outside of the U.S. are denominated in local currencies, and accordingly, the U.S. dollar equivalent of these sales is affected by changes in the foreign currency exchange rates.
If the local currencies in which we sell our products strengthen against the U.S. dollar, we have in the past, and in the future may need to, lower our prices in the local currency to remain competitive in our international markets.
In the past, these dynamics have also adversely affected our net sales growth in international markets and may pose similar challenges in the future.
See “Current business outlook” in this Form 10-Q for information regarding recent business conditions.
We continue to make a concentrated effort to increase our net sales through the pursuit of orders with a value greater than $1.0 million.
These types of orders expose us to significant additional business and legal risks compared to smaller orders.
At times these orders include terms that impose critical delivery commitments and severe contractual liabilities if we fail to provide the required quantity of products at the required delivery times, impose product acceptance requirements and product performance evaluation requirements which create uncertainty with respect to the timing of our ability to recognize revenue from such orders, allow the customers to cancel or delay orders without liability, require us to develop specific product mitigation plans for product delivery constraints caused by unexpected or catastrophic situations to help assure quick production recovery, and that require most favored customer pricing, significant discounts, extended payment terms and volume rebates.
At times these customers require broad indemnity obligations and large direct and consequential damage provisions in the event we breach our contracts with them.
At times these contracts have supply constraint requirements which mandate that we allocate large product inventories for a specific contract.
These inventory requirements expose us to higher risks of inventory obsolescence and can adversely impact our ability to provide adequate product supply to other customers.
In addition, these larger orders are more volatile, are subject to greater discount variability and may contract at a faster pace during an economic downturn.
We attempt to manage these risks but there can be no assurance that we will be successful in our efforts.
Sales of our products are dependent on customers in certain industries, particularly the telecommunications, semiconductor, consumer electronics, automotive, energy, automated test equipment, and aerospace, defense and government.
We are currently implementing changes within our organization designed to enhance our ability to pursue market opportunities, accelerate our technology development initiatives, and improve operational efficiencies.
Specifically, we are in the process of aligning certain aspects of our operations with our strategic focus on industry-specific applications where we believe our product platform can add the most value to our customers.
By virtue of our holdings of cash, investment securities and foreign currency derivatives, we have exposure to many different counterparties, and routinely execute transactions with counterparties in the financial services industry, including commercial banks and investment banks.
Many of these transactions expose us to credit risk in the event of a default of our counterparties.
We continue to monitor the stability of the financial markets, particularly those in the emerging markets.
We Have Established a Budget and Variations from Our Budget Will Affect Our Financial Results.
We have established an operating budget for fiscal 2019.
•increased component costs resulting from vendors increasing their sales prices.
•government actions throughout the world.
There can be no assurance that we will be able to compete successfully in the future.
•tariffs and trade restrictions imposed by the U.S. or other countries;
Our Revenues are Subject to Seasonal Variations.
In previous years, our revenues have been characterized by seasonality, with revenues typically growing from the first quarter to the second quarter, being relatively constant from the second quarter to the third quarter, growing in the fourth quarter compared to the third quarter and declining in the first quarter of the following year from the fourth quarter of the preceding year.
There can be no assurance as to the outcome of any future examinations.
In recent years, we have completed several acquisitions.
Achieving the anticipated benefits of an acquisition depends upon whether the integration of the acquired business, products or technology is accomplished efficiently and effectively.
In addition, successful acquisitions generally require, among other things, integration of product offerings, manufacturing operations and coordination of sales and marketing and research and development efforts.
These difficulties can become more challenging due to the need to coordinate geographically separated organizations, the complexities of the technologies being integrated, and the necessities of integrating personnel with disparate business backgrounds and combining different corporate cultures.
The integration of operations following an acquisition also requires the dedication of management resources, which may distract attention from our day-to-day business and may disrupt key research and development, marketing or sales efforts.
In addition, effective January 1, 2010, certain qualified research and development expenses in Hungary became eligible for an enhanced tax deduction.
These tax benefits may not be available in future years due to changes in political conditions in Hungary or changes in tax laws in Hungary or in the U.S.
Profits from our manufacturing facility in Penang, Malaysia are free of tax under a 15-year tax holiday effective January 1, 2013.
Our manufacturing processes use large volumes of high-quality components and subassemblies supplied by outside sources.
Several of these items are only available through limited sources.
Limited source items purchased include custom application-specific integrated circuits, chassis and other components.
We have in the past experienced delays and quality problems in connection with limited source items, and there can be no assurance that these problems will not recur in the future.
In some countries, we use distributors to support our sales channels.
We rely on the efficient and uninterrupted operation of complex information technology systems and networks, including cloud-based and other outsourced services, to operate our business.
We rely on a primary global center for our management information systems and on multiple systems in branches not covered by our global center.
As with any information system, unforeseen issues may arise that could affect our ability to receive adequate, accurate and timely financial information, which in turn could inhibit effective and timely decisions.
Furthermore, it is possible that our global center for information systems or our branch operations could experience a complete or partial shutdown.
A significant system or network disruption could be the result of new system implementations, facility issues, energy blackouts, and computer viruses, cyber-attacks, or security breaches, some of which may remain undetected for an extended period.
Threats to our information technology security can take a variety of forms and individuals or groups of hackers or sophisticated organizations including state-sponsored organizations, may take steps that pose threats to our customers and our infrastructure.
In addition, changing laws and regulations governing our responsibility to safeguard private data could result in a significant increase in operating or capital expenditures needed to comply with these new laws or regulations.
Accordingly, our operating results in such periods would be adversely impacted.
From time to time, we have experienced attempts to breach our security and attempts to introduce malicious software into our information technology systems; however, such attacks have not previously resulted in any material damage to us.
We are Subject to Risks Associated with Our Website.
We devote significant resources to maintaining our website, ni.com, as a key marketing, sales and support tool and expect to continue to do so in the future.
We host our website internally.
Our Products are Complex and May Contain Bugs, Vulnerabilities, Errors, or Design Flaws.
As has occurred in the past and as may be expected to occur in the future, our hardware products, software products and third-party components or operating systems on which our products are based may contain bugs, vulnerabilities, errors or design flaws.
Our products operate in conjunction with third-party products and components across a broad ecosystem.
As has occurred in the past and as may be expected to occur in the future, our products, or products or components in conjunction with which they operate, may contain design flaws.
Although we maintain insurance, there can be no assurance that such insurance or the contractual limitations used by us to limit our liability will be sufficient to cover or limit any claims which may occur.
We Are Subject to the Risk of Product Liability Claims.
Our products are designed to provide information upon which users may rely.
Our products are also used in “real time” applications requiring extremely rapid and continuous processing and constant feedback.
Such applications give rise to the risk that a failure or interruption of the system or application could result in economic damage, bodily harm or property damage.
Although we maintain insurance, there can be no assurance that such insurance or the contractual limitations used by us to limit our liability will be sufficient to cover or limit any claims which may occur.
As required by Section 302 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, this Form 10-Q contains our management’s certification of adequate disclosure controls and procedures as of June 30, 2019.
Our most recent annual report on Form 10-K also contains a report by our management on our internal control over financial reporting including an assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2018 and an attestation and report by our external auditors with respect to the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting under Section 404.
We expect that the ongoing compliance with Sections 302 and 404 will continue to be both very costly and very challenging and there can be no assurance that material weaknesses will not be identified in future periods.
Our Business Depends on the Continued Service of Our Key Management and Technical Personnel.
Our success depends upon the continued contributions of our key management, sales, marketing, research and development and operational personnel including Alex Davern, our Chief Executive Officer, Eric Starkloff, our President and Chief Operating Officer, and other members of our senior management and key technical personnel.
Our key employees may voluntarily terminate their employment with us at any time.
We also believe our future success will depend upon our ability to attract and retain additional highly skilled management, technical, marketing, research and development, and operational personnel with experience in managing large and rapidly changing companies, as well as training, motivating and supervising employees.
The market for hiring and retaining certain technical personnel, including software engineers, has become more competitive and intense in recent years.
Failure to attract and retain a sufficient number of qualified technical personnel, including software engineers, or retain our key personnel could have a material adverse effect on our operating results.
We must comply with many different governmental regulations related to the use, storage, discharge and disposal of toxic, volatile or otherwise hazardous chemicals used in our operations in the U.S., Hungary, and Malaysia.
Although we believe that our activities conform to presently applicable environmental regulations, our failure to comply with present or future regulations could result in the imposition of fines, suspension of production or a cessation of operations.
Any such environmental regulations could require us to acquire costly equipment or to incur other significant expenses to comply with such regulations.
Any failure by us to control the use of or adequately restrict the discharge of hazardous substances could subject us to future liabilities.
Provisions in Our Charter Documents and Delaware Law May Delay or Prevent an Acquisition of Us.
Our certificate of incorporation, bylaws and Delaware law contain provisions that could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us without the consent of our Board of Directors.
These provisions include a classified Board of Directors, prohibition of stockholder action by written consent, prohibition of stockholders to call special meetings and the requirement that the holders of at least 80% of our shares approve any business combination not otherwise approved by two-thirds of our Board of Directors.
Delaware law also imposes some restrictions on mergers and other business combinations between us and any holder of 15% or more of our outstanding common stock.
In addition, our Board of Directors has the right to issue preferred stock without stockholder approval, which could be used to dilute the stock ownership of a potential hostile acquirer.
