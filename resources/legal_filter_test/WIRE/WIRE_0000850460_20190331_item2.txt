Item 2.
Encore believes it is a low-cost manufacturer of electrical building wire and cable.
The Company is a significant supplier of building wire for interior electrical wiring in commercial and industrial buildings, homes, apartments, and manufactured housing.
Price competition for electrical wire and cable is intense, and the Company sells its products in accordance with prevailing market prices.
Copper, a commodity product, is the principal raw material used by the Company in manufacturing its products.
Copper accounted for approximately 73.0%, 69.7%, and 65.2% of the Company’s cost of goods sold during fiscal 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively.
Additionally, the SEC allows shares of certain physically backed copper exchange-traded funds (“ETFs”) to be listed and publicly traded.
Such funds and other copper ETFs like them hold copper cathode as collateral against their shares.
The acquisition of copper cathode by copper ETFs may materially decrease or interrupt the availability of copper for immediate delivery in the United States, which could materially increase the Company’s cost of copper.
In addition to rising copper prices and potential supply shortages, we believe that ETFs and similar copper-backed derivative products could lead to increased price volatility for copper.
Wire prices can, and frequently do, change on a daily basis.
Historically, the Company has not engaged in hedging strategies for raw material purchases.
The tables below highlight the range of closing prices of copper on a per pound basis on the Comex exchange for the periods shown.
Reference should also be made to the audited financial statements and notes thereto included in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018.
Net sales were $314.7 million in the first quarter of 2019 compared to $291.4 million in the first quarter of 2018.
This 8.0% increase in net sales dollars is primarily the result of a 13.5% increase in copper wire unit volume shipped, offset somewhat by a 5.9% decrease in the average selling price of copper wire.
Unit volume is measured in pounds of copper contained in the wire shipped during the period.
The 13.5% increase in unit volume shipped was primarily due to particularly rough winter weather that slowed construction and impacted volumes in the first quarter of 2018, particularly in January.
The average cost per pound of raw copper purchased decreased 9.6% in the first quarter of 2019 compared to the first quarter of 2018 and was the principal driver of the decreased average sales price of copper wire.
Cost of goods sold was $273.4 million, or 86.9% of net sales, in the first quarter of 2019, compared to $253.9 million, or 87.1% of net sales, in the first quarter of 2018.
Gross profit increased to $41.3 million, or 13.1% of net sales, in the first quarter of 2019 from $37.5 million, or 12.9% of net sales, in the first quarter of 2018.
The increase in gross profit margin percentage was driven principally by the increase of the copper wire spread.
The spread between the average price paid for a pound of raw copper and the average sales price for a pound of copper contained in finished wire increased 2.2% in the first quarter of 2019 versus the first quarter of 2018.
The spread increased as a result of the average sales price per pound of copper sold decreasing 5.9% while the per pound cost of raw copper purchased decreased 9.6%.
The percentage change on sales is on a higher nominal dollar amount than on purchases and, therefore, spreads change on a nominal dollar basis.
The margin changes were due primarily to the competitive pricing environment in the industry.
On April 8, 2019, the U.S. Commerce Department imposed preliminary countervailing duties on imports of aluminum wire from China at rates ranging from 11.57 to 164.16 percent.
The final results of the U.S. Government’s ongoing antidumping and countervailing duty investigations are not expected until the end of the year.
Total raw materials cost, including the LIFO adjustment, decreased to 75.0% of net sales in the first quarter of 2019, from 76.5% of net sales in the first quarter of 2018.
Increased overhead costs added to the increase in total cost of sales dollars and increased as a percent of net sales.
Overheads contain some fixed and semi-fixed components which do not fluctuate as much as sales dollars fluctuate.
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost, using the last-in, first out (LIFO) method, or market.
The Company maintains two inventory pools for LIFO purposes.
As permitted by U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, the Company maintains its inventory costs and cost of goods sold on a first-in, first-out (FIFO) basis and makes a monthly adjustment to adjust total inventory and cost of goods sold from FIFO to LIFO.
The Company performs a lower of cost or market calculation quarterly.
decreases in copper and other material prices could necessitate establishing an LCM reserve in future periods.
During the first quarter of 2018, a LIFO adjustment was recorded, increasing cost of sales by $2.0 million.
The Company maintains a substantial inventory of finished products to satisfy customers’ delivery requirements promptly.
As is customary in the building wire industry, the Company provides payment terms to most of its customers that exceed terms that it receives from its suppliers.
Copper suppliers generally give very short payment terms (less than 15 days) while the Company and the building wire industry give customers much longer terms.
In general, the Company’s standard payment terms result in the collection of a significant majority of net sales within approximately 75 days of the date of invoice.
As a result of this timing difference, building wire companies must have sufficient cash and access to capital resources to finance their working capital needs, thereby creating a barrier to entry for companies who do not have sufficient liquidity and capital resources.
The two largest components of working capital, receivables and inventory, and to a lesser extent, capital expenditures, are the primary drivers of the Company’s liquidity needs.
Capital expenditures have historically been necessary to expand and update the production capacity of the Company’s manufacturing operations.
The Company has historically satisfied its liquidity and capital expenditure needs with cash generated from operations and borrowings under its various debt arrangements.
The Company historically uses its revolving credit facility to manage day to day operating cash needs as required by daily fluctuations in working capital and has the facility in place should such a need arise in the future.
Cash provided by operating activities was $11.4 million in the first three months of 2019 compared to $8.0 million of cash used in the first three months of 2018.
The following changes in components of cash flow from operations were notable.
Trade accounts payable and accrued liabilities used cash of $16.4 million in the first three months of 2019 versus $6.6 million in the first three months of 2018, resulting in a negative change in cash flow of $9.8 million.
In the first three months of 2019, changes in current and deferred taxes provided cash of $4.0 million versus a $3.6 million source of cash in the first three months of 2018.
These changes in cash flow were the primary drivers of the $19.4 million increase in cash provided by operations in the first three months of 2019 compared to the first three months of 2018.
Cash used in investing activities increased to $11.9 million in the first three months of 2019 from $7.5 million in the first three months of 2018 due to higher capital expenditures on plant and equipment.
These changes in cash flow provided less than $0.1 million cash in financing activities for the first three months of 2019 versus
As of March 31, 2019, the balance on the Company’s revolving line of credit remained at zero.
The Company’s cash balance was $178.0 million at March 31, 2019 versus $107.8 million at March 31, 2018.
The total capital expenditures for all of 2019 associated with these projects are currently estimated to be between $38 million and $43 million.
The Company believes that the current cash balance, cash flow from operations, and the financing available from its revolving credit facility will satisfy anticipated working capital and capital expenditure requirements during 2019.
