Financial Statements.
The unaudited consolidated financial statements of Encore Wire Corporation (the “Company”) have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”) for interim information and the instructions to Form 10-Q and Rule 10-01 of Regulation S-X.
Accordingly, they do not include all of the information and footnotes required by U.S. GAAP for complete annual financial statements.
Amounts billed and due from our customers are classified as accounts receivables on the balance sheet and require payment on a short-term basis through standard payment terms.
We review and update these estimates regularly and the impact of any adjustments are recognized in the period the adjustments are identified.
The adjustments resulting from updated estimates of trade payment discounts and customer rebates were not material.
The Financial Accounting Standards Board (the “FASB”) Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) is the sole source of authoritative U.S. GAAP other than Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") issued rules and regulations that apply only to SEC registrants.
The FASB issues an Accounting Standard Update (“ASU”) to communicate changes to the codification.
The Company considers the applicability and impact of all ASUs.
The following are those ASUs that are relevant to the Company.
In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU No.
2014-09, “Revenue from Contracts with Customers (ASC 606),” which replaces numerous requirements in U.S. GAAP, including industry-specific requirements, and provides companies with a single revenue recognition model for recognizing revenue from contracts with customers.
On January 1, 2018, we adopted the requirements of ASC 606 and all the related amendments to all of our contracts using the modified retrospective method.
Upon completing our implementation assessment of ASC 606, we concluded that no adjustment was required to the opening balance of retained earnings at the date of initial application.
The comparative information has also not been restated and continues to be reported under the accounting standards in effect for those periods.
2016-02, “Leases (ASC 842).” Under the new guidance, a lessee will be required to recognize a right to use asset and a lease liability for all leases with terms of twelve months or longer.
Lessor accounting remains largely consistent with existing U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.
The new standard will be effective for us beginning January 1, 2019.
Companies that elect this option would record a cumulative-effect adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings on the date of adoption.
The Company has elected to apply this transition option upon adoption.
The Company continues to evaluate the effect that ASC 842 will have on its consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost, determined by the last-in, first-out (LIFO) method, or market.
LIFO pools are established at the end of each fiscal year.
During the first three quarters of every year, LIFO calculations are based on the inventory levels and costs at that time.
Accordingly, interim LIFO balances will fluctuate depending on those inventory levels and costs.
In the third quarter of 2018, LIFO adjustments were recorded, decreasing cost of sales by $9.1 million, versus LIFO adjustments increasing cost of sales by $11.0 million in the third quarter of 2017.
In the first nine months of 2018, LIFO adjustments were recorded, decreasing cost of sales by $5.4 million, versus LIFO adjustments increasing cost of sales by $15.0 million in the first nine months of 2017.
For the nine months ended September 30, the Company’s tax rate was approximately 23.3% in 2018 and 32.6% in 2017.
The difference between 2017 and 2018 is due primarily to the reduction in the federal corporate tax rate from 35% to 21% and the elimination of the Domestic Production Activities Deduction.
Due to the complexities involved in the accounting for the enactment of the new law, the SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin (“SAB”) 118 allowed a provisional estimate for the year ended December 31, 2017, which we made.
As of September 30, 2018, we have not made any material adjustments to our provisional estimate at December 31, 2017.
Earnings per common and common equivalent share are computed using the weighted average number of shares of common stock and common stock equivalents outstanding during each period.
The weighted average of employee stock options excluded from the determination of diluted earnings per common and common equivalent share for the third quarter was 166,500 in 2018 and 129,000 in 2017.
The weighted average of employee stock options excluded from the determination of diluted earnings per common and common equivalent share for the nine months ended September 30 was 159,537 in 2018 and 123,963 in 2017.
Such options were anti-dilutive for their respective periods.
The Credit Agreement, as amended, extends through October 1, 2021 and provides for maximum borrowings of $150.0 million.
At our request, and subject to certain conditions, the commitments under the Credit Agreement may be increased by a maximum of up to $100.0 million as long as existing or new lenders agree to provide such additional commitments.
Borrowings under the line of credit bear interest, at the Company’s option, at either (1) LIBOR plus a margin that varies from 0.875% to 1.75% depending upon the Leverage Ratio (as defined in the Credit Agreement), or (2) the base rate (which is the highest of the federal funds rate plus 0.5%, the prime rate, or LIBOR plus 1.0%) plus 0% to 0.25% (depending upon the Leverage Ratio).
A commitment fee ranging from 0.15% to 0.30% (depending upon the Leverage Ratio) is payable on the unused line of credit.
At September 30, 2018, there were no borrowings outstanding under the Credit Agreement, and letters of credit outstanding in the amount of $1.3 million left $148.7 million of credit available under the Credit Agreement.
Obligations under the Credit Agreement are the only contractual borrowing obligations or commercial borrowing commitments of the Company.
Obligations under the Credit Agreement are unsecured and contain customary covenants and events of default.
The Company was in compliance with the covenants as of September 30, 2018.
On November 10, 2006, the Board of Directors approved a stock repurchase program authorizing the Company to repurchase up to an authorized number of shares of its common stock on the open market or through privately negotiated transactions at prices determined by the President of the Company during the term of the program.
The Company’s Board of Directors has authorized several increases and annual extensions of this stock repurchase program, and, as of September 30, 2018, 1,132,946 shares remained authorized for repurchase through March 31, 2019.
The Company did not repurchase any shares of its stock in the nine months ended September 30, 2018 or 2017.
There were no changes to stockholders’ equity for the nine months ended September 30, 2018 and 2017 other than net income, the declaration of dividends, stock compensation, and the issuance of immaterial amounts of shares of common stock.
There are no material pending proceedings to which the Company is a party or to which any of its property is subject.
Significant judgment is required in both the determination of the probability of a loss and the determination as to whether a loss is reasonably estimable.
For information on the Company’s legal proceedings, see Note 8 to the Company’s consolidated financial statements included in Item 1 to this report and incorporated herein by reference.
Item 1A.
There have been no material changes to the Company’s risk factors as disclosed in Item 1A, “Risk Factors,” in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2017.
