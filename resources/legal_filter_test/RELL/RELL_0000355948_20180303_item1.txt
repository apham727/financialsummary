 The accompanying unaudited consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with United States Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (“GAAP”) for interim financial information and the instructions to Form 10-Q and Article 10 of Regulation S-X.
Accordingly, they do not include all the information and notes required by GAAP for complete financial statements.
 Our fiscal quarter ends on the Saturday nearest the end of the quarter-ending month.
The third quarter of fiscal 2018 and fiscal 2017 both contained 13 weeks.
The first nine months of fiscal 2018 and fiscal 2017 contained 40 and 39 weeks, respectively.
 In the opinion of management, all adjustments, which are of a normal and recurring nature, necessary for a fair presentation of the results of interim periods have been made.
All inter-company transactions and balances have been eliminated.
The unaudited consolidated financial statements presented herein include the accounts of our wholly owned subsidiaries.
Certain information and note disclosures normally included in financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP have been condensed or omitted pursuant to such rules and regulations.
 The financial information contained in this report should be read in conjunction with our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended May 27, 2017, that we filed on July 31, 2017.
Inventory reserves were approximately $3.7 million as of March 3, 2018 and $3.5 million as of May 27, 2017.
 In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) No.
2014-09 (“ASU 2014-09”), Revenue from Contracts with Customers, which amends guidance for revenue recognition.
ASU 2014-09 is principles based guidance that can be applied to all contracts with customers, enhancing comparability of revenue recognition practices across entities, industries, jurisdictions and capital markets.
The core principle of the guidance is that entities should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods and services.
In August 2015, the FASB issued an amendment to defer the effective date for all entities by one year.
Companies have the option of using either a full or modified retrospective approach in applying this standard.
During fiscal 2016 and 2017, the FASB issued four additional updates which further clarify the guidance provided in ASU 2014-09.
 We are evaluating the impact of the new standard on our financial statements using a three-phase approach (assessment, conversion and implementation).
We have undertaken a detailed analysis of our various contracts with customers and revenue streams.
The Company has engaged a third party to assist in evaluating the impact of this new standard on its consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.
We will complete the conversion and implementation phases by the end of fiscal year 2018 in conjunction with future interpretative guidance.
During the fourth quarter of each fiscal year, our goodwill balances are reviewed for impairment using the first day of our fourth quarter as the measurement date.
If after reviewing the totality of events or circumstances, we determine that it is not likely that the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount, then we test for impairment through the application of a fair value based test.
 Intangible assets are initially recorded at their fair market values determined on quoted market prices in active markets, if available, or recognized valuation models.
Intangible assets that have finite useful lives are amortized over their useful lives either on a straight-line basis or over their projected future cash flows and are tested for impairment when events or changes in circumstances occur that indicate possible impairment.
The carrying value of goodwill was $6.3 million as of March 3, 2018 and May 27, 2017.
 Goodwill is initially recorded based on the premium paid for acquisitions and is subsequently tested for impairment, using the first day of our fourth quarter as the measurement date.
The goodwill balance in its entirety relates to our IMES reporting unit which is included in our Healthcare segment.
 (1) Change from prior periods reflect impact of foreign currency translation.
 As of March 3, 2018, we had approximately $0.2 million invested in time deposits and certificates of deposit (“CD”) which mature in less than twelve months.
 As of May 27, 2017, we had invested in time deposits and certificates of deposit in the amount of $8.2 million.
Of this, $6.4 million mature in less than twelve months and $1.8 million mature in greater than twelve months.
 We liquidated our investments in equity securities in the third quarter of fiscal 2018.
Proceeds from the liquidation were $0.9 million with gross realized gains of $0.2 million for the nine months ended March 3, 2018.
Prior to the liquidation of our investment in equity securities, our investments in equity securities were classified as available-for-sale and were carried at their fair value based on quoted market prices.
Our investments, which were included in non-current assets, had a carrying amount of $0.6 million as of May 27, 2017.
Proceeds from the sale of securities were $0.1 million during the third quarter of fiscal 2017.
Prior to liquidating the equity securities, we reinvested proceeds from the sale of securities, and the cost of the equity securities sold was based on a specific identification method.
Gross realized gains on those sales were less than $0.1 million during the third quarter of fiscal 2017.
Net unrealized holding gains of less than $0.1 million during the third quarter of fiscal 2017 were included in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss).
We also provide extended warranties for some products we sell that lengthen the period of coverage specified in the manufacturer’s original warranty.
Our warranty terms generally range from one to three years.
Each quarter, we assess actual warranty costs incurred on a product-by-product basis and compare the warranty costs to our estimated warranty obligation.
With respect to new products, estimates are based generally on knowledge of the products, the extended warranty period and warranty experience.
 Warranty reserves are established for costs that are expected to be incurred after the sale and delivery of products under warranty.
The warranty reserves are determined based on known product failures, historical experience and other available evidence.
Warranty reserves were approximately $0.1 million as of March 3, 2018 and May 27, 2017.
 We recorded an income tax provision from continuing operations of $1.1 million and $0.8 million for the first nine months of fiscal 2018 and the first nine months of fiscal 2017, respectively.
The effective income tax rate from continuing operations during the first nine months of fiscal 2018 was a tax provision of 65.0%, as compared to a tax provision of (13.7%) during the first nine months of fiscal 2017.
The difference in rate during the first nine months of fiscal 2018, as compared to the first nine months of fiscal 2017, reflects the change in the overall loss realized through the third quarter in each respective period, changes in our geographical distribution of income (loss), the recording of provision to return true-ups of various foreign jurisdictions, the accrual of an uncertain tax position with respect to a German audit and our positions with respect to permanent reinvestment of foreign earnings under ASC 740-30, Income Taxes - Other Considerations or Special Areas (“ASC 740-30”).
Primarily as a result of those provisions of the Act, the Company recorded a deferred remeasurement impact of approximately $1.6 million, which was fully offset by the valuation allowance movement.
Additionally, the estimated deemed earnings repatriation tax, net of available foreign tax credits brought back as part of the deemed repatriation, was $3.5 million.
The Company does not anticipate any cash tax payments due to the foreign tax credit carryforwards available to fully offset the provisional deemed repatriation tax.
 The tax impact recorded for the Act during the third quarter of fiscal 2018 was provisional as outlined below and may change.
The Company completed a preliminary assessment of earnings that could be repatriated based on reinvestment needs of non-U.S. operations and earnings available for repatriation.
In addition, the Company continues to monitor potential legislative action and regulatory interpretations of the Act.
 Based on the effective date of certain provisions, the Company will be subject to additional requirements of the Act beginning in fiscal 2019.
The Company has not completed its analysis of those provisions and the estimated impact.
The Company also has not determined its accounting policy to treat the taxes due on GILTI as a period cost or include in the determination of deferred taxes.
 In December 2017, the SEC issued Staff Accounting Bulletin No.
Accordingly, we have reduced the deferred tax liability from $5.7 million as of the second quarter of fiscal 2018 to $0.2 million as of the third quarter of fiscal 2018 on foreign earnings of $47.2 million.
We are currently under examination in Thailand (fiscal 2008 through 2011).
We have tax years open in Germany beginning in fiscal 2015 and the Netherlands beginning in fiscal 2011.
 On September 12, 2017, the Company received an income tax refund from the State of Illinois of approximately $2.0 million, which was inclusive of interest earned.
The refund was a result of the conclusion of the Illinois amended return related to the sale of the RF, Wireless and Power Division in 2011.
 As of March 3, 2018, our worldwide liability for uncertain tax positions related to continuing operations was $0.1 million, excluding interest and penalties, as compared to no liability as of May 27, 2017.
The change to the uncertain tax positions for the third quarter of fiscal 2018 was as a result of the preliminary German audit assessments and the related exposure for the open years, which was reserved in the second quarter of fiscal 2018.
It is not expected that there will be a change to unrecognized tax provision within the next 12 months.
 The valuation allowance against the net deferred tax assets increased to $10.0 million as of March 3, 2018.
Changes during the first nine months relating to the Act include the impact from the deferred remeasurement, deemed earnings repatriation tax and changes to the permanent reinvestment assertion outside basis difference as a result of the Act.
