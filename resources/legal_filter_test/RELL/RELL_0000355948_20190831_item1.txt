The accompanying unaudited consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with United States Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (“GAAP”) for interim financial information and the instructions to Form 10-Q and Article 10 of Regulation S-X.
Accordingly, they do not include all the information and notes required by GAAP for complete financial statements.
Our fiscal quarter ends on the Saturday nearest the end of the quarter-ending month.
All inter-company transactions and balances have been eliminated.
The unaudited consolidated financial statements presented herein include the accounts of our wholly owned subsidiaries.
Certain information and note disclosures normally included in financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP have been condensed or omitted pursuant to such rules and regulations.
The financial information contained in this report should be read in conjunction with our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 1, 2019, that we filed on August 5, 2019.
Inventory reserves were approximately $4.6 million as of August 31, 2019 and June 1, 2019.
2014-09 (“ASU 2014-09”), Revenue from Contracts with Customers, which amends guidance for revenue recognition.
ASU 2014-09 is principles based guidance that can be applied to all contracts with customers, enhancing comparability of revenue recognition practices across entities, industries, jurisdictions and capital markets.
The core principle of the guidance is that entities should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods and services.
In August 2015, the FASB issued an amendment to defer the effective date for all entities by one year.
Companies have the option of using either a full or modified retrospective approach in applying this standard.
During fiscal 2016 and 2017, the FASB issued four additional updates which further clarify the guidance provided in ASU 2014-09.
As a result, financial information for the reporting period beginning June 3, 2018 was reported under the new standard, while comparative financial information has not been adjusted and continues to be reported in accordance with the previous standard.
The adoption of this standard did not impact the timing of revenue recognition for our customer sales.
The adoption did not result in the recognition of a cumulative adjustment to beginning retained earnings, nor did it have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements.
For the Company, the most significant impact of the new standard is the addition of required disclosures within the notes to the financial statements.
The Company recognizes services revenue when the repair, installation or training is performed.
Based on our analysis of services revenue, ASU 2014-09 has an immaterial impact on the timing, amount or characterization of services revenue recognized by the Company.
The services we provide are relatively short in duration and typically completed in one to two weeks.
Therefore, at each reporting date, the amount of unbilled work performed is insignificant.
The services revenue has consistently accounted for less than 5% of the Company’s total revenues and is expected to continue at that level.
A contract is an agreement between two or more parties that creates enforceable rights and obligations.
Prior to accepting a customer purchase order, we review the credit worthiness of the customer.
Purchase orders are deemed to meet the collectability criterion once the customer’s credit is approved.
Contract assets arise when the Company transfers a good or performs a service in advance of receiving consideration from the customer and contract liabilities arise when the Company receives consideration from its customer in advance of performance.
The Company receives advance payments or deposits from our customers before revenue is recognized, resulting in contract liabilities.
Each accepted purchase order identifies a distinct good or service as the performance obligation.
The goods are generally standard products we purchased from a supplier and stocked on our shelves.
However, we recognize revenue at a point in time because the termination provisions do not require, upon cancelation, the customer to pay fees that are commensurate with the work performed.
The promises to the customer are limited only to those goods or service.
As such, they are not a separate promised service.
For shipping point, Richardson is making the election under ASC 606-10-25-18B to account for shipping and handling as activities to fulfill the promise to transfer the goods.
The goods we provide to our customers are distinct in that our customers benefit from the goods we sell them through use in their own processes.
Each product we sell benefits the customer independently of the other products.
The transaction price for each product is the amount invoiced to the customer.
The transaction price is a fixed price per unit, except for the variable consideration.
The Company elects to exclude sales tax from the transaction price.
With the exception of sale with right of return, variable consideration has been identified only in the form of customer early payment discounts, which are immaterial to the Company’s financial statements.
We recognize revenue when title transfers to the customer, at the shipping point for FOB shipping contracts and at the customer’s delivery location for FOB destination contracts.
We believe that the transfer of title best represents when the customer obtains control of the goods.
Prior to that date, we do not have right to payment, and the significant risks and rewards remain with us.
The significant risks and rewards of ownership of the inventory transfer simultaneously with the transfer of title.
The customer’s acceptance of the goods is based on objective measurements, not subjective.
Our return policy is available to customers in our terms and conditions found on our website www.rell.com.
The Company allows returns with prior written authorization and we allow returns within 10 days of shipment for replacement parts.
The reserve for returns creates a refund liability on our balance sheet as a contra Trade Accounts Receivable as well as an asset in inventory.
The reserve is considered immaterial at each balance sheet date for further consideration.
Returns for defective product are typically covered by our supplier’s warranty, thus, returns for defective product are not factored into our reserve.
Our warranty terms generally range from one to three years.
Each quarter, we assess actual warranty costs incurred on a product-by-product basis and compare the warranty costs to our estimated warranty reserve.
See Note 7, Warranties, for further information regarding the impact of warranties concerning ASU 2014-09.
Principal versus agent guidance was considered for customized products that are provided by our suppliers versus manufactured by the Company.
Intangible assets are initially recorded at their fair market values determined by quoted market prices in active markets, if available, or recognized valuation models.
Intangible assets that have finite useful lives are amortized over their useful lives and are tested for impairment when events or changes in circumstances occur that indicate possible impairment.
Change from prior periods reflect impact of foreign currency translation.
As of August 31, 2019, we had no investments.
As of June 1, 2019, we had $8.0 million invested in CDs which mature in less than twelve months.
Our warranty terms generally range from one to three years.
Each quarter, we assess actual warranty costs incurred on a product-by-product basis and compare the warranty costs to our estimated warranty obligation.
Warranty reserves are established for costs that are expected to be incurred after the sale and delivery of products under warranty.
The warranty reserves are determined based on known product failures, historical experience and other available evidence.
Warranty reserves were approximately $0.3 million as of August 31, 2019 and June 1, 2019.
ASU 2016-02 establishes a right-of-use (“ROU”) model that requires a lessee to record an ROU asset and a lease liability on the balance sheet for all leases with terms longer than 12 months.
Leases will be classified as either finance or operating, with classification affecting the pattern of expense recognition in the income statement.
A modified retrospective transition approach is required for lessees for capital and operating leases existing at, or entered into after, the beginning of the earliest comparative period presented in the financial statements, with certain practical expedients available.
The new standard was effective for the Company on June 2, 2019.
As a result of adopting Topic 842, we recognized operating right-of-use assets of $3.6 million, finance right-of-use assets of $0.5 million, operating lease liabilities of $3.8 million and finance lease liabilities of $0.5 million.
Existing deferred rent of $0.2 million was recorded as an offset to our gross operating lease right-of-use assets.
Several leases include renewal clauses which vary in length and may not include specific rent renewal amounts.
The Company will revise the value of the right of use assets and associated lease liabilities when the Company is reasonably certain it will renew the lease.
The Company recorded $0.4 million of lease expense in the first quarter of fiscal 2019.
On June 2, 2019, the Company elected the modified retrospective method of transition to adopt the new lease standard Topic 842, which resulted in no restatement of prior period results.
At June 1, 2019, prior to adoption of the new lease standard, operating lease obligations were not included as a liability on the balance sheet.
Therefore, the operating lease obligations were included in the table for comparative purposes only and the total lease liability was not included as it is not applicable.
We recorded an income tax provision of $0.2 million and $0.3 million for the first three months of fiscal 2020 and the first three months of fiscal 2019, respectively.
The effective income tax rate during the first three months of fiscal 2020 was a tax provision of 53.0% as compared to a tax provision of 38.6% during the first three months of fiscal 2019.
The difference in rate during the first three months of fiscal 2020 as compared to the first three months of fiscal 2019 reflects changes in our geographical distribution of income (loss).
As of June 1, 2019, the deferred tax liability totaled $0.2 million.
As of August 31, 2019, our worldwide liability for uncertain tax positions related to continuing operations was $0.1 million, excluding interest and penalties as compared to $0.1 million liabilities for uncertain tax positions as of June 1, 2019.
There was no change in recorded uncertain tax positions during the first three months of fiscal 2020.
The valuation allowance against the net deferred tax assets was $11.7 million as of August 31, 2019 as no material additional domestic federal and state net deferred tax assets were generated during the first quarter of fiscal 2020 from losses in the U.S. jurisdiction.
The Class B common stock has 10 votes per share and has transferability restrictions; however, Class B common stock may be converted into common stock on a share-for-share basis at any time.
With respect to dividends and distributions, shares of common stock and Class B common stock rank equally and have the same rights, except that Class B common stock cash dividends are limited to 90% of the amount of Class A common stock cash dividends.
In accordance with ASC 260-10, Earnings Per Share (“ASC 260”), our Class B common stock is considered a participating security requiring the use of the two-class method for the computation of basic and diluted earnings per share.
The shares of Class B common stock are considered to be participating convertible securities since the shares of Class B common stock are convertible on a share-for-share basis into shares of common stock and may participate in dividends with common stock according to a predetermined formula which is 90% of the amount of Class A common stock cash dividends.
