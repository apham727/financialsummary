Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.
We issued floating-rate debt which is subject to fluctuations in interest rates. Our secured credit facilities accrue interest at variable rates and only the 2024 Term B is subject to a floor or a minimum rate. A 100 basis point increase in interest rates over our floor(s) on our debt balances outstanding as of June 30, 2019, under the secured credit facilities, would increase our annual interest expense by approximately $3.4 million. The impact on future interest expense as a result of future changes in interest rates will depend largely on the gross amount of our borrowings at that time.
In December 2015 and December 2018, we entered into interest rate swap agreements which convert a portion of our outstanding variable rate debt to fixed.
See Note 5 of the Unaudited Consolidated Condensed Financial Statements for additional information related to the senior secured credit facilities.
