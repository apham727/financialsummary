Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.
We issued floating-rate debt which is subject to fluctuations in interest rates.
Our secured credit facilities accrue interest at variable rates and only the 2024 Term B is subject to a floor or a minimum rate.
A 100 basis point increase in interest rates over our floor(s) on our debt balances outstanding as of September 30, 2019, under the secured credit facilities, would increase our annual interest expense by approximately $3.3 million.
In December 2015 and December 2018, we entered into interest rate swap agreements which convert a portion of our outstanding variable rate debt to fixed.
The interest rate swap exposes us to credit risk in the event that the counterparty to the swap agreement does not or cannot meet its obligations.
The notional amount is used to measure interest to be paid or received and does not represent the amount of exposure to credit loss.
The loss would be limited to the amount that would have been received, if any, over the remaining life of the swap.
The counterparty to the swap is a major US based financial institution and we expect the counterparty to be able to perform its obligations under the swap.
See Note 5 of the Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information related to the senior secured credit facilities.
