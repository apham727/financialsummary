Item 2.
Except as otherwise indicated or unless the context otherwise requires, (a) the terms “EVERTEC,” “we,” “us,” “our,” “our Company” and “the Company” refer to EVERTEC, Inc. and its subsidiaries on a consolidated basis, (b) the term “Holdings” refers to EVERTEC Intermediate Holdings, LLC, but not any of its subsidiaries and (c) the term “EVERTEC Group” refers to EVERTEC Group, LLC and its predecessor entities and their subsidiaries on a consolidated basis, including the operations of its predecessor entities prior to the Merger (as defined below).
EVERTEC is a leading full-service transaction processing business in Latin America and the Caribbean, providing a broad range of merchant acquiring, payment services and business process management services.
According to the August 2018 Nilson Report, we are one of the largest merchant acquirers in Latin America based on total number of transactions and we believe we are the largest merchant acquirer in the Caribbean and Central America.
We serve 26 countries in the region from our base in Puerto Rico.
We manage a system of electronic payment networks that process more than two billion transactions annually, and offer a comprehensive suite of services for core bank processing and cash processing in Puerto Rico and technology outsourcing in all the regions we serve.
In addition, we own and operate the ATH network, one of the leading debit networks in Latin America.
We serve a diversified customer base of leading financial institutions, merchants, corporations and government agencies with “mission-critical” technology solutions that enable them to issue, process and accept transactions securely.
We believe our business is well-positioned to continue to expand across the fast-growing Latin American region.
•Our ability to capture and analyze data across the transaction processing value chain and use that data to provide value-added services that are differentiated from those offered by pure-play vendors that serve only one portion of the transaction processing value chain (such as only merchant acquiring or payment services).
services, which enable financial institutions and other issuers to manage, support and facilitate the processing for credit, debit, prepaid, automated teller machines (“ATM”) and EBT card programs; and (iii) business process management solutions, which provide “mission-critical” technology solutions such as core bank processing, as well as IT outsourcing and cash management services to financial institutions, corporations and governments.
We provide these services through scalable, end-to-end technology platforms that we manage and operate in-house and that generates significant operating efficiencies that enable us to maximize profitability.
Our revenue is predominantly recurring in nature because of the mission-critical and embedded nature of the services we provide.
EVERTEC, Inc. ("EVERTEC", formerly known as Carib Latam Holdings, Inc.) is a Puerto Rico corporation organized in April 2012.
Our main operating subsidiary, EVERTEC Group, LLC (formerly known as EVERTEC, LLC and EVERTEC, Inc., hereinafter “EVERTEC Group”), was organized in Puerto Rico in 1988.
On September 30, 2010, pursuant to an Agreement and Plan of Merger (as amended, the “Merger Agreement”), AP Carib Holdings, Ltd. (“Apollo”), an affiliate of Apollo Global Management LLC, acquired a 51% indirect ownership interest in EVERTEC Group as part of a merger (the “Merger”) and EVERTEC Group became a wholly-owned subsidiary of Holdings.
On April 17, 2012, EVERTEC Group was converted from a Puerto Rico corporation to a Puerto Rico limited liability company (the “Conversion”) for the purpose of improving its consolidated tax efficiency by taking advantage of changes to the Puerto Rico Internal Revenue Code, as amended (the “PR Code”), that permit limited liability companies to be treated as partnerships that are pass-through entities for Puerto Rico tax purposes.
Prior to these conversions, EVERTEC, Inc. was formed in order to act as the new parent company of Holdings and its subsidiaries, including EVERTEC Group.
The transactions described above in this paragraph are collectively referred to as the “Reorganization.”
After the consummation of the Merger, Popular retained an indirect ownership interest in EVERTEC Group and is our largest customer.
Under the terms of the MSA, Popular agreed to continue to use EVERTEC services on an ongoing and exclusive basis, for the duration of the agreement, on commercial terms consistent with those of our historical relationship.
Additionally, Popular granted us a right of first refusal on the development of certain new financial technology products and services for the duration of the MSA.
The ongoing migration from cash and paper methods of payment to electronic payments continues to benefit the transaction-processing industry globally.
For example, currently the adoption of banking products, including electronic payments, in the Latin American and Caribbean regions is lower relative to the mature U.S. and European markets.
We also benefit from the trend for financial institutions and government agencies to outsource technology systems and processes.
Many medium- and small-size institutions in the Latin American markets in which we operate have outdated computer systems and updating these IT legacy systems is financially and logistically challenging, which presents a business opportunity for us.
The Oversight Board has broad budgetary and financial powers over Puerto Rico’s budget, laws, financial plans and regulations, including the power to approve restructuring agreements with creditors, file petitions for restructuring and reform the electronic system for the tax collection.
The Oversight Board will have ultimate authority in preparing the Puerto Rico government’s budget and any issuance of future debt by the government and its instrumentalities.
In addition, PROMESA imposes an automatic stay on all litigation against Puerto Rico and its instrumentalities, as well as any other judicial or administrative actions or proceedings to enforce or collect claims against the Puerto Rico government.
On May 1, 2017, the automatic stay expired.
Promptly after the expiration of the stay, creditors of the Puerto Rico government filed various lawsuits involving defaults on more than $70 billion of bonds issued by Puerto Rico, having failed to reach a negotiated settlement on such defaults with the Puerto Rico government during the period of the automatic stay.
On May 3, 2017, the Oversight Board filed a voluntary petition of relief on behalf of the Commonwealth pursuant to Title III of PROMESA for the restructuring of the Commonwealth’s debt.
Title III is an in-court debt restructuring proceeding similar to protections afforded debtors under Chapter 11 of the United States Code (the “Bankruptcy Code”); the Bankruptcy Code is not available to the Commonwealth or its instrumentalities.
As the solution to the Puerto Rican government’s debt crisis remains unclear, we continue to carefully monitor our receivables with the government as well as monitor general economic trends to understand the impact the crisis has on the economy of Puerto Rico and our card payment volumes.
In addition to the macroeconomic trends described above, Management currently estimates that we will continue to experience a revenue attrition in Latin America of approximately $2 million to $3 million for previously disclosed migrations anticipated in 2019.
The clients' decisions, which were made prior to 2015, for these anticipated migrations were driven by a variety of historical factors, most importantly customer service experience.
Total revenues in the second quarter of 2019 increased by $9.2 million or 8% to $122.5 million when compared with the prior year period.
Revenue increase in the quarter was primarily driven by increased volumes from ATH debit network and benefits from value added solutions coupled with other pricing actions.
Cost of revenues amounted to $52.6 million, an increase of $3.5 million or 7% when compared with the prior year period.
These increases were partially offset by a decrease in salaries and compensation mainly driven by deferred salaries in connection with software developments.
Selling, general and administrative expenses in the second quarter of 2019 decreased by $2.8 million or 16% when compared with the same quarter in 2018.
The decrease is primarily related to lower professional fees as the prior year included fees in connection with due diligence for a potential transaction that the Company decided not to pursue.
Depreciation and amortization expense amounted to $17.2 million, an increase of $1.5 million or 9% when compared with the prior year period.
Non-operating expenses increased by $0.7 million to $8.1 million when compared with the prior year period.
The increase is mainly related to a $1.0 million decrease in Other income, net due to higher foreign exchange losses relative to the same quarter in 2018.
Income tax expense amounted to $2.5 million, a decrease of $0.6 million when compared with the prior year quarterly period.
The effective tax rate for the quarter was 8.4%, compared with 13.4% in the 2018 period.
The decrease in effective tax rate is primarily related to the tax benefit generated in connection with stock based compensation of $1.0 million coupled with a shift in taxable income composition in Puerto Rico.
Total revenues for the six months ended June 30, 2019 amounted to $241.4 million, an increase of $17.8 million or 8%.
Revenue increase in the first half of 2019 reflected growth from elevated sales volumes in Puerto Rico, higher core banking transactions and an increase in fees generated by network services related to new managed services projects.
Additionally, revenue growth was impacted by one-time revenue related to an electronic benefits contract of approximately $2.7 million and revenue from hardware sales and the completion of several projects of approximately $2.5 million.
Cost of revenues amounted to $102.6 million, an increase of $6.1 million or 6% when compared with the prior year period.
Selling, general and administrative expenses in the six months ended June 30, 2019 decreased by $1.1 million or 3% to $30.2 million when compared with the same period in 2018.
Depreciation and amortization expense amounted to $33.5 million, an increase of $1.9 million when compared with the prior year.
The increase is due to the same reasons explained above for the quarter.
Non-operating expenses increased by $1.0 million to $14.9 million when compared with the prior year period.
The increase is almost entirely related to a decrease in Other income, net of $1.6 million due to an increase in foreign exchange losses.
Income tax expense amounted to $6.3 million for the six months ended June 30, 2019, an increase of $0.7 million when compared with the prior year period and an effective tax rate of 10.5% compared with 14.0% in the prior year.
The decrease in the effective tax rate is driven by the impact of the tax benefit generated from stock based compensation of $1.0 million and the shift in taxable income in Puerto Rico.
The Payment Services - Latin America segment revenues consist of revenues related to providing access to the ATH network and other card networks to financial institutions, including related services such as authorization, processing, management and recording of ATM and POS transactions, and ATM management and monitoring.
The segment revenues also include revenues from card processing services (such as credit and debit card processing, authorization and settlement and fraud monitoring and control to debit or credit issuers), payment processing services (such as payment and billing products for merchants, businesses and financial institutions), as well as licensed software solutions for risk and fraud management and card payment processing.
For ATH debit network and processing services, revenues are primarily driven by the number of transactions processed.
Revenues are derived primarily from network fees, transaction switching and processing fees, and the leasing POS devices.
For card issuer processing, revenues are primarily dependent upon the number of cardholder accounts on file, transactions and authorizations processed, the number of cards embossed, and other processing services.
The Merchant Acquiring segment consists of revenues from services that allow merchants to accept electronic methods of payment.
In the Merchant Acquiring segment, revenues include a discount fee and membership fees charged to merchants, debit network fees and rental fees from POS devices and other equipment, net of credit card interchange and assessment fees charged by credit cards associations (such as VISA or MasterCard) or payment networks.
The discount fee is generally a percentage of the transaction value.
EVERTEC also charges merchants for other services that are unrelated to the number of transactions or the transaction value.
The Business Solutions segment consists of revenues from a full suite of business process management solutions in various product areas such as core bank processing, network hosting and management, IT professional services, business process outsourcing, item processing, cash processing, and fulfillment.
Core bank processing and network services revenues are derived in part from a recurrent fee and from fees based on the number of accounts on file (i.e.
Revenues from other processing services within the Business Solutions segment are generally volume-based and depend on factors such as the number of accounts processed.
In addition to the four operating segments described above, Management identified certain functional cost areas that operate independently and do not constitute businesses in themselves.
These units could neither be concluded as operating segments nor could they be combined with any other operating segments.
The CODM reviews the operating segments separate financial information to assess performance and to allocate resources.
Management evaluates the operating results of each of its operating segments based upon revenues and Adjusted EBITDA.
Segment asset disclosure is not used by the CODM as a measure of segment performance since the segment evaluation is driven by revenues and adjusted EBITDA performance.
As such, segment assets are not disclosed in the notes to the accompanying consolidated condensed financial statements.
The following tables set forth information about the Company’s operations by its four business segments for the periods indicated below.
Business Solutions segment revenue increased $6.0 million to $55.2 million.
The increase was mainly related to higher hardware and software sales coupled with revenue from new services provided to Popular and the Government of Puerto Rico.
Merchant acquiring revenues increased $3.4 million to $52.8 million when compared with the prior year period, driven by the same reasons above explained for the quarter coupled with electronic benefit disaster relief recovery funding that ended in March 2019.
Increases in transactional fees contributed to higher net spreads versus the same period in the previous year, while higher non-transactional fees also helped to drive the year-over-year revenue increase.
Business solutions revenue increased by $9.4 million to $106.5 million when compared with the prior year mainly driven by the same reasons as in the June ending quarter.
These revenue increases were coupled with revenue from incremental managed services from the Government of Puerto Rico.
Our principal source of liquidity is cash generated from operations, and our primary liquidity requirements are the funding of capital expenditures, working capital needs and acquisitions.
We also have a $125.0 million Revolving Facility, of which $116.9 million was available as of June 30, 2019.
At June 30, 2019, we had cash and cash equivalents of $64.0 million, of which $50.1 million resides in our subsidiaries located outside of Puerto Rico for purposes of (i) funding the respective subsidiary’s current business operations and (ii) funding potential future investment outside of Puerto Rico.
We intend to indefinitely reinvest these funds outside of Puerto Rico, and based on our liquidity forecast, we will not need to repatriate this cash to fund the Puerto Rico operations or to meet debt-service obligations.
Based on our current level of operations, we believe our cash flows from operations and the available secured Revolving Credit Facility will be adequate to meet our liquidity needs for the next twelve months.
Net cash provided by operating activities for the six months ended June 30, 2019 was $76.0 million compared with cash provided by operating activities of $76.9 million for the corresponding 2018 period.
The $19.8 million increase is attributable to increases in capital expenditures.
The $1.4 million decrease was mainly related to a $12.0 million paydown in the prior year on the Revolving Facility, coupled with a $29.1 million decrease in cash used to paydown long-term debt.
We invested approximately $35.6 million and $15.9 million for the six months ended June 30, 2019 and 2018, respectively.
We expect capital expenditures to be in a range of $50 million to $55 million in 2019.
On February 15, 2019 and April 25, 2019, the Board declared a regular quarterly cash dividend of $0.05 per share on the Company’s outstanding shares of common stock, which was paid on March 22, 2019 and June 7, 2019, respectively, to stockholders of record as of the close of business on February 26, 2019 and May 6, 2019, respectively.
The dividend will be paid on September 6, 2019, to stockholders of record as of the close of business on August 5, 2019.
The additional borrowing capacity for the Revolving Facility at June 30, 2019 was $116.9 million.
The Company issues letters of credit against the Revolving Facility which reduce the additional borrowing capacity of the Revolving Facility.
In May 2016, EVERTEC Group entered into a non-interest bearing financing agreement amounting to $0.7 million to purchase software.
As of June 30, 2019 and December 31, 2018, the outstanding principal balance of the note payable was $0.2 million and $0.3 million, respectively.
The current portion of this note is recorded as part of accounts payable and the long-term portion is included in other long-term liabilities.
In January 2019, EVERTEC Group entered into a non-interest bearing financing agreement amounting to $10.0 million to purchase data processing equipment and maintenance.
As of June 30, 2019, the outstanding principal balance of the note payable was $5.0 million, recorded as part of accounts payable.
During the six months ended June 30, 2019, the Company reclassified gains of $0.5 million from accumulated other comprehensive loss into income through interest expense.
Refer to Note 6 for tabular disclosure of the fair value of derivatives and to Note 7 for tabular disclosure of losses recorded on cash flow hedging activities.
The cash flow hedge is considered highly effective.
As of June 30, 2019, the secured leverage ratio was 2.17 to 1.00.
As of the date of filing of this Form 10-Q, no event has occurred that constitutes an Event of Default or Default.
We define “EBITDA” as earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization.
We define “Adjusted EBITDA” as EBITDA further adjusted to exclude unusual items and other adjustments described below.
Adjusted EBITDA by segment is reported to the chief operating decision maker for purposes of making decisions about allocating resources to the segments and assessing their performance.
For this reason Adjusted EBITDA, as it relates to our segments, is presented in conformity with Accounting Standards Codification 280, Segment Reporting, and is excluded from the definition of non-GAAP financial measures under the Securities and Exchange Commission's Regulation G and Item 10(e) of Regulation S-K. We define “Adjusted Net Income” as net income adjusted to exclude unusual items and other adjustments described below.
We define “Adjusted Earnings per common share” as Adjusted Net Income divided by diluted shares outstanding.
In addition, our presentation of Adjusted EBITDA is substantially consistent with the equivalent measurements that are contained in the senior secured credit facilities in testing EVERTEC Group’s compliance with covenants therein such as the senior secured leverage ratio.
In addition, in evaluating EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted Earnings per common share, you should be aware that in the future we may incur expenses such as those excluded in calculating them.
•other companies, including other companies in our industry, may not use EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted Net Income, and Adjusted Earnings per common share or may calculate EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted Earnings per common share differently than as presented in this Report, limiting their usefulness as a comparative measure.
EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted Earnings per common share are not measurements of liquidity or financial performance under GAAP.
You should not consider EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted Earnings per common share as alternatives to cash flows from operating activities or any other performance measures determined in accordance with GAAP, as an indicator of cash flows, as a measure of liquidity or as an alternative to operating or net income determined in accordance with GAAP.
