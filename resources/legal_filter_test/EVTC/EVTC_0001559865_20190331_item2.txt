We manage a system of electronic payment networks that process more than two billion transactions annually, and offer a comprehensive suite of services for core bank processing, cash processing and technology outsourcing.
In addition, we own and operate the ATH network, one of the leading debit networks in Latin America.

EVERTEC, Inc. ("EVERTEC", formerly known as Carib Latam Holdings, Inc.) is a Puerto Rico corporation organized in April 2012.
Our main operating subsidiary, EVERTEC Group, LLC (formerly known as EVERTEC, LLC and EVERTEC, Inc., hereinafter “EVERTEC Group”), was organized in Puerto Rico in 1988.
On September 30, 2010, pursuant to an Agreement and Plan of Merger (as amended, the “Merger Agreement”), AP Carib Holdings, Ltd. (“Apollo”), an affiliate of Apollo Global Management LLC, acquired a 51% indirect ownership interest in EVERTEC Group as part of a merger (the “Merger”) and EVERTEC Group became a wholly-owned subsidiary of Holdings.
On April 17, 2012, EVERTEC Group was converted from a Puerto Rico corporation to a Puerto Rico limited liability company (the “Conversion”) for the purpose of improving its consolidated tax efficiency by taking advantage of changes to the Puerto Rico Internal Revenue Code, as amended (the “PR Code”), that permit limited liability companies to be treated as partnerships that are pass-through entities for Puerto Rico tax purposes.
Prior to these conversions, EVERTEC, Inc. was formed in order to act as the new parent company of Holdings and its subsidiaries, including EVERTEC Group.
The transactions described above in this paragraph are collectively referred to as the “Reorganization.”
After the consummation of the Merger, Popular retained an indirect ownership interest in EVERTEC Group and is our largest customer.
Under the terms of the MSA, Popular agreed to continue to use EVERTEC services on an ongoing and exclusive basis, for the duration of the agreement, on commercial terms consistent with those of our historical relationship.
Additionally, Popular granted us a right of first refusal on the development of certain new financial technology products and services for the duration of the MSA.
The ongoing migration from cash and paper methods of payment to electronic payments continues to benefit the transaction-processing industry globally.
For example, currently the adoption of banking products, including electronic payments, in the Latin American and Caribbean regions is lower relative to the mature U.S. and European markets.
We also benefit from the trend for financial institutions and government agencies to outsource technology systems and processes.
Many medium- and small-size institutions in the Latin American markets in which we operate have outdated computer systems and updating these IT legacy systems is financially and logistically challenging, which presents a business opportunity for us.
The Oversight Board has broad budgetary and financial powers over Puerto Rico’s budget, laws, financial plans and regulations, including the power to approve restructuring agreements with creditors, file petitions for restructuring and reform the electronic system for the tax collection.
The Oversight Board will have ultimate authority in preparing the Puerto Rico government’s budget and any issuance of future debt by the government and its instrumentalities.
In addition, PROMESA imposes an automatic stay on all litigation against Puerto Rico and its instrumentalities, as well as any other judicial or administrative actions or proceedings to enforce or collect claims against the Puerto Rico government.
On May 1, 2017, the automatic stay expired.
Promptly after the expiration of the stay, creditors of the Puerto Rico government filed various lawsuits involving defaults on more than $70 billion of bonds issued by Puerto Rico, having failed to reach a negotiated settlement on such defaults with the Puerto Rico government during the period of the automatic stay.
On May 3, 2017, the Oversight Board filed a voluntary petition of relief on behalf of the Commonwealth pursuant to Title III of PROMESA for the restructuring of the Commonwealth’s debt.
Title III is an in-court debt restructuring proceeding similar to protections afforded debtors under Chapter 11 of the United States Code (the “Bankruptcy Code”); the Bankruptcy Code is not available to the Commonwealth or its instrumentalities.
As the solution to the Puerto Rican government’s debt crisis remains unclear, we continue to carefully monitor our receivables with the government as well as monitor general economic trends to understand the impact the crisis has on the economy of Puerto Rico and our card payment volumes.
In addition to the macroeconomic trends described above, Management currently estimates that we will continue to experience a revenue attrition in Latin America of approximately $3 million to $4 million for previously disclosed migrations anticipated in 2019.
The clients' decisions, which were made prior to 2015, for these anticipated migrations were driven by a variety of historical factors, most importantly customer service experience.
Total revenues in the first quarter of 2019 increased by $8.6 million or 8% to $118.8 million.
Additionally, revenue growth was a result of an increase in network services related to new managed services projects, as well as, a one-time revenue related to an electronic benefits contract of approximately $2.7 million.
Cost of revenues amounted to $50.0 million, an increase of $2.6 million or 5% when compared with the prior year period.
Selling, general and administrative expenses in the first quarter of 2019 increased by $1.7 million or 13% when compared with the same quarter in 2018.
Depreciation and amortization expense amounted to $16.3 million, an increase of $0.4 million or 3%.
The increase is mainly related to higher capital expenditures in prior year as well as impact from development projects going into production.
Non-operating expenses increased by $0.4 million to $6.9 million when compared with the prior year period.
The increase is mainly related to a $0.6 million decrease in Other income, net due to a decrease in foreign exchange gains relative to the same quarter in 2018.
Income tax expense amounted to $3.8 million, relatively flat when compared with the prior year period.
The effective tax rate for the quarter was 12.5%, compared with 14.5% in the 2018 period.

In the Merchant Acquiring segment, revenues include a discount fee and membership fees charged to merchants, debit network fees and rental fees from POS devices and other equipment, net of credit card interchange and assessment fees charged by credit cards associations (such as VISA or MasterCard) or payment networks.
The discount fee is generally a percentage of the transaction value.
EVERTEC also charges merchants for other services that are unrelated to the number of transactions or the transaction value.
The Business Solutions segment consists of revenues from a full suite of business process management solutions in various product areas such as core bank processing, network hosting and management, IT professional services, business process outsourcing, item processing, cash processing, and fulfillment.
Core bank processing and network services revenues are derived in part from a recurrent fee and from fees based on the number of accounts on file (i.e.
Revenues from other processing services within the Business Solutions segment are generally volume-based and depend on factors such as the number of accounts processed.
The CODM reviews the operating segments separate financial information to assess performance and to allocate resources.
Management evaluates the operating results of each of its operating segments based upon revenues and Adjusted EBITDA.
Segment asset disclosure is not used by the CODM as a measure of segment performance since the segment evaluation is driven by revenues and adjusted EBITDA performance.
As such, segment assets are not disclosed in the notes to the accompanying consolidated financial statements.
The following tables set forth information about the Company’s operations by its four business segments for the periods indicated below.
Merchant Acquiring segment revenue increased $2.6 million to $26.0 million due to increased sales volumes compared to results in prior year, which was negatively impacted by the 2017 hurricanes, and by electronic benefit disaster recovery funding that started in March 2018 and ended in March 2019.
Increases in transactional fees contributed to higher net spreads versus the same period in the previous year, while higher non-transactional fees also helped to drive the year-over-year revenue increase.
Business Solutions segment revenue increased $3.4 million or 7% mainly driven by new services provided to Popular and incremental managed services revenues from the Government of Puerto Rico.
Adjusted EBITDA decreased $0.1 million to
Our principal source of liquidity is cash generated from operations, and our primary liquidity requirements are the funding of capital expenditures, working capital needs and acquisitions.
We also have a $125.0 million Revolving Facility, of which $82.9 million was available as of March 31, 2019.
At March 31, 2019, we had cash and cash equivalents of $73.2 million, of which $48.4 million resides in our subsidiaries located outside of Puerto Rico for purposes of (i) funding the respective subsidiary’s current business operations and (ii) funding potential future investment outside of Puerto Rico.
We intend to indefinitely reinvest these funds outside of Puerto Rico, and based on our liquidity forecast, we will not need to repatriate this cash to fund the Puerto Rico operations or to meet debt-service obligations.
Based on our current level of operations, we believe our cash flows from operations and the available secured Revolving Credit Facility will be adequate to meet our liquidity needs for the next twelve months.
Net cash provided by operating activities for the three months ended March 31, 2019 was $29.3 million compared with cash provided by operating activities of $30.4 million for the corresponding 2018 period.
The $1.0 million decrease in cash provided by operating activities is primarily driven by more cash used to pay down accounts payable, accrued liabilities, and income taxes, partially offset by more collections of accounts receivable.
Net cash used in investing activities for the three months ended March 31, 2019 was $14.0 million compared with $9.4 million for the corresponding period in 2018.
The $4.6 million increase is attributable to increases in capital expenditures.
Net cash used in financing activities for the three months ended March 31, 2019 was $15.6 million compared with $17.4 million for the corresponding 2018 period.
The $1.7 million decrease was mainly related to a $15.0 million draw on our Revolving Facility, compared with a $12.0 million paydown in the prior year, coupled with a $1.5 million decrease is cash used to paydown long-term debt.
We invested approximately $14.0 million and $9.4 million for the three months ended March 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively.
We expect capital expenditures to be in a range of $40 million to $45 million in 2019.
The dividend will be paid on June 7, 2019 to stockholders of record as of the close of business on May 6, 2019.
The additional borrowing capacity for the Revolving Facility at March 31, 2019 was $82.9 million.
The Company issues letters of credit against the Revolving Facility which reduce the additional borrowing capacity of the Revolving Facility.

The current portion of these notes is recorded as part of accounts payable and the long-term portion is included in other long-term liabilities.
In January 2019, EVERTEC Group entered into a non-interest bearing financing agreement amounting to $10.0 million to purchase data processing equipment and maintenance.
As of March 31, 2019, the outstanding principal balance of the note payable was $6.4 million, recorded as part of accounts payable.
During the three months ended March 31, 2019, the Company reclassified gains of $0.3 million from accumulated other comprehensive loss into income through interest expense.

We define “EBITDA” as earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization.
We define “Adjusted EBITDA” as EBITDA further adjusted to exclude unusual items and other adjustments described below.
Adjusted EBITDA by segment is reported to the chief operating decision maker for purposes of making decisions about allocating resources to the segments and assessing their performance.
For this reason Adjusted EBITDA, as it relates to our segments, is presented in conformity with Accounting Standards Codification 280, Segment Reporting, and is excluded from the definition of non-GAAP financial measures under the Securities and Exchange Commission's Regulation G and Item 10(e) of Regulation S-K. We define “Adjusted Net Income” as net income adjusted to exclude unusual items and other adjustments described below.

In addition, our presentation of Adjusted EBITDA is substantially consistent with the equivalent measurements that are contained in the senior secured credit facilities in testing EVERTEC Group’s compliance with covenants therein such as the senior secured leverage ratio.
In addition, in evaluating EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted Earnings per common share, you should be aware that in the future we may incur expenses such as those excluded in calculating them.
•other companies, including other companies in our industry, may not use EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted Net Income, and Adjusted Earnings per common share or may calculate EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted Earnings per common share differently than as presented in this Report, limiting their usefulness as a comparative measure.
EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted Earnings per common share are not measurements of liquidity or financial performance under GAAP.
You should not consider EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted Earnings per common share as alternatives to cash flows from operating activities or any other performance measures determined in accordance with GAAP, as an indicator of cash flows, as a measure of liquidity or as an alternative to operating or net income determined in accordance with GAAP.
