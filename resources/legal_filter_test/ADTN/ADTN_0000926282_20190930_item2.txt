The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the related notes that appear in Part I, Item 1 of this document.
See also Item 1A, Risk Factors, of the 2018 Form 10‑K.
See Note 14 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part I, Item 1 of this report for further information regarding the Company’s segments and revenue categories.
Many of our customers require prompt delivery of products.
This requires us to maintain sufficient inventory levels to satisfy anticipated customer demand.
Our third quarter 2019 revenue was negatively impacted by a pause in shipments to a Tier 1 customer in Latin America (“LATAM”) and the continued slowdown in spending at another international Tier 1 customer.
For the fourth quarter of 2019, our current expectations include a continued impact from a decline in sales related to these two customers.
For the international Tier 1 customer, we believe that normal spending should resume in 2020.
During the three months ended June 30, 2019, the Company changed the manner in which it estimates its excess and obsolete inventory reserves.
Under the new policy, we establish reserves for estimated excess and obsolete inventory equal to the difference between the cost of the inventory and the estimated net realizable value of the inventory based on historical usage, known trends, inventory age, and market conditions.
When we dispose of excess and obsolete inventories, the related disposals are charged against the inventory reserves.
See Note 8 of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part I, Item 1 of this report for additional information.
The following table presents selected financial information derived from our Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income expressed as a percentage of sales for the periods indicated.
Amounts may not foot due to rounding.
As a percentage of sales, cost of sales increased from 58.4% for the three months ended September 30, 2018 to 59.4% for the three months ended September 30, 2019 and decreased from 61.9% for the nine months ended September 30, 2018 to 58.5% for the nine months ended September 30, 2019.
Network Solutions segment cost of sales, as a percentage of that segment’s sales, increased from 57.8% for the three months ended September 30, 2018 to 60.0% for the three months ended September 30, 2019 and decreased from 61.0% for the nine months ended September 30, 2018 to 57.8% for the nine months ended September 30, 2019.
The decrease in cost of sales as a percentage of sales for the nine months ended September 30, 2019 was primarily attributable to an increase in volume, a regional revenue shift, changes in customer and product mix and a decrease in labor expense due to a restructuring program initiated in the first quarter of 2018.
Selling, general and administrative expenses increased 0.5% from $30.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2018 to $30.9 million for the three months ended September 30, 2019, and increased 3.4% from $96.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2018 to $99.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2019.
As a percentage of sales, selling, general and administrative expenses increased from 21.9% for the three months ended September 30, 2018 to 27.1% for the three months ended September 30, 2019, and decreased from 24.8% for the nine months ended September 30, 2018 to 24.1% for the nine months ended September 30, 2019.

As a percentage of sales, research and development expenses increased from 21.3% for the three months ended September 30, 2018 to 27.9% for the three months ended September 30, 2019, and decreased from 24.0% for the nine months ended September 30, 2018 to 23.1% for the nine months ended September 30, 2019.
We may incur significant research and development expenses prior to the receipt of revenue from a major new product group.
Asset impairment, which were $3.9 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2019, relate to the abandonment of certain information technology implementation projects which we had previously capitalized costs related to these projects.
There were no impairment charges recognized during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2018.
Gain on contingency, which was $1.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2019, relates to the reversal of contingent liabilities which were initially recognized upon the acquisition of SmartRG in the fourth quarter of 2018.
See Note 2 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part I, Item 1 of this report for additional information.
There was no gain on contingency recognized during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2018.
The changes in interest and dividend income for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2019 were primarily attributable to fluctuations in investment balances.
Interest expense, which is primarily related to our taxable revenue bond, remained constant at $0.1 million in the three months ended September 30, 2018 and 2019 and $0.4 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2018 and 2019, as we had no substantial change in our fixed-rate borrowing.
See “Liquidity and Capital Resources” below for additional information on our revenue bond.
The fluctuation in our net investment gain was primarily attributable to changes in fair value of equity securities recognized during the period.
See Note 7 of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements, included in Part I, Item 1 of this report, and “Investing Activities” in “Liquidity and Capital Resources” below for additional information.
Other income (expense), net increased from income of $0.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2018 to income of $1.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2019 and increased from expense of $0.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2018 to income of $2.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2019.
The fluctuations in other income (expense), net for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2019 was primarily attributable to gains on foreign currency transactions.
Gain on bargain purchase of a business, net, which was $11.3 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2018, was related to our acquisition of Sumitomo Electric Lightwave Corp.’s North American EPON business and entry into a technology license and supply agreement with Sumitomo Electric Industries, Ltd. in March 2018.

The increase in the effective tax rate between the two periods was primarily driven by the establishment of a valuation allowance against our domestic deferred tax assets in the amount of $37.1 million during the three months ending September 30, 2019, offset by a 9.38% rate reduction related to a transfer pricing study completed during the second quarter of 2019 that resulted in the assignment of operating expenditures to specific company locations, and the effective income tax rates among the respective jurisdictions.
See Note 4 of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part I, Item 1 of this report for additional information.

At September 30, 2019, cash on hand was $96.4 million and short-term investments were $28.8 million, which resulted in available short-term liquidity of $125.2 million, of which $62.5 million was held by our foreign subsidiaries.

The decrease in our working capital and our current ratio was primarily attributable to the reclassification of our bond payable to current liabilities as it matures in January 2020, as well as the reclassification of the related restricted certificate of deposit from a long-term investment to a short-term investment.
The decrease in the quick ratio was primarily attributable to the reclassification of our bond payable to current liabilities as it matures in January 2020, partially offset by an increase in short-term investments, primarily related to the reclassification of our restricted certificate of deposit from a long-term investment to a short-term investment.
