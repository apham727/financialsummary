We maintain depository investments with certain financial institutions.
Although these depository investments may exceed government insured depository limits, we have evaluated the credit-worthiness of these financial institutions, and determined the risk of material financial loss due to exposure of such credit risk to be minimal.
As of March 31, 2019, $106.2 million of our cash and cash equivalents, primarily certain domestic money market funds and foreign depository accounts, were in excess of government provided insured depository limits.
As of March 31, 2019, approximately $37.1 million of our cash and investments may be directly affected by changes in interest rates.
At March 31, 2019, we held $10.1 million of cash and variable-rate investments where a change in interest rates would impact our interest income.
In addition, we held $26.9 million of fixed-rate bonds whose fair values may be directly affected by a change in interest rates.
A hypothetical 50 bps increase in interest rates as of March 31, 2019 would reduce the fair value of our fixed-rate bonds by approximately $0.1 million.
We may establish cash flow hedges utilizing foreign exchange forward contracts to reduce the risk that movements in exchange rates will adversely affect the net cash flows resulting from the planned purchase of products from foreign suppliers.
We have certain customers and suppliers who are invoiced or pay in a non-functional currency.
When appropriate, we utilize foreign exchange forward contracts to help manage the volatility relating to these valuation exposures.
All non-functional currencies billed would result in a combined hypothetical gain or loss of $1.1 million if the U.S. dollar weakened or strengthened 10% against the billing currencies.
The fluctuation compared to prior periods is due to an increase in U.S. dollar-denominated billings in a non-U.S. dollar denominated subsidiary as well as an increase in international sales.
Although we do not currently hold any derivative instruments, any gain or loss would be partially mitigated by these derivative instruments.
As of March 31, 2019, we have certain material contracts, including accounts receivable, accounts payable and lease liabilities, denominated in foreign currencies.
For further information about the fair value of our investments and our derivative and hedging activities as of March 31, 2019, see Notes 7 and 8 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 1 of this report.
