We maintain depository investments with certain financial institutions. Although these depository investments may exceed government insured depository limits, we have evaluated the credit worthiness of these financial institutions, and determined the risk of material financial loss due to exposure of such credit risk to be minimal. As of March 31, 2018, $80.4 million of our cash and cash equivalents, primarily certain domestic money market funds, commercial paper and foreign depository accounts, were in excess of government provided insured depository limits. 
As of March 31, 2018, approximately $110.3 million of our cash and investments may be directly affected by changes in interest rates. We have performed a hypothetical sensitivity analysis assuming market interest rates increase or decrease by 50 basis points (bps) for an entire year, while all other variables remain constant. At March 31, 2018, we held $51.0 million of cash and variable-rate investments where a change in interest rates would impact our interest income. A hypothetical 50 bps decline in interest rates as of March 31, 2018 would reduce annualized interest income on our cash and investments by approximately $0.3 million. In addition, we held $59.2 million of fixed-rate bonds whose fair values may be directly affected by a change in interest rates. A hypothetical 50 bps increase in interest rates as of March 31, 2018 would reduce the fair value of our fixed-rate bonds by approximately $0.4 million. 
As of March 31, 2017, approximately $169.3 million of our cash and investments was subject to being directly affected by changes in interest rates. We have performed a hypothetical sensitivity analysis assuming market interest rates increase or decrease by 50 bps for the entire year, while all other variables remain constant. A hypothetical 50 bps decline in interest rates as of March 31, 2017 would have reduced annualized interest income on our cash, money market instruments and variable rate demand notes by approximately $0.4 million. In addition, a hypothetical 50 bps increase in interest rates as of March 31, 2017 would have reduced the fair value of our fixed-rate bonds by approximately $0.5 million. 
For further information about the fair value of our investments and our derivative and hedging activities as of March 31, 2018, see Notes 7 and 8 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
