We recognized a positive revenue impact in the first half of 2017 due to our being awarded a network expansion program by a large European Tier-1 customer. During the first and second quarters of 2018, this European Tier 1 customer undertook an additional network expansion project. We anticipate that as our Latin American customers resume their network upgrade projects, we may experience further enhancement to our revenues. We have recently announced receipt of a new nation-wide award in the APAC region, as well as additional awards based on new ADTRAN technologies in the EMEA region that we believe will likely result in a positive impact to our revenues. However, a resolution of the regulatory changes affecting a major customer in Mexico has been slower than anticipated, and business with one of our customers in that region has not yet returned to normal levels. We are continuing to pursue opportunities with new customers in this region. 
As a percentage of sales, cost of sales increased from 54.2% in the three months ended June 30, 2017 to 61.0% in the three months ended June 30, 2018, and increased from 55.4% in the six months ended June 30, 2017 to 63.9% in the six months ended June 30, 2018. The increase in cost of sales as a percentage of sales for the three months ended June 30, 2018 is primarily attributable to a regional revenue shift, customer and product mix, services and support mix and an increase in warranty expense. The increase in cost of sales as a percentage of sales for the six months ended June 30, 2018 is primarily attributable to a regional revenue shift, customer and product mix, services and support mix, an increase in labor expense due to a restructuring program and an increase in warranty expense. 
Network Solutions cost of sales, as a percent of that segment’s sales, increased from 51.2% in the three months ended June 30, 2017 to 60.5% in the three months ended June 30, 2018, and increased from 52.3% in the six months ended June 30, 2017 to 62.7% in the six months ended June 30, 2018. The increase in cost of sales as a percentage of sales for the three months ended June 30, 2018 is primarily attributable to a regional revenue shift, customer and product mix and an increase in warranty expense. The increase in cost of sales as a percentage of sales for the six months ended June 30, 2018 is primarily attributable to a regional revenue shift, customer and product mix, an increase in labor expense due to a restructuring program, an increase in warranty expense due to a settlement in first quarter of 2017 with a third party supplier for a defective component and purchase discounts received from a contract manufacturer in the first quarter of 2017. 
Selling, general and administrative expenses decreased 7.6% from $34.7 million in the three months ended June 30, 2017 to $32.1 million in the three months ended June 30, 2018, and decreased 5.6% from $69.5 million in the six months ended June 30, 2017 to $65.6 million in the six months ended June 30, 2018. The decrease in selling, general and administrative expenses for the three months ended June 30, 2018 is primarily attributable to decreases in performance-based compensation expense, travel expense, deferred compensation expense, and independent contractor expense, partially offset by an increase in labor expense due to a restructuring program. The decrease in selling, general and administrative expenses for the six months ended June 30, 2018 is primarily attributable to a decrease in deferred compensation expense, performance-based compensation expense, travel expense, and independent contractor expense, partially offset by an increase in labor expense due to a restructuring program. 
As a percentage of sales, selling, general and administrative expenses increased from 18.8% in the three months ended June 30, 2017 to 25.1% in the three months ended June 30, 2018, and increased from 19.6% in the six months ended June 30, 2017 to 26.4% in the six months ended June 30, 2018. Selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales may fluctuate whenever there is a significant fluctuation in revenues for the periods being compared. 
Research and development expenses decreased 8.4% from $33.6 million in the three months ended June 30, 2017 to $30.7 million in the three months ended June 30, 2018, and decreased 3.0% from $65.5 million in the six months ended June 30, 2017 to $63.6 million in the six months ended June 30, 2018. The decrease in research and development expenses for the three months ended June 30, 2018 is primarily attributable to decreases in engineering materials, independent contractor expense, amortization of intangibles acquired in the third quarter of 2016 that were fully amortized in 2017, and performance-based compensation expense. The decrease in research and development expenses for the six months ended June 30, 2018 is primarily attributable to decreases in engineering materials and amortization of intangibles acquired in the third quarter of 2016 that were fully amortized in 2017, partially offset by an increase in labor expense due to a restructuring program. 
Interest and dividend income decreased 6.1% from $1.0 million in the three months ended June 30, 2017 to $0.9 million in the three months ended June 30, 2018, and decreased 6.6% from $1.9 million in the six months ended June 30, 2017 to $1.8 million in the six months ended June 30, 2018. The decrease in interest and dividend income for the three and six months ended June 30, 2018 is primarily attributable to a decrease in investment balances and a decrease in the rate of return on those investments. 
Interest expense, which is primarily related to our taxable revenue bond, remained constant at $0.1 million in the three months ended June 30, 2017 and 2018, and $0.3 million in the six months ended June 30, 2017 and 2018, as we had no substantial change in our fixed-rate borrowing. See “Liquidity and Capital Resources” below for additional information on our revenue bond. 
Net realized investment gains decreased 28.8% from $1.4 million in the three months ended June 30, 2017 to $1.0 million in the three months ended June 30, 2018, and decreased 52.0% from $1.9 million in the six months ended June 30, 2017 to $0.9 million in the six months ended June 30, 2018. The decrease in net realized investment gains for the three and six months ended June 30, 2018 is primarily attributable to changes in fair value on equity securities recognized during the period under ASC 2016-01. Prior to January 1, 2018, changes in fair value were recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income, net of deferred taxes, on the balance sheet. See Note 1, Note 7 and “Investing Activities” in “Liquidity and Capital Resources” below for additional information. 
Other expense, net, comprised primarily of miscellaneous income, gains and losses on foreign currency transactions, gains and losses on foreign exchange forward contracts, investment account management fees, and scrap raw material sales, decreased 69.8% from $0.7 million of expense in the three months ended June 30, 2017 to $0.2 million of expense in the three months ended June 30, 2018, and decreased 53.2% from $0.6 million of expense in the six months ended June 30, 2017 to $0.3 million of expense in the six months ended June 30, 2018. The change in other expense, net for the three and six months ended June 30, 2018 is primarily attributable to higher losses on foreign exchange contracts in 2017. 
Gain on bargain purchase of a business is related to our acquisition of Sumitomo Electric Lightwave Corp.’s North American EPON business and entry into a technology license and supply agreement with Sumitomo Electric Industries, Ltd. on March 19, 2018. See Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. 
Our effective tax rate decreased from an expense of 27.3% in the six months ended June 30, 2017 to a benefit of 20.1%, excluding the tax effect of the bargain purchase gain, in the six months ended June 30, 2018. The decrease in the effective tax rate between the two periods is primarily attributable to the change in income and the effect of the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, which was signed into law on December 22, 2017. 
As a result of the above factors, net income (loss) decreased $20.1 million from $12.4 million in the three months ended June 30, 2017 to $(7.7) million in the three months ended June 30, 2018, and decreased $37.5 million from $19.1 million in the six months ended June 30, 2017 to $(18.5) million in the six months ended June 30, 2018.  
We intend to finance our operations with cash flow from operations. We have used, and expect to continue to use, the cash generated from operations for working capital, purchases of treasury stock, shareholder dividends, and other general corporate purposes, including (i) product development activities to enhance our existing products and develop new products and (ii) expansion of sales and marketing activities. We believe our cash and cash equivalents, investments and cash generated from operations to be adequate to meet our operating and capital needs for at least the next 12 months. 
At June 30, 2018, cash on hand was $100.3 million and short-term investments were $6.1 million, which resulted in available short-term liquidity of $106.4 million, of which $83.0 million was held by our foreign subsidiaries. At December 31, 2017, cash on hand was $86.4 million and short-term investments were $16.1 million, which resulted in available short-term liquidity of $102.6 million, of which $56.8 million was held by our foreign subsidiaries. We intend to permanently reinvest the funds held by our foreign subsidiaries outside the U.S. and our current business plans do not indicate a need to repatriate these funds to finance domestic operations. The increase in short-term liquidity from December 31, 2017 to June 30, 2018 is primarily attributable to shifts among available investment option tenures to provide funds for our short-term cash needs. 
Accounts receivable decreased 47.2% from $144.2 million at December 31, 2017 to $76.1 million at June 30, 2018. We had no allowance for doubtful accounts at December 31, 2017 or June 30, 2018. Quarterly accounts receivable days sales outstanding (DSO) decreased from 105 days as of December 31, 2017 to 54 days as of June 30, 2018. The decrease in net accounts receivable is due to the collection of customer-specific payment terms that became due in the first quarter of 2018 and the timing of sales and collections during the quarter. Additionally, certain international customers may have longer payment terms than U.S. customers.  
Prepaid expense and other current assets decreased 45.2% from $17.3 million at December 31, 2017 to $9.5 million at June 30, 2018. The decrease in prepaid expenses and other current assets is primarily attributable to the recognition of deferred costs related to network installation services that were completed during the first quarter.  
Capital expenditures totaled approximately $4.2 million and $7.5 million for the six months ended June 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively. These expenditures were primarily used to purchase computer hardware, software, manufacturing and test equipment, and building improvements. 
Our long-term investments increased 10.9% from $130.3 million at December 31, 2017 to $144.4 million at June 30, 2018. Long-term investments at June 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017 included an investment in a certificate of deposit of $26.7 million and $27.8 million, respectively, which serves as collateral for our revenue bond. See “Debt” below for additional information. We have various equity investments included in long-term investments with a fair value of $37.6 million and $35.7 million, at June 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017, respectively. 
Long-term investments at June 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017 also included $20.4 million and $19.9 million, respectively, related to our deferred compensation plans, and $0.5 million of other investments carried at cost, consisting of interests in two private equity funds and an investment in a privately held telecommunications equipment manufacturer. 
In July 2003, our Board of Directors elected to begin declaring quarterly dividends on our common stock considering the tax treatment of dividends and adequate levels of Company liquidity. During the six months ended June 30, 2018, we paid dividends totaling $8.7 million. 
Since 1997, our Board of Directors has approved multiple share repurchase programs that have authorized open market repurchase transactions of up to 50.0 million shares of our common stock that are implemented through open market or private purchases from time to time as conditions warrant. During the six months ended June 30, 2018, we repurchased 0.8 million shares of our common stock at an average price of $15.72 per share. As of June 30, 2018, we have the authority to purchase an additional 2.7 million shares of our common stock under the current plans approved by the Board of Directors. 
We issued 24 thousand shares of treasury stock during the six months ended June 30, 2018 to accommodate employee stock option exercises. The stock options had exercise prices ranging from $15.29 to $18.97. We received proceeds totaling $0.4 million from the exercise of these stock options during the six months ended June 30, 2018. 
We have committed to invest up to an aggregate of $7.9 million in two private equity funds, and we have contributed $8.4 million as of June 30, 2018, of which $7.7 million has been applied to these commitments.  
On July 14, 2015, our Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of an additional 5.0 million shares of our common stock (bringing the total shares authorized for repurchase to 50.0 million). This authorization will be implemented through open market or private purchases from time to time as conditions warrant.
