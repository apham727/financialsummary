Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures.
Even disclosure controls and procedures determined to be effective can only provide reasonable assurance that their objectives are achieved.
As of the end of the period covered by this report, an evaluation was carried out by management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(e)) pursuant to Rule 13a-15 of the Exchange Act.
Management determined that controls were not effectively designed, documented, and maintained to verify that the existence of all inventories subject to our cycle count program were included and counted at the frequency required under the Companyâ€™s internal policies, and that the key reports and related data used to monitor the results of this program were not validated to ensure completeness and accuracy.
Management determined that controls were not effectively designed and maintained over the determination of the estimated reserve for excess and obsolete inventory, including the review of significant inputs and assumptions used to determine our excess and obsolete inventory reserve, and to ensure the completeness and accuracy of key reports and related data used in the calculation of this reserve.
Specifically, the Company has begun redesigning and enhancing additional controls and procedures to ensure the completeness of our cycle count program and the completeness and accuracy of key reports and related data used to monitor the results of this cycle count program.
Additionally, the Company has begun redesigning and implementing enhanced controls and procedures related to the review of significant inputs and assumptions used to determine our excess and obsolete inventory reserve, and to ensure the completeness and accuracy of key reports and related data used in the calculation of the excess and obsolete inventory reserve.
The Company has begun to implement enhancements to these processes and controls to comply with internal policies in order to ensure completeness and accuracy of inventories.
For example, the Company has revised the methodology used in estimating its excess and obsolete inventory reserve, as further discussed in Note 1 of the Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part I, Item 1 of this report.
We believe that the foregoing actions will support the improvement of our internal control over financial reporting, and, through our efforts to identify, design, and implement the necessary control activities, will be effective in remediating the material weaknesses described above.
We will continue to devote significant time and attention to these remediation efforts.
Until the remediation steps set forth above, including the efforts to implement the necessary control activities that we identify, are fully completed, the material weaknesses described above will continue to exist.
