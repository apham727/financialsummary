Based upon that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of June 30, 2019 due to the material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting described in the 2018 Form 10-K and below.
Management determined that controls were not effectively designed, documented, and maintained to verify that the existence of all inventories subject to our cycle count program were included and counted at the frequency required under the Company’s internal policies, and that the key reports and related data used to monitor the results of this program were not validated to ensure completeness and accuracy.
Management determined that controls were not effectively designed and maintained over the determination of the estimated reserve for excess and obsolete inventory, including the review of significant inputs and assumptions used to determine our excess and obsolete inventory reserve, and to ensure the completeness and accuracy of key reports and related data used in the calculation of this reserve.
These material weaknesses did not result in any material misstatement to the Company’s financial statements or disclosures but did result in an out-of-period adjustment with the effect of increasing cost of goods sold during the three months ended June 30, 2019 and decreasing cost of goods sold for the six months ended June 30, 2019.
