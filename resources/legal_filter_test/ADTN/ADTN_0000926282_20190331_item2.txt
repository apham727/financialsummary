The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements and the related notes that appear in Item 1 of this document. 
We are focused on being a top global supplier of access infrastructure and related value-added solutions from the cloud edge to the subscriber edge. We offer a broad portfolio of flexible software and hardware network solutions and services that enable service providers to meet today’s service demands, while enabling them to transition to the fully-converged, scalable, highly-automated, cloud-controlled voice, data, internet and video network of the future. 
Our critical accounting policies and estimates have not changed significantly from those detailed in our most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018, filed on February 28, 2019, with the SEC. 
As a percentage of sales, cost of sales decreased from 67.1% in the three months ended March 31, 2018 to 57.8% in the three months ended March 31, 2019. The decrease in cost of sales as a percentage of sales for the three months ended March 31, 2019 is primarily attributable to a regional revenue shift, customer and product mix, services and support mix and a decrease in labor expense as a result of a restructuring program in the first quarter of 2018. 
Network Solutions cost of sales, as a percent of that segment’s sales, decreased from 65.2% in the three months ended March 31, 2018 to 56.2% in the three months ended March 31, 2019. The decrease in cost of sales as a percentage of sales for the three months ended March 31, 2019 is primarily attributable to a regional revenue shift, customer and product mix and a decrease in labor expense due to a restructuring program in the first quarter of 2018. 
Selling, general and administrative expenses increased 4.8% from $33.5 million in the three months ended March 31, 2018 to $35.1 million in the three months ended March 31, 2019. The increase in selling, general and administrative expenses for the three months ended March 31, 2019 is primarily attributable to increases in deferred compensation expense and incremental expenses as a result of the SmartRG acquisition. 
As a percentage of sales, selling, general and administrative expenses decreased from 27.8% in the three months ended March 31, 2018 to 24.4% in the three months ended March 31, 2019. Selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales may fluctuate whenever there is a significant fluctuation in revenue for the periods being compared. 
Research and development expenses decreased 3.7% from $32.8 million in the three months ended March 31, 2018 to $31.6 million in the three months ended March 31, 2019. The decrease in research and development expenses for the three months ended March 31, 2019 is primarily attributable to decreases in restructuring and labor expenses, partially offset by an increase in incremental expenses as a result of the SmartRG and Sumitomo acquisitions. 
Interest and dividend income decreased 31.8% from $0.9 million in the three months ended March 31, 2018 to $0.6 million in the three months ended March 31, 2019. The decrease in interest and dividend income for the three months ended March 31, 2019 is primarily attributable to fluctuations in investment balances. 
Net investment gain (loss) increased from a loss of $(0.1) million in the three months ended March 31, 2018 to a gain of $5.9 million in the three months ended March 31, 2019. The fluctuation in our net investment gain (loss) is primarily attributable to changes in fair value on equity securities recognized during the period. See Note 7 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, included in Item 1 of this report, and “Investing Activities” in “Liquidity and Capital Resources” for additional information. 
Other income (expense), net, is comprised primarily of miscellaneous income, gains and losses on foreign currency transactions and gains and losses on foreign exchange forward contracts. Other income (expense), net increased from $0.1 million of expense in the three months ended March 31, 2018 to $0.9 million of income in the three months ended March 31, 2019. The change in other income (expense), net for the three months ended March 31, 2019 is primarily attributable to the receipt of insurance proceeds from a life insurance policy. 
Gain on bargain purchase of a business was $11.3 million during the three months ended March 31, 2018 and is related to our acquisition of Sumitomo Electric Lightwave Corp.’s North American EPON business and entry into a technology license and supply agreement with Sumitomo Electric Industries, Ltd. in March 2018. No gain on bargain purchase of a business was recorded during the three months ended March 31, 2019. See Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 1 of this report for additional information. 
Our effective tax rate increased from a benefit of 15.1%, excluding the tax effect of the bargain purchase gain, in the three months ended March 31, 2018 to an expense of 28.6% three months ended March 31, 2019. The increase in the effective tax rate between the two periods is primarily driven by the shift to profitability in the current quarter. 
As a result of the above factors, net income increased $11.6 million from a net loss of $10.8 million in the three months ended March 31, 2018 to net income of $0.8 million in the three months ended March 31, 2019.  
We intend to finance our operations with cash flow from operations. We have used, and expect to continue to use, the cash generated from operations for working capital, purchases of treasury stock, shareholder dividends, business acquisitions and other general corporate purposes, including (i) product development activities to enhance our existing products and develop new products and (ii) expansion of sales and marketing activities. We believe our cash and cash equivalents, investments and cash generated from operations to be adequate to meet our operating and capital needs for at least the next 12 months. 
At March 31, 2019, cash on hand was $109.1 million and short-term investments were $31.3 million, which resulted in available short-term liquidity of $140.4 million, of which $70.2 million was held by our foreign subsidiaries. At December 31, 2018, cash on hand was $105.5 million and short-term investments were $3.2 million, which resulted in available short-term liquidity of $108.7 million, of which $87.1 million was held by our foreign subsidiaries. The increase in short-term liquidity from December 31, 2018 to March 31, 2019 is primarily attributable to the restricted certificate of deposit totaling $25.6 million being reclassified from a long-term investment to a short-term investment. 
Other receivables decreased 5.8% from $36.7 million at December 31, 2018 to $34.6 million at March 31, 2019. The decrease in other receivables is primarily attributable to a decrease in contract assets, leased equipment receivables and income tax receivables partially offset by an increase in contract manufacturers’ receivables. 
Accounts payable remained consistent at $60.1 million at December 31, 2018 and March 31, 2019. Accounts payable will fluctuate due to variations in the timing of the receipt of supplies, inventory and services and our subsequent payments for these purchases. 
Capital expenditures totaled approximately $1.9 million and $2.0 million for the three months ended March 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. These expenditures were primarily used to purchase computer hardware, software, manufacturing and test equipment and building improvements. 
Our combined short-term and long-term investments increased $4.4 million from $112.1 million at December 31, 2018 to $116.5 million at March 31, 2019. This increase reflects the impact of net realized and unrealized gains and losses on our combined investments plus new investments, partially offset by cash used for share repurchases, shareholder dividends and property, plant and equipment purchases. 
Our long-term investments decreased 21.7% from $108.8 million at December 31, 2018 to $85.2 million at March 31, 2019. Long-term investments at December 31, 2018 included an investment in a certificate of deposit of $25.6 million, which serves as collateral for our revenue bond. This certificate of deposit is now included in short-term investments as of March 31, 2019, as this bond matures on January 1, 2020. See “Debt” below for additional information. We also have investments in various marketable equity securities classified as long-term investments with a fair market value of $30.9 million and $27.0 million, at March 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018, respectively. Long-term investments at March 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018 also included $20.4 million and $18.3 million, respectively, related to our deferred compensation plans. 
Acquisition of businesses, net of cash acquired, totaled $7.8 million for the three months ended March 31, 2018. No businesses were acquired during the three months ended March 31, 2019. See Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 1 of this report for additional information. 
In July 2003, our Board of Directors elected to begin declaring quarterly dividends on our common stock considering the tax treatment of dividends and adequate levels of Company liquidity. During the three months ended March 31, 2019 and 2018, we paid dividends totaling $4.3 million and $4.4 million, respectively. 
Since 1997, our Board of Directors has approved multiple share repurchase programs that have authorized open market repurchase transactions of our common stock, which are implemented through open market or private purchases from time to time as conditions warrant. During the three months ended March 31, 2019, we repurchased 13,000 shares of our common stock, for $0.2 million at an average price of $14.06 per share. We currently have authorization to repurchase an additional 2.5 million shares of our common stock under the current authorization of up to 5.0 million shares. 
There were no stock options exercised during the three months ended March 31, 2019.  
We have committed to invest up to an aggregate of $7.9 million in two private equity funds, and we have contributed $8.4 million as of March 31, 2019, of which $7.7 million has been applied to these commitments.  
On July 14, 2015, our Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of an additional 5.0 million shares of our common stock (bringing the total shares authorized for repurchase to 50.0 million). This authorization will be implemented through open market or private purchases from time to time as conditions warrant.
