Many of our customers require prompt delivery of products.
We recognized a positive impact to our revenues in the first half of 2017 due to our being awarded a network expansion program by a large European tier-1 customer.
We anticipate that as our Latin American customers resume their network upgrade projects, we may experience further enhancement to our revenues.
We have recently announced receipt of a new nationwide award in the APAC region, as well as additional awards based on new ADTRAN technologies in the EMEA region that we believe will likely result in a positive impact to our revenues.
However, a resolution of the regulatory changes affecting a major customer in Mexico has been slower than anticipated, and business with our customer in that region has not yet returned to a more normal level.
We are continuing to pursue opportunities with new customers in this region.
As a percentage of sales, cost of sales increased from 56.7% in the three months ended March 31, 2017 to 67.1% in the three months ended March 31, 2018.
The increase in cost of sales as a percentage of sales for the three months ended March 31, 2018 is primarily attributable to a regional revenue shift, customer and product mix, services and support mix, an increase in labor expense due to a restructuring program, an increase in warranty expense due to a settlement in Q1 2017 with a third party supplier for a defective component and purchase discounts received from a contract manufacturer in Q1 2017.
Network Solutions cost of sales, as a percent of that segment’s sales, increased from 53.4% in the three months ended March 31, 2017 to 65.2% in the three months ended March 31, 2018.
Selling, general and administrative expenses decreased 3.6% from $34.8 million in the three months ended March 31, 2017 to $33.5 million in the three months ended March 31, 2018.
As a percentage of sales, selling, general and administrative expenses increased from 20.4% in the three months ended March 31, 2017 to 27.8% in the three months ended March 31, 2018.
Research and development expenses increased 2.7% from $32.0 million in the three months ended March 31, 2017 to $32.8 million in the three months ended March 31, 2018.
The increase in research and development expenses for the three months ended March 31, 2018 is primarily attributable to an increase in labor expense due to a restructuring program, partially offset by a decrease in amortization of intangibles acquired in the third quarter of 2016.
As a percentage of sales, research and development expenses increased from 18.8% in the three months ended March 31, 2017 to 27.2% in the three months ended March 31, 2018.
We may incur significant research and development expenses prior to the receipt of revenues from a major new product group.
The decrease in interest and dividend income for the three months ended March 31, 2018 is primarily attributable to a decrease in investment balances and a decrease in the rate of return on those investments.
Interest expense, which is primarily related to our taxable revenue bond, remained constant at $0.1 million in the three months ended March 31, 2017 and 2018, as we had no substantial change in our fixed-rate borrowing.
See “Liquidity and Capital Resources” below for additional information on our revenue bond.
Net realized investment gains decreased 120.6% from $0.5 million in the three months ended March 31, 2017 to $(0.1) million in the three months ended March 31, 2018.
Prior to January 1, 2018, changes in fair value were recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income, net of deferred taxes, on the balance sheet.
See note 1, note 7 and “Investing Activities” in “Liquidity and Capital Resources” below for additional information.
Other income (expense), net, comprised primarily of miscellaneous income, gains and losses on foreign currency transactions, gains and losses on foreign exchange forward contracts, investment account management fees, and scrap raw material sales, changed 142.5% from $0.1 million of income in the three months ended March 31, 2017 to $0.1 million of expense in the three months ended March 31, 2018.
The change in other income (expense), net for the three months ended March 31, 2018 is primarily attributable to increased losses on our foreign exchange contracts.
Gain on bargain purchase of a business is related to our acquisition of Sumitomo Electric Lightwave Corp.’s North American EPON business and entry into a technology license and supply agreement with Sumitomo Electric Industries, Ltd. on March 19, 2018.
See Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.
Our effective tax rate decreased from 20.3% in the three months ended March 31, 2017 to 15.1%, excluding the tax impact of the bargain purchase gain, in the three months ended March 31, 2018.
The decrease in the effective tax rate between the two periods is primarily attributable to the impact of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, which was signed into law on December 22, 2017.
As a result of the above factors, net income (loss) decreased $17.5 million from $6.7 million in the three months ended March 31, 2017 to $(10.8) million in the three months ended March 31, 2018.
We intend to finance our operations with cash flow from operations.
We believe our cash and cash equivalents, investments and cash generated from operations to be adequate to meet our operating and capital needs for at least the next 12 months.
At March 31, 2018, cash on hand was $82.6 million and short-term investments were $16.4 million, which resulted in available short-term liquidity of $99.0 million, of which $63.7 million was held by our foreign subsidiaries.
At December 31, 2017, cash on hand was $86.4 million and short-term investments were $16.1 million, which resulted in available short-term liquidity of $102.6 million, of which $56.8 million was held by our foreign subsidiaries.
The decrease in short-term liquidity from December 31, 2017 to March 31, 2018 is primarily attributable to shifts among available investment option tenures to provide funds for our short-term cash needs.
Our working capital, which consists of current assets less current liabilities, decreased 20.9% from $306.3 million as of December 31, 2017 to $242.2 million as of March 31, 2018, and our current ratio, defined as current assets divided by current liabilities, decreased from 3.87 as of December 31, 2017 to 3.36 as of March 31, 2018 The decrease in our working capital and current ratio is primarily attributable to a decrease in accounts receivable and prepaid expenses and other current assets, partially offset by a decrease in accounts payable and an increase in other receivables.
The decrease in the quick ratio is primarily attributable to a decrease in accounts receivable, partially offset by a decrease in accounts payable.
Accounts receivable decreased 43.9% from $144.2 million at December 31, 2017 to $80.9 million at March 31, 2018.
We had no allowance for doubtful accounts at December 31, 2017 or March 31, 2018.
Quarterly accounts receivable days sales outstanding (DSO) decreased from 105 days as of December 31, 2017 to 60 days as of March 31, 2018 The decrease in net accounts receivable is due to the collection of customer specific payment terms that became due in the first quarter of 2018 and the timing of sales and collections during the quarter.
Additionally, certain international customers can have longer payment terms than U.S. customers.
Inventory decreased 2.1% from $122.5 million at December 31, 2017 to $120.0 million at March 31, 2018.
Prepaid expense and other current assets decreased 43.9% from $17.3 million at December 31, 2017 to $9.7 million at March 31, 2018.
The decrease in prepaid expenses and other current assets is primarily attributable to the recognition of deferred costs related to network installation services that were completed during the quarter.
These expenditures were primarily used to purchase computer hardware, software, manufacturing and test equipment, and building improvements.
Our combined short-term and long-term investments increased $26.5 million from $146.4 million at December 31, 2017 to $172.9 million at March 31, 2018.
Our long-term investments increased 20.1% from $130.3 million at December 31, 2017 to $156.5 million at March 31, 2018.
Long-term investments at March 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017 included an investment in a certificate of deposit of $26.7 million and $27.8 million, respectively, which serves as collateral for our revenue bond.
We have various equity investments included in long-term investments with a fair value of $36.5 million and $35.7 million, at March 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017, respectively.
Long-term investments at March 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017 also included $20.1 million and $19.9 million, respectively, related to our deferred compensation plans, and $0.5 million of other investments carried at cost, consisting of interests in two private equity funds and an investment in a privately held telecommunications equipment manufacturer.
In July 2003, our Board of Directors elected to begin declaring quarterly dividends on our common stock considering the tax treatment of dividends and adequate levels of Company liquidity.
During the three months ended March 31, 2018, we paid dividends totaling $4.4 million.
Since 1997, our Board of Directors has approved multiple share repurchase programs that have authorized open market repurchase transactions of up to 50.0 million shares of our common stock, which will be implemented through open market or private purchases from time to time as conditions warrant.
As of March 31, 2018, we have the authority to purchase an additional 2.9 million shares of our common stock under the current plans approved by the Board of Directors.
We issued 24 thousand shares of treasury stock during the three months ended March 31, 2018 to accommodate employee stock option exercises.
The stock options had exercise prices ranging from $15.29 to $18.97.
We received proceeds totaling $0.4 million from the exercise of these stock options during the three months ended March 31, 2018.
We do not have off-balance sheet financing arrangements and have not engaged in any related party transactions or arrangements with unconsolidated entities or other persons that are reasonably likely to materially affect liquidity or the availability of or requirements for capital resources.
During the three months ended March 31, 2018, there have been no material changes in contractual obligations and commercial commitments from those discussed in our most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2017 filed on February 23, 2018 with the SEC.
We have committed to invest up to an aggregate of $7.9 million in two private equity funds, and we have contributed $8.4 million as of March 31, 2018, of which $7.7 million has been applied to these commitments.
On July 14, 2015, our Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of an additional 5.0 million shares of our common stock (bringing the total shares authorized for repurchase to 50.0 million).
This authorization will be implemented through open market or private purchases from time to time as conditions warrant.
