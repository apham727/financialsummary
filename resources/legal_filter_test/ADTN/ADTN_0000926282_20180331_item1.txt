The accompanying unaudited consolidated financial statements of ADTRAN®, Inc. and its subsidiaries (ADTRAN) have been prepared pursuant to the rules and regulations for reporting on Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q.
In the opinion of management, all adjustments necessary to fairly state these interim statements have been recorded and are of a normal and recurring nature.
The interim statements should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and notes thereto included in ADTRAN’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2017, filed on February 23, 2018 with the SEC.
Our more significant estimates include the obsolete and excess inventory reserves, warranty reserves, customer rebates, determination of the deferred revenue components of multiple element sales agreements, estimated costs to complete obligations associated with deferred revenues, estimated income tax provision and income tax contingencies, the fair value of stock-based compensation, impairment of goodwill, valuation and estimated lives of intangible assets, estimated pension liability, fair value of investments, and the evaluation of other-than-temporary declines in the value of investments.
Actual amounts could differ significantly from these estimates.
ASU 2016-02 requires an entity to recognize lease assets and lease liabilities on the balance sheet and to disclose key information about the entity's leasing arrangements.
We believe the most significant impact relates to our accounting for operating leases for office space and equipment.
The two primary areas of impact of these ASUs were network implementation service revenue performance obligations and contract costs.
The primary impact will be accelerated revenue recognition for certain performance obligations related to service revenue arrangements that were previously deferred until customer acceptance and capitalization and amortization of incremental costs of obtaining a contract as described below.
In connection with the adoption of the new revenue standard, effective January 1, 2018, we adopted ASC 340-40, Other Assets and Deferred Costs - Contracts with Customers, with respect to capitalization and amortization of incremental costs of obtaining a contract.
The primary impact was capitalization of certain sales commissions for our extended maintenance and support contracts in excess of one year and amortization of those costs over the period that the related revenue is recognized.
We recorded a bargain purchase gain of $11.3 million during the first quarter of 2018, net of income taxes, which is subject to customary working capital adjustments between the parties.
SEI, an OEM supplier based in Japan, is a market leader in EPON.
SEI’s Broadband Networks Division through its SEL subsidiary operated a North American EPON business including sales, marketing, support, and region-specific engineering development.
The North American EPON market is primarily driven by the Tier 1 cable MSO operators and has developed slower than anticipated.
Through the transaction, SEI divested its North American EPON assets and established a relationship with ADTRAN.
The transfer of these assets to ADTRAN, which included key customer relationships and required assumption by ADTRAN of relatively low incremental expenses, along with the value of the technology license and OEM supply agreement, resulted in the bargain purchase gain.
The following unaudited supplemental pro forma information presents the financial results as if the acquisition had occurred on January 1, 2017.
This unaudited supplemental pro forma information does not purport to be indicative of what would have occurred had the acquisition been completed on January 1, 2017, nor is it indicative of any future results.
Aside from revising the 2017 and 2018 net income for the effect of the bargain purchase gain, there were no material, non-recurring adjustments to this unaudited pro forma information.
For the three months ended March 31, 2018, we incurred acquisition and integration related expenses and amortization of acquired intangibles of $0.2 million related to this acquisition.
Revenue is measured based on the consideration we expect to receive in exchange for transferring goods or providing services to a customer and as performance obligations under the terms of the contract are satisfied.
Generally, this occurs with the transfer of control of a product or service to the customer.
The consideration, including any discounts, is allocated between separate products and services based on their stand-alone selling prices using the most likely amount.
The stand-alone selling prices are determined based on the prices at which we sell the separate products and services.
Sales, value added, and other taxes collected concurrent with revenue-producing activities are excluded from revenue.
Capitalized costs with an amortization period greater than one year were immaterial.
The following is a description of the principal activities from which we generate our revenue by reportable segment.
Network Solutions includes hardware products and next-generation virtualized solutions used in service provider or business networks, as well as prior generation products.
Shipping terms are generally FOB shipping point.
Revenue is recorded net of discounts and rebates using the most likely amount.
Customers are typically invoiced when control is transferred and revenue is recognized.
Our products generally include assurance-based warranties of 90 days to five years for product defects, which are accrued at the time revenue is recognized.
In certain transactions, we are also the lessor in sales-type lease arrangements for network equipment, which have terms of 18 months to five years.
Product revenue for these leases is generally recorded when we transfer control of the product to our customers.
Customers are typically invoiced and pay for maintenance services at the beginning of the maintenance period, which is recorded in current or non-current unearned revenue depending on the length of the service period.
Maintenance services are provided on an as-needed basis and our customers benefit evenly throughout the contract term.
Accordingly, we recognize revenue for maintenance services on a straight-line basis over the maintenance period in services revenue.
We recognize revenue for network implementation, which primarily consists of engineering, execution and enablement services, when performance obligations are complete at a point in time.
If we have recognized revenue, but not billed the customer, the right to consideration is recognized as a contract asset, which is included in other receivables in the Consolidated Balance Sheet.
As of March 31, 2018, we did not have any remaining performance obligations related to customer contracts that had an original expected duration of one year or more, other than maintenance services, which are satisfied over time.
During the three months ended March 31, 2018, we recognized $3.5 million of revenue that was included in unearned revenue at the beginning of the period.
Our effective tax rate decreased from 20.3% in the three months ended March 31, 2017, to 15.1%, excluding the tax impact of the bargain purchase gain, in the three months ended March 31, 2018.
The decrease in the effective tax rate between the two periods is primarily attributable to the impact of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, which was signed into law on December 22, 2017.
The aggregate intrinsic value will change based on the fair market value of our stock.
The total pre-tax intrinsic value of options exercised during the three months ended March 31, 2018 was $33 thousand.
As of March 31, 2018, there was $2.5 million of unrecognized compensation expense related to unvested stock options, which is expected to be recognized over an average remaining recognition period of 1.3 years.
The fair value of our stock options is estimated using the Black-Scholes model.
There were no stock options granted during the three months ended March 31, 2018 or 2017.
The fair value of our PSUs with market conditions is calculated using a Monte Carlo Simulation valuation method.
The fair value of these performance-based PSU awards was equal to the closing price of our stock on the date of grant.
As of March 31, 2018, there was $12.9 million of unrecognized compensation expense related to unvested market-based PSUs, RSUs and restricted stock, which is expected to be recognized over an average remaining recognition period of 2.9 years.
In addition, there was $10.7 million of unrecognized compensation expense related to unvested performance-based PSUs, which will be recognized over the requisite service period of three years as achievement of the performance objective becomes probable.
Actual maturities may differ from contractual maturities because some borrowers have the right to call or prepay obligations with or without call or prepayment penalties.
At March 31, 2018, we held a $26.7 million restricted certificate of deposit, which is carried at cost.
This investment serves as a collateral deposit against the principal amount outstanding under loans made to ADTRAN pursuant to an Alabama State Industrial Development Authority revenue bond (the Bond), which totaled $26.7 million at March 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017.
At March 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017, the estimated fair value of the Bond using a level 2 valuation technique was approximately $26.6 million and $26.7 million, respectively, based on a debt security with a comparable interest rate and maturity and a Standard and Poor’s credit rating of AAA.
In conjunction with this program, we are eligible to receive certain economic incentives from the state of Alabama that reduce the amount of payroll withholdings we are required to remit to the state for those employment positions that qualify under this program.
It is our intent to make annual principal payments in addition to the interest amounts that are due.
Prior to January 1, 2018, our marketable equity securities were classified as available-for-sale.
Realized gains and losses on marketable equity securities were included in net realized investment gain (loss).
Unrealized gains and losses were recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income, net of deferred taxes, on the balance sheet.
On January 1, 2018, we adopted ASU 2016-01, which requires us to measure all equity investments that do not result in consolidation and are not accounted for under the equity method at fair value, with any changes in fair value recognized in net realized investment gain (loss).
Upon adoption, we reclassified $3.2 million of net unrealized gains related to marketable equity securities from accumulated other comprehensive income to opening retained earnings.
As of March 31, 2018 and 2017, gross unrealized losses related to individual investments in a continuous loss position for 12 months or longer were not significant.
These multiple market prices are used as inputs into a distribution-curve-based algorithm to determine the daily market value of each security.
We participate in foreign exchange forward contracts in connection with the management of exposure to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates.
Purchases of U.S. denominated inventory by our European subsidiary represent our primary exposure.
Changes in the fair value of derivatives designated as cash flow hedges are not recognized in current operating results, but are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income.
Amounts related to cash flow hedges are reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive income when the underlying hedged item impacts earnings.
This reclassification is recorded in the same line item of the consolidated statements of income at which the effects of the hedged item are recorded, which is cost of sales.
When appropriate, we utilize foreign exchange forward contracts to help manage the volatility relating to these valuation exposures.
Our derivative instruments are recorded in the Consolidated Balance Sheets at their fair values.
Our derivative instruments are not subject to master netting arrangements and are not offset in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.
As of March 31, 2018, we had no foreign exchange forward contracts.
We evaluate the carrying value of goodwill during the fourth quarter of each year and between annual evaluations if events occur or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of the reporting unit below its carrying amount.
We have elected to first assess the qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit to which the goodwill is assigned is less than its carrying amount as a basis for determining whether it is necessary to perform the two-step impairment test.
If we determine that it is more likely than not that its fair value is less than its carrying amount, then the two-step impairment test will be performed.
There have been no impairment losses recognized since the acquisition in 2011.
Intangible assets are included in other assets in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets and include intangibles acquired in conjunction with our acquisitions of Bluesocket, Inc. on August 4, 2011, the NSN BBA business on May 4, 2012, CommScope’s active fiber access business on September 13, 2016 and Sumitomo Electric Lightwave Corp.’s North American EPON business and technology license and OEM supply agreement with Sumitomo Electric Industries, Ltd. on March 19, 2018.
The following table presents our intangible assets as of March 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017.
Fully amortized intangible assets have been removed from prior year balances for comparability.
Amortization expense, all of which relates to business acquisitions, was $0.4 million and $1.1 million for the three months ended March 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively.
Since 1997, our Board of Directors has approved multiple share repurchase programs that have authorized open market repurchase transactions of up to 50.0 million shares of our common stock, which will be implemented through open market or private purchases from time to time as conditions warrant.
As of March 31, 2018, we have the authority to purchase an additional 2.9 million shares of our common stock under the current plans approved by the Board of Directors.
We issued 24 thousand shares of treasury stock during the three months ended March 31, 2018 to accommodate employee stock option exercises.
The stock options had exercise prices ranging from $15.29 to $18.97.
We received proceeds totaling $0.4 million from the exercise of these stock options during the three months ended March 31, 2018.
Other comprehensive income consists of unrealized gains (losses) on available-for-sale securities; unrealized gains (losses) on cash flow hedges; reclassification adjustments for amounts included in net income related to impairments of available-for-sale securities, realized gains (losses) on available-for-sale securities, realized gains (losses) on cash flow hedges, and amortization of actuarial gains (losses) related to our defined benefit plan; defined benefit plan adjustments; and foreign currency translation adjustments.

Anti-dilutive options totaled 4.8 million and 4.0 million for the three months ended March 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively.
The following table presents information about the reported sales and gross profit of our reportable segments for the three months ended March 31, 2018 and 2017.
We do not produce asset information by reportable segment; therefore, it is not reported.
The table below presents sales information by category for the three months ended March 31, 2018 and 2017.
Our products generally include warranties of 90 days to five years for product defects.
We engage in extensive product quality programs and processes, including actively monitoring and evaluating the quality of our component suppliers.
Our products continue to become more complex in both size and functionality as many of our product offerings migrate from line card applications to total systems.
The increasing complexity of our products will cause warranty incidences, when they arise, to be more costly.
In addition, from time to time, specific warranty accruals may be recorded if unforeseen problems arise.
Alternatively, if we provide for more reserves than we require, we will reverse a portion of such provisions in future periods.
The liability for warranty obligations totaled $9.7 million at March 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017.
These liabilities are included in accrued expenses in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets.
We have committed to invest up to an aggregate of $7.9 million in two private equity funds, and we have contributed $8.4 million as of March 31, 2018, of which $7.7 million has been applied to these commitments.
On April 17, 2018, we announced that our Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.09 per common share to be paid to stockholders of record at the close of business on May 2, 2018.
The payment date will be May 16, 2018.
The quarterly dividend payment will be approximately $4.3 million.
In July 2003, our Board of Directors elected to begin declaring quarterly dividends on our common stock considering the tax treatment of dividends and adequate levels of Company liquidity.
