We maintain depository investments with certain financial institutions. Although these depository investments may exceed government insured depository limits, we have evaluated the credit-worthiness of these financial institutions, and determined the risk of material financial loss due to exposure of such credit risk to be minimal. As of September 30, 2019, $93.7 million of our cash and cash equivalents, primarily certain domestic money market funds and foreign depository accounts, were in excess of government provided insured depository limits. 
As of September 30, 2019, approximately $38.4 million of our cash and investments could be directly affected by changes in interest rates. We have performed a hypothetical sensitivity analysis assuming market interest rates increase or decrease by 50 basis points (“bps”) for an entire year, while all other variables remain constant. At September 30, 2019, we held $5.9 million of cash and variable-rate investments where a change in interest rates would impact our interest income. A hypothetical 50 bps decline in interest rates as of September 30, 2019 would reduce annualized interest income on our cash and investments by approximately $0.1 million. In addition, we held $32.5 million of fixed-rate bonds whose fair values may be directly affected by a change in interest rates. A hypothetical 50 bps increase in interest rates as of September 30, 2019 would reduce the fair value of our fixed-rate bonds by approximately $0.3 million. 
As of September 30, 2019, we had certain material contracts, including accounts receivable, accounts payable and lease liabilities, denominated in foreign currencies. As of September 30, 2019, we did not have any forward contracts outstanding.
