All material intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.
The condensed consolidated financial statements included herein are unaudited.
In the opinion of management, all adjustments, consisting of normal recurring adjustments, necessary for a fair presentation in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America have been included.
These condensed consolidated financial statements and the related notes should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes included in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018 (the “2018 Annual Report”).
Previously, this item was included within Net change in other long-term assets and liabilities.
 Prior to adoption, the Company evaluated Topic 842, including the initial review of any necessary changes to existing processes and systems that would be required to implement this standard, in order to determine its impact on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.
In 2018, the Company implemented a new lease management system that facilitated the adoption of this standard and enabled the Company to fulfill its requirements for both reporting and disclosure purposes, as well as to better manage and monitor the Company’s ongoing lease portfolio.
The Company ensured all key system functionality and other requirements were met, and we completed our assessment of the standard and implemented the necessary changes to our existing policies, processes and controls to achieve appropriate compliance with regards to our lease portfolio.
 On January 1, 2019, we adopted Topic 842 using the updated modified retrospective transition approach allowed under ASU 2018-11 and did not restate prior periods.
of Cash Flow for the three months ended March 31, 2019, nor did it have any impact on our compliance with debt covenants.
The adoption of Topic 842 provided various optional practical expedients in transition, some of which we have elected.
Going forward, the impact of Topic 842 on the Company’s consolidated financial statements will be dependent upon the Company’s lease portfolio.
The accounting for finance leases (formerly referred to as “capital leases”) remains substantially unchanged.
Refer to Note 15 herein for further details regarding the impact of the adoption of Topic 842 and other information related to our lease portfolio.
For the three months ended March 31, 2019 and 2018, less than 5% of our net sales are recognized over time, as the associated contracts relate to the sale of goods with no alternative use as they are only sold to a single customer and whose underlying contract terms provide the Company with an enforceable right to payment, including a reasonable profit margin, for performance completed to date, in the event of customer termination.
It is generally expected that a substantial portion of our remaining performance obligations will be fulfilled within three months, and nearly all of our performance obligations are part of contracts that have original durations of one year or less.
 Net sales by geographic area are based on the customer location to which the product is shipped.
and markets a broad range of connector and connector systems, value-add products and other products, including antennas and sensors, used in a broad range of applications in a diverse set of end markets.
The accounting policies of the segments are the same as those for the Company as a whole and are described herein and in Note 1 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements in the Company’s 2018 Annual Report.
 Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests is classified below net income.
Earnings per share is determined after the impact of the noncontrolling interests’ share in net income of the Company.
In addition, the equity attributable to noncontrolling interests is presented as a separate caption within equity.

 In May 2017, the Company adopted the 2017 Stock Purchase and Option Plan for Key Employees of Amphenol and Subsidiaries (the “2017 Employee Option Plan”).
A committee of the Company’s Board of Directors has been authorized to grant stock options pursuant to the 2017 Employee Option Plan.
As of March 31, 2019, there were 16,982,040 shares of Common Stock available for the granting of additional stock options under the 2017 Employee Option Plan.
The Company also continues to maintain the 2009 Stock Purchase and Option Plan for Key Employees of Amphenol and Subsidiaries, as amended (the “2009 Employee Option Plan”).
No additional stock options will be granted under the 2009 Employee Option Plan.
The 2004 Directors Option Plan expired in May 2014, except that its terms continue with respect to any outstanding options granted thereunder.
Options were last granted under the 2004 Directors Option Plan in May 2011.
Options granted under the 2004 Directors Option Plan are fully vested and are generally exercisable over a period of ten years from the date of grant.
 The grant-date fair value of each option grant under the 2009 Employee Option Plan, the 2017 Employee Option Plan and the 2004 Directors Option Plan is estimated using the Black-Scholes option pricing model.
The grant-date fair value of each share grant is determined based on the closing share price of the Company’s Common Stock on the date of the grant.
Use of a valuation model for option grants requires management to make certain assumptions with respect to selected model inputs.
Expected share price volatility is calculated based on the historical volatility of the Common Stock and implied volatility derived from related exchange traded options.
The average expected life is based on the contractual term of the option and expected exercise and historical post-vesting termination experience.
The risk-free interest rate is based on U.S. Treasury zero-coupon issuances with a remaining term equal to the expected life assumed at the date of grant.
The expected annual dividend per share is based on the Company’s dividend rate.
As of March 31, 2019, the number of restricted shares available for grant under the 2012 Directors Restricted Stock Plan was 109,150.
Grants under the 2012 Directors Restricted Stock Plan entitle the holder to receive shares of the Company’s Common Stock without payment.
 In January 2018, the Company made a voluntary cash contribution of approximately $81.0 to fund the U.S. Plans.

SSI, which is headquartered in the United States (Wisconsin), is a leading designer and manufacturer of sensors and sensing solutions for the global automotive and industrial markets.
The acquisition of SSI is not material to the Company.
The contingent consideration payment is based on certain 2019 revenue and profitability levels of SSI.
The contingent consideration is payable in 2020 and recorded in Other accrued expenses on the accompanying Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets as of March 31, 2019.
 In the past twelve months, the Company has completed several other acquisitions, all within the Interconnect Products and Assemblies segment.
The Company is in the process of completing its analyses of the fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed.
The Company anticipates that the final assessments of values will not differ materially from the preliminary assessments.
 During the three months ended March 31, 2019, the Company incurred approximately $16.5 ($13.2 after-tax) of acquisition-related expenses, which includes the amortization of $12.5 related to the value associated with acquired backlog from the SSI acquisition, as well as external transaction costs of $4.0.
 The increase in goodwill, net of foreign currency translation, during the first three months of 2019 is primarily due to the acquisition of SSI in January 2019, which is included in the Interconnect Products and Assemblies segment.
 Intangible assets are included in Intangibles, net and other long-term assets in the accompanying Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets.

 On January 15, 2019, the Company amended its $2,000.0 unsecured credit facility (the “2016 Revolving Credit Facility”) with a $2,500.0 unsecured credit facility (“2019 Revolving Credit Facility”).
The 2019 Revolving Credit Facility, which matures January 2024, increases the lenders’ aggregate commitments by $500.0 and, consistent with the previous 2016 Revolving Credit Facility, gives the Company the ability to borrow at a spread over LIBOR.
The Company may utilize the 2019 Revolving Credit Facility for general corporate purposes.
At March 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018, there were no borrowings under the 2019 Revolving Credit Facility.

The Company is generally not able to precisely estimate the ultimate settlement amounts or timing until the close of an audit.
 Amphenol is a lessee of buildings, office space, automobiles and equipment throughout the world, nearly all of which are classified as operating leases expiring at various dates.
The Company’s real estate leases, which are comprised primarily of manufacturing facilities, warehouses and sales offices, represent the vast majority of our operating lease liabilities and generally have a lease term between 2 and 12 years.
The remaining leases consist primarily of machinery and equipment used in production, office equipment and vehicles, each with various lease terms.
The vast majority of our leases are comprised of fixed lease payments, with a small percentage of the Company’s real estate leases including lease payments tied to a rate or index which may be subject to variability.
Certain real estate leases also include executory costs such as common area maintenance (non-lease component), as well as property insurance and property taxes (non-components).
non-components, are included in the measurement of the Company’s lease liabilities to the extent that such payments are either fixed amounts or variable amounts based on a rate or index (fixed in substance) as stipulated in the lease contract.
 Substantially all of our lease agreements do not specify an implicit borrowing rate, and as such, the Company utilizes its incremental borrowing rate by lease term, in order to calculate the present value of our future lease payments.
On January 1, 2019, the discount rate used on existing leases at adoption was determined based on the remaining lease term using available data as of that date.
For new or renewed leases starting in 2019, the discount rate is determined using available data at lease commencement and based on the lease term including any reasonably certain renewal periods.
Leases with renewal options allow the Company to extend the lease term typically between 1 and 6 years.
Renewal options are reviewed at lease commencement to determine if such options are reasonably certain of being exercised, which could impact the lease term.
 Lease contracts that we have executed but which have not yet commenced as of March 31, 2019 were not material, and are excluded from the tables above.
The Company does not generally enter into leases involving the construction or design of the underlying asset, and nearly all of the assets we lease are not specialized in nature.
Our lease agreements generally do not include residual value guarantees nor do we enter into sublease arrangements with external parties.
 Prior to January 1, 2019, the Company accounted for its leases in accordance with Topic 840, Leases.
At December 31, 2018, the Company was committed under operating leases for buildings, office space, automobiles and equipment, which expired at various dates.

   Item 2.
For purposes of the following discussion, the terms “constant currencies” and “organically” have the same meaning as these aforementioned non-GAAP financial measures.
Refer to “Non-GAAP Financial Measures” within this Item 2 for more information, including our reasons for including the non-GAAP financial measures and material limitations with respect to the usefulness of the measures.
The Company obtained, prepared and analyzed all of the information it believes necessary in order to complete its accounting of the Tax Act in the fourth quarter of 2018 based on the regulatory guidance issued at that time.
The Company undertakes no obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements except as required by law.
 Net sales were $1,958.5 in the first quarter of 2019 compared to $1,866.9 in the first quarter of 2018, which represented an increase of 5% in U.S. dollars, 8% in constant currencies and 5% organically over the same respective prior year period.
Net sales in the Interconnect Products and Assemblies segment (approximately 95% of net sales) in the first quarter of 2019 increased 5% in U.S. dollars, 8% in constant currencies and 5% organically, compared to the first quarter of 2018.
The sales growth was driven by increases in the information technology and data communications, industrial, military, commercial aerospace and mobile networks markets, arising primarily from organic growth along with contributions from the Company’s acquisitions, which was partially offset by a decrease in the mobile device market and a small decrease in the automotive market.
Net sales in the Cable Products and Solutions segment (approximately 5% of net sales) in the first quarter of 2019, which primarily serves the broadband market, decreased 1% in U.S. dollars, while increasing 2% in constant currencies and 2% organically, compared to the first quarter of 2018.
   (2)    Foreign currency translation impact, a non-GAAP measure, represents the impact on net sales resulting from foreign currency exchange rate changes in the current year period(s) compared to the same period(s) in the prior year.
Such amount is calculated by subtracting current year net sales translated at average foreign currency exchange rates for the respective prior periods from current year reported net sales, taken as a percentage of the respective prior period net sales.
   (3)    Constant Currency Net Sales Growth and Organic Net Sales Growth are non-GAAP financial measures as defined in the "Non-GAAP Financial Measures" section.
   (4)    Acquisition impact, a non-GAAP measure, represents the impact on net sales resulting from acquisitions closed since the beginning of the prior calendar year, which were not included in the Company’s results as of the comparable prior year periods and which do not reflect the underlying growth of the Company on a comparative basis.
 Geographically, sales in the United States in the first quarter of 2019 increased approximately 10% in U.S. dollars ($578.9 in 2019 versus $527.0 in 2018) and 5% organically, compared to the first quarter of 2018.
Foreign sales in the first quarter of 2019 increased approximately 3% in U.S. dollars ($1,379.6 in 2019 versus $1,339.9 in 2018), 6% in constant currencies and 4% organically, compared to the first quarter of 2018.
 Selling, general and administrative expenses increased to $235.1 or 12.0% of net sales for the first quarter of 2019, compared to $230.0 or 12.3% of net sales for the first quarter of 2018.
Administrative expenses represented approximately 4.5% of net sales for the first quarter of 2019 and represented approximately 5.0% of net sales for the first quarter of 2018.
Research and development expenses represented approximately 3.0% of net sales for the first quarter of 2019 and represented 2.8% of net sales for first quarter of 2018.
Selling and marketing expenses represented approximately 4.5% of net sales for the first quarter of 2019 and represented approximately 4.5% of net sales for the first quarter of 2018.
 Operating income was $376.2 or 19.2% of net sales for the first quarter of 2019, compared to $376.9 or 20.2% of net sales for the first quarter of 2018.
These expenses had the effect of decreasing net income by $13.2 or $0.04 per share for the three months ended March 31, 2019.
Operating income for the Interconnect Products and Assemblies segment for the first quarter of 2019 was $410.0 or 22.0% of net sales compared to $391.1 or 22.1% of net sales for the first quarter of 2018.
Operating income for the Cable Products and Solutions segment for the first quarter of 2019 was $10.5 or 10.9% of net sales, compared to $11.3 or 11.7% of net sales for the first quarter of 2018.
The decrease in operating margin for the Cable Products and Solutions segment for the first quarter of 2019, compared to the same respective period of 2018, was primarily driven by product mix.
The increase in interest expense is primarily due to higher average debt levels, along with higher average interest rates on the Company’s U.S. commercial paper borrowings as well as the new 4.350% U.S. Senior Notes issuance in January 2019.
The borrowings under the U.S. Commercial Paper Program and net proceeds from the 4.350% U.S. Senior Notes were used to repay the Company’s 2.55% U.S. Senior Notes in January 2019.
 Provision for income taxes for the first quarter of 2019 was at an effective tax rate of 22.8%, compared to 24.4% for the first quarter of 2018.
For the first quarter of 2019 and 2018, the excess tax benefits resulting from stock option exercise activity had the impact of lowering the effective tax rate and increasing earnings per share by the amounts noted in the table below.
The effective tax rate was further impacted by the effect of acquisition-related expenses during the first quarter of 2019, as noted in the table below.
Excluding the effect of these items, the Adjusted Effective Tax Rate, a non-GAAP financial measure as defined in the “Non-GAAP Financial Measures” section below within this Item 2, for the three months ended March 31, 2019 and 2018 was 24.5% and 25.5%, respectively, as reconciled in the tables below to the comparable effective tax rate based on GAAP results.
Excluding the effect of the excess tax benefits related to stock-based compensation and acquisition-related expenses discussed above, Adjusted Net Income attributable to Amphenol Corporation and Adjusted Diluted EPS, non-GAAP financial measures as defined in the “Non-GAAP Financial Measures” section below within this Item 2, were $273.9 and $0.89, respectively, for the first quarter of 2019, compared to $261.5 and $0.83, respectively, for the first quarter of 2018.
   (1)    While the terms “operating margin” and “effective tax rate” are not considered U.S. GAAP financial measures, for purposes of this table, we derive the reported (GAAP) measures based on GAAP results, which serve as the basis for the reconciliation to their comparable non-GAAP financial measure.
 At March 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018, the Company had cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments of $987.6 and $1,291.7, respectively.
The majority of the Company’s cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments on hand as of December 31, 2018 and March 31, 2019 is located outside of the United States.
The Company intends to evaluate future earnings for distribution, and accrue for those distributions where appropriate, and to indefinitely reinvest all other foreign earnings.
 The Company’s primary sources of liquidity are internally generated cash flow, our cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments on hand, the Commercial Paper Programs, and the 2019 Revolving Credit Facility.
The Company believes that its cash, cash equivalents and short-term investment position on hand, ability to generate future cash flow from operations, availability under its credit facilities, and access to capital markets (including the recent issuance of the 2029 Senior Notes in January 2019, discussed further within this Item 2) provide adequate liquidity to meet its obligations for the next twelve months.
 The Company’s primary ongoing cash requirements will be for operating and capital expenditures, product development activities, repurchases of its Common Stock, dividends, debt service, payments associated with the Transition Tax (which is payable in annual installments until 2025), taxes due upon the repatriation of foreign earnings (which will be payable upon the repatriation of such earnings), and funding of pension obligations.
The Company’s debt service requirements consist primarily of principal and interest on the Company’s Senior Notes, the 2019 Revolving Credit Facility and the Commercial Paper Programs (all as defined below).
The Company may also use cash to fund all or part of the cost of acquisitions.
 The ability to generate cash from operating activities is one of the Company’s fundamental financial strengths.
The increase in cash flow provided by operating activities (“Operating Cash Flow”) for the first three months of 2019 compared to the first three months of 2018 is primarily related to a lower usage of cash related to the change in working capital.
In addition, Operating Cash Flow for the first three months of 2018 included the Company’s voluntary cash contribution of approximately $81.0 during that period to fund its U.S. defined benefit pension plans (“U.S.
Plans”, and together with its foreign plans, the “Plans”), while no such voluntary cash contributions to the U.S. Plans were made in the first quarter of 2019.
 In the first three months of 2019, the components of working capital as presented on the accompanying Condensed Consolidated Statements of Cash Flow increased $22.7, excluding the impact of acquisitions and foreign currency translation, primarily due to decreases in accounts payable of $113.4 and accrued liabilities, including income taxes, of $91.3, partially offset by decreases in accounts receivable of $160.8 and inventories of $31.7.
In the first three months of 2018, the components of working capital as presented on the accompanying Condensed Consolidated Statements of Cash Flow increased $133.3, excluding the impact of acquisitions and foreign currency translation, primarily due to a decrease in accounts payable and accrued liabilities of $99.3 and $65.5, respectively, and an increase in inventories of $55.8, partially offset by a decrease in accounts receivable of $118.3.
Accounts receivable decreased $129.9 to $1,661.9, primarily due to lower sales in the first quarter of 2019 relative to the fourth quarter of 2018, partially offset by the effect of translation from exchange rate changes at March 31, 2019 compared to December 31, 2018 (“Translation”) and the impact of the SSI acquisition in the Interconnect Products and Assemblies segment that
