The increase in interest expense is primarily due to higher average debt levels, along with higher average interest rates on the Company’s U.S. commercial paper borrowings as well as the new 4.350% U.S. Senior Notes issuance in January 2019.
The borrowings under the U.S. Commercial Paper Program and net proceeds from the 4.350% U.S. Senior Notes were used to repay the Company’s 2.55% U.S. Senior Notes in January 2019.

Provision for income taxes for the second quarter and first six months of 2018 was at an effective tax rate of 24.7% and 24.5%, respectively.
For the second quarter and first six months of 2019 and 2018, the excess tax benefits resulting from stock option exercise activity had the impact of lowering the effective tax rate and increasing earnings per share by the amounts noted in the tables below.
The effective tax rate for the second quarter and first six months of 2019 was further impacted by the tax effect of acquisition-related expenses during such periods of 2019, as noted in the tables below.

Inventory days at June 30, 2019 and December 31, 2018 were 83 and 74 days, respectively.

Intangibles, net and other long-term assets increased $241.5 to $735.8, primarily due to (i) the adoption of the new lease standard (“Topic 842”) described in Note 15 of the accompanying Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements, which resulted in the recognition of $178.9 of operating lease right-of-use assets as of June 30, 2019 and (ii) the recognition of certain intangible assets related to the SSI acquisition and other 2019 acquisitions, partially offset by (iii) the amortization of $40.4 related to the Company’s intangible assets during the six months ended June 30, 2019.
Payable days at June 30, 2019 and December 31, 2018 were approximately 53 days.
Other long-term liabilities increased $90.9 to $623.7, primarily as a result of the adoption of Topic 842, which resulted in the recognition of approximately $121.7 of long-term operating lease liabilities as of June 30, 2019, partially offset by a decrease in deferred income tax liabilities.
In the first quarter of 2018, the Company made a voluntary cash contribution to fund the Company’s U.S. Plans of approximately $81.0.
In addition to cash flow from operating activities, the Company also considers Free Cash Flow, a non-GAAP financial measure defined in the “Non-GAAP Financial Measures” section below, as a key metric in measuring the Company’s ability to generate cash.
The following table reconciles Free Cash Flow to its most directly comparable U.S. GAAP financial measure for the six months ended June 30, 2019 and 2018.
Cash flows from investing activities consist primarily of cash flows associated with capital expenditures, proceeds from disposals of property, plant and equipment, net sales and maturities (purchases) of short-term investments, and acquisitions.
In the first six months of 2019, net cash used in investing activities was driven primarily by the use of $756.2 in cash to fund acquisitions, capital expenditures (net of disposals) of $144.4, and net purchases of short-term investments of $2.5.
In the first six months of 2018, net cash used in investing activities was driven primarily by the use of $158.8 in cash to fund acquisitions, along with capital expenditures (net of disposals) of $132.6, partially offset by net sales and maturities of short-term investments of $8.3.

The 2019 Revolving Credit Facility, which matures January 2024, increases the lenders’ aggregate commitments by $500.0 and, consistent with the previous 2016 Revolving Credit Facility, gives the Company the ability to borrow at a spread over LIBOR.
The Company may utilize the 2019 Revolving Credit Facility for general corporate purposes.
At June 30, 2019, there were no borrowings under the 2019 Revolving Credit Facility.
