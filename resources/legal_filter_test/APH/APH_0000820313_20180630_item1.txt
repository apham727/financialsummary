 In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (the “FASB”) issued Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606) (“ASU 2014-09”, and collectively with its related subsequent amendments, “Topic 606”). Topic 606 supersedes previous revenue recognition guidance and requires entities to recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for such goods or services. The Company adopted Topic 606 as of January 1, 2018 using the modified retrospective transition method applied to those contracts which were not completed as of January 1, 2018. Under this transition method, the Company’s results in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income for the three and six months ended June 30, 2018 are presented under Topic 606, while the comparative results for the three and six months ended June 30, 2017 were not retrospectively adjusted, as such results were recognized in accordance with the revenue recognition policy discussed under Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in Note 1 of the Company’s 2017 Annual Report.  
 The adoption of Topic 606 did not have a material impact on our condensed consolidated financial statements as of the adoption date and as of and for the three and six months ended June 30, 2018. Refer to Note 3 herein for further discussion regarding revenue recognition and related policies.  
system that will facilitate the adoption of this new standard and ensure all requirements are met for both reporting and disclosure purposes. While the Company continues to evaluate the impact that ASU 2016-02 will have on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures, we will be recognizing a right-of-use asset and a corresponding lease liability for our operating lease commitments on our balance sheet. The actual impact of the standard will be dependent upon the Company’s lease portfolio at adoption. The Company is also currently evaluating which transition approach will be used upon adoption.  
 Prior to the adoption of Topic 606, the Company’s revenue recognition policy was in accordance with ASC Topic 605, Revenue Recognition. Effective January 1, 2018, the Company adopted Topic 606 using the modified retrospective transition method, resulting in accounting policy changes surrounding revenue recognition which replaced certain related policies discussed under Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates (in Item 7) and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (in Note 1) of the Company’s 2017 Annual Report. The adoption of Topic 606 did not have a material impact on the Company’s condensed consolidated financial statements. The following is a summary of the Company’s revenue recognition and related accounting policies and disclosures resulting from the adoption of Topic 606.  
 With limited exceptions, the Company recognizes revenue at the point in time when we ship or deliver the product from our manufacturing facility to our customer, when our customer accepts and has legal title of the goods, and the Company has a present right to payment for such goods. Based on the respective contract terms, most of our contracts’ revenues are recognized either (i) upon shipment based on free on board (“FOB”) shipping point, (ii) when the product arrives at its destination or (iii) when the product is pulled from consignment inventory. Less than 5% of our net sales are recognized over time, as the associated contracts relate to the sale of goods with no alternative use as they are only sold to a single customer and whose underlying contract terms provide the Company with an enforceable right to payment, including a reasonable profit margin, for performance completed to date, in the event of customer termination. For the contracts recognized over time, we typically record revenue using the input method, based on the materials and labor costs incurred to date relative to the contract’s total estimated costs. This method reasonably depicts when and as control of the goods transfers to the customer, since it measures our progress in producing the goods, which is generally commensurate with this transfer of control. Since we typically invoice our customers at the same time that we satisfy 
our performance obligations, we do not have significant contract assets or contract liabilities related to our contracts with customers recorded in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets.   
 Standard product warranty coverage which provides assurance that our products will conform to the contractually agreed-upon specifications for a limited period from the date of shipment is typically offered, while extended or separately-priced warranty coverage is typically not offered. The warranty claim is generally limited to a credit equal to the purchase price or a promise to repair or replace the product for a specified period of time at no additional charge. We estimate our warranty liability based on historical experience, product history, and current trends, and record warranty expense in cost of sales in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income. Warranty liabilities and related warranty expense have not been and were not significant in the accompanying Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements as of and for the three and six months ended June 30, 2018.  
 The Company records contract assets or contract liabilities depending on the timing of revenue recognition, billings and cash collections on a contract-by-contract basis. Contract assets represent unbilled receivables, which generally arise when revenue recognized over time exceed amounts billed to customers. Contract liabilities represent billings or advanced consideration received from customers in excess of revenue recognized to date. As the Company’s performance obligations are typically less than one year, these amounts are generally recorded as current in the accompanying Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets within Other current assets or Other accrued expenses as of June 30, 2018. Contract assets and contract liabilities recorded in the Company’s Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets were not significant both at the date of adoption and as of June 30, 2018.  
 Net sales by geographic area are based on the customer location to which the product is shipped.  
 On January 24, 2017, the Company’s Board of Directors authorized a stock repurchase program under which the Company could purchase up to $1,000.0 of the Company’s Common Stock during the two-year period ending January 24, 2019 in accordance with the requirements of Rule 10b-18 of the Exchange Act (the “2017 Stock Repurchase Program”). During the three months ended March 31, 2018, the Company repurchased 4.2 million shares of its common stock for $382.0 under the 2017 Stock Repurchase Program, bringing total repurchases under this program to approximately 12.6 million shares or $1,000.0, thus completing the 2017 Stock Repurchase Program.   
 On April 24, 2018, the Company’s Board of Directors authorized a new stock repurchase program under which the Company may purchase up to $2,000.0 of the Company’s Common Stock during the three-year period ending April 24, 2021 in accordance with the requirements of Rule 10b-18 of the Exchange Act (the “2018 Stock Repurchase Program”). During the three months ended June 30, 2018, the Company repurchased 3.1 million shares of its common stock for $263.4 under the 2018 Stock Repurchase Program. These treasury shares have been retired by the Company, accordingly common stock and retained earnings were reduced. From July 1, 2018 to July 27, 2018, the Company repurchased approximately 0.4 million additional shares of its common stock for $34.8, leaving approximately $1,701.8 available to purchase under the 2018 Stock Repurchase Program. The price and timing of any future purchases under the 2018 Stock Repurchase Program will depend on factors such as levels of cash generation from operations, the volume of stock option exercises by employees, cash requirements for acquisitions, dividends, economic and market conditions and stock price.  
 On April 24, 2018, the Company’s Board of Directors approved an increase to its quarterly dividend rate from $0.19 to $0.23 per share effective with dividends declared in the second quarter of 2018.  
 Excluded from the computations above were anti-dilutive common shares of 1.5 million and 1.7 million for the three months ended June 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively, and 0.9 million and 1.0 million for the six months ended June 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively.  
 Certain operations of the Company are subject to environmental laws and regulations which govern the discharge of pollutants into the air and water, as well as the handling and disposal of solid and hazardous wastes. The Company believes that its operations are currently in substantial compliance with applicable environmental laws and regulations and that the costs of continuing compliance will not have a material adverse effect on the Company’s financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.  
 For the three months ended June 30, 2018 and 2017, the Company’s income before income taxes was reduced for stock-based compensation expense of $13.3 and $12.3, respectively. In addition, for the three months ended June 30, 2018 and 2017, the Company recognized aggregate income tax benefits associated with stock-based compensation of $4.9 and $24.1, respectively, in the provision for income taxes in the accompanying Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income, which include the excess tax benefits from option exercises of $3.0 (or $0.01 per share) and $21.2 (or $0.07 per share), respectively. For the six months ended June 30, 2018 and 2017, the Company’s income before income taxes was reduced for stock-based compensation expense of $26.0 and $24.4, respectively. In addition, for the six months ended June 30, 2018 and 2017, the Company recognized aggregate income tax benefits associated with stock-based compensation of $10.8 and $35.1, respectively, which include the excess tax benefits from option exercises of $7.1 (or $0.02 per share) and $29.2 (or $0.09 per share), respectively. The impact associated with recognizing excess tax benefits from option exercises in the provision for income taxes on our consolidated financial statements could result in significant fluctuations in our effective tax rate in the future, since the provision for income taxes will be impacted by the timing and intrinsic value of future stock-based compensation award exercises.  
 In May 2017, the Company adopted the 2017 Stock Purchase and Option Plan for Key Employees of Amphenol and Subsidiaries (the “2017 Employee Option Plan”). A committee of the Company’s Board of Directors has been authorized to grant stock options pursuant to the 2017 Employee Option Plan. The number of shares of the Company’s Class A Common Stock (“Common Stock”) reserved for issuance under the 2017 Employee Option Plan is 30,000,000 shares.  As of June 30, 2018, there were 16,947,280 shares of Common Stock available for the granting of additional stock options under the 2017 Employee Option Plan. The Company also continues to maintain the 2009 Stock Purchase and Option Plan for Key Employees of Amphenol and Subsidiaries, as amended (the “2009 Employee Option Plan”). No additional stock options will be granted under the 2009 Employee Option Plan. The 2000 Stock Purchase and Option Plan for Key Employees of Amphenol and Subsidiaries, as amended, expired in May 2011 and all options granted thereunder have been either exercised or forfeited. Options granted under the 2017 Employee Option Plan and 
 In 2004, the Company adopted the 2004 Stock Option Plan for Directors of Amphenol Corporation (the “2004 Directors Option Plan”). The 2004 Directors Option Plan is administered by the Company’s Board of Directors. The 2004 Directors Option Plan expired in May 2014, except that its terms continue with respect to outstanding options granted thereunder. Options were last granted under the 2004 Directors Option Plan in May 2011. Options granted under the 2004 Directors Option Plan are fully vested and are generally exercisable over a period of ten years from the date of grant.  
 The grant-date fair value of each option grant under the 2009 Employee Option Plan, the 2017 Employee Option Plan and the 2004 Directors Option Plan is estimated using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. The grant-date fair value of each share grant is determined based on the closing share price of the Company’s Common Stock on the date of the grant. The fair value is then amortized on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period of the awards, which is generally the vesting period. Use of a valuation model for option grants requires management to make certain assumptions with respect to selected model inputs. Expected share price volatility is calculated based on the historical volatility of the Common Stock and implied volatility derived from related exchange traded options. The average expected life is based on the contractual term of the option and expected exercise and historical post-vesting termination experience. The risk-free interest rate is based on U.S. Treasury zero-coupon issuances with a remaining term equal to the expected life assumed at the date of grant. The expected annual dividend per share is based on the Company’s dividend rate.  
 As of June 30, 2018, the total compensation cost related to non-vested restricted shares not yet recognized was approximately $1.1 with a weighted average expected amortization period of 0.88 years.  
 The Company and certain of its domestic subsidiaries have defined benefit pension plans (the “U.S. Plans”), which cover certain U.S. employees and which represent the majority of the plan assets and benefit obligations of the aggregate defined benefit plans of the Company. The U.S. Plans’ benefits are generally based on years of service and compensation and are generally noncontributory. Certain U.S. employees not covered by the U.S. Plans are covered by defined contribution plans. Certain foreign subsidiaries have defined benefit plans covering their employees (the “International Plans” and, together with the U.S. Plans, the “Plans”). The following is a summary, based on the most 
 As a result of the adoption of ASU 2017‑07, the Company records service costs in the same line item as the respective employee compensation costs and within operating income, while all other pension-related costs including interest cost, expected return on plan assets, amortization of prior service cost and amortization of net actuarial losses are reported separately within Other income, net in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income.   
 In January 2018, the Company made a voluntary cash contribution of approximately $81.0 to fully fund the U.S. Plans, and estimates that, based on current actuarial calculations, cash contributions to the Plans will aggregate approximately $90.0 in 2018. The timing and amount of cash contributions in subsequent years will depend on a number of factors, including the investment performance of the Plans’ assets. This voluntary cash contribution made in the first quarter of 2018 is reflected as cash used in operating activities within Net change in accrued pension and postretirement benefits in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Cash Flow.  
 The Company offers various defined contribution plans for certain U.S. and foreign employees. Participation in these plans is based on certain eligibility requirements. The Company matches the majority of employee contributions to the U.S. defined contribution plans with cash contributions up to a maximum of 5% of eligible compensation. During the six months ended June 30, 2018 and 2017, the Company provided matching contributions to the U.S. defined contribution plans of approximately $4.3 and $3.2, respectively.  
 In the past twelve months, the Company has completed several acquisitions, including three acquisitions which closed in the first six months of 2018, all in the Interconnect Products and Assemblies segment. The Company is in the process of completing its analyses of the fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed. The Company anticipates that the final assessments of values will not differ materially from the preliminary assessments. These acquisitions were not significant to the Company either individually or in the aggregate.   
 Intangible assets are included in Intangibles, net and other long-term assets in the accompanying Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. The amortization expense for the three months ended June 30, 2018 and 2017 was approximately $11.9 and $12.0, respectively. The amortization expense for the six months ended June 30, 2018 and 2017 was approximately $23.8 and $24.0, respectively. As of June 30, 2018, amortization expense relating to the Company’s current intangible assets estimated for the remainder of 2018 is approximately $23.2 and for each of the next five fiscal years is approximately $42.9 in 2019, $37.2 in 2020, $32.5 in 2021, $24.9 in 2022 and $22.2 in 2023.  
 The Company has a $2,000.0 unsecured credit facility (the “Revolving Credit Facility”), which matures March 2021 and gives the Company the ability to borrow at a spread over LIBOR. The Company may utilize the Revolving Credit 
 The Company has a commercial paper program (the “U.S. Commercial Paper Program”) pursuant to which the Company issues short-term unsecured commercial paper notes (“U.S. Commercial Paper” or “USCP Notes”) in one or more private placements in the United States. The maturities of the USCP Notes vary, but may not exceed 397 days from the date of issue. The USCP Notes are sold under customary terms in the commercial paper market and may be issued at a discount from par, or, alternatively, may be sold at par, and bear varying interest rates on a fixed or floating basis. The maximum aggregate principal amount of the USCP Notes outstanding under the U.S. Commercial Paper Program at any time is capped at $2,000.0. The average interest rate on the U.S. Commercial Paper as of June 30, 2018 was 2.37%.   
 On July 10, 2018, the Company and one of its wholly owned subsidiaries entered into a euro-commercial paper program (the “Euro Commercial Paper Program” and, together with the U.S. Commercial Paper Program, the “Commercial Paper Programs”) pursuant to which the wholly owned subsidiary may issue short-term unsecured commercial paper notes (the “ECP Notes” and, together with the USCP Notes, “Commercial Paper”), which are guaranteed by the Company and are to be issued outside of the United States. The maturities of the ECP Notes will vary, but may not exceed 183 days from the date of issue. The ECP Notes will be sold under customary terms in the euro-commercial paper market and may be issued at par or a discount therefrom or a premium thereto and bear varying interest rates on a fixed or floating basis. The maximum aggregate principal amount of the ECP Notes outstanding under the Euro Commercial Paper Program at any time is capped at $2,000.0. The ECP Notes may be issued in Euros, Sterling, U.S. Dollars or other currencies.   
 All of the Company’s outstanding senior notes (“Senior Notes”), listed in the table above, are unsecured and rank equally in right of payment with the Company’s other unsecured senior indebtedness. Interest on each series of Senior Notes is payable semiannually. The Company may, at its option, redeem some or all of any series of senior notes at any time subject to certain terms and conditions, which include paying 100% of the principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the date of repurchase and, with certain exceptions, a make-whole premium. The fair value of each series of Senior Notes is based on recent bid prices in an active market and is therefore classified as Level 1 in the fair value hierarchy (Note 15). The 2.55% Senior Notes are due in January 2019 and are therefore recorded, net of the related unamortized discount and debt issuance costs, within Current portion of long-term debt in the accompanying Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets as of June 30, 2018.   
 For the three months ended June 30, 2018 and 2017, stock option exercise activity had the impact of lowering our Provision for income taxes by approximately $3.0 and $21.2, respectively, and lowering our effective tax rate by approximately 80 basis points and 660 basis points, respectively, due to the recognition of excess tax benefits within Provision for income taxes in the accompanying Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income. For the six months ended June 30, 2018 and 2017, stock option exercise activity had the impact of lowering our Provision for income taxes by approximately $7.1 and $29.2, respectively, and lowering our effective tax rate by approximately 100 basis points and 470 basis points, respectively.  
 Fair value is determined based on the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants. These requirements establish market or observable inputs as the preferred source of values. Assumptions based on hypothetical transactions are used in the absence of market inputs. The Company does not have any non-financial instruments accounted for at fair value on a recurring basis.  
 Level 1 Quoted prices for identical instruments in active markets.  
 Level 2 Quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets; quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not active; and model-derived valuations whose inputs are observable or whose significant value drivers are observable.  
 Level 3 Significant inputs to the valuation model are unobservable.  
 The Company does not have any significant financial or non-financial assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value on a non-recurring basis.  
 Net sales were $1,981.4 in the second quarter of 2018 compared to $1,666.5 in the second quarter of 2017, which represented an increase of 19% in U.S. dollars, 17% in constant currencies and 13% organically over the same respective prior period. Net sales were $3,848.3 in the first six months of 2018 compared to $3,226.6 in the first six months of 2017, which represented an increase of 19% in U.S. dollars, 16% in constant currencies and 12% organically over the same respective prior period. Net sales in the Interconnect Products and Assemblies segment (approximately 94% of net sales) in the second quarter of 2018 increased 20% in U.S. dollars, 17% in constant currencies and 13% organically, compared to the second quarter of 2017. Net sales in the Interconnect Products and Assemblies segment (approximately 95% of net sales) in the first six months of 2018 increased 20% in U.S. dollars, 17% in constant currencies and 13% organically, compared to the first six months of 2017. The sales growth in both periods was driven by increases in the industrial, automotive, mobile devices, information technology and data communications, military, mobile networks and 
commercial aerospace markets, arising primarily from organic growth along with contributions from the Company’s acquisitions. Net sales in the second quarter of 2018 in the Cable Products and Solutions segment (approximately 6% of net sales), which primarily serves the broadband market, increased 4% in U.S. dollars, 5% in constant currencies and 5% organically, compared to the second quarter of 2017. Net sales in the first six months of 2018 in the Cable Products and Solutions segment (approximately 5% of net sales) increased 2% in U.S. dollars, 2% in constant currencies and 2% organically in the first six months of 2018 compared to the same period in 2017.  
   (1)    Net sales growth in U.S. dollars is calculated based on Net sales as reported in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income and Note 5 of the accompanying financial statements. 
   (2)    Foreign currency translation impact, a non-GAAP measure, represents the impact on net sales resulting from foreign currency exchange rate changes in the current year period(s) compared to the same period(s) in the prior year. Such amount is calculated by subtracting current year net sales translated at average foreign currency exchange rates for the respective prior periods from current year reported net sales, taken as a percentage of the respective prior period net sales.   
   (3)    Constant Currency Net Sales Growth and Organic Net Sales Growth are non-GAAP financial measures as defined in the "Non-GAAP Financial Measures" section. 
   (4)    Acquisition impact, a non-GAAP measure, represents the impact on net sales resulting from acquisitions closed since the beginning of the prior calendar year, which were not included in the Company’s results as of the comparable prior year periods and which do not reflect the underlying growth of the Company on a comparative basis. 
 Geographically, sales in the United States in the second quarter of 2018 increased approximately 21% in U.S. dollars ($576.3 in 2018 versus $476.5 in 2017) and 15% organically, compared to the second quarter of 2017, and increased 18% in U.S. dollars ($1,103.3 in 2018 versus $934.3 in 2017) and 12% organically in the first six months of 2018, compared to the first six months of 2017. Foreign sales in the second quarter of 2018 increased approximately 18% in U.S. dollars ($1,405.1 in 2018 versus $1,190.0 in 2017), 15% in constant currencies and 12% organically, compared to the second quarter of 2017, and increased 20% in U.S. dollars ($2,745.0 in 2018 versus $2,292.3 in 2017), 16% in constant currencies and 13% organically in the first six months of 2018, compared to the first six months of 2017. The comparatively weaker U.S. dollar for the second quarter and first six months of 2018 had the effect of increasing sales by approximately $39.4 and $102.8, respectively, compared to the same respective periods in 2017.   
 Selling, general and administrative expenses increased to $236.6 or 11.9% of net sales and $466.6 or 12.1% of net sales for the second quarter and first six months of 2018, respectively, compared to $212.4 or 12.7% of net sales and $414.2 or 12.8% of net sales for the second quarter and first six months of 2017, respectively. Administrative expenses represented approximately 4.8% and 4.9% of net sales for the second quarter and first six months of 2018, respectively, and represented approximately 4.9% of net sales for both the second quarter and first six months of 2017. Research and development expenses represented approximately 2.8% of net sales for both the second quarter and first six months of 2018, and represented 2.8% of net sales for both the second quarter and first six months of 2017. Selling and marketing expenses represented approximately 4.4% and 4.5% of net sales for the second quarter and first six months of 2018, respectively, and represented approximately 5.1% of net sales for both the second quarter and first six months of 2017.   
 Operating income was $408.2 or 20.6% of net sales and $785.1 or 20.4% of net sales for the second quarter and first six months of 2018, respectively, compared to $336.2 or 20.2% of net sales and $650.3 or 20.2% of net sales for the second quarter and first six months of 2017, respectively. Operating income for the second quarter and first six months of 2017 included $4.0 of acquisition-related expenses (separately presented in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income) related to external transaction costs incurred in the second quarter of 2017. These expenses had an impact on net income of $3.7 or $0.01 per share for the three and six months ended June 30, 2017. Excluding the effect of these acquisition-related expenses, Adjusted Operating Income and Adjusted Operating Margin, as defined in the “Non-GAAP Financial Measures” section below, were $340.2 or 20.4% of net sales and $654.3 or 20.3% of net sales for the three and six months ended June 30, 2017, respectively. The increase in the Adjusted Operating Margin for the three and six months ended June 30, 2018, compared to the same respective periods in 2017, was driven primarily by an increase in operating margin for the Interconnect Products and Assemblies segment. Operating income for the Interconnect Products and Assemblies segment for the second quarter and first six months of 2018 was $419.7 or 22.4% of net sales and $810.9 or 22.3% of net sales, respectively, compared to $348.4 or 22.3% of net sales and $672.4 or 22.2% of net sales for the second quarter and first six months of 2017, respectively. Operating income for the Cable Products and Solutions segment for the second quarter and first six months of 2018 was $14.7 or 13.2% of net sales and $26.0 or 12.5% of net sales, respectively, compared to $16.0 or 14.9% of net sales and $29.7 or 14.6% of net sales for the second quarter and first six months of 2017, respectively. The decrease in operating margin for the Cable Products and Solutions segment for the second quarter and first six months of 2018, compared to the same respective periods of 2017, was primarily driven by increases in certain commodity costs.  
 Provision for income taxes for the second quarter and first six months of 2018 was at an effective tax rate of 24.7% and 24.5%, respectively. For the second quarter of 2018, the excess tax benefits resulting from stock option exercise activity had the impact of lowering the effective tax rate by approximately 80 basis points and increasing earnings per share by $0.01, and for the first six months of 2018, the excess tax benefits resulting from stock option exercise activity had the impact of lowering the effective tax rate by approximately 100 basis points and increasing earnings per share by $0.02. Provision for income taxes for the second quarter and first six months of 2017 was at an effective tax rate of 20.1% and 21.9%, respectively. For the second quarter of 2017, the excess tax benefits resulting from stock option exercise activity had the impact of lowering the effective tax rate by approximately 660 basis points and increasing earnings per share by $0.07, and for the first six months of 2017, the excess tax benefits resulting from stock option exercise activity had the impact of lowering the effective tax rate by approximately 470 basis points and increasing earnings per share by $0.09. Excluding the effect of these items, the Adjusted Effective Tax Rate, a non-GAAP financial measure defined in the “Non-GAAP Financial Measures” section below, for the three and six months ended June 30, 2018 was 25.5%, and for the three and six months ended June 30, 2017 was 26.5%, as reconciled in the tables below to the comparable effective tax rate based on GAAP results. Refer to Note 14 of the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for further information related to income taxes.  
   (1)    While the terms “operating margin” and “effective tax rate” are not considered U.S. GAAP financial measures, for purposes of this table, we derive the reported (GAAP) measures based on GAAP results, which serve as the basis for the reconciliation to their comparable non-GAAP financial measure. 
 At June 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017, the Company had cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments of $991.1 and $1,753.7, respectively. The vast majority of the Company’s cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments on hand as of December 31, 2017 and June 30, 2018 is located outside of the United States. Prior to the Tax Act, the Company asserted its intention to indefinitely reinvest outside of the United States all of its foreign earnings not otherwise distributed currently. For earnings occurring on or after January 1, 2018, the Tax Act’s change to a modified territorial tax system in the United States has significantly reduced the U.S. tax expense associated with the remittance of foreign earnings, among other changes. The Tax Act also imposed a one-time transition tax on all of the Company’s pre-2018 accumulated unremitted foreign earnings. As a result, on December 31, 2017, the Company recorded a provisional U.S. tax expense for the Transition Tax. This Transition Tax on the deemed repatriation of the accumulated unremitted earnings and profits of foreign subsidiaries, will be paid, net of applicable tax credits and deductions, in annual installments until 2025, as permitted under the Tax Act. In the second quarter of 2018, the Company paid the first annual installment of the Transition Tax of approximately $18.0. The Company does not believe that these future tax payments will have a significant impact on its liquidity or capital resources.   
 The ability to generate cash from operating activities is one of the Company’s fundamental financial strengths. Cash flow provided by operating activities was $395.3 in the first six months of 2018 compared to $518.2 in the first six months of 2017. The decrease in cash flow provided by operating activities (“operating cash flow”) for the first six months of 2018 compared to the first six months of 2017 is primarily related to (i) the Company’s voluntary cash contribution of approximately $81.0 in the first quarter of 2018 to fully fund its U.S. defined benefit pension plans (“U.S. Plans”, and together with its foreign plans, the “Plans”), (ii) certain tax payments made during the first half of 2018 related to the Tax Act of approximately $54.0, including the first annual installment of the Transition Tax of approximately $18.0 and payments for foreign and state withholding and income taxes of approximately $36.0 related to foreign cash repatriated during the first half of 2018, along with (iii) a higher usage of cash related to other changes in working capital, all of which were partially offset by an increase in net income in the first six months of 2018.   
 In the first six months of 2018, the components of working capital as presented on the accompanying Condensed Consolidated Statements of Cash Flow increased $185.5, excluding the impact of acquisitions and foreign currency translation, primarily due to an increase in inventories of $80.0, accounts receivable of $44.5 and other current assets of $29.8 and a decrease in accrued liabilities, including income taxes, of $44.8, partially offset by an increase in accounts payable of $13.6. In the first six months of 2017, the components of working capital as presented on the accompanying Condensed Consolidated Statements of Cash Flow increased $115.8, excluding the impact of acquisitions and foreign currency translation, primarily due to an increase in inventories and other current assets of $86.4 and $38.8, respectively, and a decrease in income taxes payable of $45.0, partially offset by an increase in accounts payable of $62.1.  
 The following describes the significant changes in the amounts as presented on the accompanying Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets at June 30, 2018 as compared to December 31, 2017. Accounts receivable increased $28.7 to $1,627.3, primarily due to higher sales in the second quarter of 2018 relative to the fourth quarter of 2017, which were partially offset by the effect of translation from exchange rate changes at June 30, 2018 compared to December 31, 2017 (“Translation”). Days sales outstanding at June 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017 were approximately 73 days. Inventories increased $52.9 to $1,159.8, primarily to support expected future sales levels, partially offset by Translation. Inventory days at June 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017 were 78 and 76 days, respectively. Other current assets increased $46.4 to $243.2, primarily due to the recording of contract assets of $25.5 as of June 30, 2018 as a result of the adoption of Topic 606 as well as an increase in other receivables. Property, plant and equipment, net, increased $71.4 to $888.2, primarily due to capital additions of $180.1, partially offset by depreciation of $95.9 and Translation. Goodwill increased $86.0 to $4,128.6, primarily as a result of goodwill recognized related to three acquisitions in the Interconnect Products and Assemblies segment that closed during the first six months of 2018, which was partially offset by Translation. Intangibles, net and other long-term assets decreased $16.4 to $472.1, primarily as a result of amortization related to the Company’s intangible assets. Accounts payable increased $27.5 to $903.1, primarily as a result of 
purchasing activity, which was partially offset by payments on outstanding payables and Translation. Payable days at June 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017 were approximately 61 and 60 days, respectively. Total accrued expenses, including accrued income taxes, decreased $33.4 to $669.3, primarily as a result of the first annual installment payment of the Transition Tax, foreign and state withholding and income taxes paid related to foreign cash repatriated, as well as certain employee-related compensation and benefit costs. Accrued pension and postretirement benefit obligations decreased $95.2 to $176.8, primarily due to the Company’s voluntary cash contribution of approximately $81.0 in January 2018 to fully fund the Company’s U.S. Plans. Other long-term liabilities, including deferred taxes, decreased $55.7 to $511.9, primarily as a result of a reduction in deferred foreign and state withholding and income taxes.  
 The Company estimates that, based on current actuarial calculations and including the first quarter contribution to its U.S. Plans, cash contributions to the Plans will aggregate approximately $90.0 in 2018. The timing and amount of cash contributions in subsequent years will depend on a number of factors, including the investment performance of the Plans’ assets.  
 In addition to cash flow from operating activities, the Company also considers Free Cash Flow, a non-GAAP financial measure defined in the “Non-GAAP Financial Measures” section below, as a key metric in measuring the Company’s ability to generate cash. The following table reconciles Free Cash Flow to its most directly comparable U.S. GAAP financial measure for the six months ended June 30, 2018 and 2017. The decrease in Free Cash Flow is primarily related to the decrease in operating cash flow during the first six months of 2018, which was primarily driven by (i) the voluntary cash contribution to fully fund the U.S. Plans of approximately $81.0 in January 2018, (ii) certain tax payments made during the first half of 2018 related to the Tax Act of approximately $54.0, including the first annual installment of the Transition Tax of approximately $18.0 and payments for foreign and state withholding and income taxes of approximately $36.0 related to foreign cash repatriated during the first half of 2018, and (iii) a higher usage of cash related to other changes in working capital as discussed above, along with an increase in capital expenditures to support certain new customer programs.   
 Cash flows from investing activities consist primarily of cash flows associated with capital expenditures, proceeds from disposals of property, plant and equipment, net sales and maturities (purchases) of short-term investments, and acquisitions.   
and distributions to shareholders of noncontrolling interests of $7.1, partially offset by cash proceeds from the exercise of stock options of $50.7. For the first six months of 2017, cash used in financing activities was driven primarily by repurchases of the Company’s common stock of $399.9, net repayments of commercial paper of $364.1, dividend payments of $98.2, purchases of and distributions to noncontrolling interests of $19.6, and payments of costs related to the issuances of two senior notes of $5.2, partially offset by borrowings related to the issuances of two senior notes in April 2017 of $749.3 and cash proceeds from the exercise of stock options of $73.0.  
 The Company has significant flexibility to meet its financial commitments. The Company uses debt financing to lower the overall cost of capital and increase return on stockholders’ equity. The Company’s debt financing includes the use of commercial paper programs, revolving credit facility and senior notes as part of its overall cash management strategy.  
 The Company has a $2,000.0 unsecured credit facility (the “Revolving Credit Facility”), which matures March 2021 and gives the Company the ability to borrow at a spread over LIBOR. The Company intends to utilize the Revolving Credit Facility for general corporate purposes. At June 30, 2018, there were no borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility. The Revolving Credit Facility requires payment of certain annual agency and commitment fees and requires that the Company satisfy certain financial covenants. At June 30, 2018, the Company was in compliance with the financial covenants under the Revolving Credit Facility.  
 Pursuant to the terms of the commercial paper program, the Company issues short-term unsecured commercial paper notes in one or more private placements (the “U.S. Commercial Paper Program”) in the United States. The maximum aggregate principal amount of the commercial paper notes that may be outstanding at any time under the U.S. Commercial Paper Program is $2,000.0. The amount of U.S. commercial paper notes outstanding (“USCP Notes”) as of June 30, 2018 was $1,047.9.   
 On July 10, 2018, the Company and one of its wholly owned subsidiaries entered into a euro-commercial paper program (the “Euro Commercial Paper Program” and, together with the U.S. Commercial Paper Program, the “Commercial Paper Programs”) pursuant to which the wholly owned subsidiary may issue short-term unsecured commercial paper notes (the “ECP Notes” and, together with the USCP Notes, the “Commercial Paper”), which are guaranteed by the Company and are to be issued outside of the United States. The maximum aggregate principal amount of the ECP Notes outstanding under the Euro Commercial Paper Program at any time is capped at $2,000.0.   
due in January 2019 and are therefore recorded, net of the related unamortized discount and debt issuance costs, within Current portion of long-term debt in the accompanying Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets as of June 30, 2018.  
 Refer to Note 13 of the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for further information related to the Company’s debt.  
 On January 24, 2017, the Company’s Board of Directors authorized a stock repurchase program under which the Company could purchase up to $1,000.0 of the Company’s Common Stock during the two-year period ending January 24, 2019 in accordance with the requirements of Rule 10b-18 of the Exchange Act (the “2017 Stock Repurchase Program”). During the three months ended March 31, 2018, the Company repurchased 4.2 million shares of its common stock for $382.0 under the 2017 Stock Repurchase Program, bringing total repurchases under this program to approximately 12.6 million shares or $1,000.0, thus completing the 2017 Stock Repurchase Program.   
 On April 24, 2018, the Company’s Board of Directors authorized a new stock repurchase program under which the Company may purchase up to $2,000.0 of the Company’s Common Stock during the three-year period ending April 24, 2021 in accordance with the requirements of Rule 10b-18 of the Exchange Act (the “2018 Stock Repurchase Program”). During the three months ended June 30, 2018, the Company repurchased 3.1 million shares of its common stock for $263.4 under the 2018 Stock Repurchase Program. These treasury shares have been retired by the Company, accordingly common stock and retained earnings were reduced. From July 1, 2018 to July 27, 2018, the Company repurchased approximately 0.4 million additional shares of its common stock for $34.8, leaving approximately $1,701.8 available to purchase under the 2018 Stock Repurchase Program. The price and timing of any future purchases under the 2018 Stock Repurchase Program will depend on factors such as levels of cash generation from operations, the volume of stock option exercises by employees, cash requirements for acquisitions, dividends, economic and market conditions and stock price.  
 On April 24, 2018, the Company’s Board of Directors approved an increase to its quarterly dividend rate from $0.19 to $0.23 per share effective with dividends declared in the second quarter of 2018.  
 The Company’s primary sources of liquidity are internally generated cash flow, the Commercial Paper Programs, the Revolving Credit Facility, and its cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments on hand. The Company believes that its cash, cash equivalents and short-term investment position on hand, ability to generate future cash flow from operations, availability under its credit facilities, and access to capital markets (including the issuances of both the 2020 Senior Notes and 2024 Senior Notes in April 2017) provide adequate liquidity to meet its obligations for the next twelve months and the foreseeable future, including the repayment of the $750.0 outstanding principal amount of 2.55% Senior Notes due January 2019 (the “2.55% Notes”).  
 The Company’s primary ongoing cash requirements will be for operating and capital expenditures, product development activities, repurchases of its Common Stock, funding of pension obligations, dividends, debt service (including the repayment of the 2.55% Notes), payments associated with the Transition Tax (which is payable in annual installments until 2025) and taxes due upon the repatriation of foreign earnings (which will be payable upon the repatriation of such earnings). The Company’s debt service requirements consist primarily of principal and interest on 
the Senior Notes, the Revolving Credit Facility and the Commercial Paper Programs. The Company may also use cash to fund all or part of the cost of acquisitions.  
 Certain operations of the Company are subject to environmental laws and regulations which govern the discharge of pollutants into the air and water, as well as the handling and disposal of solid and hazardous wastes. The Company believes that its operations are currently in substantial compliance with applicable environmental laws and regulations and that the costs of continuing compliance will not have a material adverse effect on the Company’s financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.  
   ·    Adjusted Diluted EPS is defined as diluted earnings per share (as reported in accordance with U.S. GAAP), excluding income and expenses and their specific tax effects, that are not directly related to the Company's operating performance during the periods presented. Adjusted Diluted EPS is calculated as Adjusted Net Income attributable to Amphenol Corporation, as defined below, divided by the weighted average outstanding diluted shares as reported in the Company’s Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income. 
   ·    Adjusted Operating Margin is defined as Adjusted Operating Income (as defined above) expressed as a percentage of Net sales (as reported in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income). 
   ·    Free Cash Flow is defined as Net cash provided by operating activities (“operating cash flow” - as reported in accordance with U.S. GAAP) less capital expenditures (as reported in accordance with U.S. GAAP), both of which are derived from the Company’s Condensed Consolidated Statements of Cash Flow. Free Cash Flow is an important liquidity measure for the Company, as we believe it is useful for management and investors to assess our ability to generate cash, as well as to assess how much cash can be used to reinvest in the growth of the Company or to return to shareholders through either stock repurchases or dividends. 
 The Company’s disclosures of its critical accounting policies, which are contained in its 2017 Annual Report, have not materially changed since that report was filed. Effective January 1, 2018, the Company’s policies related to revenue recognition have been updated in accordance with Note 3 of the accompanying Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part I, Item 1 within this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.  
 Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk  
 The Company, in the normal course of doing business, is exposed to a variety of risks, including market risks associated with foreign currency exchange rates and changes in interest rates. The Company does not have any significant concentration with any one counterparty. There has been no material change in the Company’s assessment of its sensitivity to foreign currency exchange rate risk since its presentation set forth in Part II, Item 7A “Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk” in its 2017 Annual Report. The Company may borrow under its Revolving Credit Facility and Commercial Paper Programs. Any borrowings under the new Euro Commercial Paper Program, entered into in July 2018 as discussed in Note 13 of the accompanying Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements, may be denominated in foreign currencies, and there can be no assurance that the Company can successfully manage 
these changes in exchange rates, including in the event of a significant and sudden decline in the value of any of the foreign currencies for which such borrowings are made. In addition, any borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility either bear interest at or trade at rates that fluctuate with a spread over LIBOR, while any borrowings under the Commercial Paper Programs are subject to floating interest rates. Therefore, when the Company borrows under these debt instruments, the Company is exposed to market risk from exposure to changes in interest rates. As of June 30, 2018, there were no outstanding borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility, while borrowings under the Commercial Paper Programs were at an average floating rate of 2.37%. The Company does not expect changes in interest rates to have a material effect on income or cash flows in 2018, although there can be no assurances that interest rates will not change significantly.
