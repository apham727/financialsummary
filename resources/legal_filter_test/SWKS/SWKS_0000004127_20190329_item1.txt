In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-13, Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments (Topic 320), (“ASU 2016-13”).
This ASU requires a financial asset (or a group of financial assets) measured on the basis of amortized cost to be presented at the net amount expected to be collected.
This ASU requires that the income statement reflect the measurement of credit losses for newly recognized financial assets as well as the expected increases or decreases of expected credit losses that have taken place during the period.
This ASU requires that credit losses of debt securities designated as available-for-sale be recorded through an allowance for credit losses.

This ASU expands the scope of Topic 718 to include share-based payment transactions for acquiring goods and services from nonemployees.
The Company adopted ASU 2018-07 during the second quarter of fiscal 2019.
The adoption of this standard did not have a material impact on the Company’s consolidated financial statements.
In August 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-15, Intangibles-Goodwill and Other-Internal-Use Software (Topic 350), Customer’s Accounting for Implementation Costs Incurred in a Cloud Computing Arrangement That Is a Service Contract (“ASU 2018-15”).
The new guidance clarifies the accounting for implementation costs in cloud computing arrangements.
The Company adopted ASU 2018-15, on a prospective basis, during the second quarter of fiscal 2019.
The adoption of this standard did not have a material impact on the Company’s consolidated financial statements.
This ASU requires lessees to reflect most leases on their balance sheet as assets and obligations.
The Company will utilize the modified retrospective method and will recognize any cumulative effect adjustment in retained earnings at the beginning of the period of adoption.
The Company is currently evaluating the effect that ASU 2016-02 will have on the consolidated financial statements and related disclosures, including the available practical expedients and the discount rate to be applied in the valuations.
At March 29, 2019, the Company had $13.9 million accrued to other long-term liabilities for capital equipment, and $38.1 million accrued to accounts payable for capital equipment.
At September 28, 2018, the Company had $13.9 million accrued to other long-term liabilities for capital equipment, and $94.1 million accrued to accounts payable for capital equipment.
These amounts accrued at March 29, 2019, for capital equipment purchases have been excluded from the consolidated statements of cash flows for the six months ended March 29, 2019, and are expected to be paid in subsequent periods.
The Company adopted ASU 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606), in the first quarter of fiscal 2019 for open contracts not completed as of the adoption date using the modified retrospective approach.
The impact from the cumulative effect adjustment was not material and comparative information for prior periods has not been adjusted.
The impact of applying the new standard on the Company’s consolidated financial statements for the six months ended March 29, 2019, was not material, except for an increase in accounts receivable and other current liabilities in the amount of $30.7 million to reflect customer credits as a liability.

Returns under the Company’s general assurance warranty of products have not been material and warranty-related services are not considered a separate performance obligation.
As of March 29, 2019, the amount of remaining performance obligation that has not been recognized as revenue is not material.
Pricing adjustments and estimates of returns are treated as variable consideration for purposes of determining the transaction price.

Payments are due within one year of invoicing and do not include a significant financing component.
To date, there have been no material impairment losses on accounts receivable.

The Company’s revenue to external customers is generated principally from the sale of semiconductor products that facilitate various wireless communication applications.
Accordingly, the Company considers its product offerings to be similar in nature and therefore not segregated for reporting purposes.

•Level 1 - Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
•Level 2 - Observable inputs other than Level 1 prices, such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities, quoted prices in markets with insufficient volume or infrequent transactions (less active markets), or model-driven valuations in which all significant inputs are observable or can be derived principally from, or corroborated with, observable market data.
The Company measures certain assets and liabilities at fair value on a recurring basis such as its financial instruments.
There have been no transfers between Level 1, 2 or 3 assets or liabilities during the three and six months ended March 29, 2019.

The Company reassesses the fair value of its contingent consideration liabilities on a quarterly basis and records any fair value adjustments to earnings in the period that they are determined.
The fair value of the contingent consideration was determined using a probabilistic Black-Scholes pricing model calibrated to the expected revenue forecast to be generated from the acquired business over a one-year period.
There were no changes to the fair value of the Level 3 liabilities during the three and six months ended March 29, 2019.
The Company’s non-financial assets and liabilities, such as goodwill, intangible assets, and other long-lived assets resulting from business combinations, are measured at fair value using income approach valuation methodologies at the date of acquisition and are subsequently re-measured if there are indicators of impairment.
