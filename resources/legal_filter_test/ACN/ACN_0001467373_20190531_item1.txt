The accompanying unaudited interim Consolidated Financial Statements of Accenture plc and its controlled subsidiary companies have been prepared pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) for quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and do not include all of the information and note disclosures required by U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“U.S.
GAAP”) for complete financial statements.
We use the terms “Accenture,” “we” and “our” in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements to refer to Accenture plc and its subsidiaries.
These Consolidated Financial Statements should therefore be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes thereto for the fiscal year ended August 31, 2018 included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC on October 24, 2018.
As a result, all of the assets and liabilities of Accenture Holdings plc were acquired by Accenture plc, and Accenture Holdings plc ceased to exist.
As of May 31, 2019 and August 31, 2018, total allowances recorded for client receivables were $49,216 and $49,913, respectively.
Depreciation expense was $109,398 and $322,746 for the three and nine months ended May 31, 2019, respectively, and $101,814 and $315,410 for the three and nine months ended May 31, 2018, respectively.
As of May 31, 2019 and August 31, 2018, total accumulated depreciation was $2,074,736 and $1,862,098, respectively.
Deferred transition amortization expense was $67,225 and $204,313 for the three and nine months ended May 31, 2019, respectively, and $95,696 and $248,838 for the three and nine months ended May 31, 2018, respectively.
See Note 6 (Goodwill and Intangible Assets) to these Consolidated Financial Statements for intangible asset amortization balances.
On September 1, 2018, we adopted FASB ASU No.
2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606), which replaced most existing revenue recognition guidance.
The core principle of Topic 606 is that an entity should recognize revenue for the transfer of goods or services equal to the amount that it expects to be entitled to receive for those goods or services.
Topic 606 has been applied to contracts that were not completed as of September 1, 2018.
Results for reporting periods beginning after September 1, 2018 are presented under Topic 606, while prior period amounts are not adjusted and continue to be reported in accordance with our historic accounting.
See Note 2 (Revenues) to these Consolidated Financial Statements for further details.
In connection with the adoption of Topic 606, we are now presenting total revenues and no longer reporting revenues before reimbursements.
Prior period results have been revised to reflect this change in presentation.
The impact of adopting the new standard was not material to our Consolidated Financial Statements.
Upon adoption, we recorded a decrease to retained earnings of $6,451, net of a tax impact of $3,071, as of September 1, 2018.
The impact of adopting the new standard for the three and nine months ended May 31, 2019 was an increase to revenues of approximately $35.8 million and $54.5 million, respectively.
The impact on our balance sheet as of May 31, 2019 was not material with the exception of the classification of $2.4 billion of receivables and $589.6 million of contract assets, which were previously classified as Unbilled services, net.
We account for revenue in accordance with Topic 606, which we adopted on September 1, 2018 using the modified retrospective method.
A performance obligation is a promise in a contract to transfer a distinct good or service to the client and is the unit of accounting in Topic 606.
A contract’s transaction price is allocated to each distinct performance obligation and recognized as revenue when, or as, the performance obligation is satisfied.
For contracts with multiple performance obligations, we allocate the contract’s transaction price to each performance obligation based on the relative standalone selling price.
While determining relative standalone selling price and identifying separate performance obligations require judgment, generally relative standalone selling prices and the separate performance obligations are readily identifiable as we sell those performance obligations unaccompanied by other performance obligations.
Contract modifications are routine in the performance of our contracts.
Contracts are often modified to account for changes in the contract specifications, requirements or duration.
If a contract modification results in the addition of performance obligations priced at a standalone selling price or if the post-modification services are distinct from the services provided prior to the modification, the modification is accounted for separately.
If the modified services are not distinct, they are accounted for as part of the existing contract.
Our revenues are derived from contracts for outsourcing services, technology integration consulting services and non-technology consulting services.
We have many types of contracts, including time-and-materials contracts, fixed-price contracts, fee-per-transaction contracts and contracts with multiple fee types.
The nature of our contracts gives rise to several types of variable consideration, including incentive fees.
We include these variable fees in the estimated transaction price when there is a basis to reasonably estimate the amount of the fee and it is not probable a significant reversal of revenue will occur.
The selection of the method to measure progress towards completion requires judgment and is based on the contract and the nature of the services to be provided.
Revenues are generally recognized on outsourcing contracts over time because our clients benefit from the services as they are performed.
Outsourcing contracts require us to provide a series of distinct services each period over the contract term.
Revenues from unit-priced contracts are recognized as transactions are processed.
When contractual billings represent an amount that corresponds directly with the value provided to the client (e.g., time-and-materials contracts), revenues are recognized as amounts become billable in accordance with contract terms.
Our contracts for non-technology integration consulting services are typically less than a year in duration.
Revenues are generally recognized over time as our clients benefit from the services as they are performed, or the contract includes termination provisions enabling payment for performance completed to date.
When contractual billings represent an amount that corresponds directly with the value provided to the client (e.g.
time-and-materials contracts), revenues are recognized as amounts become billable in accordance with contract terms.
Revenues from fixed-price contracts are generally recognized using costs incurred to date relative to total estimated costs at completion to measure progress toward satisfying our performance obligations.
Incurred cost represents work performed, which corresponds with, and thereby best depicts, the transfer of control to the client.
On May 31, 2019, we had approximately $18 billion of remaining performance obligations.
The majority of our contracts are terminable by the client on short notice with little or no termination penalties, and some without notice.
Under Topic 606, only the non-cancelable portion of these contracts is included in our performance obligations.
Based on the terms of our contracts, a significant portion of what we consider contract bookings is not included in our remaining performance obligations.
See Note 11 (Segment Reporting) to these Consolidated Financial Statements for our disaggregated revenues.
Adjustments in contract estimates related to performance obligations satisfied or partially satisfied in prior periods increased our revenues by approximately $16 million and decreased our revenues by approximately $13 million for the three and nine months ended May 31, 2019, respectively.
No adjustment on any one contract was material to our Consolidated Financial Statements for the three and nine months ended May 31, 2019.
Amounts are billed as work progresses in accordance with agreed-upon contractual terms, either at periodic intervals (e.g., monthly or quarterly) or upon achievement of contractual milestones.
When we bill or receive payments from our clients before revenue is recognized, we record Contract liabilities.
Contract assets and liabilities are reported on our Consolidated Balance Sheet on a contract-by-contract basis at the end of each reporting period.
For some outsourcing contracts, we receive payments for transition or set-up activities, which are deferred and recognized as revenue as the services are provided.
These advance payments are typically not a significant financing component because they are used to meet working capital demands in the early stages of a contract and to protect us from the other party failing to complete its obligations under the contract.
Deferred transition revenues were $570,310 and $581,395 as of May 31, 2019 and August 31, 2018, respectively, and are included in Non-current deferred revenues.
Costs related to these activities are also deferred and are expensed as the services are provided.
Generally, deferred amounts are protected in the event of early termination of the contract and are monitored regularly for impairment.
Impairment losses are recorded when projected remaining undiscounted operating cash flows of the related contract are not sufficient to recover the carrying amount of contract assets.
Deferred transition costs were $685,605 and $690,868 as of May 31, 2019 and August 31, 2018, respectively, and are included in Deferred contract costs.
Revenues recognized during the three and nine months ended May 31, 2019 that were included in Deferred revenues as of February 28, 2019 and September 1, 2018 were $1.7 billion and $2.7 billion, respectively.
During the nine months ended May 31, 2019, we completed individually immaterial acquisitions for total consideration of $1,034,730, net of cash acquired.
Goodwill includes immaterial adjustments related to prior period acquisitions.
The payment of the cash dividends also resulted in the issuance of an immaterial number of additional restricted share units to holders of restricted share units.
In the normal course of business, we use derivative financial instruments to manage foreign currency exchange rate risk.
Our derivative financial instruments consist of deliverable and non-deliverable foreign currency forward contracts.
For a cash flow hedge, the effective portion of the change in estimated fair value of a hedging instrument is recorded in Accumulated other comprehensive loss as a separate component of Shareholders’ Equity and is reclassified into Cost of services in the Consolidated Income Statements during the period in which the hedged transaction is recognized.
For information related to derivatives designated as cash flow hedges that were reclassified into Cost of services during the three and nine months ended May 31, 2019 and 2018, as well as those expected to be reclassified into Cost of services in the next 12 months, see Note 4 (Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss) to these Consolidated Financial Statements.
Realized gains or losses and changes in the estimated fair value of foreign currency forward contracts that have not been designated as hedges were net losses of $10,319 and $88,247 for the three and nine months ended May 31, 2019, respectively, and net losses of $84,480 and $37,698 for the three and nine months ended May 31, 2018, respectively.
We hold investments in equity securities that do not have readily determinable fair values.
The carrying amount of these investments was $125,724 as of May 31, 2019.
2016-01, these investments were accounted for under the cost method.
For additional information, see Note 1 (Basis of Presentation) to these Consolidated Financial Statements.
In the three months ended February 28, 2018, we recognized tax expense of $136,724, primarily to remeasure our net deferred tax assets at the new, lower rates.
In addition, we recognize taxes related to unusual or infrequent items or resulting from a change in judgment regarding a position taken in a prior year as discrete items in the interim period in which the event occurs.
Our effective tax rates for the three months ended May 31, 2019 and 2018 were 25.6% and 34.4%, respectively.
Our effective tax rates for the nine months ended May 31, 2019 and 2018 were 21.1% and 27.2%, respectively.
The effective tax rate for the three months ended May 31, 2019 was lower primarily due to changes in prior year tax liabilities and the geographic distribution of earnings, partially offset by higher expense from the adoption of FASB ASU No.
The effective tax rate for the nine months ended May 31, 2019 was lower primarily due to higher benefits from final determinations of prior year taxes, changes in the geographic distribution of earnings and adjustments to prior year tax liabilities.
These decreases were partially offset by higher expense from the adoption of FASB ASU No.
2016-16 and lower tax benefits from share-based payments.
For additional information, see Note 1 (Basis of Presentation) to these Consolidated Financial Statements.
In the normal course of business and in conjunction with certain client engagements, we have entered into contractual arrangements through which we may be obligated to indemnify clients with respect to certain matters.
For arrangements with unspecified limitations, we cannot reasonably estimate the aggregate maximum potential liability, as it is inherently difficult to predict the maximum potential amount of such payments, due to the conditional nature and unique facts of each particular arrangement.
The information set forth under “Legal Contingencies” in Note 10 (Commitments and Contingencies) to our Consolidated Financial Statements under Part I, Item 1, “Financial Statements,” is incorporated herein by reference.
