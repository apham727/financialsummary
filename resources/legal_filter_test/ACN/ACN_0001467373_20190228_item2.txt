We use the terms “Accenture,” “we,” “our” and “us” in this report to refer to Accenture plc and its subsidiaries. All references to years, unless otherwise noted, refer to our fiscal year, which ends on August 31. For example, a reference to “fiscal 2019” means the 12-month period that will end on August 31, 2019. All references to quarters, unless otherwise noted, refer to the quarters of our fiscal year. 
We use the term “in local currency” so that certain financial results may be viewed without the impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, thereby facilitating period-to-period comparisons of business performance. Financial results “in local currency” are calculated by restating current period activity into U.S. dollars using the comparable prior year period’s foreign currency exchange rates. This approach is used for all results where the functional currency is not the U.S. dollar. 
•Our results of operations could be materially adversely affected by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. 
•Our work with government clients exposes us to additional risks inherent in the government contracting environment. 
•If we are unable to manage the organizational challenges associated with our size, we might be unable to achieve our business objectives. 
•We might be unable to access additional capital on favorable terms or at all. If we raise equity capital, it may dilute our shareholders’ ownership interest in us. 
•Irish law differs from the laws in effect in the United States and might afford less protection to shareholders. 
Revenues are driven by the ability of our executives to secure new contracts and to deliver services and solutions that add value relevant to our clients’ current needs and challenges. The level of revenues we achieve is based on our ability to deliver market-leading services and solutions and to deploy skilled teams of professionals quickly and on a global basis. 
Effective September 1, 2018, we adopted Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606). In connection with the adoption, we present total revenues and no longer report revenues before reimbursements (net revenues). This change has no impact on operating income but does affect ratios calculated as a percentage of revenue, such as operating margin. Prior period results have been revised to reflect the fiscal 2019 presentation. For additional information, see Note 1 (Basis of Presentation) to our Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 1, “Financial Statements.” 
As we are a global company, our revenues are denominated in multiple currencies and may be significantly affected by currency exchange rate fluctuations. If the U.S. dollar weakens against other currencies, resulting in 
favorable currency translation, our revenues, revenue growth and results of operations in U.S. dollars may be higher. If the U.S. dollar strengthens against other currencies, resulting in unfavorable currency translation, our revenues, revenue growth and results of operations in U.S. dollars may be lower. The U.S. dollar strengthened against various currencies during the three and six months ended February 28, 2019 compared to the three and six months ended February 28, 2018, resulting in unfavorable currency translation and U.S. dollar revenue growth that was approximately 4% and 3% lower, respectively, than our revenue growth in local currency. Assuming that exchange rates stay within recent ranges for the remainder of fiscal 2019, we estimate that our full fiscal 2019 revenue growth in U.S. dollars will be approximately 3% lower in U.S. dollars than our revenue growth in local currency.
Effective September 1, 2018, we adopted ASU No. 2017-07, Compensation—Retirement Benefits (Topic 715), which required us to reclassify certain components of pension costs from operating expenses to non-operating expenses. Prior period results have been revised to reflect the fiscal 2019 presentation. For additional information, see Note 1 (Basis of Presentation) to our Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 1, “Financial Statements.” 
Gross margin (Revenues less Cost of services as a percentage of Revenues) for the second quarter of fiscal 2019 was 29.2%, compared with 28.9% for the second quarter of fiscal 2018. Gross margin for the six months ended February 28, 2019 was 30.2% compared with 29.9% for the six months ended February 28, 2018. The increase in gross margin for the second quarter of fiscal 2019 was primarily due to lower labor costs, compared to the second quarter of fiscal 2018. The increase in gross margin for the six months ended February 28, 2019 was primarily due to lower non-payroll costs, compared to the same period in fiscal 2018.
Sales and marketing and General and administrative costs as a percentage of revenues were 16.0% for the second quarter of fiscal 2019 and 15.8% for the six months ended February 28, 2019, compared with 15.8% for both the second quarter of fiscal 2018 and six months ended February 28, 2018. We continuously monitor these costs and implement cost-management actions, as appropriate. For the second quarter of fiscal 2019 compared to the same period in fiscal 2018, Sales and marketing costs as a percentage of revenues decreased 30 basis points, primarily due to improved operational efficiency in our business development activities and General and administrative costs as a percentage of revenues increased 50 basis points, primarily due to the recognition of share-based compensation upon the previously disclosed vesting and settlement of our former chairman and chief executive officer’s restricted share units in connection with his resignation for health reasons during the second quarter of fiscal 2019. For the six months ended February 28, 2019 compared to the same period in fiscal 2018, Sales and marketing costs as a percentage of revenues decreased 20 basis points, and General and administrative costs as a percentage of revenues increased 20 basis points.
The effective tax rates for the three and six months ended February 28, 2019 were 17.1% and 18.6%, respectively. The effective tax rates for the three and six months ended February 28, 2018 were 26.1% and 23.0%, respectively. In the second quarter of fiscal 2018, we recorded a $137 million tax charge associated with the enactment of the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the “Tax Act”). Absent this charge, our effective tax rates for the three and six months ended February 28, 2018 would have been 15.1% and 18.0%, respectively. For additional information see Note 9 (Income Taxes) to our Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 1, “Financial Statements”.

Cost of services for the second quarter of fiscal 2019 increased $350 million, or 5%, over the second quarter of fiscal 2018, and decreased as a percentage of revenues to 70.8% from 71.1% during this period. Gross margin for the second quarter of fiscal 2019 increased to 29.2% from 28.9% during the second quarter of fiscal 2018.The increase in gross margin was primarily due to lower labor costs compared to the same period in fiscal 2018.
Sales and marketing expense for the second quarter of fiscal 2019 increased $21 million, or 2%, over the second quarter of fiscal 2018, and decreased as a percentage of revenues to 9.8% from 10.1% during this period. The decrease as a percentage of revenues was primarily due to improved operational efficiency in our business development activities compared to the same period in fiscal 2018. 
General and administrative costs for the second quarter of fiscal 2019 increased $83 million, or 15%, over the second quarter of fiscal 2018, and increased as a percentage of revenues to 6.2% from 5.7% during this period. The increase as a percentage of revenues was primarily due to higher share-based compensation as discussed in the Overview. 
Operating income for the second quarter of fiscal 2019 increased $91 million, or 7%, over the second quarter of fiscal 2018. 
Amounts in table may not total due to rounding. 
•Financial Services operating income decreased as higher consulting contract profitability and revenue growth were offset by higher operating expenses as a percentage of revenues.
•Products operating income was relatively flat year-over-year as revenue growth and higher consulting contract profitability were offset by higher operating expenses as a percentage of revenues.
•Resources operating income increased primarily due to revenue growth and higher contract profitability.
Other income (expense), net primarily consists of foreign currency gains and losses, non-operating components of pension expense, as well as gains and losses associated with our investments in privately held companies. For the second quarter of fiscal 2019, other expense decreased $33 million from the second quarter of fiscal 2018, primarily due to lower net foreign exchange losses. 
The effective tax rate for the second quarter of fiscal 2019 was 17.1%, compared with 26.1% for the second quarter of fiscal 2018. In the second quarter of fiscal 2018, we recorded a $137 million tax charge associated with the enactment of the Tax Act. Absent this charge, our effective tax rate for the second quarter of fiscal 2018 would have been 15.1%. The higher effective tax rate for the three months ended February 28, 2019 was primarily due to lower tax benefits from share-based payments and higher expense from the adoption of FASB ASU No. 2016-16, partially offset by a decrease in prior year tax liabilities. For additional information, see Note 1 (Basis of Presentation) to our Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 1, “Financial Statements.” 
Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests for the second quarter of fiscal 2019 decreased $40 million, or 71%, from the second quarter of fiscal 2018 due to the decrease in the non-controlling ownership percentage from 4% held by Accenture Holdings plc and Accenture Canada Holdings Inc. to less than 1% held by only Accenture Canada Holdings Inc. driven by the Accenture Holdings plc merger with and into Accenture plc. For additional information on the merger, see Note 1 (Basis of Presentation) to our Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 1, “Financial Statements”. 
Diluted earnings per share were $1.73 for the second quarter of fiscal 2019, compared with $1.37 for the second quarter of fiscal 2018. The $0.36 increase in our diluted earnings per share included the impact of the $137 million tax charge associated with the Tax Act, which decreased diluted earnings per share for the second quarter of fiscal 2018 by $0.21. Excluding the impact of this charge, diluted earnings per share for the second quarter of fiscal 2019 increased $0.15 compared with the second quarter of fiscal 2018, due to an increase of $0.12 from higher revenues and operating results, $0.05 from lower non-operating expense and $0.02 from lower weighted average shares outstanding. These increases were partially offset by a decrease of $0.04 from a higher effective tax rate. For information regarding our earnings per share calculations, see Note 3 (Earnings Per Share) to our Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 1, “Financial Statements.”

We believe that our current and longer-term working capital, investments and other general corporate funding requirements will be satisfied for the next twelve months and thereafter through cash flows from operations and, to the extent necessary, from our borrowing facilities and future financial market activities. 
Substantially all of our cash is held in jurisdictions where there are no regulatory restrictions or material tax effects on the free flow of funds. Domestic cash inflows for our Irish parent, principally dividend distributions from lower-tier subsidiaries, have been sufficient to meet our historic cash requirements, and we expect this to continue into the future. 
The Board of Directors of Accenture plc has authorized funding for our publicly announced open-market share purchase program for acquiring Accenture plc Class A ordinary shares and for purchases and redemptions of Accenture plc Class A ordinary shares and Accenture Canada Holdings Inc. exchangeable shares held by current and former members of Accenture Leadership and their permitted transferees. 
In the normal course of business and in conjunction with some client engagements, we have entered into contractual arrangements through which we may be obligated to indemnify clients with respect to certain matters. 
To date, we have not been required to make any significant payment under any of the arrangements described above. For further discussion of these transactions, see Note 10 (Commitments and Contingencies) to our Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 1, “Financial Statements.” 
See Note 1 (Basis of Presentation) and Note 2 (Revenues) to our Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 1, “Financial Statements.” Note 2 includes updates to our revenue policy as result of the implementation of FASB ASU No. 2014-09.
The following table provides information relating to our purchases of Accenture plc Class A ordinary shares during the second quarter of fiscal 2019.
