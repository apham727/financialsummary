•Our work with government clients exposes us to additional risks inherent in the government contracting environment.
•If we are unable to manage the organizational challenges associated with our size, we might be unable to achieve our business objectives.
We may also be subject to criticism and negative publicity related to our incorporation in Ireland.
•Irish law differs from the laws in effect in the United States and might afford less protection to shareholders.
Revenues are driven by the ability of our executives to secure new contracts and to deliver services and solutions that add value relevant to our clients’ current needs and challenges.
The level of revenues we achieve is based on our ability to deliver market-leading services and solutions and to deploy skilled teams of professionals quickly and on a global basis.
There also continues to be volatility in foreign currency exchange rates.
The majority of our revenues are denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar, including the Euro, U.K. pound and Japanese yen.
Effective January 10, 2019, the Board of Directors appointed David Rowland, who was serving as our chief financial officer, as the interim chief executive officer and a director of Accenture, and KC McClure, who was serving as our managing director—Finance Operations, as our chief financial officer, and named our lead independent director, Marge Magner, as the non-executive chair of the board.
We subsequently announced the passing of Mr. Nanterme on January 31, 2019.
In connection with the adoption, we present total revenues and no longer report revenues before reimbursements (net revenues).
This change has no impact on operating income but does affect ratios calculated as a percentage of revenue, such as operating margin.
Prior period results have been revised to reflect the fiscal 2019 presentation.

If the U.S. dollar weakens against other currencies, resulting in
favorable currency translation, our revenues, revenue growth and results of operations in U.S. dollars may be higher.
If the U.S. dollar strengthens against other currencies, resulting in unfavorable currency translation, our revenues, revenue growth and results of operations in U.S. dollars may be lower.
The U.S. dollar strengthened against various currencies during the three and six months ended February 28, 2019 compared to the three and six months ended February 28, 2018, resulting in unfavorable currency translation and U.S. dollar revenue growth that was approximately 4% and 3% lower, respectively, than our revenue growth in local currency.
Assuming that exchange rates stay within recent ranges for the remainder of fiscal 2019, we estimate that our full fiscal 2019 revenue growth in U.S. dollars will be approximately 3% lower in U.S. dollars than our revenue growth in local currency.

The increase in gross margin for the second quarter of fiscal 2019 was primarily due to lower labor costs, compared to the second quarter of fiscal 2018.
