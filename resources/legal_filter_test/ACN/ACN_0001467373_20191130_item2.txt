All references to years, unless otherwise noted, refer to our fiscal year, which ends on August 31.
For example, a reference to “fiscal 2020” means the 12-month period that will end on August 31, 2020.
All references to quarters, unless otherwise noted, refer to the quarters of our fiscal year.
We use the term “in local currency” so that certain financial results may be viewed without the impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, thereby facilitating period-to-period comparisons of business performance.
Financial results “in local currency” are calculated by restating current period activity into U.S. dollars using the comparable prior year period’s foreign currency exchange rates.
Forward-looking statements are based upon assumptions as to future events that may not prove to be accurate.
•Our business depends on generating and maintaining ongoing, profitable client demand for our services and solutions, including through the adaptation and expansion of our services and solutions in response to ongoing changes in technology and offerings, and a significant reduction in such demand or an inability to respond to the evolving technological environment could materially affect our results of operations.
•If we are unable to keep our supply of skills and resources in balance with client demand around the world and attract and retain professionals with strong leadership skills, our business, the utilization rate of our professionals and our results of operations may be materially adversely affected.
•Our results of operations could be materially adversely affected by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates.
•As a result of our geographically diverse operations and our growth strategy to continue to expand in our key markets around the world, we are more susceptible to certain risks.
•Our work with government clients exposes us to additional risks inherent in the government contracting environment.
•If we are unable to manage the organizational challenges associated with our size, we might be unable to achieve our business objectives.
•Our ability to attract and retain business and employees may depend on our reputation in the marketplace.
•If we do not successfully manage and develop our relationships with key alliance partners or if we fail to anticipate and establish new alliances in new technologies, our results of operations could be adversely affected.
•Many of our contracts include fees subject to the attainment of targets or specific service levels.
If we raise equity capital, it may dilute our shareholders’ ownership interest in us.
We may also be subject to criticism and negative publicity related to our incorporation in Ireland.
•Irish law differs from the laws in effect in the United States and might afford less protection to shareholders.
Revenues are driven by the ability of our executives to secure new contracts, to renew and extend existing contracts, and to deliver services and solutions that add value relevant to our clients’ current needs and challenges.
The level of revenues we achieve is based on our ability to deliver market-leading services and solutions and to deploy skilled teams of professionals quickly and on a global basis.
There also continues to be volatility in foreign currency exchange rates.
The majority of our revenues are denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar, including the Euro, Japanese yen and U.K. pound.
If the U.S. dollar weakens against other currencies, resulting in favorable currency translation, our revenues, revenue growth and results of operations in U.S. dollars may be higher.
If the U.S. dollar strengthens against other currencies, resulting in unfavorable currency translation, our revenues, revenue growth and results of operations in U.S. dollars may be lower.
The U.S. dollar strengthened against various currencies during the first quarter of fiscal 2020 compared to the first quarter of fiscal 2019, resulting in unfavorable currency translation and U.S. dollar revenue growth that was approximately 2% lower than our revenue growth in local currency.
Assuming that exchange rates stay within recent ranges for the remainder of fiscal 2020, we estimate that our full fiscal 2020 revenue growth in U.S. dollars will be approximately 1% lower in U.S. dollars than our revenue growth in local currency.
Gross margin (Revenues less Cost of services as a percentage of Revenues) for the first quarter of fiscal 2020 was 32.1%, compared with 31.1% for the first quarter of fiscal 2019.
The increase in gross margin for the first quarter of fiscal 2020 was primarily due to lower labor costs as a percentage of revenues compared to the same period in fiscal 2019.
Sales and marketing and General and administrative costs as a percentage of revenues were 16.6% for the first quarter of fiscal 2020, compared with 15.7% for the first quarter of fiscal 2019.
For the first quarter of fiscal 2020 compared to the same period in fiscal 2019, Sales and marketing costs as a percentage of revenues increased 40 basis points, primarily due to higher selling and other business development costs, and General and administrative costs as a percentage of revenues increased 50 basis points, primarily due to higher technology and facilities costs.
We continuously monitor these costs and implement cost-management actions, as appropriate.
Operating margin (Operating income as a percentage of revenues) for the first quarter of fiscal 2020 was 15.6%, compared with 15.4% for the first quarter of fiscal 2019.

Sales and marketing expense for the first quarter of fiscal 2020 increased $121 million, or 11%, over the first quarter of fiscal 2019, and increased as a percentage of revenues to 10.5% from 10.1% during this period.
The increase as a percentage of revenues was primarily due to higher selling and other business development costs compared to the same period in fiscal 2019.
General and administrative costs for the first quarter of fiscal 2020 increased $91 million, or 15%, over the first quarter of fiscal 2019, and increased as a percentage of revenues to 6.1% from 5.6% during this period.

•Financial Services operating income decreased as revenue growth was offset by lower contract profitability and higher sales and marketing costs as a percentage of revenues.
•Products operating income increased primarily due to revenue growth and higher consulting contract profitability.
•Resources operating income increased primarily due to revenue growth and higher outsourcing contract profitability.
Other income (expense), net primarily consists of foreign currency gains and losses, non-operating components of pension expense, as well as gains and losses associated with our investments.
For the first quarter of fiscal 2020, other income (expense) increased $45 million over the first quarter of fiscal 2019, primarily due to gains on investments, partially offset by foreign exchange losses.
The higher effective tax rate for the three months ended November 30, 2019 was primarily due to lower benefits from final determinations of prior year taxes and the phased-in effects of US tax reform.
For additional information, see Note 1 (Basis of Presentation) to our Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 1, “Financial Statements.”
We expect the fiscal 2020 annual effective tax rate to be in the range of 23.5% to 25.5%.
The effective tax rate for interim periods can vary because of the timing of when certain events occur during the year.
The $0.13 increase in our diluted earnings per share was due to an increase of $0.17 from higher revenues and operating results, $0.06 from higher non-operating income, and $0.01 from lower weighted average shares outstanding.
These increases were partially offset by a decrease of $0.11 from a higher effective tax rate.
For information regarding our earnings per share calculations, see Note 3 (Earnings Per Share) to our Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 1, “Financial Statements.”
Amounts in table may not total due to rounding.
We believe that our current and longer-term working capital, investments and other general corporate funding requirements will be satisfied for the next twelve months and thereafter through cash flows from operations and, to the extent necessary, from our borrowing facilities and future financial market activities.
Substantially all of our cash is held in jurisdictions where there are no regulatory restrictions or material tax effects on the free flow of funds.
Domestic cash inflows for our Irish parent, principally dividend distributions from lower-tier subsidiaries, have been sufficient to meet our historic cash requirements, and we expect this to continue into the future.
