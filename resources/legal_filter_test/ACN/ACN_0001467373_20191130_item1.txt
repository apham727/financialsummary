The accompanying unaudited interim Consolidated Financial Statements of Accenture plc and its controlled subsidiary companies have been prepared pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) for quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and do not include all of the information and note disclosures required by U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“U.S.
GAAP”) for complete financial statements.
We use the terms “Accenture,” “we” and “our” in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements to refer to Accenture plc and its subsidiaries.

On September 1, 2019, we adopted FASB ASU No.
Enhanced quantitative and qualitative disclosures about leasing arrangements are also required.
We elected the package of practical expedients which does not require reassessment of prior conclusions related to identifying leases, lease classification or initial direct costs.

See Note 7 (Leases) to these Consolidated Financial Statements for further details.
See Note 12 (Segment Reporting) to these Consolidated Financial Statements for our disaggregated revenues.
We had remaining performance obligations of approximately $19 billion and $20 billion as of November 30, 2019 and August 31, 2019, respectively.
The majority of our contracts are terminable by the client on short notice with little or no termination penalties, and some without notice.
Under Topic 606, only the non-cancelable portion of these contracts is included in our performance obligations.
Adjustments in contract estimates related to performance obligations satisfied or partially satisfied in prior periods were immaterial for the three months ended November 30, 2019 and 2018, respectively.
Deferred transition revenues were $583,531 and $563,245 as of November 30, 2019 and August 31, 2019, respectively, and are included in Non-current deferred revenues.
Costs related to these activities are also deferred and are expensed as the services are provided.
Generally, deferred amounts are protected in the event of early termination of the contract and are monitored regularly for impairment.
Impairment losses are recorded when projected remaining undiscounted operating cash flows of the related contract are not sufficient to recover the carrying amount of contract assets.
Deferred transition costs were $691,727 and $681,492 as of November 30, 2019 and August 31, 2019, respectively, and are included in Deferred contract costs.
Revenues recognized during the three months ended November 30, 2019 that were included in Deferred revenues as of August 31, 2019 were $1.8 billion.
Revenues recognized during the three months ended November 30, 2018 that were included in Deferred revenues as of September 1, 2018 were $1.8 billion.
During the three months ended November 30, 2019, we completed individually immaterial acquisitions for total consideration of $97,028, net of cash acquired.
Goodwill includes immaterial adjustments related to prior period acquisitions.
We account for leases in accordance with Topic 842.
See Note 1 (Basis of Presentation) to these Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on our adoption.
As a lessee, substantially all of our lease obligation is for office real estate.
Our leases may include the option to extend or terminate before the end of the contractual term and are often non-cancelable or cancelable only by the payment of penalties.
Our lease assets and liabilities include these options in the lease term when it is reasonably certain that they will be exercised.
In certain cases, we sublease excess office real estate to third-party tenants.
Unless the implicit rate can be determined, we use our incremental borrowing rate on that date to calculate the present value.
Our incremental borrowing rate approximates the rate at which we could borrow, on a secured basis for a similar term, an amount equal to our lease payments in a similar economic environment.
Effective September 1, 2019, when we are the lessee, all leases are recognized as lease liabilities and associated lease assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheet.
Lease liabilities represent our obligation to make payments arising from the lease.
Lease assets represent our right to use an underlying asset for the lease term and may also include advance payments, initial direct costs or lease incentives.
Fixed and variable payments that depend upon an index or rate, such as the Consumer Price Index (CPI), are included in the recognition of lease assets and liabilities at the commencement-date rate.
As of November 30, 2019, our operating leases had a weighted average remaining lease term of 7.4 years and a weighted average discount rate of 4.2%.
As of November 30, 2019, we have entered into operating leases that have not yet commenced with future lease payments of $430 million that are not reflected in the table above.
These leases are primarily related to office real estate and will commence in or before fiscal year 2022 with lease terms of up to 17 years.
The payment of the cash dividends also resulted in the issuance of an immaterial number of additional restricted share units to holders of restricted share units.
On December 16, 2019, the Board of Directors of Accenture plc declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.80 per share on its Class A ordinary shares for shareholders of record at the close of business on January 16, 2020 payable on February 14, 2020.
In the normal course of business, we use derivative financial instruments to manage foreign currency exchange rate risk.
Our derivative financial instruments consist of deliverable and non-deliverable foreign currency forward contracts.
For a cash flow hedge, the effective portion of the change in estimated fair value of a hedging instrument is recorded in Accumulated other comprehensive loss as a separate component of Shareholders’ Equity and is reclassified into Cost of services in the Consolidated Income Statements during the period in which the hedged transaction is recognized.
For information related to derivatives designated as cash flow hedges that were reclassified into Cost of services during the three months ended November 30, 2019 and 2018, as well as those expected to be reclassified into Cost of services in the next 12 months, see Note 4 (Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss) to these Consolidated Financial Statements.
Realized gains or losses and changes in the estimated fair value of foreign currency forward contracts that have not been designated as hedges were net losses of $56,619 and $48,983 for the three months ended November 30, 2019 and 2018, respectively.
We hold investments in equity securities that do not have readily determinable fair values.
The carrying amount of these investments was $149,525 and $131,675 as of November 30, 2019 and August 31, 2019, respectively.
In addition, we recognize taxes related to unusual or infrequent items or resulting from a change in judgment regarding a position taken in a prior year as discrete items in the interim period in which the event occurs.
Our effective tax rates for the three months ended November 30, 2019 and 2018 were 23.6% and 19.8%, respectively.
In the normal course of business and in conjunction with certain client engagements, we have entered into contractual arrangements through which we may be obligated to indemnify clients with respect to certain matters.
For arrangements with unspecified limitations, we cannot reasonably estimate the aggregate maximum potential liability, as it is inherently difficult to predict the maximum potential amount of such payments, due to the conditional nature and unique facts of each particular arrangement.
On July 24, 2019, Accenture was named in a putative class action lawsuit filed by consumers of Marriott International, Inc. (“Marriott”) in the U.S. District Court for the District of Maryland.
Since 2009, we have provided certain IT infrastructure outsourcing services to Starwood.
We cannot reasonably estimate a range of loss, if any, at this time.
Effective September 1, 2019 we revised the reporting of our geographic regions for the movement of one country from Growth Markets to Europe.
Prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform with the current period presentation.
