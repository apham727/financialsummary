We use the terms “Accenture,” “we,” “our” and “us” in this report to refer to Accenture plc and its subsidiaries. All references to years, unless otherwise noted, refer to our fiscal year, which ends on August 31. For example, a reference to “fiscal 2018” means the 12-month period that will end on August 31, 2018. All references to quarters, unless otherwise noted, refer to the quarters of our fiscal year.
We use the term “in local currency” so that certain financial results may be viewed without the impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, thereby facilitating period-to-period comparisons of business performance. Financial results “in local currency” are calculated by restating current period activity into U.S. dollars using the comparable prior year period’s foreign currency exchange rates. This approach is used for all results where the functional currency is not the U.S. dollar.
•Our results of operations could be materially adversely affected by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates.
•Our work with government clients exposes us to additional risks inherent in the government contracting environment.
•Our global delivery capability is increasingly concentrated in India and the Philippines, which may expose us to operational risks.
•As a result of our geographically diverse operations and our growth strategy to continue geographic expansion, we are more susceptible to certain risks.
•Adverse changes to our relationships with key alliance partners or in the business of our key alliance partners could adversely affect our results of operations.
•Our ability to attract and retain business and employees may depend on our reputation in the marketplace.
•If we are unable to manage the organizational challenges associated with our size, we might be unable to achieve our business objectives.
•We might be unable to access additional capital on favorable terms or at all. If we raise equity capital, it may dilute our shareholders’ ownership interest in us.
•Irish law differs from the laws in effect in the United States and might afford less protection to shareholders.
Revenues are driven by the ability of our executives to secure new contracts and to deliver services and solutions that add value relevant to our clients’ current needs and challenges. The level of revenues we achieve is based on our ability to deliver market-leading services and solutions and to deploy skilled teams of professionals quickly and on a global basis. 
As we are a global company, our revenues are denominated in multiple currencies and may be significantly affected by currency exchange rate fluctuations. If the U.S. dollar weakens against other currencies, resulting in favorable currency translation, our revenues, revenue growth and results of operations in U.S. dollars may be higher. If the U.S. dollar strengthens against other currencies, resulting in unfavorable currency translation, our revenues, revenue growth and results of operations in U.S. dollars may be lower. The U.S. dollar weakened against various currencies during the three and nine months ended May 31, 2018 compared to the three and nine months ended May 31, 2017, resulting in favorable currency translation and U.S. dollar revenue growth that was approximately 5% and 4% higher, respectively, than our revenue growth in local currency. Assuming that exchange rates stay within recent ranges for the remainder of fiscal 2018, we estimate that our full fiscal 2018 revenue growth in U.S. dollars will be approximately 3.0% higher in U.S. dollars than our revenue growth in local currency.
and administrative costs primarily include costs for non-client-facing personnel, information systems, office space and certain acquisition-related costs.
Gross margin (Net revenues less Cost of services before reimbursable expenses as a percentage of net revenues) for the third quarter of fiscal 2018 was 32.2%, compared with 32.8% for the third quarter of fiscal 2017. Gross margin for the nine months ended May 31, 2018 was 31.3%, compared with 31.7% for the nine months ended May 31, 2017. The decrease in gross margin for the nine months ended May 31, 2018 was principally due to higher labor costs compared to the same period in fiscal 2017 as well as higher acquisition-related costs, partially offset by other cost efficiencies and improved contract profitability in the third quarter of fiscal 2018.
Sales and marketing and General and administrative costs as a percentage of net revenues were 16.5% for the third quarter of fiscal 2018 and 16.4% for the nine months ended May 31, 2018, compared with 17.3% for the third quarter of fiscal 2017 and 16.7% for the nine months ended May 31, 2017. We continuously monitor these costs and implement cost-management actions, as appropriate. For the third quarter of fiscal 2018 compared to the same period in fiscal 2017, Sales and marketing costs as a percentage of net revenues decreased 40 basis points, principally due to improved operational efficiency in our business development activities, and General and administrative costs as a percentage of net revenues decreased 50 basis points. For the nine months ended May 31, 2018 compared to the same period in fiscal 2017, Sales and marketing and General and administrative costs as a percentage of net revenues each decreased 10 basis points.
During the third quarter of fiscal 2017, we recorded a $510 million pension settlement charge and related $198 million reduction in taxes for the U.S. pension plan termination. For additional information, see Note 8 (Retirement and Profit Sharing Plans) to our Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 1, “Financial Statements.” 
Operating margin (Operating income as a percentage of net revenues) for the third quarter of fiscal 2018 was 15.7%, compared with 9.8% for the third quarter of fiscal 2017. Operating margin for the nine months ended May 31, 2018 was 14.9%, compared with 13.0% for the nine months ended May 31, 2017. The pension settlement charge decreased operating margin by 570 and 200 basis points for the three and nine months ended May 31, 2017, respectively. Excluding the effect of the pension settlement charge, operating margin for the three and nine months ended May 31, 2017 would have been 15.5% and 15.0%, respectively. 
The effective tax rates for the three and nine months ended May 31, 2018 were 34.4% and 27.2%, respectively. The effective tax rates for the three and nine months ended May 31, 2017 were 19.4% and 20.2%, respectively. For the three and nine months ended May 31, 2018, we recorded a provisional tax charge associated with the enactment of the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the “Tax Act”) of $41 million and $178 million, respectively. Absent these charges and $81 million of expense from a non-U.S. tax law change, our effective tax rate for the three and nine months ended May 31, 2018 would have been 26.8% and 21.3%, respectively. Absent the pension settlement charge and related taxes, our effective tax rates for the three and nine months ended May 31, 2017 would have been 26.6% and 22.7%, respectively. For additional information see Note 9 (Income Taxes) to our Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 1, “Financial Statements”. 
Diluted earnings per share were $1.60 for the third quarter of fiscal 2018, compared with $1.05 for the third quarter of fiscal 2017. Diluted earnings per share were $4.76 for the nine months ended May 31, 2018, compared with $3.96 for the nine months ended May 31, 2017. The impact of tax law changes decreased diluted earnings per share by $0.19 and $0.40 during the three and nine months ended May 31, 2018, respectively. The impact of the pension settlement 
charge, net of taxes, decreased diluted earnings per share by $0.47 in both the three and nine months ended May 31, 2017. Excluding these impacts, diluted earnings per share would have been $1.79 and $1.52 for the third quarter of fiscal 2018 and 2017, respectively and $5.16 and $4.43 for the nine months ended May 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively.

•Financial Services operating income increased primarily due to consulting revenue growth and higher outsourcing contract profitability.
•Products operating income increased primarily due to revenue growth.
Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests for the third quarter of fiscal 2018 decreased $20 million, or 57%, from the third quarter of fiscal 2017 due to the decrease in the non-controlling ownership percentage from 4% held by Accenture Holdings plc and Accenture Canada Holdings Inc. to less than 1% held by only Accenture Canada Holdings Inc. driven by the Accenture Holdings plc merger with and into Accenture plc. 
Diluted earnings per share were $1.60 for the third quarter of fiscal 2018, compared with $1.05 for the third quarter of fiscal 2017. The $0.55 increase in our diluted earnings per share included the impact of tax law changes, which decreased diluted earnings per share for the third quarter of fiscal 2018 by $0.19. The impact of the pension settlement charge, net of taxes, decreased diluted earnings per share by $0.47 for the third quarter of fiscal 2017. Excluding these impacts, diluted earnings per share for the third quarter of fiscal 2018 increased $0.27 compared with the third quarter of fiscal 2017 due to an increase of $0.28 from higher revenues and operating results, $0.01 from lower weighted average shares outstanding and $0.01 from lower net income attributable to other non-controlling interests. These increases were partially offset by decreases of $0.02 from higher non-operating expense and $0.01 from a higher effective tax rate.

We believe that our current and longer-term working capital, investments and other general corporate funding requirements will be satisfied for the next twelve months and thereafter through cash flows from operations and, to the extent necessary, from our borrowing facilities and future financial market activities. 
Substantially all of our cash is held in jurisdictions where there are no regulatory restrictions or material tax effects on the free flow of funds. Domestic cash inflows for our Irish parent, principally dividend distributions from lower-tier subsidiaries, have been sufficient to meet our historic cash requirements, and we expect this to continue into the future. 
The Board of Directors of Accenture plc has authorized funding for our publicly announced open-market share purchase program for acquiring Accenture plc Class A ordinary shares and for purchases and redemptions of Accenture plc Class A ordinary shares and Accenture Canada Holdings Inc. exchangeable shares held by current and former members of Accenture Leadership and their permitted transferees.
For a complete description of all share purchase and redemption activity for the third quarter of fiscal 2018, see Part II, Item 2, “Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds.”

Purchases and Redemptions of Accenture Holdings plc Ordinary Shares and Accenture Canada Holdings Inc. Exchangeable Shares
The following table provides additional information relating to our purchases and redemptions of Accenture Holdings plc ordinary shares and Accenture Canada Holdings Inc. exchangeable shares for cash during the third quarter of fiscal 2018. We believe that the following table and footnotes provide useful information regarding the share purchase and redemption activity of Accenture. Generally, purchases and redemptions of Accenture Canada Holdings Inc. exchangeable shares for cash and employee forfeitures reduce shares outstanding for purposes of computing diluted earnings per share. In connection with the merger of Accenture Holdings plc with and into Accenture plc on March 13, 2018, shareholders of Accenture Holdings plc (other than Accenture plc and Accenture Holdings plc) received one Class A ordinary share of Accenture plc for each share of Accenture Holdings plc that they owned. Accordingly, as of March 13, 2018, there were no longer any ordinary shares of Accenture Holdings plc outstanding.
