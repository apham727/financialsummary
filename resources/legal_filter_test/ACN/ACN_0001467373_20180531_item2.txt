Forward-looking statements are based upon assumptions as to future events that may not prove to be accurate.
•Our work with government clients exposes us to additional risks inherent in the government contracting environment.
•Our global delivery capability is increasingly concentrated in India and the Philippines, which may expose us to operational risks.
•If we are unable to manage the organizational challenges associated with our size, we might be unable to achieve our business objectives.
We may also be subject to criticism and negative publicity related to our incorporation in Ireland.
•Irish law differs from the laws in effect in the United States and might afford less protection to shareholders.
Revenues are driven by the ability of our executives to secure new contracts and to deliver services and solutions that add value relevant to our clients’ current needs and challenges.
The level of revenues we achieve is based on our ability to deliver market-leading services and solutions and to deploy skilled teams of professionals quickly and on a global basis.
There also continues to be volatility in foreign currency exchange rates.
The majority of our net revenues are denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar, including the Euro and the U.K. pound.
If the U.S. dollar weakens against other currencies, resulting in favorable currency translation, our revenues, revenue growth and results of operations in U.S. dollars may be higher.
If the U.S. dollar strengthens against other currencies, resulting in unfavorable currency translation, our revenues, revenue growth and results of operations in U.S. dollars may be lower.
The U.S. dollar weakened against various currencies during the three and nine months ended May 31, 2018 compared to the three and nine months ended May 31, 2017, resulting in favorable currency translation and U.S. dollar revenue growth that was approximately 5% and 4% higher, respectively, than our revenue growth in local currency.
Assuming that exchange rates stay within recent ranges for the remainder of fiscal 2018, we estimate that our full fiscal 2018 revenue growth in U.S. dollars will be approximately 3.0% higher in U.S. dollars than our revenue growth in local currency.
and administrative costs primarily include costs for non-client-facing personnel, information systems, office space and certain acquisition-related costs.
Gross margin (Net revenues less Cost of services before reimbursable expenses as a percentage of net revenues) for the third quarter of fiscal 2018 was 32.2%, compared with 32.8% for the third quarter of fiscal 2017.
Gross margin for the nine months ended May 31, 2018 was 31.3%, compared with 31.7% for the nine months ended May 31, 2017.
The decrease in gross margin for the nine months ended May 31, 2018 was principally due to higher labor costs compared to the same period in fiscal 2017 as well as higher acquisition-related costs, partially offset by other cost efficiencies and improved contract profitability in the third quarter of fiscal 2018.

We continuously monitor these costs and implement cost-management actions, as appropriate.
