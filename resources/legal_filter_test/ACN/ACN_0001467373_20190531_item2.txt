We use the terms “Accenture,” “we,” “our” and “us” in this report to refer to Accenture plc and its subsidiaries. All references to years, unless otherwise noted, refer to our fiscal year, which ends on August 31. For example, a reference to “fiscal 2019” means the 12-month period that will end on August 31, 2019. All references to quarters, unless otherwise noted, refer to the quarters of our fiscal year. 
We use the term “in local currency” so that certain financial results may be viewed without the impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, thereby facilitating period-to-period comparisons of business performance. Financial results “in local currency” are calculated by restating current period activity into U.S. dollars using the comparable prior year period’s foreign currency exchange rates. This approach is used for all results where the functional currency is not the U.S. dollar. 
•Our results of operations could be materially adversely affected by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. 
•As a result of our geographically diverse operations and our growth strategy to continue geographic expansion, we are more susceptible to certain risks.
•Our work with government clients exposes us to additional risks inherent in the government contracting environment. 
•If we are unable to manage the organizational challenges associated with our size, we might be unable to achieve our business objectives. 
•We might be unable to access additional capital on favorable terms or at all. If we raise equity capital, it may dilute our shareholders’ ownership interest in us. 
•Irish law differs from the laws in effect in the United States and might afford less protection to shareholders. 
Revenues are driven by the ability of our executives to secure new contracts and to deliver services and solutions that add value relevant to our clients’ current needs and challenges. The level of revenues we achieve is based on our ability to deliver market-leading services and solutions and to deploy skilled teams of professionals quickly and on a global basis. 
Effective September 1, 2018, we adopted Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606). In connection with the adoption, we present total revenues and no longer report revenues before reimbursements (net revenues). This change has no impact on operating income but does affect ratios calculated as a percentage of revenue, such as operating margin. Prior period results have been revised to reflect the fiscal 2019 presentation. For additional information, see Note 1 (Basis of Presentation) to our Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 1, “Financial Statements.” 
As we are a global company, our revenues are denominated in multiple currencies and may be significantly affected by currency exchange rate fluctuations. If the U.S. dollar weakens against other currencies, resulting in favorable currency translation, our revenues, revenue growth and results of operations in U.S. dollars may be higher. If the U.S. dollar strengthens against other currencies, resulting in unfavorable currency translation, our revenues, revenue growth and results of operations in U.S. dollars may be lower. The U.S. dollar strengthened against various currencies during the three and nine months ended May 31, 2019 compared to the three and nine months ended May 31, 2018, resulting in unfavorable currency translation and U.S. dollar revenue growth that was approximately 5% and 4% lower, respectively, than our revenue growth in local currency. Assuming that exchange rates stay within recent 
ranges for the remainder of fiscal 2019, we estimate that our full fiscal 2019 revenue growth in U.S. dollars will be approximately 3% lower in U.S. dollars than our revenue growth in local currency.
Effective September 1, 2018, we adopted ASU No. 2017-07, Compensation—Retirement Benefits (Topic 715), which required us to reclassify certain components of pension costs from operating expenses to non-operating expenses. Prior period results have been revised to reflect the fiscal 2019 presentation. For additional information, see Note 1 (Basis of Presentation) to our Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 1, “Financial Statements.” 
Gross margin (Revenues less Cost of services as a percentage of Revenues) for the third quarter of fiscal 2019 was 31.8%, compared with 31.2% for the third quarter of fiscal 2018. Gross margin for the nine months ended May 31, 2019 was 30.7% compared with 30.4% for the nine months ended May 31, 2018. The increase in gross margin for the third quarter of fiscal 2019 was primarily due to lower labor costs as a percentage of revenues compared to the third quarter of fiscal 2018. The increase in gross margin for the nine months ended May 31, 2019 was primarily due to lower non-payroll and labor costs as a percentage of revenues compared to the same period in fiscal 2018.
Sales and marketing and General and administrative costs as a percentage of revenues were 16.3% for the third quarter of fiscal 2019 and 16.0% for the nine months ended May 31, 2019, compared with 15.9% for the third quarter of fiscal 2018 and 15.8% for the nine months ended May 31, 2018. We continuously monitor these costs and implement cost-management actions, as appropriate. For the third quarter of fiscal 2019 compared to the same period in fiscal 2018, Sales and marketing costs as a percentage of revenues increased 40 basis points, primarily due to higher selling and other business development costs and General and administrative costs as a percentage of revenues increased 10 basis points. For the nine months ended May 31, 2019 compared to the same period in fiscal 2018, Sales and marketing costs as a percentage of revenues were flat, and General and administrative costs as a percentage of revenues increased 20 basis points.
The effective tax rates for the three and nine months ended May 31, 2019 were 25.6% and 21.1%, respectively. The effective tax rates for the three and nine months ended May 31, 2018 were 34.4% and 27.2%, respectively. For the three and nine months ended May 31, 2018, we recorded a tax charge associated with the enactment of the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of $41 million and $178 million, respectively. Absent these charges and $81 million of expense from a non-U.S. tax law change recorded during the third quarter of fiscal 2018, our effective tax rate for the three and nine months ended May 31, 2018 would have been 26.8% and 21.3%, respectively. For additional information see Note 9 (Income Taxes) to our Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 1, “Financial Statements”.

•Resources revenues increased 19% in local currency, driven by growth across all industry groups and geographic regions.
•North America revenues increased 9% in local currency, driven by the United States.
•Growth Markets revenues increased 13% in local currency, driven by Japan, as well as China, Brazil and Australia.
Operating expenses for the third quarter of fiscal 2019 increased $322 million, or 4%, over the third quarter of fiscal 2018, and decreased as a percentage of revenues to 84.5% from 84.7% during this period.
Cost of services for the third quarter of fiscal 2019 increased $208 million, or 3%, over the third quarter of fiscal 2018, and decreased as a percentage of revenues to 68.2% from 68.8% during this period. Gross margin for the third quarter of fiscal 2019 increased to 31.8% from 31.2% during the third quarter of fiscal 2018. The increase in gross margin was primarily due to lower labor costs as a percentage of revenues compared to the same period in fiscal 2018.
Sales and marketing expense for the third quarter of fiscal 2019 increased $78 million, or 7%, over the third quarter of fiscal 2018, and increased as a percentage of revenues to 10.7% from 10.3% during this period. The increase as a percentage of revenues was primarily due to higher selling and other business development costs compared to the same period in fiscal 2018.
Amounts in table may not total due to rounding. 
•Financial Services operating income decreased as revenue growth was offset by higher operating expenses as a percentage of revenues.
•Products operating income was relatively flat year-over-year as revenue growth was offset by higher operating expenses as a percentage of revenues.
•Resources operating income increased primarily due to revenue growth and higher contract profitability.
The effective tax rate for the third quarter of fiscal 2019 was 25.6%, compared with 34.4% for the third quarter of fiscal 2018. In the third quarter of fiscal 2018, we recorded a $122 million charge associated with tax law changes. Absent this charge, the effective tax rate would have been 26.8% for the third quarter of fiscal 2018. The lower effective tax rate for the three months ended May 31, 2019 was primarily due to changes in prior year tax liabilities and the geographic distribution of earnings, partially offset by higher expense from the adoption of FASB ASU No. 2016-16. For additional information, see Note 1 (Basis of Presentation) to our Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 1, “Financial Statements.” 
Diluted earnings per share were $1.93 for the third quarter of fiscal 2019, compared with $1.60 for the third quarter of fiscal 2018. The $0.33 increase in our diluted earnings per share included the impact of tax law changes, which decreased diluted earnings per share for the third quarter of fiscal 2018 by $0.19. Excluding the impact of these changes, diluted earnings per share for the third quarter of fiscal 2019 increased $0.14 compared with the third quarter of fiscal 2018 due to an increase of $0.09 from higher revenues and operating results, $0.03 from a lower effective tax rate, $0.02 from lower weighted average shares outstanding and $0.01 from lower non-operating expense. These increases were partially offset by a decrease of $0.01 from higher net income attributable to non-controlling interests-other. For information regarding our earnings per share calculations, see Note 3 (Earnings Per Share) to our Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 1, “Financial Statements.” 
Amounts in table may not total due to rounding. 
•Resources revenues increased 21% in local currency, driven by growth across all industry groups and geographic regions. 
•North America revenues increased 9% in local currency, driven by the United States. 
•Europe revenues increased 6% in local currency, led by Italy, the United Kingdom, Ireland, Germany and France. 
•Growth Markets revenues increased 15% in local currency, driven by Japan, as well as Brazil and China. 
Operating expenses for the nine months ended May 31, 2019 increased $1,366 million, or 5%, over the nine months ended May 31, 2018, and decreased as a percentage of revenues to 85.3% from 85.5% during this period. 
Cost of services for the nine months ended May 31, 2019 increased $1,046 million, or 5%, over the nine months ended May 31, 2018, and decreased as a percentage of revenues to 69.3% from 69.6% during this period. Gross margin for the nine months ended May 31, 2019 increased to 30.7% from 30.4% during the nine months ended May 31, 2018. The increase in gross margin was primarily due to lower non-payroll and labor costs as a percentage of revenues compared to the same period in fiscal 2018. 
Sales and marketing expense for the nine months ended May 31, 2019 increased $168 million, or 5%, over the nine months ended May 31, 2018, and remained flat as a percentage of revenues at 10.2% during this period. 
Operating income for the nine months ended May 31, 2019 increased $304 million, or 7%, over the nine months ended May 31, 2018. 
Amounts in table may not total due to rounding. 
•Financial Services operating income decreased as higher consulting contract profitability and revenue growth were offset by higher operating expenses as a percentage of revenues. 
•Products operating income increased primarily due to revenue growth and higher contract profitability, partially offset by higher operating expenses as a percentage of revenues. 
•Resources operating income increased primarily due to revenue growth and higher contract profitability. 
The effective tax rate for the nine months ended May 31, 2019 was 21.1%, compared with 27.2% for the nine months ended May 31, 2018. In the nine months ended May 31, 2018, we recorded a $258 million charge associated with tax law changes. Absent this charge, our effective tax rate for the nine months ended May 31, 2018 would have been 21.3%. The lower effective tax rate for the nine months ended May 31, 2019 was primarily due to higher benefits from final determinations of prior year taxes, changes in the geographic distribution of earnings and adjustments to prior year tax liabilities. These decreases were partially offset by higher expense from the adoption of FASB ASU No. 2016-16 and lower tax benefits from share-based payments. For additional information, see Note 1 (Basis of Presentation) to our Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 1, “Financial Statements.” 
Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests for the nine months ended May 31, 2019 decreased $84 million, or 62%, from the nine months ended May 31, 2018 due to the decrease in the non-controlling ownership percentage in March 2018 from 4% held by Accenture Holdings plc and Accenture Canada Holdings Inc. to less than 1% held by only Accenture Canada Holdings Inc. driven by the Accenture Holdings plc merger with and into Accenture plc. For additional information on the merger, see Note 1 (Basis of Presentation) to our Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 1, “Financial Statements”. 
Diluted earnings per share were $5.62 for the nine months ended May 31, 2019, compared with $4.76 for the nine months ended May 31, 2018. The $0.86 increase in our diluted earnings per share included the impact of tax law changes, which decreased diluted earnings per share for the nine months ended May 31, 2018 by $0.40. Excluding the impact of these changes, diluted earnings per share for the nine months ended May 31, 2019 increased $0.46 compared with the nine months ended May 31, 2018, due to an increase of $0.37 from higher revenues and operating results, $0.05 from lower weighted average shares outstanding, $0.04 from lower non-operating expense and $0.01 from a lower effective tax rate. These increases were partially offset by a decrease of $0.01 from higher net income attributable to non-controlling interests-other. For information regarding our earnings per share calculations, see Note 3 (Earnings Per Share) to our Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 1, “Financial Statements.”

We believe that our current and longer-term working capital, investments and other general corporate funding requirements will be satisfied for the next twelve months and thereafter through cash flows from operations and, to the extent necessary, from our borrowing facilities and future financial market activities. 
Substantially all of our cash is held in jurisdictions where there are no regulatory restrictions or material tax effects on the free flow of funds. Domestic cash inflows for our Irish parent, principally dividend distributions from lower-tier subsidiaries, have been sufficient to meet our historic cash requirements, and we expect this to continue into the future. 
Under the borrowing facilities described above, we had an aggregate of $405 million of letters of credit outstanding as of May 31, 2019.
The Board of Directors of Accenture plc has authorized funding for our publicly announced open-market share purchase program for acquiring Accenture plc Class A ordinary shares and for purchases and redemptions of Accenture plc Class A ordinary shares and Accenture Canada Holdings Inc. exchangeable shares held by current and former members of Accenture Leadership and their permitted transferees. 
In the normal course of business and in conjunction with some client engagements, we have entered into contractual arrangements through which we may be obligated to indemnify clients with respect to certain matters. 
To date, we have not been required to make any significant payment under any of the arrangements described above. For further discussion of these transactions, see Note 10 (Commitments and Contingencies) to our Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 1, “Financial Statements.” 
See Note 1 (Basis of Presentation) and Note 2 (Revenues) to our Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 1, “Financial Statements.” Note 2 includes updates to our revenue policy as a result of the implementation of FASB ASU No. 2014-09.
