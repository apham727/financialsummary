Item 3. Qualitative and Quantitative Disclosures about Market Risk 
We translate all assets and liabilities of our foreign operations, where the U.S. dollar is not the functional currency, at the period-end exchange rate and translate sales and expenses at the average exchange rates in effect during the period. The net effect of these translation adjustments is recorded in the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements as Comprehensive Income. The translation adjustment was a loss of approximately $3,500 and a gain of approximately $3,100 for the second quarter of 2018 and 2017, respectively. For the six months ended June 30, 2018 and 2017, the translation adjustment was a loss of approximately $1,800 and a gain of approximately $3,800, respectively. Translation adjustments are not adjusted for income taxes as they relate to permanent investments in our foreign subsidiaries. Net foreign currency transaction gains and losses included in other income, net amounted to a gain of $294 and a loss of $87 for the second quarter of 2018 and 2017, respectively. For the six months ended June 30, 2018 and 2017, net foreign currency transaction gains and losses included in other income, net were a gain of $156 and a loss of $153, respectively. A hypothetical 10% change in the value of the U.S. dollar in relation to our most significant foreign currency net assets would have had an impact of approximately $7,470 on our foreign net assets as of June 30, 2018.
