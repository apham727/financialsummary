Sales to U.S. customers were 58% of total sales for the quarter compared with 52% for the same period last year, with the balance of sales to customers primarily in Europe, Canada and Asia.

Revenue excluding foreign currency exchange impacts, EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are provided for information purposes only and are not measures of financial performance under GAAP. 
The Company believes that revenue excluding foreign currency exchange impacts is a useful measure in analyzing organic sales results. The Company excludes the effect of currency translation from revenue for this measure because currency translation is not under managements control, is subject to volatility and can obscure underlying business trends. The portion of revenue attributable to currency translation is calculated as the difference between the current period revenue and the current period revenue after applying foreign exchange rates from the prior period. 
The Companys liquidity position as measured by cash and cash equivalents increased by $1,790 to a balance of $10,463 at June 30, 2019 from December 31, 2018. 
During the second quarter of 2019, the increase in cash provided by operating activities is primarily due to a decrease in working capital needs primarily for inventories despite increased revenues along with higher levels of orders, particularly in the second quarter of 2019. 
The significant cash used in investing activities in 2018 reflects the acquisition the Maval OE Steering business. Purchases of property and equipment were $6,401 during 2019 compared to $5,555 for 2018. The Company expects to invest between $15 million and $18 million in capital expenditures during 2019. 
During the first quarter of 2019, the Company utilized revolver borrowings to fund working capital to support the growth seen from fourth quarter 2018 along with the payment of annual incentive compensation amounts. During the second quarter of 2019, the Company made payments on the revolver that offset all but $695 of the 2019 borrowings. 
The cash used in financing activities in first quarter 2018 reflects the use of the revolver to partially finance the acquisition of the Maval OE Steering business. At June 30, 2019, we had $123,695 of obligations under the Revolving Facility excluding the unamortized debt issue costs. 
The Credit Agreement contains certain financial covenants related to minimum interest coverage and total leverage ratio at the end of each quarter. The Credit Agreement also includes other covenants and restrictions, including limits on the amount of additional indebtedness, and restrictions on the ability to merge, consolidate or sell all or substantially all our assets. We were in compliance with all covenants at June 30, 2019. 
As of June 30, 2019, the amount available to borrow under the Credit Agreement was approximately $51,305. The Credit Agreement matures in October 2021. 
There were no borrowings for the China Facility balance during the quarter ended June 30, 2019. 
The Company declared dividends of $0.030 per share during the first quarter 2019 and $0.030 per share during the second quarter of 2019. The Companys working capital, capital expenditure and dividend requirements are expected to be funded from cash provided by operations and amounts available under the Credit Agreement.
