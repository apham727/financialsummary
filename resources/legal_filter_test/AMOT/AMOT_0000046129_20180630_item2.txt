EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are provided for information purposes only and are not measures of financial performance under GAAP. 
The Company believes EBITDA is often a useful measure of a Companys operating performance and is a significant basis used by the Companys management to measure the operating performance of the Companys business because EBITDA excludes charges for depreciation, amortization and interest expense that have resulted from our debt financings, as well as our provision for income tax expense. EBITDA is frequently used as one of the bases for comparing businesses in the Companys industry. 
The Companys liquidity position as measured by cash and cash equivalents decreased by $261 to a balance of $15,329 at June 30, 2018 from December 31, 2017. 
Operating cash flow is flat for the six months ended June 30, 2018 compared to 2017. The increase in net income in 2018 is offset by increases in working capital needs due to the Maval OE Steering business acquisition and Company growth. 
The significant cash used in investing activities in 2018 reflects the acquisition the Maval OE Steering business during the quarter. Also during the six months ended June 30, 2018, purchases of property and equipment were $5,555 compared to $2,677 for the six months ended June 30, 2017. Capital expenditures are expected to increase throughout 2018 to support our new contract wins along with our continued IT infrastructure enhancements. The Company expects to invest between $13 million and $16 million in capital expenditures during 2018. 
The change in cash used in financing activities reflects the 2018 use of the revolver to partially finance the acquisition of the Maval OE Steering business. During the second quarter 2018, we utilized our foreign revolver to make a $1,500 capital investment into our Changzhou operation to fund expansion and future capital spending in support of recently announced contract wins.
