We have foreign operations in The Netherlands, Sweden, Germany, China, Portugal, Canada and Mexico, which expose the Company to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations due to transactions denominated in Euros, Swedish Krona, Chinese Renminbi, Canadian dollar and Mexican pesos, respectively.
We estimate that foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations during the quarter ended March 31, 2018 increased sales in comparison to quarter ended March 31, 2017 by approximately $4,000.
The net effect of these translation adjustments is recorded in the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements as Comprehensive Income.
Net foreign currency transaction gains and losses included in other income, net amounted to a loss of $138 and $70 for the first quarter of 2018 and 2017, respectively.
A hypothetical 10% change in the value of the U.S. dollar in relation to our most significant foreign currency net assets would have had an impact of approximately $6,300 on our foreign net assets as of March 31, 2018.
Interest rates on our Revolving Facility are based on the LIBOR plus a margin of 1.00% to 2.25% (currently 1.50%) or the Prime Rate plus a margin of 0% to 1.25% (currently 0.50%), in each case depending on the CompanyÂ’s ratio of total funded indebtedness to Consolidated EBITDA.
We use interest rate derivatives to add stability to interest expense and to manage our exposure to interest rate movements.
We primarily use interest rate swaps as part of our interest rate risk management strategy.
During October 2013, the Company entered into two interest rate swaps with a combined notional of $25,000 (representing 50% of the Term Loan balance at that time) that amortize quarterly to a notional of $6,673 at maturity.
The notional amount changes over time as loan payments are made.
As a requirement of the debt refinance, one of the swaps was liquidated.
In February 2017, we entered into three interest rate swaps with a combined notional of $40,000 that matures in February 2022.
As of March 31, 2018, we had $63,462 outstanding under the Revolving Facility, of which $43,985 is currently being hedged.
A hypothetical one percentage point (100 basis points) change in the Base Rate on the $18,943 of unhedged floating rate debt outstanding at March 31, 2018 would have an impact of approximately $49 on our interest expense for the first quarter 2018.
