We have foreign operations in The Netherlands, Sweden, Germany, China, Portugal, Canada and Mexico, which expose the Company to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations due to transactions denominated in Euros, Swedish Krona, Chinese Renminbi, Canadian dollar and Mexican pesos, respectively.
For the six months ended June 30, 2019 we estimate that foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations decreased sales by approximately $5,200 compared to the six months ended June 30, 2018.
The net effect of these translation adjustments is recorded in the condensed consolidated financial statements as Comprehensive Income.

Net foreign currency transaction gains and losses included in other income, net amounted to a gain of $19 and $294 for the second quarter of 2019 and 2018, respectively.
For the six months ended June 30, 2019 and 2018, net foreign currency transaction gains and losses included in other income, net were a loss of $58 and a gain of $156, respectively.

Interest rates on our Revolving Facility are based on the LIBOR plus a margin of 1.00% to 2.25% (currently 2.0%) or the Prime Rate plus a margin of 0% to 1.25% (currently 1.0%), in each case depending on the CompanyÂ’s ratio of total funded indebtedness to Consolidated EBITDA.

We primarily use interest rate swaps as part of our interest rate risk management strategy.
During October 2013, the Company entered into two interest rate swaps with a combined notional of $25,000 that amortized quarterly to a notional of $6,673 at the September 2018 maturity.
Neither of these interest rate swaps is currently active, one was liquidated as part of the 2016 debt refinancing and the other matured in September 2018.
In February 2017, we entered into three interest rate swaps with a combined notional of $40,000 that matures in February 2022.
As of June 30, 2019, we had $123,695 outstanding under the Revolving Facility, of which $40,000 is currently being hedged.
A hypothetical one percentage point (100 basis points) change in the Base Rate on the $83,695 of unhedged floating rate debt outstanding at June 30, 2019 would have an impact of approximately $200 on our interest expense for the second quarter of 2019 and $400 on our interest expense for the six months ended June 30, 2019.
