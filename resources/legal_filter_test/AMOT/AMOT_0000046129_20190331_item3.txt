We have foreign operations in The Netherlands, Sweden, Germany, China, Portugal, Czech Republic, Canada and Mexico, which expose the Company to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations due to transactions denominated in Euros, Swedish Krona, Chinese Renminbi, Czech Krona, Canadian dollar and Mexican pesos, respectively.
We estimate that foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations during the quarter ended March 31, 2019 decreased sales in comparison to quarter ended March 31, 2018 by approximately $3,100.
The net effect of these translation adjustments is recorded in the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements as Comprehensive Income.
Net foreign currency transaction gains and losses included in other income, net amounted to approximately a loss of $100 and $138 for the first quarters of 2019 and 2018, respectively.
A hypothetical 10% change in the value of the U.S. dollar in relation to our most significant foreign currency net assets would have had an impact of approximately $6,700 on our foreign net assets as of March 31, 2019.
Interest rates on our Revolving Facility are based on the LIBOR plus a margin of 1.00% to 2.25% (currently 2.0%) or the Prime Rate plus a margin of 0% to 1.25% (currently 1.0%), in each case depending on the CompanyÂ’s ratio of total funded indebtedness to Consolidated EBITDA.
We use interest rate derivatives to add stability to interest expense and to manage our exposure to interest rate movements.
We primarily use interest rate swaps as part of our interest rate risk management strategy.
During October 2013, the Company entered into two interest rate swaps with a combined notional of $25,000 that amortized quarterly to a notional of $6,673 at the September 2018 maturity.
Neither of these interest rate swaps is currently active, one was liquidated as part of the 2016 debt refinancing and the other matured in September 2018.
In February 2017, we entered into three interest rate swaps with a combined notional of $40,000 that matures in February 2022.
As of March 31, 2019, we had $129,502 outstanding under the Revolving Facility, of which $40,000 is currently being hedged.
A hypothetical one percentage point (100 basis points) change in the Base Rate on the $85,462 of unhedged floating rate debt outstanding at March 31, 2019 would have approximately a $200 impact on our interest expense for the first quarter of 2019.
