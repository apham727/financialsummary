Refer to Note 16 – Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (Loss) for further information.
Our unaudited interim consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“GAAP”).
Interim results are not necessarily indicative of results for a full year.
The information included in this Form 10-Q should be read in conjunction with information included in the Microsoft Corporation fiscal year 2018 Form 10-K filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) on August 3, 2018.
We have recast certain prior period amounts related to investments, derivatives, and fair value measurements to conform to the current period presentation based on our adoption of the new accounting standard for financial instruments.
We have also recast prior period commercial cloud revenue to include the commercial portion of LinkedIn to provide a comparable view of our commercial cloud business performance.
The recast of these prior period amounts had no impact on our consolidated financial statements.
The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Microsoft Corporation and its subsidiaries.
Intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated.
We consider all highly liquid interest-earning investments with a maturity of three months or less at the date of purchase to be cash equivalents.
The fair values of these investments approximate their carrying values.
In general, investments with original maturities of greater than three months and remaining maturities of less than one year are classified as short-term investments.
Investments with maturities beyond one year may be classified as short-term based on their highly liquid nature and because such marketable securities represent the investment of cash that is available for current operations.
Debt investments are classified as available-for-sale and realized gains and losses are recorded using the specific identification method.
Changes in fair value, excluding other-than-temporary impairments, are recorded in other comprehensive income (“OCI”).
Debt investments are impaired when a decline in fair value is judged to be other-than-temporary.
Fair value is calculated based on publicly available market information or other estimates determined by management.
We employ a systematic methodology on a quarterly basis that considers available quantitative and qualitative evidence in evaluating potential impairment of our investments.
If the cost of an investment exceeds its fair value, we evaluate, among other factors, general market conditions, credit quality of debt instrument issuers, and the duration and extent to which the fair value is less than cost.
We also evaluate whether we have plans to sell the security or it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the security before recovery.
Once a decline in fair value is determined to be other-than-temporary, an impairment charge is recorded in other income (expense), net and a new cost basis in the investment is established.
Equity investments without readily determinable fair values are measured using the equity method, or measured at cost with adjustments for observable changes in price or impairments (referred to as the measurement alternative).
We perform a qualitative assessment on a quarterly basis and recognize an impairment if there are sufficient indicators that the fair value of the investment is less than carrying value.
Changes in value are recorded in other income (expense), net.
Derivative instruments are recognized as either assets or liabilities and measured at fair value.
For derivative instruments designated as fair value hedges, gains and losses are recognized in other income (expense), net with offsetting gains and losses on the hedged items.
For options designated as fair value hedges, changes in the time value are excluded from the assessment of hedge effectiveness and recognized in other income (expense), net.
For derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges, the effective portion of the gains and losses are initially reported as a component of OCI and subsequently recognized in revenue when the hedged exposure is recognized in revenue.
Gains and losses on derivatives representing either hedge components excluded from the assessment of effectiveness or hedge ineffectiveness are recognized in other income (expense), net.
For derivative instruments that are not designated as hedges, gains and losses from changes in fair values are primarily recognized in other income (expense), net.
Level 1 – inputs are based upon unadjusted quoted prices for identical instruments in active markets.
Our Level 1 investments include U.S. government securities, common and preferred stock, and mutual funds.
Our Level 1 derivative assets and liabilities include those actively traded on exchanges.
Level 2 – inputs are based upon quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not active, and model-based valuation techniques (e.g.
the Black-Scholes model) for which all significant inputs are observable in the market or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities.
Where applicable, these models project future cash flows and discount the future amounts to a present value using market-based observable inputs including interest rate curves, credit spreads, foreign exchange rates, and forward and spot prices for currencies.
Our Level 2 investments include commercial paper, certificates of deposit, U.S. agency securities, foreign government bonds, mortgage- and asset-backed securities, corporate notes and bonds, and municipal securities.
Our Level 2 derivative assets and liabilities primarily include certain over-the-counter option and swap contracts.
Level 3 – inputs are generally unobservable and typically reflect management’s estimates of assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability.
The fair values are therefore determined using model-based techniques, including option pricing models and discounted cash flow models.
Our Level 3 assets and liabilities include investments in corporate notes and bonds, and goodwill and intangible assets, when they are recorded at fair value due to an impairment charge.
Unobservable inputs used in the models are significant to the fair values of the assets and liabilities.
We measure equity investments without readily determinable fair values on a nonrecurring basis.
Our other current financial assets and current financial liabilities have fair values that approximate their carrying values.
As of December 31, 2018 and June 30, 2018, long-term accounts receivable, net of allowance for doubtful accounts, were $1.9 billion and $1.8 billion, respectively, and are included in other long-term assets on our consolidated balance sheets.
In October 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued new guidance requiring an entity to recognize the income tax consequences of an intra-entity transfer of an asset other than inventory when the transfer occurs, rather than when the asset has been sold to an outside party.
We recorded a net cumulative-effect adjustment that resulted in an increase in retained earnings of $557 million, which reversed the previous deferral of income tax consequences and recorded new deferred tax assets from intra-entity transfers involving assets other than inventory, partially offset by a U.S. deferred tax liability related to global intangible low-taxed income (“GILTI”).
Adoption of the standard resulted in an increase in long-term deferred tax assets of $2.8 billion, an increase in long-term deferred tax liabilities of $2.1 billion, and a reduction in other current assets of $152 million.
As a result of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (“TCJA”), we are continuing to evaluate the impact of this standard on our consolidated financial statements, including accounting policies, processes, and systems.
Adoption of the standard had no impact to cash from or used in operating, financing, or investing on our consolidated cash flows statements.
In January 2016, the FASB issued a new standard related to certain aspects of recognition, measurement, presentation, and disclosure of financial instruments.
Most prominent among the changes in the standard is the requirement for changes in the fair value of our equity investments, with certain exceptions, to be recognized through net income rather than OCI.
Adoption of the standard was applied using a modified retrospective approach through a cumulative-effect adjustment from accumulated other comprehensive income (“AOCI”) to retained earnings as of the effective date, and we elected to measure equity investments without readily determinable fair values at cost with adjustments for observable changes in price or impairments.
The cumulative-effect adjustment included any previously held unrealized gains and losses held in AOCI related to our equity investments carried at fair value as well as the impact of recording the fair value of certain equity investments carried at cost.
The impact on our consolidated balance sheets upon adoption was not material.
Adoption of the standard had no impact to cash from or used in operating, financing, or investing on our consolidated cash flows statements.
In August 2017, the FASB issued new guidance related to accounting for hedging activities.
This guidance expands strategies that qualify for hedge accounting, changes how many hedging relationships are presented in the financial statements, and simplifies the application of hedge accounting in certain situations.
We are currently evaluating the impact of this standard on our consolidated financial statements, including accounting policies, processes, and systems.
In June 2016, the FASB issued a new standard to replace the incurred loss impairment methodology under current GAAP with a methodology that reflects expected credit losses and requires consideration of a broader range of reasonable and supportable information to inform credit loss estimates.
We will be required to use a forward-looking expected credit loss model for accounts receivables, loans, and other financial instruments.
Credit losses relating to available-for-sale debt securities will also be recorded through an allowance for credit losses rather than as a reduction in the amortized cost basis of the securities.
The standard will be effective for us beginning July 1, 2020, with early adoption permitted beginning July 1, 2019.
We are currently evaluating the impact of this standard on our consolidated financial statements, including accounting policies, processes, and systems.
Basic earnings per share (“EPS”) is computed based on the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period.
Dilutive potential common shares include outstanding stock options and stock awards.
In periods where we recognized a net loss, we excluded the impact of potentially dilutive outstanding stock-based awards from the calculation of diluted loss per share as their inclusion would have an antidilutive effect.
Refer to Note 5 – Derivatives for further information on the fair value of our derivative instruments.
Equity investments presented as “Other” in the tables above include investments without readily determinable fair values measured using the equity method or measured at cost with adjustments for observable changes in price or impairments, and investments measured at fair value using net asset value as a practical expedient which are not categorized in the fair value hierarchy.
As of December 31, 2018 and June 30, 2018, equity investments without readily determinable fair values measured at cost with adjustments for observable changes in price or impairments were $1.1 billion and $697 million, respectively.
As of December 31, 2018, we had no collateral received under agreements for loaned securities.
As of June 30, 2018, collateral received under agreements for loaned securities was $1.8 billion and primarily comprised U.S. government and agency securities.
Unrealized losses from fixed-income securities are primarily attributable to changes in interest rates.
Management does not believe any remaining unrealized losses represent other-than-temporary impairments based on our evaluation of available evidence.
We use derivative instruments to manage risks related to foreign currencies, equity prices, interest rates, and credit; to enhance investment returns; and to facilitate portfolio diversification.
Our objectives for holding derivatives include reducing, eliminating, and efficiently managing the economic impact of these exposures as effectively as possible.
Our derivative programs include strategies that both qualify and do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment.
We monitor our foreign currency exposures daily to maximize the economic effectiveness of our foreign currency hedge positions.
Option and forward contracts are used to hedge a portion of forecasted international revenue and are designated as cash flow hedging instruments.
Principal currencies hedged include the euro, Japanese yen, British pound, Canadian dollar, and Australian dollar.
Foreign currency risks related to certain non-U.S. dollar denominated securities are hedged using foreign exchange forward contracts that are designated as fair value hedging instruments.
Certain options and forwards not designated as hedging instruments are also used to manage the variability in foreign exchange rates on certain balance sheet amounts and to manage other foreign currency exposures.
Securities held in our equity investments portfolio are subject to market price risk.
Market price risk is managed relative to broad-based global and domestic equity indices using certain convertible preferred investments, options, futures, and swap contracts not designated as hedging instruments.
In the past, to hedge our price risk, we also used and designated equity derivatives as hedging instruments, including puts, calls, swaps, and forwards.
Securities held in our fixed-income portfolio are subject to different interest rate risks based on their maturities.
We manage the average maturity of our fixed-income portfolio to achieve economic returns that correlate to certain broad-based fixed-income indices using exchange-traded option and futures contracts, and over-the-counter swap and option contracts, none of which are designated as hedging instruments.
In addition, we use “To Be Announced” forward purchase commitments of mortgage-backed assets to gain exposure to agency mortgage-backed securities.
These meet the definition of a derivative instrument in cases where physical delivery of the assets is not taken at the earliest available delivery date.
Our fixed-income portfolio is diversified and consists primarily of investment-grade securities.
We use credit default swap contracts, not designated as hedging instruments, to manage credit exposures relative to broad-based indices and to facilitate portfolio diversification.
We use credit default swaps as they are a low-cost method of managing exposure to individual credit risks or groups of credit risks.
Certain of our counterparty agreements for derivative instruments contain provisions that require our issued and outstanding long-term unsecured debt to maintain an investment grade credit rating and require us to maintain minimum liquidity of $1.0 billion.
To the extent we fail to meet these requirements, we will be required to post collateral, similar to the standard convention related to over-the-counter derivatives.
As of December 31, 2018, our long-term unsecured debt rating was AAA, and cash investments were in excess of $1.0 billion.
As a result, no collateral was required to be posted.
Gross derivative assets and liabilities subject to legally enforceable master netting agreements for which we have elected to offset were $233 million and $294 million, respectively, as of December 31, 2018, and $533 million and $207 million, respectively, as of June 30, 2018.
We estimate that $116 million of net derivative gains included in AOCI as of December 31, 2018 will be reclassified into earnings within the following 12 months.
No significant amounts of gains (losses) were reclassified from AOCI into earnings as a result of forecasted transactions that failed to occur for the three and six months ended December 31, 2018.
On October 25, 2018, we acquired GitHub, Inc. in a $7.5 billion stock transaction (inclusive of total cash payments of $1.3 billion in respect of vested GitHub equity awards and an indemnity escrow).
The acquisition is expected to empower developers to achieve more at every stage of the development lifecycle, accelerate enterprise use of GitHub, and bring Microsoft’s developer tools and services to new audiences.
The financial results of GitHub have been included in our consolidated financial statements since the date of the acquisition.
GitHub is reported as part of our Intelligent Cloud segment.
The purchase price allocation as of the date of the acquisition was based on a preliminary valuation and is subject to revision as more detailed analyses are completed and additional information about the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed becomes available.
The goodwill recognized in connection with the acquisition is primarily attributable to anticipated synergies from future growth and is not expected to be deductible for tax purposes.
Transactions recognized separately from the preliminary purchase price allocation were approximately $600 million, primarily related to equity awards recognized as expense over the related service period.
For the six months ended December 31, 2018, we completed 11 additional acquisitions for $959 million, substantially all of which were paid in cash.
Includes goodwill of $5.4 billion related to GitHub.
See Note 7 – Business Combinations for further information.
The measurement periods for the valuation of assets acquired and liabilities assumed end as soon as information on the facts and circumstances that existed as of the acquisition dates becomes available, but do not exceed 12 months.
Adjustments in purchase price allocations may require a change in the amounts allocated to goodwill during the periods in which the adjustments are determined.
Any change in the goodwill amounts resulting from foreign currency translations and purchase accounting adjustments are presented as “Other” in the table above.
Also included in “Other” are business dispositions and transfers between segments due to reorganizations, as applicable.
See Note 7 – Business Combinations for further information.
Intangible assets amortization expense was $530 million and $1.1 billion for the three and six months ended December 31, 2018, respectively, and $562 million and $1.1 billion for the three and six months ended December 31, 2017, respectively.
As of December 31, 2018 and June 30, 2018, we had no commercial paper issued or outstanding.
Effective August 31, 2018, we terminated our credit facilities, which served as back-up for our commercial paper program.
As of December 31, 2018, the total carrying value and estimated fair value of our long-term debt, including the current portion, were $73.2 billion and $74.2 billion, respectively.
As of June 30, 2018, the total carrying value and estimated fair value of our long-term debt, including the current portion, were $76.2 billion and $77.5 billion, respectively.
These estimated fair values are based on Level 2 inputs.
Euro-denominated debt securities.
The notes in the table above are senior unsecured obligations and rank equally with our other senior unsecured debt outstanding.
As of December 31, 2018 and June 30, 2018, the aggregate debt issuance costs and unamortized discount associated with our long-term debt, including the current portion, were $630 million and $658 million, respectively.
The TCJA also reduced the U.S. federal statutory tax rate from 35% to 21% effective January 1, 2018.
The GILTI and BEAT provisions of the TCJA were effective for us beginning July 1, 2018.
We recorded a provisional net charge of $13.8 billion in the second quarter of fiscal year 2018, and $13.7 billion for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2018, related to the TCJA based on reasonable estimates for those tax effects.
We adjusted our provisional net charge by recording additional tax expense of $157 million in the second quarter of fiscal year 2019, related to GILTI deferred taxes pursuant to SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin No.
To calculate the transition tax, we estimated our deferred foreign income for fiscal year 2018 because these tax returns are not complete or due.
We adjusted our provisional charge by recording additional tax expense of $157 million in the second quarter of fiscal year 2019.
We elected the deferred method, under which we recorded the corresponding deferred tax assets and liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets.
As of December 31, 2018, the primary unresolved issues for this and other open IRS audits are related to transfer pricing.
We have not received a proposed assessment for the unresolved issues and do not expect a final resolution of these issues in the next 12 months.
Based on the information currently available, we do not anticipate a significant increase or decrease to our tax contingencies for these issues within the next 12 months.
The resolution of each of these audits is not expected to be material to our consolidated financial statements.
Contracted not recognized revenue was $72 billion as of December 31, 2018, of which we expect to recognize approximately 60% of the revenue over the next 12 months and the remainder thereafter.
We have operating and finance leases for datacenters, corporate offices, research and development facilities, retail stores, and certain equipment.
Our leases have remaining lease terms of 1 year to 20 years, some of which include options to extend the leases for up to 5 years, and some of which include options to terminate the leases within 1 year.
As of December 31, 2018, we have additional operating and finance leases, primarily for datacenters, that have not yet commenced of $2.7 billion and $6.4 billion, respectively.
These operating and finance leases will commence between fiscal year 2019 and fiscal year 2022 with lease terms of 1 year to 16 years.
There were 32 patent infringement cases pending against Microsoft as of December 31, 2018, none of which are material individually or in aggregate.
In December 2018, the SAMR met with Microsoft representatives and presented their preliminary views as to certain possible violations of China’s Anti-Monopoly Law, to which they have invited Microsoft to respond.
U.S.
Microsoft Mobile Oy, a subsidiary of Microsoft, along with other handset manufacturers and network operators, is a defendant in 40 lawsuits filed in the Superior Court for the District of Columbia by individual plaintiffs who allege that radio emissions from cellular handsets caused their brain tumors and other adverse health effects.
We assumed responsibility for these claims in our agreement to acquire Nokia’s Devices and Services business and have been substituted for the Nokia defendants.
Nine of these cases were filed in 2002 and are consolidated for certain pre-trial proceedings; the remaining cases are stayed.
In 2014, the trial court granted in part and denied in part the defendants’ motion to exclude the plaintiffs’ general causation experts.
The plaintiffs have filed supplemental expert evidence, portions of which the defendants have moved to strike.
In August 2018, the trial court issued an order striking portions of the plaintiffs’ expert reports.
Microsoft was served with the complaint in June 2014 and has been substituted for the Nokia defendants.
Current and former female Microsoft employees in certain engineering and information technology roles brought this class action in federal court in Seattle in 2015, alleging systemic gender discrimination in pay and promotions.
Microsoft filed an opposition in January 2018, attaching an expert report showing no statistically significant disparity in pay and promotions between similarly situated men and women.
In June 2018, the court denied the plaintiffs’ motion for class certification.
As of December 31, 2018, we accrued aggregate legal liabilities of $273 million.
On September 20, 2016, our Board of Directors approved a share repurchase program authorizing up to $40.0 billion in share repurchases.
This share repurchase program commenced on December 22, 2016, has no expiration date, and may be suspended or discontinued at any time without notice.
As of December 31, 2018, $19.5 billion remained of this $40.0 billion share repurchase program.
The above table excludes shares repurchased to settle employee tax withholding related to the vesting of stock awards.
All repurchases were made using cash resources.
The dividend declared on November 28, 2018 was included in other current liabilities as of December 31, 2018.
Our reportable segments are described below.
Windows, including Windows original equipment manufacturer (“OEM”) licensing and other non-volume licensing of the Windows operating system; Windows Commercial, comprising volume licensing of the Windows operating system, Windows cloud services, and other Windows commercial offerings; patent licensing; Windows Internet of Things (“IoT”); and MSN advertising.
Revenue and costs are generally directly attributed to our segments.
However, due to the integrated structure of our business, certain revenue recognized and costs incurred by one segment may benefit other segments.
Revenue from certain contracts is allocated among the segments based on the relative value of the underlying products and services, which can include allocation based on actual prices charged, prices when sold separately, or estimated costs plus a profit margin.
Cost of revenue is allocated in certain cases based on a relative revenue methodology.
Operating expenses that are allocated primarily include those relating to marketing of products and services from which multiple segments benefit and are generally allocated based on relative gross margin.
Includes billings to OEMs and certain multinational organizations because of the nature of these businesses and the impracticability of determining the geographic source of the revenue.
Our commercial cloud revenue, which includes Office 365 commercial, Azure, the commercial portion of LinkedIn, Dynamics 365, and other commercial cloud properties, was $9.0 billion and $17.5 billion for the three and six months ended December 31, 2018, respectively, and $6.1 billion and $11.9 billion for the three and six months ended December 31, 2017, respectively.
These amounts are primarily included in Office products and cloud services, Server products and cloud services, and LinkedIn in the table above.
Assets are not allocated to segments for internal reporting presentations.
A portion of amortization and depreciation is included with various other costs in an overhead allocation to each segment; it is impracticable for us to separately identify the amount of amortization and depreciation by segment that is included in the measure of segment profit or loss.
We have reviewed the accompanying consolidated balance sheet of Microsoft Corporation and subsidiaries (the "Company") as of December 31, 2018, the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, cash flows, and stockholders’ equity for the three-month and six-month periods ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the “interim financial information”).
Based on our reviews, we are not aware of any material modifications that should be made to the accompanying interim financial information for it to be in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.
In our opinion, the information set forth in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet as of June 30, 2018, is fairly stated, in all material respects, in relation to the consolidated balance sheet from which it has been derived.
This interim financial information is the responsibility of the Company's management.
We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the PCAOB and the Securities and Exchange Commission.
We conducted our reviews in accordance with standards of the PCAOB.
A review of interim financial information consists principally of applying analytical procedures and making inquiries of persons responsible for financial and accounting matters.
It is substantially less in scope than an audit conducted in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB, the objective of which is the expression of an opinion regarding the financial statements taken as a whole.
Accordingly, we do not express such an opinion.
Refer to Note 14 – Contingencies of the Notes to Financial Statements (Part I, Item 1 of this Form 10-Q) for information regarding legal proceedings in which we are involved.
Our competitors range in size from diversified global companies with significant research and development resources to small, specialized firms whose narrower product lines may let them be more effective in deploying technical, marketing, and financial resources.
Our ability to remain competitive depends on our success in making innovative products, devices, and services that appeal to businesses and consumers.
A well-established ecosystem creates beneficial network effects among users, application developers, and the platform provider that can accelerate growth.
Establishing significant scale in the marketplace is necessary to achieve and maintain attractive margins.
We face significant competition from firms that provide competing platforms.
A competing vertically-integrated model, in which a single firm controls the software and hardware elements of a product and related services, has succeeded with some consumer products such as personal computers, tablets, phones, gaming consoles, and wearables.
Competitors pursuing this model also earn revenue from services integrated with the hardware and software platform, including applications and content sold through their integrated marketplaces.
They may also be able to claim security and performance benefits from their vertically integrated offer.
We also offer some vertically-integrated hardware and software products and services.
We derive substantial revenue from licenses of Windows operating systems on personal computers.
We face significant competition from competing platforms developed for new devices and form factors such as smartphones and tablet computers.
These devices compete on multiple bases including price and the perceived utility of the device and its platform.
Users are increasingly turning to these devices to perform functions that in the past were performed by personal computers.
Even if many users view these devices as complementary to a personal computer, the prevalence of these devices may make it more difficult to attract application developers to our PC operating system platforms.
The variety and utility of content and applications available on a platform are important to device purchasing decisions.
Users sometimes incur costs to move data and buy new content and applications when switching platforms.
To compete, we must successfully enlist developers to write applications for our platform and ensure that these applications have high quality, security, customer appeal, and value.
Companies compete with us based on a growing variety of business models.
Even as we transition more of our business to infrastructure-, platform-, and software-as-a-service business model, the license-based proprietary software model generates a substantial portion of our software revenue.
Many of our competitors also develop and sell software to businesses and consumers under this model.
Other competitors develop and offer free applications, online services and content, and make money by selling third-party advertising.
Some companies compete with us using an open source business model by modifying and then distributing open source software at nominal cost to end-users, and earning revenue on advertising or complementary services and products.
These firms do not bear the full costs of research and development for the software.
Some open source software vendors develop software that mimics the features and functionality of our products.
Our increasing focus on cloud-based services presents execution and competitive risks.
A growing part of our business involves cloud-based services available across the spectrum of computing devices.
Our strategic vision is to compete and grow by building best-in-class platforms and productivity services for an intelligent cloud and an intelligent edge infused with artificial intelligence (“AI”).
At the same time, our competitors are rapidly developing and deploying cloud-based services for consumers and business customers.
Pricing and delivery models are evolving.
Devices and form factors influence how users access services in the cloud and sometimes the user’s choice of which suite of cloud-based services to use.
We are devoting significant resources to develop and deploy our cloud-based strategies.
We are undertaking cultural and organizational changes to drive accountability and eliminate obstacles to innovation.
Our success in the IoT will depend on the level of adoption of our offerings such as Microsoft Azure, Azure Stack, Azure IoT Edge, and Azure Sphere.
We may not establish market share sufficient to achieve scale necessary to achieve our business objectives.
Continuing to bring to market compelling cloud-based experiences that generate increasing traffic and market share.
Maintaining the utility, compatibility, and performance of our cloud-based services on the growing array of computing devices, including PCs, smartphones, tablets, gaming consoles, and other devices, as well as sensors and other endpoints.
Continuing to enhance the attractiveness of our cloud platforms to third-party developers.
Ensuring our cloud-based services meet the reliability expectations of our customers and maintain the security of their data.
Making our suite of cloud-based services platform-agnostic, available on a wide range of devices and ecosystems, including those of our competitors.
It is uncertain whether our strategies will attract the users or generate the revenue required to succeed.
We also invest in the development and acquisition of a variety of hardware for productivity, communication, and entertainment including PCs, tablets, gaming devices, and HoloLens.
Investments in new technology are speculative.
Commercial success depends on many factors, including innovativeness, developer support, and effective distribution and marketing.
We may not achieve significant revenue from new product, service, and distribution channel investments for several years, if at all.
We may not get engagement in certain features, like Microsoft Stores, Microsoft Edge, and Bing, that drive post-license monetization opportunities.
Developing new technologies is complex.
It can require long development and testing periods.
In December 2016, we completed our acquisition of LinkedIn Corporation for $27.0 billion, and in October 2018, we completed our acquisition of GitHub, Inc. for $7.5 billion.
If an arrangement fails to adequately anticipate changing circumstances and interests of a party, it may result in early termination or renegotiation of the arrangement.
It may take longer than expected to realize the full benefits from these transactions and arrangements, such as increased revenue, enhanced efficiencies, or increased market share, or the benefits may ultimately be smaller than we expected.
We review our amortizable intangible assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable.
We test goodwill for impairment at least annually.
These include legislative changes and regulatory actions that make it more difficult to obtain injunctions, and the increasing use of legal process to challenge issued patents.
The number of these claims may grow because of constant technological change in the markets in which we compete, the extensive patent coverage of existing technologies, the rapid rate of issuance of new patents, and our offering of first-party devices, such as Microsoft Surface.
In some countries, such as Germany, an injunction can be issued before the parties have fully litigated the validity of the underlying patents.
We may not be able to protect our source code from copying if there is an unauthorized disclosure.
Source code, the detailed program commands for our operating systems and other software programs, is critical to our business.
Although we license portions of our application and operating system source code to several licensees, we take significant measures to protect the secrecy of large portions of our source code.
If our source code leaks, we might lose future trade secret protection for that code.
Unauthorized disclosure of source code also could increase the security risks described in the next paragraph.
Threats to IT security can take a variety of forms.
Individual and groups of hackers and sophisticated organizations, including state-sponsored organizations or nation-states, continuously undertake attacks that pose threats to our customers and our IT.
These actors may use a wide variety of methods, which may include developing and deploying malicious software or exploiting vulnerabilities in hardware, software, or other infrastructure in order to attack our products and services or gain access to our networks and datacenters, using social engineering techniques to induce our employees, users, partners, or customers to disclose passwords or other sensitive information or take other actions to gain access to our data or our users’ or customers’ data, or acting in a coordinated manner to launch distributed denial of service or other coordinated attacks.
Inadequate account security practices may also result in unauthorized access to confidential data.
For example, system administrators may fail to timely remove employee account access when no longer appropriate.
Employees or third parties may intentionally compromise our or our users’ security or systems, or reveal confidential information.
Cyberthreats are constantly evolving, increasing the difficulty of detecting and successfully defending against them.
We may have no current capability to detect certain vulnerabilities, which may allow them to persist in the environment over long periods of time.
Cyberthreats can have cascading impacts that unfold with increasing speed across our internal networks and systems and those of our partners and customers.
In addition, our internal IT environment continues to evolve.
Often, we are early adopters of new devices and technologies.
We embrace new ways of sharing data and communicating internally and with partners and customers using methods such as social networking and other consumer-oriented technologies.
Our business policies and internal security controls may not keep pace with these changes as new threats emerge.
The security of our products and services is important in our customers’ decisions to purchase or use our products or services.
Security threats are a significant challenge to companies like us whose business is providing technology products and services to others.
Customers using our cloud-based services rely on the security of our infrastructure, including hardware and other elements provided by third parties, to ensure the reliability of our services and the protection of their data.
Adversaries tend to focus their efforts on the most popular operating systems, programs, and services, including many of ours, and we expect that to continue.
Adversaries that acquire user account information at other companies can use that information to compromise our users’ accounts where accounts share the same attributes like passwords.
Inadequate account security practices may also result in unauthorized access.
We are also increasingly incorporating open source software into our products.
To defend against security threats to our internal IT systems, our cloud-based services, and our customers’ systems, we must continuously engineer more secure products and services, enhance security and reliability features, improve the deployment of software updates to address security vulnerabilities in our own products as well as those provided by others, develop mitigation technologies that help to secure customers from attacks even when software updates are not deployed, maintain the digital security infrastructure that protects the integrity of our network, products, and services, and provide customers security tools such as firewalls and anti-virus software and information about the need to deploy security measures and the impact of doing so.
The cost of these steps could reduce our operating margins.
Customers may also spend more on protecting their existing computer systems from attack, which could delay adoption of additional products or services.
Customers may fail to update their systems, continue to run software or operating systems we no longer support, or may fail timely to install or enable security patches.
Our license agreements typically contain provisions that eliminate or limit our exposure to liability, but there is no assurance these provisions will withstand legal challenges.
At times, to achieve commercial objectives, we may enter into agreements with larger liability exposure to customers.
As illustrated by the recent Spectre and Meltdown threats, our products operate in conjunction with and are dependent on products and components across a broad ecosystem.
As we continue to grow the number and scale of our cloud-based offerings, we store and process increasingly large amounts of personally identifiable information of our customers and users.
The continued occurrence of high-profile data breaches provides evidence of an external environment increasingly hostile to information security.
Despite our efforts to improve the security controls across our business groups and geographies, it is possible our security controls over personal data, our training of employees and vendors on data security, and other practices we follow may not prevent the improper disclosure of customer or user data we or our vendors store and manage.
In addition, third parties who have limited access to our customer or user data may use this data in unauthorized ways.
Our software products and services also enable our customers and users to store and process personal data on-premises or, increasingly, in a cloud-based environment we host.
Government authorities can sometimes require us to produce customer or user data in response to valid legal orders.
In the U.S. and elsewhere, we advocate for transparency concerning these requests and appropriate limitations on government authority to compel disclosure.
We may not be able to protect information in our products and services from use by others.
LinkedIn and other Microsoft products and services contain valuable information and content protected by contractual restrictions or technical measures.
In certain cases, we have made commitments to our members and users to limit access to or use of this information.
Changes in the law or interpretations of the law may weaken our ability to prevent third parties from scraping or gathering information or content through use of bots or other measures and using it for their own benefit, thus diminishing the value of our products and services.
Abuse of our advertising or social platforms may harm our reputation or user engagement.
For LinkedIn, Bing Ads, and other products and services that provide content or host ads that come from or can be influenced by third parties, our reputation or user engagement may be negatively affected by activity that is hostile or inappropriate to other people, by users impersonating other people or organizations, by use of our products or services to disseminate information that may be viewed as misleading or intended to manipulate the opinions of our users, or by the use of our products or services that violates our terms of service or otherwise for objectionable or illegal ends.
We may have excessive outages, data losses, and disruptions of our online services if we fail to maintain an adequate operations infrastructure.
Our increasing user traffic, growth in services, and the complexity of our products and services demand more computing power.
We spend substantial amounts to build, purchase, or lease datacenters and equipment and to upgrade our technology and network infrastructure to handle more traffic on our websites and in our datacenters.
We are rapidly growing our business of providing a platform and back-end hosting for services provided by third parties to their end users.
Maintaining, securing, and expanding this infrastructure is expensive and complex.
It requires that we maintain an Internet connectivity infrastructure that is robust and reliable within competitive and regulatory constraints that continue to evolve.
Government litigation and regulatory activity relating to competition rules may limit how we design and market our products.
As a leading global software and device maker, government agencies closely scrutinize us under U.S. and foreign competition laws.
An increasing number of governments are actively enforcing competition laws and regulations and this includes increased scrutiny in potentially large markets such as the European Union (“EU”), the U.S., and China.
Some jurisdictions also allow competitors or consumers to assert claims of anti-competitive conduct.
U.S. federal and state antitrust authorities have previously brought enforcement actions and continue to scrutinize our business.
The European Commission (“the Commission”) closely scrutinizes the design of high-volume Microsoft products and the terms on which we make certain technologies used in these products, such as file formats, programming interfaces, and protocols, available to other companies.
Flagship product releases such as Windows 10 can receive significant scrutiny under competition laws.
For example, in 2004, the Commission ordered us to create new versions of our Windows operating system that do not include certain multimedia technologies and to provide our competitors with specifications for how to implement certain proprietary Windows communications protocols in their own products.
In 2009, the Commission accepted a set of commitments we offered to address the Commission’s concerns relating to competition in web browsing software, including an undertaking to address Commission concerns relating to interoperability.
The web browsing commitments expired in 2014.
Our portfolio of first-party devices continues to grow; at the same time our OEM partners offer a large variety of devices on our platforms.
As a result, increasingly we both cooperate and compete with our OEM partners, creating a risk that we fail to do so in compliance with competition rules.
Regulatory scrutiny in this area may increase.
Certain foreign governments, particularly in China and other countries in Asia, have advanced arguments under their competition laws that exert downward pressure on royalties for our intellectual property.
We are subject to a variety of ongoing commitments because of court or administrative orders, consent decrees, or other voluntary actions we have taken.
Our ability to realize anticipated Windows 10 post-sale monetization opportunities may be limited.
The Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and other anti-corruption laws and regulations (“Anti-Corruption Laws”) prohibit corrupt payments by our employees, vendors, or agents.
While we devote substantial resources to our global compliance programs and have implemented policies, training, and internal controls designed to reduce the risk of corrupt payments and collusive activity, our employees, vendors, or agents may violate our policies.
Operations outside the U.S. may be affected by changes in trade protection laws, policies, and measures, sanctions, and other regulatory requirements affecting trade and investment.
We may be subject to legal liability and reputational damage if we sell goods or services in violation of U.S. trade sanctions on countries such as Iran, North Korea, Cuba, Sudan, and Syria.
Other regulatory areas that may apply to our products and online services offerings include user privacy, telecommunications, data storage and protection, and online content.
For example, regulators may take the position that our offerings such as Skype are covered by existing laws regulating telecommunications services and new laws may define more of our services as regulated telecommunications services.
Data protection authorities may assert that our collection, use, and management of customer data is inconsistent with their laws and regulations.
Legislative or regulatory action relating to cybersecurity requirements may increase the costs to develop, implement, or secure our products and services.
Legislative or regulatory action could also emerge in the area of AI, increasing costs or restricting opportunity.
Applying these laws and regulations to our business is often unclear, subject to change over time, and sometimes may conflict from jurisdiction to jurisdiction.
Additionally, these laws and governments’ approach to their enforcement, and our products and services, are continuing to evolve.
Compliance with these types of regulation may involve significant costs or require changes in products or business practices that result in reduced revenue.
Noncompliance could result in the imposition of penalties or orders we stop the alleged noncompliant activity.
We strive to empower all people and organizations to achieve more, and accessibility of our products is an important aspect of this goal.
There is increasing pressure from advocacy groups, regulators, competitors, and customers to make technology more accessible.
The growth of our Internet- and cloud-based services internationally relies increasingly on the movement of data across national boundaries.
The Privacy Shield and other mechanisms are currently subject to challenges in European courts, which may lead to uncertainty about the legal basis for data transfers across the Atlantic.
The Privacy Shield and other potential rules on the flow of data across borders could increase the cost and complexity of delivering our products and services in some markets.
In May 2018, a new EU law governing data practices and privacy, the General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”), became effective.
The law, which applies to all of our activities conducted from an establishment in the EU or related to products and services offered in the EU, imposes a range of new compliance obligations regarding the handling of personal data.
Engineering efforts to build new capabilities to facilitate compliance with the law have entailed substantial expense and the diversion of engineering resources from other projects and may continue to do so.
The Company’s investment in gaining insights from data is becoming central to the value of the services we deliver to customers, to our operational efficiency and key opportunities in monetization, customer perceptions of quality, and operational efficiency.
Our ability to use data in this way may be constrained by regulatory developments that impede realizing the expected return from this investment.
Ongoing legal reviews by regulators may result in burdensome or inconsistent requirements, including data sovereignty and localization requirements, affecting the location and movement of our customer and internal employee data as well as the management of that data.
Compliance with data regulations might limit our ability to innovate or offer certain features and functionality in some jurisdictions where we operate.
Failure to comply with existing or new rules may result in significant penalties or orders to stop the alleged noncompliant activity, as well as negative publicity and diversion of management time and effort.
Our business depends on our ability to attract and retain talented employees.
Our business is based on successfully attracting and retaining talented employees.
The market for highly skilled workers and leaders in our industry is extremely competitive.
Maintaining our brand and reputation are important to our ability to recruit and retain employees.
We are also limited in our ability to recruit internationally by restrictive domestic immigration laws.
Changes to U.S. immigration policies that restrain the flow of technical and professional talent may inhibit our ability to adequately staff our research and development efforts.
Effective succession planning is also important to our long-term success.
Failure to ensure effective transfer of knowledge and smooth transitions involving key employees could hinder our strategic planning and execution.
How employment-related laws are interpreted and applied to our workforce practices may result in increased operating costs and less flexibility in how we meet our workforce needs.
We are subject to a variety of claims and lawsuits.
These claims may arise from a wide variety of business practices and initiatives, including major new product releases such as Windows 10, significant business transactions, warranty or product claims, and employment practices.
In the course of our business, there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain.
We may experience quality or supply problems.
Our hardware products such as Xbox consoles, Surface devices, and other devices we design, manufacture, and market are highly complex and can have defects in design, manufacture, or associated software.
Our software products and services also may experience quality or reliability problems.
The highly sophisticated software we develop may contain bugs and other defects that interfere with their intended operation.
Although our license agreements typically contain provisions that eliminate or limit our exposure to liability, there is no assurance these provisions will withstand legal challenge.
We acquire some device and datacenter components from sole suppliers.
In addition, our international growth strategy includes certain markets, the developing nature of which presents several risks, including deterioration of social, political, labor, or economic conditions in a country or region, and difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations.
Emerging nationalist trends in specific countries may significantly alter the trade environment.
Although we hedge a portion of our international currency exposure, significant fluctuations in foreign exchange rates between the U.S. dollar and foreign currencies may adversely affect our revenue.
A disruption or failure of our systems or operations because of a major earthquake, weather event, cyberattack, terrorist attack, or other catastrophic event could cause delays in completing sales, providing services, or performing other critical functions.
Our corporate headquarters, a significant portion of our research and development activities, and certain other essential business operations are in the Seattle, Washington area, and we have other business operations in the Silicon Valley area of California, both of which are seismically active regions.
Providing our customers with more services and solutions in the cloud puts a premium on the resilience of our systems and strength of our business continuity management plans, and magnifies the potential impact of prolonged service outages on our operating results.
Abrupt political change, terrorist activity, and armed conflict pose a risk of general economic disruption in affected countries, which may increase our operating costs.
The long-term effects of climate change on the global economy or the IT industry in particular are unclear.
Environmental regulations or changes in the supply, demand or available sources of energy or other natural resources may affect the availability or cost of goods and services, including natural resources, necessary to run our business.
Changes in weather where we operate may increase the costs of powering and cooling computer hardware we use to develop software and provide cloud-based services.
Substantial revenue comes from our U.S. government contracts.
An extended federal government shutdown resulting from failing to pass budget appropriations, adopt continuing funding resolutions or raise the debt ceiling, and other budgetary decisions limiting or delaying federal government spending, could reduce government IT spending on our products and services and adversely affect our revenue.
Our product distribution system relies on an extensive partner and retail network.
OEMs building devices that run our software have also been a significant means of distribution.
As a result, allowances for doubtful accounts and write-offs of accounts receivable may increase.
We maintain an investment portfolio of various holdings, types, and maturities.
These investments are subject to general credit, liquidity, market, and interest rate risks, which may be exacerbated by market downturns or events that affect global financial markets.
A significant part of our investment portfolio comprises U.S. government securities.
Changes in our sales organization may impact revenues.
In July 2017, we announced plans to reorganize our global sales organization to help enable customers’ digital transformation, add greater technical ability to our sales force, and create pooled resources that can be used across countries and industries.
The reorganization is the most significant change in our global sales organization in our history, involving employees changing roles, adding additional talent, realigning teams, and onboarding new partners.
Successfully executing these changes will be a significant factor in enabling future revenue growth.
As we continue to navigate through this transition, sales, profitability, and cash flow could be adversely impacted.
The development of the IoT presents security, privacy, and execution risks.
To support the growth of the intelligent cloud and the intelligent edge, we are developing products, services, and technologies to power the IoT, a network of distributed and interconnected devices employing sensors, data, and computing capabilities including AI.
The IoT’s great potential also carries substantial risks.
IoT products and services may contain defects in design, manufacture, or operation, that make them insecure or ineffective for their intended purposes.
An IoT solution has multiple layers of hardware, sensors, processors, software, and firmware, several of which we may not develop or control.
Each layer, including the weakest layer, can impact the security of the whole system.
Many IoT devices have limited interfaces and ability to be updated or patched.
IoT solutions may collect large amounts of data, and our handling of IoT data may not satisfy customers or regulatory requirements.
IoT scenarios may increasingly affect personal health and safety.
If IoT solutions that include our technologies do not work as intended, violate the law, or harm individuals or businesses, we may be subject to legal claims or enforcement actions.
Issues in the use of AI in our offerings may result in reputational harm or liability.
We are building AI into many of our offerings and we expect this element of our business to grow.
We envision a future in which AI operating in our devices, applications, and the cloud helps our customers be more productive in their work and personal lives.
AI algorithms may be flawed.
Datasets may be insufficient or contain biased information.
Inappropriate or controversial data practices by Microsoft or others could impair the acceptance of AI solutions.
Some AI scenarios present ethical issues.
If we enable or offer AI solutions that are controversial because of their impact on human rights, privacy, employment, or other social issues, we may experience brand or reputational harm.
The introduction of new features, products, services, or terms of service that customers, users, or partners do not like.
Data security breaches, compliance failures, or actions of partners or individual employees.
The proliferation of social media may increase the likelihood, speed, and magnitude of negative brand events.
