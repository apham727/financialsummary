We are exposed to economic risk from foreign exchange rates, interest rates, credit risk, and equity prices.
We use derivatives instruments to manage these risks, however, they may still impact our consolidated financial statements.
We monitor our foreign currency exposures daily to maximize the economic effectiveness of our foreign currency positions, including hedges.
We manage the average maturity of the fixed-income portfolio to achieve economic returns that correlate to certain global fixed-income indices.
Our fixed-income portfolio is diversified and consists primarily of investment-grade securities.
We manage credit exposures relative to broad-based indices and to facilitate portfolio diversification.
