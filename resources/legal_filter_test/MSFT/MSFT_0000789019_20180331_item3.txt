We are exposed to economic risk from foreign exchange rates, interest rates, credit risk, and equity prices.
We monitor our foreign currency exposures daily and use hedges where practicable to offset the risks and maximize the economic effectiveness of our foreign currency positions.
Our fixed-income portfolio is diversified across credit sectors and maturities, consisting primarily of investment-grade securities.
The credit risk and average maturity of the fixed-income portfolio is managed to achieve economic returns that correlate to certain global and domestic fixed-income indices.
In addition, we use “To Be Announced” forward purchase commitments of mortgage-backed assets to gain exposure to agency mortgage-backed securities.
We manage the securities relative to certain global and domestic indices and expect their economic risk and return to correlate with these indices.
We use a value-at-risk (“VaR”) model to estimate and quantify our market risks.
VaR is the expected loss, for a given confidence level, in the fair value of our portfolio due to adverse market movements over a defined time horizon.
The VaR is calculated as the total loss that will not be exceeded at the 97.5 percentile confidence level or, alternatively stated, the losses could exceed the VaR in 25 out of 1,000 cases.
Total one-day VaR for the combined risk categories was $254 million and $207 million as of March 31, 2018 and June 30, 2017, respectively.
The total VaR is 31% and 35% less as of March 31, 2018 and June 30, 2017, respectively, than the sum of the separate risk categories in the table above due to the diversification benefit of the combination of risks.
