Our industry is dynamic and highly competitive, with frequent changes in both technologies and business models.
At Microsoft, we push the boundaries of what is possible through a broad range of research and development activities that seek to identify and address the changing demands of customers and users, industry trends, and competitive forces.
The markets for software, devices, and cloud-based services are dynamic and highly competitive.
The devices and form factors customers prefer evolve rapidly, and influence how users access services in the cloud, and in some cases, the user’s choice of which suite of cloud-based services to use.
We must continue to evolve and adapt over an extended time in pace with this changing environment.
Our success is highly dependent on our ability to attract and retain qualified employees.
We hire a mix of university and industry talent worldwide.
We compete for talented individuals globally by offering an exceptional working environment, broad customer reach, scale in resources, the ability to grow one’s career across many different products and businesses, and competitive compensation and benefits.
Second quarter revenue is driven by corporate year-end spending trends in our major markets and holiday season spending by consumers, and fourth quarter revenue is driven by the volume of multi-year on-premises contracts executed during the period.

Our effective tax rate was 16% and 14% for the three months ended September 30, 2019 and 2018, respectively.
As of September 30, 2019, the primary unresolved issues for the IRS audits relate to transfer pricing, which could have a material impact in our consolidated financial statements when the matters are resolved.
We have not received a proposed assessment for the unresolved issues and do not expect a final resolution of these issues in the next 12 months.
Based on the information currently available, we do not anticipate a significant increase or decrease to our tax contingencies for these issues within the next 12 months.
The resolution of each of these audits is not expected to be material to our consolidated financial statements.
Equity investments were $2.7 billion and $2.6 billion as of September 30, 2019 and June 30, 2019, respectively.
Our short-term investments are primarily intended to facilitate liquidity and capital preservation.
They consist predominantly of highly liquid investment-grade fixed-income securities, diversified among industries and individual issuers.
The credit risk and average maturity of our fixed-income portfolio are managed to achieve economic returns that correlate to certain fixed-income indices.
The settlement risk related to these investments is insignificant given that the short-term investments held are primarily highly liquid investment-grade fixed-income securities.
In general, and where applicable, we use quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities to determine the fair value of our financial instruments.
This pricing methodology applies to our Level 1 investments, such as U.S. government securities, common and preferred stock, and mutual funds.
If quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities are not available to determine fair value, then we use quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities or inputs other than the quoted prices that are observable either directly or indirectly.
This pricing methodology applies to our Level 2 investments, such as commercial paper, certificates of deposit, U.S. agency securities, foreign government bonds, mortgage- and asset-backed securities, corporate notes and bonds, and municipal securities.
Level 3 investments are valued using internally-developed models with unobservable inputs.
Assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis using unobservable inputs are an immaterial portion of our portfolio.
A majority of our investments are priced by pricing vendors and are generally Level 1 or Level 2 investments as these vendors either provide a quoted market price in an active market or use observable inputs for their pricing without applying significant adjustments.
Broker pricing is used mainly when a quoted price is not available, the investment is not priced by our pricing vendors, or when a broker price is more reflective of fair values in the market in which the investment trades.
Our broker-priced investments are generally classified as Level 2 investments because the broker prices these investments based on similar assets without applying significant adjustments.
In addition, all our broker-priced investments have a sufficient level of trading volume to demonstrate that the fair values used are appropriate for these investments.
Our fair value processes include controls that are designed to ensure appropriate fair values are recorded.
These controls include model validation, review of key model inputs, analysis of period-over-period fluctuations, and independent recalculation of prices where appropriate.
Cash from operations increased $161 million to $13.8 billion for the three months ended September 30, 2019, mainly due to an increase in cash from customers, offset in part by an increase in cash used to pay income taxes, suppliers, and employees.
We issue debt to take advantage of favorable pricing and liquidity in the debt markets, reflecting our credit rating and the low interest rate environment.
The proceeds of these issuances were or will be used for general corporate purposes, which may include, among other things, funding for working capital, capital expenditures, repurchases of capital stock, acquisitions, and repayment of existing debt.
Our last debt issuance occurred in fiscal year 2017.
Refer to Note 9 – Debt of the Notes to Financial Statements (Part I, Item 1 of this Form 10-Q) for further discussion.
Unearned revenue comprises mainly unearned revenue related to volume licensing programs, which may include Software Assurance (“SA”) and cloud services.
Unearned revenue is generally invoiced annually at the beginning of each contract period for multi-year agreements and recognized ratably over the coverage period.
Unearned revenue also includes payments for other offerings for which we have been paid in advance and earn the revenue when we transfer control of the product or service.
For the three months ended September 30, 2019 and 2018, we repurchased 29 million shares and 24 million shares of our common stock for $4.0 billion and $2.6 billion, respectively, through our share repurchase program.
All repurchases were made using cash resources.
Refer to Note 14 – Stockholders’ Equity of the Notes to Financial Statements (Part I, Item 1 of this Form 10-Q) for further discussion.
Refer to Note 14 – Stockholders’ Equity of the Notes to Financial Statements (Part I, Item 1 of this Form 10-Q) for further discussion.
These obligations did not have a material impact in our consolidated financial statements during the periods presented.
Additions to property and equipment will continue, including new facilities, datacenters, and computer systems for research and development, sales and marketing, support, and administrative staff.
We expect capital expenditures to increase in coming years to support growth in our cloud offerings.
We have operating and finance leases for datacenters, corporate offices, research and development facilities, retail stores, and certain equipment.
We have paid transition tax of $3.2 billion, which included $1.2 billion during the three months ended September 30, 2019.
The remaining transition tax of $15.2 billion is payable over the next six years with a final payment in fiscal year 2026.
During the three months ended September 30, 2019, we also paid $3.5 billion related to the transfer of intangible properties that occurred in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2019.
We expect existing cash, cash equivalents, short-term investments, cash flows from operations, and access to capital markets to continue to be sufficient to fund our operating activities and cash commitments for investing and financing activities, such as dividends, share repurchases, debt maturities, material capital expenditures, and the transition tax related to the TCJA, for at least the next 12 months and thereafter for the foreseeable future.
Refer to Note 1 – Accounting Policies of the Notes to Financial Statements (Part I, Item 1 of this Form 10-Q) for further discussion.
Our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes are prepared in accordance with GAAP.
These estimates and assumptions are affected by management’s application of accounting policies.
Our contracts with customers often include promises to transfer multiple products and services to a customer.
Determining whether products and services are considered distinct performance obligations that should be accounted for separately versus together may require significant judgment.
When a cloud-based service includes both on-premises software licenses and cloud services, judgment is required to determine whether the software license is considered distinct and accounted for separately, or not distinct and accounted for together with the cloud service and recognized over time.
Judgment is required to determine the stand-alone selling price (“SSP") for each distinct performance obligation.
We use a single amount to estimate SSP for items that are not sold separately, including on-premises licenses sold with SA or software updates provided at no additional charge.
We use a range of amounts to estimate SSP when we sell each of the products and services separately and need to determine whether there is a discount to be allocated based on the relative SSP of the various products and services.
In instances where SSP is not directly observable, such as when we do not sell the product or service separately, we determine the SSP using information that may include market conditions and other observable inputs.
We typically have more than one SSP for individual products and services due to the stratification of those products and services by customers and circumstances.
In these instances, we may use information such as the size of the customer and geographic region in determining the SSP.
Due to the various benefits from and the nature of our SA program, judgment is required to assess the pattern of delivery, including the exercise pattern of certain benefits across our portfolio of customers.
Returns and credits are estimated at contract inception and updated at the end of each reporting period if additional information becomes available.
Changes to our estimated variable consideration were not material for the periods presented.
Equity investments without readily determinable fair values are written down to fair value if a qualitative assessment indicates that the investment is impaired and the fair value of the investment is less than carrying value.
We perform a qualitative assessment on a quarterly basis.
We are required to estimate the fair value of the investment to determine the amount of the impairment loss.
Once an investment is determined to be impaired, an impairment charge is recorded in other income (expense), net.
We allocate goodwill to reporting units based on the reporting unit expected to benefit from the business combination.
We evaluate our reporting units on an annual basis and, if necessary, reassign goodwill using a relative fair value allocation approach.
Goodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level (operating segment or one level below an operating segment) on an annual basis (May 1 for us) and between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value.
Application of the goodwill impairment test requires judgment, including the identification of reporting units, assignment of assets and liabilities to reporting units, assignment of goodwill to reporting units, and determination of the fair value of each reporting unit.
This analysis requires significant judgments, including estimation of future cash flows, which is dependent on internal forecasts, estimation of the long-term rate of growth for our business, estimation of the useful life over which cash flows will occur, and determination of our weighted average cost of capital.
The estimates used to calculate the fair value of a reporting unit change from year to year based on operating results, market conditions, and other factors.
Changes in these estimates and assumptions could materially affect the determination of fair value and goodwill impairment for each reporting unit.
Costs incurred internally in researching and developing a computer software product are charged to expense until technological feasibility has been established for the product.
Once technological feasibility is established, software costs are capitalized until the product is available for general release to customers.
Judgment is required in determining when technological feasibility of a product is established.
We have determined that technological feasibility for our software products is reached after all high-risk development issues have been resolved through coding and testing.
Generally, this occurs shortly before the products are released to production.
The amortization of these costs is included in cost of revenue over the estimated life of the products.
In determining whether a loss should be accrued we evaluate, among other factors, the degree of probability of an unfavorable outcome and the ability to make a reasonable estimate of the amount of loss.
The tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such a position are measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement.
Inventories are stated at average cost, subject to the lower of cost or net realizable value.
Cost includes materials, labor, and manufacturing overhead related to the purchase and production of inventories.
Net realizable value is the estimated selling price less estimated costs of completion, disposal, and transportation.
We regularly review inventory quantities on hand, future purchase commitments with our suppliers, and the estimated utility of our inventory.
Our share repurchases may occur through open market purchases or pursuant to a Rule 10b5-1 trading plan.
The above table excludes shares repurchased to settle employee tax withholding related to the vesting of stock awards.
We returned $7.9 billion to shareholders in the form of share repurchases and dividends in the first quarter of fiscal year 2020.
Refer to Note 14 – Stockholders’ Equity of the Notes to Financial Statements (Part I, Item 1 of this Form 10-Q) for further discussion regarding share repurchases and dividends.
