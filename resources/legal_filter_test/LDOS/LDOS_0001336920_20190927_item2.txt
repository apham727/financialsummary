Effective the beginning of fiscal 2019, we changed the composition of our Defense Solutions reportable segment to better align the operations within the reportable segment to the customers we serve.
In addition, certain contracts were reassigned between the Civil and Defense Solutions reportable segments.
During the three and nine months ended September 27, 2019, we generated approximately 87% of our total revenues from contracts with the U.S. government.
In September 2018, Congress passed and the President signed a consolidated appropriations bill funding the Departments of Defense, Labor, and Health and Human Services for the full government fiscal year ("GFY") 2019.
Earlier in 2018, funding for the Departments of Veterans Affairs and Energy as well as funding for Congress were also enacted.
All were funded at increased levels from the previous year.
From the expiration of that CR until the passage of a new CR on January 25, 2019 there was a partial U.S. government shutdown, which reduced or delayed work on existing contracts and caused delays in other government contracting actions and payments.
In March 2019, the President submitted the GFY 2020 budget proposal to Congress.
The budget included $750 billion for defense and $563 billion for non-defense spending.
The defense budget proposal included $576 billion for national defense and $165 billion for the Overseas Contingency Operations fund.
On July 22, 2019, the White House and Congress reached a tentative two-year budget deal to raise spending caps and suspend the debt ceiling until July 2021.
Allocations for national defense spending increased to $738 billion in GFY 2020 and to $741 billion in GFY 2021.
For non-defense programs, spending increased to $632 billion in GFY 2020 and $635 billion in GFY 2021.
A CR was enacted on September 27, 2019, providing funding at GFY 2019 enacted levels until November 21, 2019.

Non-operating expense, net of $35 million for the three months ended September 27, 2019 was consistent with the non-operating expense, net of $33 million for the three months ended September 28, 2018.
The $89 million decrease was primarily due to the gain recognized on the sale of our commercial cybersecurity business.
For the three months ended September 27, 2019, our effective tax rate was 24.3% compared to 13.5% for the three months ended September 28, 2018.
The increase in the effective tax rate was primarily due to the recording of a valuation allowance related to foreign tax credits in the current quarter and a release of a valuation allowance related to the utilization of a capital loss carryforward in the prior year quarter.

Net cash provided by investing activities increased $213 million for the nine months ended September 27, 2019, when compared to the prior year, primarily due to $183 million of proceeds received for the dispositions of our commercial cybersecurity and health staff augmentation businesses, $96 million of proceeds received for the sale of real estate properties and $81 million of cash paid in the prior year related to our 2016 acquisition.
