For the three months ended March 31, 2018, Sierra Monitor Corporation (“we”, “us” or the “Company”) reported net sales of $5,151,016 compared to $4,527,190 for the three months ended March 31, 2017.

Sales of gas detection products, including industrial accounts and military sales, increased by approximately 19.9% in the first quarter of 2018 compared to the same period in the prior year. Our flame and gas detection products are generally sold to engineering and installation firms who utilize the products as part of larger fire and safety projects in a variety of facilities, such as oil, gas and chemical processing plants, wastewater treatment facilities, alternate fuel vehicle maintenance garages, and other sites where hazardous gases are used or produced. The increase in sales in the first quarter of 2018 compared to the same period in the prior year was primarily attributable to increased government shipments. 
Sales of our FieldServer product line increased by 8.6% in the first quarter of 2018 compared to the same period in the prior year. Our FieldServer products are primarily sold to OEMs who develop a broad range of products relevant to facility automation, such as boilers, chillers, air handlers, lighting controls, generator sets, electric sub-meters, etc. Our FieldServer products are also bought by system integrators looking to connect various discrete automation sub-systems to a common facility management system. Our IIoT focused products are showing growth due to pull through from other solutions like our SMC Cloud offer which is enabling device management, visualization and analytics. Customers are buying our equipment to access the cloud solution.

At March 31, 2018, we had no long-term liabilities. 
We maintain a line of credit with a commercial bank in the maximum amount of $2,000,000. No borrowings have been made under our line of credit during the first three months of fiscal year 2018 and there were no outstanding balances at March 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017. As of March 31, 2018, we were in compliance with the financial covenants of the line of credit. 
In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued ASU 2014-09, “Revenue from Contracts with Customers” (Topic 606). ASC 606 requires the recognition of revenue when promised goods or services are transferred to customers in an amount that reflects the considerations to which the entity expects to be entitled to in exchange for those goods or services. On January 1, 2018, the Company adopted ASC 606 by using the modified retrospective method. The Company recognized the cumulative effect of initially applying ASC 606 as an adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings. The comparative information has not been recast and continues to be reported under the accounting standards in effect for those periods. The adoption did not have a material impact to the nature and timing of its revenues, condensed statements of operations, condensed statements cash flows and condensed balance sheets. The majority of the impact has been on sales returns and the impact has been deemed immaterial. 
The Company’s revenues are derived from the sale of FieldServer products, FieldServer products services, Gas Detection and Environment Control products, and Gas Detection and Environment Control products services. The Company accounts for a contract with a customer when there’s approval and commitment from both parties, the rights of the parties are identified, payment terms are identified, the contract has commercial substance and collectability of consideration is probable. 
Discounts are applied at time of order entry and sales are processed at net pricing. No allowances are offered to customers. 
The Company provides a warranty on all products sold for a period of two years after the date of shipment. Warranty issues are usually resolved with repair or replacement of the product. This standard warranty is assurance type warranty and does not offer any services in addition to the assurance that the product will continue working as specified. Therefore, warranties are not considered separate performance obligations in the arrangement. Instead, estimated future warranty obligations related to products are provided by charges to condensed statements of operations in the period in which the related revenue is recognized. 
The Company records accounts receivable when it has an unconditional right to consideration. Contract liabilities are recorded when cash payments are received or due in advance of performance. Contract liabilities consist of only advance payments, where the Company has unsatisfied performance obligations. Contract liabilities are classified as deferred revenue and included within “Other current liabilities” on the condensed balance sheets. At times, billing may occur subsequent to revenue recognition, resulting in an unbilled receivable which represents a contract asset. The Company does not have any unbilled receivable on the condensed balance sheets. 
Payment terms vary by customer. The time between invoicing and when payment is due is not significant. For certain products or services and customer types, payment is required before the products or services are delivered to the customer. 
There were no significant changes in estimates during the period that would affect the contract balances. The amounts of revenue recognized during the three months ended March 31, 2018 and March 31, 2017 from the opening deferred revenue balances were $425 and $0, respectively. For the periods ended March 31, 2018, and March 31, 2017 no impairment losses related to contract balances were recognized in the condensed statement of operations. 
The Company has elected to account for shipping and handling activities related to contracts with customers as costs to fulfill the promise to transfer the associated products. 
Our domestic sales are generally made on an open account basis unless specific experience or knowledge of the customer’s potential inability or unwillingness to meet the payment terms dictate secured payments. Our international sales are generally made based on secure payments, including cash wire advance payments and letters of credit. International sales are made on open account terms where sufficient historical experience justifies the credit risks involved. In many of our larger sales, the customers are frequently construction contractors who are in need of our field services to complete their work and obtain payment. Management’s ability to manage the credit terms and take advantage of the leverage provided by the customers’ need for our services is critical to the effective application of credit terms and minimization of accounts receivable losses. 
We maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts which is analyzed on a periodic basis to determine adequacy. We believe that we have demonstrated the ability to make reasonable and reliable estimates of allowances for doubtful accounts based on significant historical experience. 
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or estimated market, cost being determined on the first-in, first-out method. The Company uses an Enterprise Requirements Planning (“ERP”) software system which provides data upon which management relies to determine inventory trends and identify excesses. The carrying value of inventory is reduced to market for slow moving and obsolete items based on historical experience and current product demand. We evaluate the carrying value of inventory quarterly. The adequacy of these carrying amounts is dependent upon management’s ability to forecast demands accurately, manage product changes efficiently, and interpret the data provided by the ERP system.
