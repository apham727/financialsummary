Our FieldServer products are also bought by system integrators looking to connect various discrete automation sub-systems to a common facility management system.
Our IoT focused products are showing growth due to pull through from other solutions like our SMC Cloud offer which is enabling device management, visualization and analytics.
Customers are buying our equipment to access the cloud solution.

Our reduced gross margin in the first quarter of 2019 compared to the same period in 2018 is primarily due to product mix.
Expenses for research and development, which include new product development and engineering to sustain existing products, were $738,720, or 13.4% of net sales, for the three-month period ended March 31, 2019, compared with $774,428, or 15.0% of net sales, in the same period in the prior year.

At March 31, 2019, our balance sheet reflected approximately $2,256,000 of cash and $2,727,000 of net trade receivables.
The difference in the cash flow and balance sheet in first quarter of 2019 compared with the same period in the prior year was due to a number of factors including decreased accrued compensation expenses, increased net receivables and decreased accounts payable.
At March 31, 2019, we had approximately $926,000 in long-term liabilities related to lease right-of-use liabilities compared to no long-term liabilities at December 31, 2018.
We maintain a line of credit with a commercial bank in the maximum amount of $2,000,000.
No borrowings have been made under our line of credit during the first three months of fiscal year 2019 and there were no outstanding balances at March 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018.
As of March 31, 2019, we were in compliance with the financial covenants of the line of credit.
In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued ASU 2014-09, “Revenue from Contracts with Customers” (Topic 606).
ASC 606 requires the recognition of revenue when promised goods or services are transferred to customers in an amount that reflects the considerations to which the entity expects to be entitled to in exchange for those goods or services.
The Company recognized the cumulative effect of initially applying ASC 606 as an adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings.
The majority of the impact has been on sales returns and the impact has been deemed immaterial.
The Company’s revenue arrangements consist of multiple performance obligations including hardware, software, and services.
Determining the stand-alone selling price (“SSP”) and allocation of consideration from an arrangement to the individual performance obligations, and the appropriate timing of revenue recognition are significant judgments with respect to these arrangements.
Gas Detection and Environment Control Products are sold as off-the-shelf products with prices fixed at the time of order.
The creditworthiness of customers is assessed prior to the Company accepting a customer’s first order.
Additionally, international customers and customers who have developed a history of payment problems are generally required to prepay or pay through a letter-of-credit.
Gas detection and environment control services consist of field service orders (technical support) and training, which are provided separately from product orders.
Orders are accepted in the same forms as discussed for Gas Detection and Environment Control Products above with hourly prices fixed at the time of order.
Revenue recognition occurs only when the service activity is completed.
Such services are provided to current and prior customers, and, as noted above, creditworthiness has generally already been assessed.
In cases where the probability of receiving payment is low, a credit card number is collected for immediate processing.
Revenue is recognized in the period the technical support and training are performed.
However, if custom development of the protocol driver is required, the product order is not processed until development of the protocol driver is complete.
When development of the driver is complete the customer is notified and can proceed with a FieldServer product.
Revenues for protocol driver development are recognized at a point in time when the control of the product is transferred to the customer generally occurring upon shipment or delivery of the related product that includes the developed protocol drivers (as noted in FieldServer Products above).
Discounts are applied at time of order entry and sales are processed at net pricing.
No allowances are offered to customers.
Applying the practical expedient, the Company recognizes the incremental costs of obtaining contracts as an expense when incurred if the amortization period of the assets that otherwise would have been recognized is one year or less.
The Company provides a warranty on all products sold for a period of two years after the date of shipment.
Warranty issues are usually resolved with repair or replacement of the product.
This standard warranty is assurance type warranty and does not offer any services in addition to the assurance that the product will continue working as specified.
Therefore, warranties are not considered separate performance obligations in the arrangement.
Instead, estimated future warranty obligations related to products are provided by charges to condensed statements of operations in the period in which the related revenue is recognized.
Contract liabilities consist of only advance payments, where the Company has unsatisfied performance obligations.
At times, billing may occur subsequent to revenue recognition, resulting in an unbilled receivable which represents a contract asset.
The Company does not have any unbilled receivable on the condensed balance sheets.
Payment terms vary by customer.
The time between invoicing and when payment is due is not significant.
For certain products or services and customer types, payment is required before the products or services are delivered to the customer.
There were no significant changes in estimates during the period that would affect the contract balances.
The amounts of revenue recognized during the three months ended March 31, 2019 and March 31, 2018 from the opening deferred revenue balances were $733 and $442, respectively.
For the periods ended March 31, 2019, and March 31, 2018 no impairment losses related to contract balances were recognized in the condensed statement of operations.
The Company has elected to account for shipping and handling activities related to contracts with customers as costs to fulfill the promise to transfer the associated products.
Remaining performance obligations represent the transaction price allocated to performances obligations that are unsatisfied or partially unsatisfied as of the end of the reporting period.
As of March 31, 2019, the remaining performance obligation is approximately $3,882,000, 36% or $1,379,000 of which is expected to be recognized in 3 months and 72% or $2,782,000 of which is expected to be recognized within nine months.
The remainder is expected to be recognized after fiscal year 2019.
Our international sales are generally made based on secure payments, including cash wire advance payments and letters of credit.
International sales are made on open account terms where sufficient historical experience justifies the credit risks involved.
In many of our larger sales, the customers are frequently construction contractors who are in need of our field services to complete their work and obtain payment.
Management’s ability to manage the credit terms and take advantage of the leverage provided by the customers’ need for our services is critical to the effective application of credit terms and minimization of accounts receivable losses.
We maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts which is analyzed on a periodic basis to determine adequacy.
We believe that we have demonstrated the ability to make reasonable and reliable estimates of allowances for doubtful accounts based on significant historical experience.
We evaluate the carrying value of inventory quarterly.
The adequacy of these carrying amounts is dependent upon management’s ability to forecast demands accurately, manage product changes efficiently, and interpret the data provided by the ERP system.
