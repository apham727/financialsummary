Selling expenses have increased in the three and six-month periods ending June 30, 2018 primarily because we added a Regional Sales Manager for Asia and Canada as well as a Regional Sales Manager for Latin America.
General and administrative expenses, which consist primarily of salaries, building rent, insurance expenses, information technology expenses and fees for professional services, were approximately $989,000, or 18% of net sales, for the three-month period ended June 30, 2018 compared to approximately $825,000, or 17% of net sales, in the three-month period ended June 30, 2017.

Our general and administrative expenses have acclimated to a higher run-rate in 2018 primarily due to technology upgrades to key customer and delivery focused systems.
There were no non-recurring costs for the three-month and six-month period of 2018.
In the second quarter of 2017, costs of approximately $580,000 related to compensation expense were incurred as a result of the departure of Varun Nagaraj as CEO and President and Anders Axelsson as Vice President of Sales and Marketing.

The increase in income in both the second quarter and first half of 2018 compared to the same periods in 2017 is due primarily to the non-recurring expense for separation packages for our two former senior executives.
After interest and tax provisions, our net income for the three-month period ended June 30, 2018 was approximately $46,000 compared to a net loss of approximately $425,000 in the same period of 2017.
For the six-month period ended June 30, 2018, our net income was approximately $97,000 compared to a net loss of approximately $559,000 in the same period of 2017.
As summarized below, the cash provided during the six months ended June 30, 2017 was due primarily to cash received by a potential strategic partner offset by changes in income.
At June 30, 2018, our balance sheet reflected approximately $2,731,000 of cash and approximately $2,957,000 of net trade receivables.
Of the total cash received, $500,000 was an expense reimbursement for some of the out-of-pocket costs the Company had incurred in connection with its consideration of strategic alternatives.
The other $500,000 was a fully refundable amount which the Company returned to the payer in August 2017.
At June 30, 2018 and 2017, we had no long-term liabilities.
We maintain a line of credit with our commercial bank in the maximum amount of $2,000,000.
No borrowings have been made under our line of credit during the first six months of fiscal year 2018 and there were no outstanding balances at June 30, 2018 or December 31, 2017.
As of June 30, 2018, we were in compliance with the financial covenants of the line of credit.
In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued ASU 2014-09, “Revenue from Contracts with Customers” (Topic 606).
ASC 606 requires the recognition of revenue when promised goods or services are transferred to customers in an amount that reflects the considerations to which the entity expects to be entitled to in exchange for those goods or services.
The majority of the impact has been on sales returns and the impact has been deemed immaterial.
The Company’s revenue arrangements consist of multiple performance obligations including hardware, software, and services.
Determining the stand-alone selling price (“SSP”) and allocation of consideration from an arrangement to the individual performance obligations, and the appropriate timing of revenue recognition are significant judgments with respect to these arrangements.
Gas Detection and Environment Control Products are sold as off-the-shelf products with prices fixed at the time of order.
The creditworthiness of customers is assessed prior to the Company accepting a customer’s first order.
Additionally, international customers and customers who have developed a history of payment problems are generally required to prepay or pay through a letter-of-credit.
Gas detection and environment control services consist of field service orders (technical support) and training, which are provided separately from product orders.
Revenue recognition occurs only when the service activity is completed.
Such services are provided to current and prior customers, and, as noted above, creditworthiness has generally already been assessed.
In cases where the probability of receiving payment is low, a credit card number is collected for immediate processing.
Revenue is recognized in the period the technical support and training are performed.
However, if custom development of the protocol driver is required, the product order is not processed until development of the protocol driver is complete.
The driver development involves further research after receipt of order, preparation of a scope document to be approved by the customer and then engineering time to write, test and release the driver program.
When development of the driver is complete the customer is notified and can proceed with a FieldServer product.
Revenues for protocol driver development are recognized at a point in time when the control of the product is transferred to the customer generally occurring upon shipment or delivery of the related product that includes the developed protocol drivers (as noted in FieldServer Products above).
Discounts are applied at time of order entry and sales are processed at net pricing.
No allowances are offered to customers.
Applying the practical expedient, the Company recognizes the incremental costs of obtaining contracts as an expense when incurred if the amortization period of the assets that otherwise would have been recognized is one year or less.
The Company provides a warranty on all products sold for a period of two years after the date of shipment.
Warranty issues are usually resolved with repair or replacement of the product.
This standard warranty is assurance type warranty and does not offer any services in addition to the assurance that the product will continue working as specified.
Therefore, warranties are not considered separate performance obligations in the arrangement.
Instead, estimated future warranty obligations related to products are provided by charges to condensed statements of operations in the period in which the related revenue is recognized.
The Company records accounts receivable when it has an unconditional right to consideration.
Contract liabilities consist of only advance payments, where the Company has unsatisfied performance obligations.
At times, billing may occur subsequent to revenue recognition, resulting in an unbilled receivable which represents a contract asset.
The Company does not have any unbilled receivable on the condensed balance sheets.
Payment terms vary by customer.
The time between invoicing and when payment is due is not significant.
For certain products or services and customer types, payment is required before the products or services are delivered to the customer.
There were no significant changes in estimates during the period that would affect the contract balances.
The amounts of revenue recognized during the six months ended June 30, 2018 and June 30, 2017 from the opening deferred revenue balances were $1,133 and $2,708, respectively.
For the periods ended June 30, 2018, and June 30, 2017 no impairment losses related to contract balances were recognized in the condensed statement of operations.
Remaining performance obligations represent the transaction price allocated to performances obligations that are unsatisfied or partially unsatisfied as of the end of the reporting period.
As of June 30, 2018, the remaining performance obligation is approximately $4,386,000, 60% or $2,617,000 of which is expected to be recognized in 3 months and 80% or $3,497,000 of which is expected to be recognized within six months.
The remainder is expected to be recognized after fiscal year 2018.
Our international sales are generally made based on secure payments, including cash wire advance payments and letters of credit.
International sales are made on open account terms where sufficient historical experience justifies the credit risks involved.
In many of our larger sales, the customers are construction contractors who are in need of our field services to complete their work and obtain payment.
Management’s ability to manage the credit terms and utilize the leverage provided by the clients’ need for our services is critical to the effective application of credit terms and minimization of accounts receivable losses.
We maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts which is analyzed on a periodic basis to determine whether it is adequate.
We believe that we have demonstrated the ability to make reasonable and reliable estimates of allowances for doubtful accounts based on significant historical experience.
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value, cost being determined on the first-in, first-out method.
The Company uses an Enterprise Requirements Planning (“ERP”) software system which provides data upon which management relies to determine inventory trends and identify excesses.
We evaluate the carrying value of inventory quarterly.
The adequacy of carrying amounts is dependent upon management’s ability to forecast demands accurately, manage product changes efficiently, and interpret the data provided by the ERP system.
