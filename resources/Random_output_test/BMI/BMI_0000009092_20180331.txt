For contracts with multiple performance obligations, the Company allocates the contract's transaction price to each performance obligation using the best estimate of the standalone selling price of each distinct good or service in a contract.
Certain customers may receive cash-based incentives or credits, which are accounted for as variable consideration.
The Company's preliminary allocation of the purchase price included approximately $0.3 million in receivables, $0.6 million in inventory, $0.2 million in property, plant and equipment, $10.9 million of intangibles and $16.1 million of goodwill.
For contracts recorded as long-term liabilities, $8.6 million was the aggregate amount of the transaction price allocated to performance obligations that were unsatisfied or partially unsatisfied as of the end of the reporting period.For instance, the Company is periodically asked to oversee and perform field installation of its products for certain customers.

The Company estimates that approximately 55% to 60% of water meters installed in the United States have been converted to a radio solutions technology.
AMI systems eliminate the need for utility personnel to drive through service territories to collect data from the meters.
The Company also supports its product and technology sales with the sale of extended service programs that provide additional services beyond the standard warranty.
In recent years, the Company has sold ORION radio technology to natural gas utilities for installation on their gas meters.
Benefits to the utility include improved customer service, increased visibility through faster leak detection, the ability to promote and quantify the effects of its water conservation efforts, and easier compliance reporting.
