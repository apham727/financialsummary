Customer fund deposits consist of amounts we owe on behalf of our customers.
See Note 9 to the financial statements in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for a description of legal proceedings.
As of October 31, 2019 and July 31, 2019, the deferred revenue balance related to performance obligations that will be satisfied after 12 months was $2 million and $4 million, respectively, and is included in other long-term obligations on our condensed consolidated balance sheets.
We compute basic net income or loss per share using the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period.
From time to time, we detect, or receive notices from customers or public or private agencies that they have detected, actual or perceived vulnerabilities in our servers, our software or third-party software components that are distributed with our products or fraudulent activity by unauthorized persons utilizing our products with stolen customer identity information.
Consequently, the RSUs are not considered participating securities and we do not present them separately in earnings per share.
As we continue to grow our online services, we become more dependent on the continuing operation and availability of our information technology and communications systems and those of our external service providers, including, for example, third-party Internet-based or cloud computing services.
We do not have significant finance leases.
Except for direct obligations of the United States government, securities issued by agencies of the United States government, and money market funds, we diversify our investments in debt securities by limiting our holdings with any individual issuer.
In order to compete, we have also introduced free offerings in several categories, but we may not be able to attract customers as effectively as competitors with different business models.Our secured revolving credit facility is available to fund a portion of our loans to qualified small businesses.
Total operating expenses as a percentage of total net revenue decreased in the first quarter of fiscal 2020 compared to the same period of fiscal 2019.
The result is a shift from traditional services and point solutions to interconnected capabilities that work on platforms and increasingly rely on A.I.Total costs and expenses in these categories were $26 million in fiscal 2019; $21 million in fiscal 2018; and $14 million in fiscal 2017.
We have experienced such instances in the past and as the accessibility of stolen identity information increases, generally, we may experience further instances of unauthorized access to our systems through the use of stolen identity information of our customers or members of our workforce in the future.
We establish reserves against revenue in our financial statements based on estimated customer refunds.
Even if we are able to attract new users through these mobile offerings, the amount of revenue that we derive per user from mobile offerings may be less than the revenue that we have historically derived from users of personal computers.
We are continually investing resources to update and improve these systems and environments in order to meet existing needs, as well as the growing and changing requirements of our business and customers.
We use commercially available security technologies and security and business controls to limit access to and use of such sensitive data.
