The Companys license and cloud arrangements often contain multiple performance obligations, including maintenance, consulting, and training.
Fees for time and materials consulting contracts are usually payable shortly after the service is provided.
For certain other financial instruments, including accounts receivable and accounts payable, the carrying value approximates their fair value due to the relatively short maturity of these items.
On January 1, 2018 the Company adopted the ASC 606 revenue recognition standard and has adjusted prior periods to conform.
If applicable, the Company will recognize transfers into and out of levels within the fair value hierarchy at the end of the reporting period in which the actual event or change in circumstance occurs.

Financial Statements and Supplementary Data both of which are contained in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2017.
The increases in the three and six months ended June 30, 2018 were primarily due to increases in compensation and benefits of $1 million and $5.5 million, respectively, attributable to increased headcount and the expansion of our application development team to support the continued development of our expanding suite of software.
They also include accounting, legal, and other professional consulting and administrative fees.
Our cloud revenue is derived from our hosted software applications and Pega Platform environments.
The increase in headcount reflects our efforts to increase our sales capacity to target new accounts in existing industries, as well as to expand coverage in new industries and geographies, and to increase the number of sales opportunities.
These awards generally have a five-year vesting schedule.
Since 2004, our Board of Directors has approved annual stock repurchase programs with the aggregate authority to repurchase up to $221.8 million of our common stock.
This fluctuation may continue in future periods, as the amount of excess tax benefits from stock-based compensation awards varies depending on our future stock price in relation to the fair value of awards, the timing of RSU vestings, exercise behavior of our stock option holders, and the total value of future grants of stock-based compensation awards.

Thus, we estimate stand-alone selling price for software licenses and cloud performance obligations using the residual approach, determined based on total transaction price minus the stand-alone selling price of other performance obligations promised in the contract.
