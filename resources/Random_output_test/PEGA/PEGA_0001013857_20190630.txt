We encourage you to carefully consider the risk factors identified in Item 1A.Pegasystems Inc. (together with its subsidiaries, “the Company”) has prepared the accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements pursuant to the rules and regulations of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) regarding interim financial reporting.
Fixed lease costs are recognized on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease.
The Company combines lease and non-lease components in the determination of lease costs for its office space leases.
If applicable, the Company will recognize transfers into and out of levels within the fair value hierarchy at the end of the reporting period in which the actual event or change in circumstance occurs.
In periods of loss, all stock options and RSUs are excluded, as their inclusion would be anti-dilutive.
There were no transfers between levels during the six months ended June 30, 2019.
As a result, there are no commensurate commissions paid on contract renewals.Revenue from cloud arrangements is generally recognized over the service period, while revenue from term and perpetual license arrangements is generally recognized upfront when the license rights become effective.
The decrease in perpetual license revenue in the six months ended June 30, 2019 reflects the shift in client preferences in favor of our cloud offerings instead of our perpetual license arrangements.
In connection with our acquisition of In the Chat Communications Inc. on May 10, 2019 and in reliance on the Regulation D exemption from registration requirements under the Securities Act, we granted an employee the right to obtain up to 14,497 shares of our common stock, which will be issued in five equal tranches contingent upon continued employment.
The decrease in total gross profit in the six months ended June 30, 2019 was primarily due to a decrease in term and perpetual license revenue reflecting the shift in client preferences toward our cloud offerings and a decrease in consulting revenue due to a decrease in billable hours.
The decreases in cloud gross profit percent in the three and six months ended June 30, 2019 were driven by an increase in costs as we accelerated our investments in cloud infrastructure and service delivery to support future growth.
The increases in the three and six months ended June 30, 2019 were primarily due to the increased value of our annual periodic equity awards granted in March 2019 and 2018.
