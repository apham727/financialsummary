We do not currently expect Topic 606 to have a significant effect on the timing of revenue recognition for our maintenance or professional services revenues, or SaaS contracts.
In May 2016, the FASB issued ASU No.
Consequently, we have not necessarily included all information and footnotes required for audited financial statements.
The following table summarizes our restructuring accruals related to facility closures and employee separation charges.
The total unrecognized tax benefit for uncertain tax positions is estimated to be $5.2 million and $6.5 million at June 30, 2018 and September 30, 2017, respectively.
Additionally, some of our business will be conducted in currencies other than the U.S. dollar.
Because the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access, or to sabotage systems, change frequently and generally are not recognized until launched against a target, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventative measures.
We also expect to grow our business by delivering our DM solutions through additional distribution channels.
New laws and regulations pertaining to our customers could cause them to pursue new strategies, reducing the demand for our products.
This protection of our proprietary technology is limited, and our proprietary technology could be used by others without our consent.

Management uses bookings as an indicator of our business performance.
Revenues from these customers included amounts recorded in our other segments.
Our revenue types are transactional and maintenance, professional services and license.
Selling, general and administrative expenses increased $30.5 million to $286.0 million during the nine months ended June 30, 2018 from $255.5 million during the nine months ended June 30, 2017, primarily attributable to an increase in personnel and labor costs as a result of increased headcount, higher share-based compensation and incentive costs.
Interest expense includes primarily interest on the senior notes issued in May 2008, July 2010 and May 2018, as well as interest and credit facility fees on the revolving line of credit.
Transactional-based revenue is recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, fees are fixed or determinable, and collection is probable.
Licenses are sold on a perpetual or term basis and bookings generally equal the fixed amount stated in the contract.
We currently plan to adopt Topic 606 in the first quarter of our fiscal 2019 using the retrospective transition method.
We continue to drive growth in our Scores segment.
The year-to-date period over period increase of $20.0 million in operating income was attributable to a $73.7 million increase in segment revenues, a $5.0 million decrease in amortization cost and a $4.5 million decrease in restructuring and acquisition-related cost, partially offset by a $36.5 million increase in segment operating expenses, a $15.6 million increase in corporate expenses and an $11.1 million increase in share-based compensation cost.

When an economy is struggling, companies in many industries delay or reduce technology purchases, and we experience softened demand for our decisioning solutions and other products and services.
Many of our customers are significantly larger than we are and may have greater bargaining power.
In addition to existing laws and regulations, changes in the U.S. or foreign legislative, judicial, regulatory or consumer environments could harm our business, financial condition or results of operations.
If we are unable to develop new products, or if we are not successful in introducing new products, we may not be able to grow our business or growth may occur more slowly than we anticipate.
Any publicly-stated revenue or earnings projections are subject to this risk.
We rely on relationships with third parties for marketing, distribution and certain services.
Our DM strategy is also increasingly focused on the delivery of our products through cloud-based deployments.
