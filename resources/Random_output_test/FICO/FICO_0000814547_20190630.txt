Indirect costs are allocated to the segments generally based on relative segment revenues, fixed rates established by management based upon estimated expense contribution levels and other assumptions that management considers reasonable.
For example, Experian, TransUnion and Equifax have developed a credit scoring product to compete directly with our products and are collectively attempting to sell the product.
We record litigation accruals for legal matters which are both probable and estimable.

We were in compliance with all financial covenants under this credit facility as of June 30, 2019.
We estimate the total variable consideration at contract inception — subject to any constraints that may apply — and update the estimates as new information becomes available and recognize the amount ratably over the SaaS service period, unless we determine it is appropriate to allocate the variable amount to each distinct service period and recognize revenue as each distinct service period is performed.
We record a receivable when we satisfy a performance obligation prior to invoicing if only the passage of time is required before payment is due or if we have an unconditional right to consideration before we satisfy a performance obligation.
Revenue is recognized when control of the promised goods or services is transferred to our customers.
We cannot assure you that the marketplace will accept these products.
We continue to expand the pursuit of our business objective to become a leader in helping businesses automate and improve decisions across their enterprises, an approach that we commonly refer to as Decision Management, or “DM.” Our DM strategy is designed to enable us to increase our business by selling multiple products to clients, as well as to enable the development of custom client solutions that may lead to opportunities to develop new proprietary scores or other new proprietary products.
Our DM strategy depends in part upon our ability to access new forms of data to develop custom and proprietary analytic tools.
All amounts and disclosures set forth in this Form 10-Q reflect these changes.

Revenues from these customers included amounts recorded in our other segments.
A reduction in our estimate of remaining useful lives, if any, could result in increased annual amortization expense in future periods.
At the segment level, the quarter over quarter $41.8 million increase in segment operating income was the result of a $24.8 million increase in our Scores segment operating income, a $20.3 million increase in our Applications segment operating income and a $0.7 million decrease in our Decision Management Software segment operating loss, partially offset by a $4.0 million increase in corporate expense.
While we use our best estimates and assumptions to accurately value assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the acquisition date, our estimates are inherently uncertain and subject to refinement.
Segment operating income as a percentage of segment revenue for Applications increased to 32% from 23% mainly due to an increase in sales of our higher-margin software products, partially offset by an increase in labor and personnel costs.
Our predictive analytics, which includes the industry-standard FICO® Score, and our decision management systems leverage the use of big data and mathematical algorithms to predict, categorize, and describe consumer behavior in order to power hundreds of billions of customer decisions each year.
In addition, we derive a significant share of revenues from transactional or unit-based software license fees, transactional fees derived under credit scoring, data processing, data management and SaaS subscription services arrangements, and annual software maintenance fees.
Selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenues decreased to 33% during the quarter ended June 30, 2019 from 38% during the quarter ended June 30, 2018 primarily due to increased sales of our high-margin Scores and software products.

Our revenues depend, to a great extent, upon conditions in the banking (including consumer credit) and insurance industries.
Our products have long and variable sales cycles.
The issuance of preferred stock, while providing flexibility in connection with possible acquisitions and other corporate purposes, could have the effect of making it more difficult for a third party to acquire, or discouraging a third party from acquiring, a majority of our outstanding voting stock.
Products that we plan to market in the future are in various stages of development.
The failure to obtain certain forms of model construction data from our customers or others could harm our business.
