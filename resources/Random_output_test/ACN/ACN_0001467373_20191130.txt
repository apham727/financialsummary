•Our business depends on generating and maintaining ongoing, profitable client demand for our services and solutions, including through the adaptation and expansion of our services and solutions in response to ongoing changes in technology and offerings, and a significant reduction in such demand or an inability to respond to the evolving technological environment could materially affect our results of operations.

The increase in gross margin for the first quarter of fiscal 2020 was primarily due to lower labor costs as a percentage of revenues compared to the same period in fiscal 2019.
