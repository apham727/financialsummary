Total operating expense for the first six months of 2018 was $221.4 million, or 25.2% of net sales, compared to $137.1 million, or 22.9% of net sales, for the first six months of 2017. The increase in operating expenses of $84.3 million is primarily due to incremental operating expenses related to the IXYS and U.S. Sensor acquisitions, an increase in amortization expense of $13.3 million resulting from the acquisition of IXYS as well as higher acquisition-related and integration costs of $12.3 million. Total operating expenses as a percent of net sales increased from 22.9% for the first six months of 2017 to 25.2% for the first six months of 2018 primarily due to the higher amortization expense and acquisition-related and integration charges noted above. 
The Industrial segment net sales increased $8.6 million, or 16.7%, in the first six months of 2018 compared to the first six months of 2017 due to higher volume primarily in the power fuse and relay operations.
