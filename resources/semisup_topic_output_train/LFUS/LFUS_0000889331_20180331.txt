The first quarter of 2017 includes approximately $1.5 million of non-segment charges. These were primarily attributable to acquisition-related costs primarily related to legal and integration costs associated with the Company’s acquisitions in 2016 of the ON Portfolio and PolySwitch.   
European net sales increased $40.9 million, or 69.4%, in the first quarter of 2018 compared to the first quarter of 2017.

For the first quarter of 2018, the Company recognized net sales of $417.8 million compared to $285.4 million in the first quarter of 2017 representing an increase of $132.4 million, or 46.4%. The increase was primarily driven by the acquisition of IXYS along with higher volume across all three segments. Net sales for Electronics increased $110.6 million, or 72.0%, due to the acquisition of IXYS and U.S. Sensor and strong growth across all the business units and geographic regions. Net sales for the Automotive segment increased $18.3 million, or 17.0% due to volume growth across all the segment’s business units and geographic regions. Net sales in the Industrial segment increased $3.4 million or 14.4% due to volume growth in the power fuse and relay businesses.

The decrease in net income reflects the impact of the acquisition and integration related costs of $39.5 million associated with the IXYS acquisition that were mostly offset by operating income increases across all three segments and foreign exchange gains. Additionally, the per share results reflect an increase in the weighted average diluted shares outstanding of 1.5 million as a result of the shares issued in conjunction with the acquisition of IXYS.
