Total operating expenses as a percent of net sales increased from 23.1% for the first nine months of 2017 to 24.7% for the first nine months of 2018 primarily due to the higher amortization expense and acquisition-related and integration charges noted above.
Operating income was $76.2 million, an increase of $17.6 million, or 30.1%, for the third quarter of 2018 compared to $58.6 million for the third quarter of 2017. The increase in operating income is due to the acquisition of IXYS and higher volume due to the strong demand across various end markets and geographies within our Electronics segment that was partially offset by lower operating income in the Automotive segment. Operating margins decreased from 18.4% in the third quarter of 2017 to 17.4% in the third quarter of 2018 driven by higher amortization expense, restructuring and integration charges. 
The Industrial segment net sales increased slightly by $0.1 million, or 0.4%, in the third quarter of 2018 compared to the third quarter of 2017 primarily due to higher volume across the power fuse and relay businesses despite the full exit of the Custom business during the second quarter of 2018.
