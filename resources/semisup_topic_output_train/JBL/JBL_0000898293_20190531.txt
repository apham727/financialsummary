Includes $7.6 million and $4.6 million recorded in the EMS segment, $0.0 million and $5.8 million recorded in the DMS segment and $1.7 million and $2.2 million of non-allocated charges for the three months ended May 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. Includes $12.3 million and $12.6 million recorded in the EMS segment, $2.1 million and $13.8 million recorded to the DMS segment and $1.8 million and $3.1 million of non-allocated charges for the nine months ended May 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. Except for asset write-off costs, all restructuring and related charges are cash costs.  
The Company procures components from a broad group of suppliers. Some of the products manufactured by the Company require one or more components that are available from only a single source.  
Amounts are net of tax, which are immaterial for the three months and nine months ended May 31, 2019. The amounts for the three months and nine months ended May 31, 2018, include a reduction to income tax expense related to derivative instruments of $3.0 million and $10.0 million, respectively.  
Charges, net of insurance proceeds of $5.0 million for the three months ended May 31, 2018, and $2.9 million and $21.4 million for the nine months ended May 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively, relate to business interruption and asset impairment costs associated with damage from Hurricane Maria, which impacted our operations in Cayey, Puerto Rico.  
For the three months and nine months ended May 31, 2019 and 2018, the amount primarily represented proceeds from collections reinvested in revolving-period transfers.  
Sales of the Companys products are concentrated among specific customers. During the nine months ended May 31, 2019, the Companys five largest customers accounted for approximately 43% of its net revenue and 82 customers accounted for approximately 90% of its net revenue. Sales to these customers were reported in the Electronics Manufacturing Services (EMS) and Diversified Manufacturing Services (DMS) operating segments.  
The Company is one of the leading providers of worldwide manufacturing services and solutions. The Company provides comprehensive electronics design, production and product management services to companies in various industries and end markets. The Company derives substantially all of its revenue from production and product management services (collectively referred to as manufacturing services), which encompasses the act of producing tangible products that are built to customer specifications, which are then provided to the customer.  
On September 15, 2016, the Companys Board of Directors formally approved a restructuring plan to better align the Companys global capacity and administrative support infrastructure to further optimize organizational effectiveness. This action includes headcount reductions across the Companys selling, general and administrative cost base and capacity realignment in higher cost locations (the 2017 Restructuring Plan).  
Differences primarily relate to the timing of revenue recognition for over-time customers and to the recovery of fulfillment costs.  
Revenue recognized during the nine months ended May 31, 2019 that was included in the contract liability balance as of September 1, 2018 was $350.9 million.  
During the three months ended May 31, 2019 and 2018, the Company recognized $28.3 million and $23.1 million, respectively, of foreign currency gains in cost of revenue, which are offset by the losses from the forward foreign exchange contracts. During the nine months ended May 31, 2019 and 2018, the Company recognized $24.3 million and $12.5 million, respectively, of foreign currency losses in cost of revenue, which are offset by the gains from the forward foreign exchange contracts.  Selling, general and administrative expenses increased during the nine months ended May 31, 2019, compared to the nine months ended May 31, 2018. The increase is predominantly due to (i) a $42.6 million increase in salary and salary related expenses and other costs primarily to support new business growth and development and (ii) $35.1 million in acquisition and integration charges related to our strategic collaboration with a healthcare company. The increase is partially offset by an additional $32.4 million of stock-based compensation expense recognized during the nine months ended May 31, 2018 as a result of the one-time modification of certain performance-based restricted stock unit awards and a one-time cash-settled award.  
For the three months and nine months ended May 31, 2019, gross profit for our DMS segment increased as a percentage of net revenue due to improved profitability across the various businesses. This increase was offset by a decrease in gross profit as a percentage of net revenue in our EMS segment due to continued weakness in the capital equipment business and ramp costs associated with new business awards. As a result, gross profit remained relatively consistent as a percentage of net revenue during the three months and nine months ended May 31, 2019, compared to the three months and nine months ended May 31, 2018.  
See Note 14  New Accounting Guidance to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of recent accounting guidance.  
Net revenue increased during the three months ended May 31, 2019, compared to the three months ended May 31, 2018. Specifically, the EMS segment revenues increased 26% primarily due to (i) a 9% increase in revenues from new customers within our cloud business, (ii) a 9% increase in revenues from existing customers within our industrial and energy business, (iii) an 8% increase in revenues from customers within our networking and telecommunications business and (iv) a 6% increase in revenues from existing customers within our print and retail business. The increase is partially offset by a 6% decrease from existing customers within our computing and storage business and capital equipment business, which we expect to remain weak into the second half of calendar year 2020. DMS segment revenues decreased 6% due to a 15% decrease in revenues from customers within our mobility business as a result of decreased end user product demand, which we expect to remain weak for the balance of the fiscal year. The decrease was partially offset by a 9% increase in revenues from existing customers in our healthcare business.  
Effective September 1, 2018, our revenue recognition accounting policies changed in conjunction with the adoption of the new revenue recognition standard. Upon adoption, we recognize revenue over time as manufacturing services are completed for the majority of our contracts with customers, which results in revenue being recognized earlier than under the previous guidance. Revenue for all other contracts with customers will be recognized at a point in time, upon transfer of control of the product to the customer, which is effectively no change to our historical accounting. For further discussion of the new revenue recognition standard, refer to Note 16  Revenue to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements.  
Amortization of intangibles decreased during the three months and nine months ended May 31, 2019, compared to the three months and nine months ended May 31, 2018, primarily due to intangible assets related to the Nypro acquisition, which were fully amortized during fiscal year 2018.   Item 1.
