Cost of inventories for certain material is determined using the last-in-first-out (LIFO) method and totaled approximately $29.2 million at June 30, 2019 and $29.5 million at December 31, 2018. An actual valuation of inventories under the LIFO method can be made only at the end of the year based on the inventory levels and costs at that time. Accordingly, interim LIFO calculations are based on management’s estimates of expected year-end inventory levels and costs. Because these estimates are subject to change and may be different than the actual inventory levels and costs at the end of the year, interim results are subject to the final year-end LIFO inventory valuation. During the three and six-month periods ended June 30, 2019, the net change in LIFO inventories resulted in no change and $.3 million of expense, respectively, to Income before income taxes. During the three and six-month periods ended June 30, 2018, the net change in LIFO inventories resulted in $.2 million and $.4 million of expense, respectively, to Income before income taxes. 
For the performance-based RSUs, the number of RSUs in which the participants will vest depends on the Company’s level of performance measured by growth in either operating or pre-tax income and sales growth over a requisite performance period.

Performance-based compensation expense for the three and six-month periods ended June 30, 2019 was $.9 million and $1.7 million, respectively. Performance-based compensation expense for the three and six-month periods ended June 30, 2018 was $.7 million and $1.4 million, respectively.

Net sales include products and shipping and handling charges, net of estimates for product returns. Revenue is measured as the amount of consideration the Company expects to receive in exchange for transferring products. All revenue is recognized when the Company satisfies the performance obligations under the contract and control of the product is transferred to the customer, primarily based on shipping terms. Revenue for shipping and handling charges are recognized at the time the products are shipped to, delivered to or picked up by the customer. The Company estimates product returns based on historical return rates.
