For the performance-based RSUs, the number of RSUs in which the participants will vest depends on the Company’s level of performance measured by growth in either operating or pre-tax income and sales growth over a requisite performance period. Depending on the extent to which the performance criterions are satisfied under the LTIP and the Incentive Plan, the participants are eligible to earn common shares over the vesting period. RSU’s forfeited in 2018 are those from the 2015 grants for which pre-tax income and sales growth performance were not achieved. Performance-based compensation expense for the three months ended March 31, 2018 and 2017 was $.7 million and $.4 million, respectively. As of March 31, 2018, the remaining compensation expense of $5.4 million for outstanding performance-based RSU’s is expected to be recognized over a period of approximately 2.1 years. 
For the three months ended March 31, 2018 and 2017, 12,000 and 33,350 stock options, respectively, were excluded from the calculation of diluted earnings per share as the effect would have been anti-dilutive.  
Net sales include products and shipping and handling charges, net of estimates for product returns. Revenue is measured as the amount of consideration the Company expects to receive in exchange for transferring products. All revenue is recognized when the Company satisfies the performance obligations under the contract and control of the product is transferred to the customer, primarily based on shipping terms. Revenue for shipping and handling charges are recognized at the time the products are shipped to, delivered to or picked up by the customer. The Company estimates product returns based on historical return rates.  
As all stock options from the 1999 Stock Option Plan are fully vested, the Company recorded no compensation expense related to stock options for the three months ended March 31, 2018 and 2017.
