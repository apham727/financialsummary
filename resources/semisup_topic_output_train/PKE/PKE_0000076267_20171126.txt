The Company’s total net sales worldwide in the 13 weeks ended November 26, 2017 decreased to $26.1 million from $26.5 million in the 13 weeks ended November 27, 2016 primarily as a result of lower sales of the Company’s printed circuit materials products in Asia and North America, partially offset by higher sales of the Company’s aerospace composite materials, structures and assemblies. The Company’s total net sales worldwide in the 39 weeks ended November 26, 2017 decreased to $83.4 million from $87.0 million in the 39 weeks ended November 27, 2016 primarily as a result of lower sales of the Company’s printed circuit materials products in Asia and North America, partially offset by higher sales of the Company’s aerospace composite materials, structures and assemblies.  
For the reasons set forth above, the Company’s earnings from operations were $801,000 and $867,000, respectively, for the 13 weeks and 39 weeks ended November 26, 2017, which included the aforementioned restructuring charges of $472,000 and $4.7 million, respectively, and the $375,000 litigation expense in the 39-week period, compared to $1.9 million and $7.4 million, respectively, for the 13 weeks and 39 weeks ended November 27, 2016, which included the aforementioned restructuring charges of $113,000 and $206,000, respectively. 
The Company’s total net sales of its aerospace composite materials, structures and assemblies products were $10.2 million and $30.3 million, respectively, in the 13 weeks and 39 weeks ended November 26, 2017, or 39% and 36%, respectively, of the Company’s total net sales worldwide in such periods, compared to $7.5 million and $24.0 million, respectively, in the 13 weeks and 39 weeks ended November 27, 2016, or 28% of the Company’s total net sales worldwide in each such periods. The Company’s total net sales of its printed circuit materials products were $15.9 million and $53.1 million, respectively, in the 13 weeks and 39 weeks ended November 26, 2017, or 61% and 64%, respectively, of the Company’s total net sales worldwide in such periods, compared to $19.0 million and $63.0 million, respectively, in the 13 weeks and 39 weeks ended November 27, 2016, or 72% of the Company’s total net sales worldwide in each such periods.  
The Company’s earnings from operations and net earnings were 88% and 61% lower, respectively, in the 39 weeks ended November 26, 2017 than in last fiscal year’s comparable period primarily as a result of the restructuring charges related to the consolidation of the Company’s electronics Business Units and advisory fees mentioned above, a one-time litigation expense of $375,000, the aforementioned decrease in sales and reduction in the gross profit margin and a higher effective tax rate compared to last year’s comparable period.

The Company’s total net sales worldwide in the 13 weeks ended November 26, 2017 were lower than such sales in the 13 weeks ended August 27, 2017 primarily as a result of lower sales of the Company’s printed circuit materials in the 13 weeks ended November 26, 2017.  
During the 13-week and 39-week periods ended November 26, 2017, total net sales worldwide of high performance printed circuit materials were 92% and 93%, respectively, of the Company’s total net sales worldwide of printed circuit materials compared to the 13-week and 39-week periods ended November 27, 2016, during which total net sales worldwide of high performance printed circuit materials were 94% and 93% respectively, of the Company’s total net sales worldwide of printed circuit materials.
