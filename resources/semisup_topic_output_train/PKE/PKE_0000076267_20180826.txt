The higher gross profit margin from continuing operations for the 26 weeks ended August 26, 2018 compared to the 26 weeks ended August 27, 2017 was principally a result of higher sales in the 26 weeks ended August 26, 2018 compared to the 26 weeks ended August 27, 2017.

The lower gross profit margin from continuing operations for the 13 weeks ended August 26, 2018 compared to the 13 weeks ended August 27, 2017 was principally due to the lower sales in the 13 weeks ended August 26, 2018 compared to the 13 weeks ended August 27, 2017.

The Company’s net earnings from discontinued operations were higher in the 26-week period ended August 26, 2018 than in last fiscal year’s comparable period, primarily as a result of lower restructuring charges and higher sales, compared to last year’s comparable period, and a one-time litigation expense of $375,000 in the 26-week period ended August 27, 2017.
The Company’s net earnings from discontinued operations were higher in the 13 weeks ended August 26, 2018 compared to the 13 weeks ended August 27, 2017 primarily as a result of lower restructuring charges, partially offset by lower sales, compared to last year’s comparable period.
