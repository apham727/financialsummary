Our future success depends upon our ability to execute our business strategy, continue to innovate, improve our existing products, design, develop, produce and market new products, and identify and enter new markets.
We may not be able to compete successfully in markets within the semiconductor industry in the future.
•negative media publicity targeting us or our suppliers, customers or competitors.
Our operating results are dependent on the performance of independent distributors.
We rely on information technology systems throughout our company to keep financial records and customer data, process orders, manage inventory, coordinate shipments to customers, maintain confidential and proprietary information, assist in semiconductor engineering and other technical activities and operate other critical functions such as Internet connectivity, network communications and email. Our information technology systems may be susceptible to damage, disruptions or shutdowns due to power outages, hardware failures, telecommunication failures, employee malfeasance, user errors, catastrophes or other unforeseen events. We also rely upon external cloud providers for certain infrastructure activities. If we were to experience a prolonged disruption in the information technology systems that involve our internal communications or our interactions with customers or suppliers, it could result in the loss of sales and customers and significant incremental costs, which could adversely affect our business. We may also be subject to security breaches of our information technology systems 
The Company has a 52-53 week fiscal year that ends on the Saturday closest to the last day in October. Fiscal 2019 is a 52-week fiscal year and fiscal 2018 was a 53-week fiscal year. The additional week in fiscal 2018 was included in the first quarter ended February 3, 2018. Therefore, the first three months of fiscal 2019 included one less week of operations as compared to the first three months of fiscal 2018. Certain amounts reported in previous periods have been reclassified to conform to the fiscal 2019 presentation.
We face intense competition in the semiconductor industry, and we expect this competition to increase in the future, including from companies located outside of the United States. Competition is generally based on innovation, design, quality and reliability of products, product performance, features and functionality, product pricing, availability and capacity, technological service and support, and the availability of integrated system solutions, with the relative importance of these factors varying among products, markets and customers. Many companies have sufficient financial, manufacturing, technical, sales and marketing resources to develop and market products that compete with our products. Some of our competitors may have more advantageous supply or development relationships with our current and potential customers or suppliers. Our 
To remain competitive, we may need to invest in or acquire other companies, purchase or license technology from third parties, or enter into other strategic transactions in order to introduce new products or enhance our existing products.
An element of our business strategy involves expansion through the acquisitions of businesses, assets, products or technologies that allow us to complement our existing product offerings, diversify our product portfolio, expand our market coverage, increase our engineering workforce, expand our technical skill sets or enhance our technological capabilities. We may not be able to find businesses that have the technology or resources we need and, if we find such businesses, we may not be able to invest in, purchase or license the technology or resources on commercially favorable terms or at all. Acquisitions, investments and technology licenses are difficult to identify and complete for a number of reasons, including the cost of potential transactions, competition among prospective buyers and licensees, the need for regulatory approvals, and difficulties related to integration efforts. In addition, investments in private companies are subject to a risk of a partial or total loss of our investment. Both in the U.S. and abroad, governmental regulation of acquisitions, including antitrust reviews and approvals, has become more complex, increasing the costs and risks of undertaking and consummating significant acquisitions. In order to finance a potential transaction, we may need to raise additional funds by issuing securities or borrowing money. We may not be able to obtain financing on favorable terms, and the sale of our stock may result in the dilution of our existing shareholders or the issuance of securities with rights that are superior to the rights of our common shareholders.
•increased risk of costly and time-consuming legal proceedings.Industrial, Automotive and Consumer end market revenues decreased in the three-month period ended February 2, 2019, as compared to the same period of the prior fiscal year, primarily as a result of one less week of operations in the first quarter of fiscal 2019 as compared to the first quarter of fiscal 2018. In addition, Consumer end market revenues decreased in the three-month period ended February 2, 2019, as compared to the same period of the prior fiscal year as a result of decreased demand for products used in portable consumer applications. Communications end market revenue increased in the three-month period ended February 2, 2019, as compared to the same period of the prior fiscal year, as a result of a broad-based increase in demand for our products sold into this end market, partially offset by one less week of operations in the first quarter of fiscal 2019 as compared to the first quarter of fiscal 2018.
Gross margin percentage decreased by 90 basis points in the three-month period ended February 2, 2019, as compared to the same period of the prior fiscal year, primarily as a result of a higher concentration of our revenue from lower margin products.
The increase in cash used for investing activities during the three-month period ended February 2, 2019, as compared to the same period of the prior fiscal year, was primarily the result of an increase in capital spending. 
The fiscal year ending November 2, 2019 (fiscal 2019) is a 52-week year and the fiscal year ended November 3, 2018 (fiscal 2018) was a 53-week year.
