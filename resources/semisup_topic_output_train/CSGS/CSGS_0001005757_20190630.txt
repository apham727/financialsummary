Cost of Maintenance (Exclusive of Depreciation). The cost of maintenance for the (i) second quarter of 2019 was $5.4 million, a slight decrease from $5.7 million for the second quarter of 2018; and (ii) and six months ended June 30, 2019 decreased 4% to $10.8 million, from $11.3 million for the six months ended June 30, 2018. Total cost of maintenance as a percentage of our maintenance revenues for the second quarters of 2019 and 2018 were 46.7% and 46.1%, respectively; and (ii) six months ended June 30, 2019 and 2018 were 45.7% and 46.2%, respectively.  
Revenues. Revenues for the second quarter of 2019 were $245.9 million, a 15% increase when compared to revenues of $213.0 million for the second quarter of 2018, with the increase mainly attributed to the additional revenues generated from the acquisition of Forte on October 1, 2018, and the continued growth in our cloud solutions and managed service arrangements. 
Operating Results. Operating income for the second quarter of 2019 was $30.3 million, or a 12.3% operating margin percentage, compared to $24.1 million, or an 11.3% operating margin percentage for the second quarter of 2018. The increase in operating income is primarily a result of the combination of higher revenues generated in the second quarter of 2019 and prudent expense management, including lower restructuring costs.

Operating Cash Flows. As described in the Liquidity section above, we believe we have the ability to generate strong cash flows to fund our operating activities and act as a source of funds for our capital resource needs.  
We generate approximately 60% of our revenues from the North American cable and satellite markets, approximately 20% of our revenues from global wireline and wireless communication providers, and the remainder from a variety of other verticals, such as financial services, healthcare, logistics, and transportation. Additionally, during the six months ended June 30, 2019 we generated 87% of our revenues from the Americas region, 9% of our revenues from the Europe, Middle East and Africa region, and 4% of our revenues from the Asia Pacific region. 
We continue to transition our focus towards more predictable recurring revenues models with our managed services arrangements and delivery of our cloud-based solutions and away from large transformational software and services deals with related maintenance agreements. 
Cash and Cash Flows. As of June 30, 2019, we had cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments of $131.5 million, as compared to $141.9 million as of March 31, 2019 and $162.9 million as of December 31, 2018. Our cash flows from operating activities for the quarter ended June 30, 2019 were $15.6 million. See the Liquidity section below for further discussion of our cash flows. 
During the first quarter of 2018, we refinanced our 2015 Credit Agreement and as a result, we repaid the outstanding principal balance of $120.0 million and borrowed $150.0 million under the 2018 Credit Agreement, resulting in a net increase of available cash of $30.0 million. As part of the refinancing, we paid $1.5 million of deferred financing costs.  
During the six months ended June 30, 2019, we repurchased 0.4 million shares of our common stock for $15.8 million (weighted-average price of $40.31 per share).  During the six months ended June 30, 2019, we generated approximately 88% of our revenues in U.S. dollars. We expect that, in the foreseeable future, we will continue to generate a very large percentage of our revenues in U.S. dollars.  
Due to foreign operations around the world, our balance sheet and income statement are exposed to foreign currency exchange risk due to the fluctuations in the value of currencies in which we conduct business. While we attempt to maximize natural hedges by incurring expenses in the same currency in which we contract revenue, the related expenses for that revenue could be in one or more differing currencies than the revenue stream.
