 Operating Income.  Operating income for the first quarter of 2018 was $25.8 million, or 12.8% of total revenues, compared to $27.0 million, or 14.0% of total revenues for the first quarter of 2017. The decrease in operating income and operating income margin percentage can be mainly attributed to the $2.4 million of acquisition-related costs. 
Operating Results. Operating income for the first quarter of 2018 was $25.8 million, or a 12.8% operating income margin percentage, compared to $27.0 million, or a 14.0% operating income margin percentage for the first quarter of 2017, with the decreases in operating income and operating income margin percentage mainly attributed to the $2.4 million of Business Ink acquisition-related costs. 
As discussed in Note 5 to the Financial Statements, on February 28, 2017 we acquired Business Ink, a multi-channel communications company based in Austin, Texas, for approximately $70 million, excluding acquisition-related expenses. This represents a purchase price of slightly over one times historical revenues. For the first quarter of 2018, Business Ink contributed $5.2 million of cloud and related solutions revenues and was neutral to our results of operations for the quarter when factoring in acquired amortization expense. At this time, for the full year 2018 we expect that Business Ink will contribute approximately $50 million of revenue for the ten months of 2018 and decrease our results of operations by approximately 5%. After we complete our integration plan for Business Ink over the next year or so, we believe it will then be accretive to our earnings on a go forward basis.  
The components of total expenses are discussed in more detail below. 
Cost of Cloud and Related Solutions (Exclusive of Depreciation). The cost of cloud and related solutions for the first quarter of 2018 increased 14% to $86.9 million, from $76.1 million for the first quarter of 2017. This increase relates almost entirely to the adoption of ASC 606, which resulted in $6.3 million of costs, previously classified as cost of software and services and maintenance, now being classified as cost of cloud and related solutions, and one month of cloud and related solutions expense from the acquired Business Ink business. Total cloud and related solutions cost as a percentage of cloud and related solutions revenues for the first quarters of 2018 and 2017 were 49.0% and 47.9%, respectively, with the increase attributed to the reclassifications resulting from the adoption of ASC 606. 
Cost of Maintenance (Exclusive of Depreciation). The cost of maintenance for the first quarter of 2018 decreased 46% to $5.7 million, from $10.4 million for the first quarter of 2017. Total cost of maintenance as a percentage of our maintenance revenues for the first quarters of 2018 and 2017 were 46.2% and 55.7%, respectively. These decreases can be attributed to the adoption of ASC 606, which resulted in $5.1 million of costs, previously classified as maintenance, now being classified as cost of cloud and related solutions.  
Maintenance Revenues. Maintenance revenues for the first quarter of 2018 were $12.2 million, a 34% decrease when compared to $18.6 million for the first quarter of 2017, with the decrease mainly due to the adoption of ASC 606, which resulted in $5.1 million of revenue previously classified as maintenance now being classified as cloud and related solutions.  
As a result of the adoption of ASC 606, $1.5 million of investments in client contracts have been reclassified to operating activities from investing activities for the first quarter ended March 31, 2018.

Cloud and Related Solutions Revenues. Cloud and related solutions revenues for the first quarter of 2018 were $177.5 million, a 12% increase when compared to $158.8 million for the first quarter of 2017. The increase in cloud and related solutions revenues is primarily due to the adoption of ASC 606 which resulted in $7.0 million of revenue previously classified as software and services and maintenance revenue now being classified as cloud and related solutions revenues, and the $5.2 million of revenues generated by the acquired Business Ink business. The remaining increase is mainly attributed to the execution of additional managed services arrangements, an increase in ancillary services revenues, and the conversion of approximately four million customer accounts onto ACP over the past twelve months.  
Diluted EPS. Diluted EPS for the first quarter of 2018 was $0.42 compared to $0.62 for the first quarter of 2017, with the decrease mainly attributed to a lower effective income tax rate of 9% for the first quarter of 2017, compared to an effective income tax rate of 31% for the current quarter. The lower first quarter 2017 income tax rate of 9% was primarily the result of an approximately $5 million net income tax benefit resulting from Comcast’s exercise of 1.4 million vested stock warrants in January 2017. 
Cost of Software and Services (Exclusive of Depreciation). The cost of software and services for the first quarter of 2018 decreased 24% to $8.5 million, from $11.3 million for the first quarter of 2017. This decrease is reflective of the decrease in revenues as personnel and the related costs previously allocated to professional services projects have been reassigned to other areas of the business. Total software and services cost as a percentage of our software and services revenues for the first quarters of 2018 and 2017 were 71.4% and 74.9%, respectively.

During the first quarter of 2018, we generated approximately 87% of our revenues in U.S. dollars. We expect that, in the foreseeable future, we will continue to generate a very large percentage of our revenues in U.S. dollars.  
Due to foreign operations around the world, our balance sheet and income statement are exposed to foreign currency exchange risk due to the fluctuations in the value of currencies in which we conduct business. While we attempt to maximize natural hedges by incurring expenses in the same currency in which we contract revenue, the related expenses for that revenue could be in one or more differing currencies than the revenue stream.
