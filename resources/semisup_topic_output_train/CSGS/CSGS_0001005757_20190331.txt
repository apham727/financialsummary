The cost of cloud and related solutions for the first quarter of 2019 increased 32% to $114.7 million, from $86.9 million for the first quarter of 2018. This increase can be mainly attributed to the cloud and related solutions expense of the acquired Business Ink and Forte businesses included in our results, to include acquisition amortization, and increased employee-related costs. Total cloud and related solutions cost as a percentage of cloud and related solutions revenues for the first quarters of 2019 and 2018 were 52.2% and 49.0%, respectively (with the first quarter of 2019 reflective of the transaction fees of $17.1 million).

Cloud and related solutions revenues for the first quarter of 2019 were $219.6 million, a 24% increase when compared to $177.5 million for the first quarter of 2018.

Revenues. Revenues for the first quarter of 2019 were $244.8 million, a 21% increase when compared to revenues of $201.7 million for the first quarter of 2018, with the increase mainly attributed to the additional revenues generated from the acquisitions of Forte on October 1, 2018 and Business Ink on February 28, 2018, and the continued growth in our cloud solutions and managed service arrangements.

Depreciation. Depreciation expense for the first quarter of 2019 increased 31% to $5.1 million, from $3.9 million for the first quarter of 2018.

Due to foreign operations around the world, our balance sheet and income statement are exposed to foreign currency exchange risk due to the fluctuations in the value of currencies in which we conduct business. While we attempt to maximize natural hedges by incurring expenses in the same currency in which we contract revenue, the related expenses for that revenue could be in one or more differing currencies than the revenue stream.
