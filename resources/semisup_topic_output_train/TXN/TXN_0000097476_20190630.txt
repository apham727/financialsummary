Our centralized manufacturing and support organizations, such as facilities, procurement and logistics, provide support to our operating segments, including those in Other. Costs incurred by these organizations, including depreciation, are charged to the segments on a per-unit basis. Consequently, depreciation expense is not an independently identifiable component within the segments’ results and, therefore, is not provided. 
Interest and debt expense was $44 million and $30 million for the second quarters of 2019 and 2018, respectively, and $82 million and $53 million for the first six months of 2019 and 2018, respectively. This was net of the amortized discounts, premiums and issuance costs. Capitalized interest was not material. 
1. Description of business, including segment and geographic area information 
Total shares of 3,264,965 and 8,976,983 were issued from treasury shares during the second quarter and first six months of 2019, respectively, related to stock compensation. 
Potentially dilutive securities representing 7 million and 5 million shares of common stock that were outstanding during the second quarters of 2019 and 2018, and 9 million and 5 million shares outstanding during the first six months of 2019 and 2018, respectively, were excluded from the computation of diluted earnings per common share during these periods because their effect would have been anti-dilutive. 
Proceeds from sales, redemptions and maturities of short-term available-for-sale investments were $200 million and $1.38 billion for the second quarters of 2019 and 2018, respectively, and $1.78 billion and $2.83 billion for the first six months of 2019 and 2018, respectively. Gross realized gains and losses from these sales were not material. 
In April 2019, we sold our manufacturing facility in Greenock, Scotland. Inventory was $2.08 billion, a decrease of $138 million from the end of 2018. Days of inventory at the end of the second quarter of 2019 were 143 compared with 152 at the end of 2018. 
Other revenue decreased by $40 million. Operating profit increased by $18 million. 
Other revenue decreased by $57 million. Operating profit increased by $6 million. 
Investing activities for the first six months of 2019 provided $915 million compared with $185 million in the year-ago period. Capital expenditures were $535 million compared with $438 million in the year-ago period and were primarily for semiconductor manufacturing equipment in both periods. We had sales of short-term investments, net of purchases, that provided cash proceeds of $1.40 billion compared with $621 million in the year-ago period. 
In our core businesses, Analog revenue declined 6% and Embedded Processing declined 16% from the same quarter a year ago. 
Gross profit of $4.62 billion was down $445 million, or 9%, primarily due to lower revenue. As a percentage of revenue, gross profit decreased to 63.6% from 64.9%. 
Gross profit of $2.36 billion was down $259 million, or 10%, due to lower revenue. As a percentage of revenue, gross profit decreased to 64.3% from 65.2%. 
Revenue of $3.67 billion decreased $349 million, or 9%, primarily due to lower revenue from Analog and Embedded Processing. 
Revenue decreased 9% from the same quarter a year ago due to broad-based weakness. 
Our cash flow from operations of $7.2 billion for the trailing 12 months again underscored the strength of our business model. Free cash flow for the trailing 12 months was $5.9 billion and 39% of revenue. This reflects the quality of our product portfolio, as well as the efficiency of our manufacturing strategy, including the benefit of 300-millimeter Analog production.
