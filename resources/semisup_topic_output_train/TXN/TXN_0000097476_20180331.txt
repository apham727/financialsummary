Our centralized manufacturing and support organizations, such as facilities, procurement and logistics, provide support to our operating segments, including those in Other. Costs incurred by these organizations, including depreciation, are charged to the segments on a per-unit basis. Consequently, depreciation expense is not an independently identifiable component within the segmentsâ€™ results and, therefore, is not provided. 
Revenue from products shipped into China, including Hong Kong, was $1.6 billion and $1.5 billion in the three months ended March 31, 2018, and March 31, 2017, respectively. 
Our Provision for income taxes was $187 million and $258 million for the first quarters of 2018 and 2017, respectively.  
As of March 31, 2018, we had contract assets of $273 million. During the three months ended March 31, 2018, our contract assets were reduced by $10 million, due to $14 million of cash received offset by $4 million of income recognized. 
We recognize shipping fees, if any, received from customers in revenue. We include shipping and handling costs in COR. The majority of our customers pay these fees directly to third parties.  
1. Description of business, including segment and geographic area information 
Interest and debt expense was $23 million and $18 million for the first quarters of 2018 and 2017, respectively. This was net of the amortization of the debt discounts, premiums and debt issuance costs. Capitalized interest was not material. 
Goodwill was $4.36 billion as of March 31, 2018, and December 31, 2017. There was no impairment of goodwill during the three months ended March 31, 2018, or March 31, 2017. 
The following geographic area information includes revenue based on product shipment destination. The revenue information is not necessarily indicative of the geographic area in which the end applications containing our products are ultimately consumed because our products tend to be shipped to the locations where our customers manufacture their products. Specifically, many of our products are shipped to our customers in China who may include these parts in the manufacture of their own end products, which they may in turn export to their customers around the world. Revenue increased $387 million, or 11 percent, due to higher revenue from Analog and Embedded Processing. 
Investing activities for the first three months of 2018 provided $266 million compared with $267 million in the year-ago period. Capital expenditures were $189 million compared with $127 million in the year-ago period and were primarily for semiconductor manufacturing equipment in both periods. We had proceeds from sales of short-term investments, net of purchases, that provided cash of $459 million compared with $363 million in the year-ago period. 
Revenue increased 11 percent from the same quarter a year ago. Demand for our Analog and Embedded Processing products continued to be strong in the industrial and automotive markets. 
Gross profit of $2.45 billion was up $303 million, or 14 percent, due to higher revenue and lower manufacturing costs. As a percentage of revenue, gross profit increased to 64.6 percent from 63.0 percent. 
Our cash flow from operations of $5.7 billion for the trailing 12 months again underscored the strength of our business model. Free cash flow for the trailing 12 months was up 17 percent from a year ago to $4.9 billion, or 32.1 percent of revenue. This reflects the quality of our product portfolio, as well as the efficiency of our manufacturing strategy, including the benefit of 300-millimeter Analog production. 
We now expect our ongoing annual operating tax rate to be about 16 percent starting in 2019 and 20 percent in 2018, lower than our previous expectation of 18 percent and 23 percent, respectively. 
Other revenue decreased by $46 million, and operating profit declined by $23 million. 
Our primary source of liquidity is cash flow from operations. Additional sources of liquidity are Cash and cash equivalents, Short-term investments and a variable-rate, revolving credit facility. Cash flows from operating activities for the first three months of 2018 were $1.11 billion, an increase of $317 million from the year-ago period. This increase was primarily due to higher Net income. The following table contains information regarding our purchases of our common stock during the quarter.
