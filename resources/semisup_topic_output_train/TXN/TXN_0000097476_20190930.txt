Our centralized manufacturing and support organizations, such as facilities, procurement and logistics, provide support to our operating segments, including those in Other. Costs incurred by these organizations, including depreciation, are charged to the segments on a per-unit basis. Consequently, depreciation expense is not an independently identifiable component within the segments’ results and, therefore, is not provided.
Interest and debt expense was $43 million and $36 million for the third quarters of 2019 and 2018, respectively, and $125 million and $89 million for the first nine months of 2019 and 2018, respectively. This was net of the amortized discounts, premiums and issuance costs. Capitalized interest was not material.

Investing activities for the first nine months of 2019 provided $1 million compared with $1.58 billion of cash used in the year-ago period. Capital expenditures were $684 million compared with $808 million in the year-ago period and were primarily for semiconductor manufacturing equipment in both periods. Short-term investments provided cash of $630 million compared with $763 million of cash used in the year-ago period.
In our core businesses, Analog revenue declined 8% and Embedded Processing declined 19% from the same quarter a year ago.
Gross profit of $7.07 billion was down $803 million, or 10%, primarily due to lower revenue. As a percentage of revenue, gross profit decreased to 64.1% from 65.2%.
Gross profit of $2.45 billion was down $358 million, or 13%, due to lower revenue. As a percentage of revenue, gross profit decreased to 64.9% from 65.8%.

Our cash flow from operations of $7.0 billion for the trailing 12 months again underscored the strength of our business model. Free cash flow for the trailing 12 months was $6.0 billion and 41% of revenue. This reflects the quality of our product portfolio, as well as the efficiency of our manufacturing strategy, including the benefit of 300-millimeter Analog production.101.insXBRL Instance Document – the instance document does not appear in the Interactive Data File because its XBRL tags are embedded within the Inline XBRL document.†
