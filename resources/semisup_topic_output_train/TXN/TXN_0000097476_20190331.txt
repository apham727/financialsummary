Our centralized manufacturing and support organizations, such as facilities, procurement and logistics, provide support to our operating segments, including those in Other. Costs incurred by these organizations, including depreciation, are charged to the segments on a per-unit basis. Consequently, depreciation expense is not an independently identifiable component within the segmentsâ€™ results and, therefore, is not provided. 
1. Description of business, including segment and geographic area information 
Revenue from products shipped into China was $1.7 billion and $1.6 billion in the first quarters of 2019 and 2018, respectively. 
The following geographic area information includes revenue based on product shipment destination. The revenue information is not necessarily indicative of the geographic area in which the end applications containing our products are ultimately consumed because our products tend to be shipped to the locations where our customers manufacture their products. Specifically, many of our products are shipped to our customers in China who may include these parts in the manufacture of their own end products, which they may in turn export to their customers around the world. 
Interest and debt expense was $38 million and $23 million for the first quarters of 2019 and 2018, respectively. This was net of the amortized discounts, premiums and issuance costs. Capitalized interest was not material. 
Goodwill was $4.36 billion as of March 31, 2019, and December 31, 2018. There was no impairment of goodwill during the first three months of 2019 or 2018. 
Potentially dilutive securities representing 9 million and 5 million shares of common stock that were outstanding during the first quarters of 2019 and 2018, respectively, were excluded from the computation of diluted earnings per common share during these periods because their effect would have been anti-dilutive. 
Proceeds from sales, redemptions and maturities of short-term available-for-sale investments were $1.58 billion and $1.46 billion for the first quarters of 2019 and 2018, respectively. Gross realized gains and losses from these sales were not material. Inventory was $2.13 billion, a decrease of $86 million from the end of 2018. Days of inventory at the end of the first quarter of 2019 were 144 compared with 152 at the end of 2018. 
Other revenue decreased by $17 million, and operating profit decreased by $12 million. 
In our core businesses, Analog revenue declined 2% and Embedded Processing declined 14% from the same quarter a year ago. 
Investing activities for the first three months of 2019 provided $1.17 billion compared with $266 million in the year-ago period. Capital expenditures were $251 million compared with $189 million in the year-ago period and were primarily for semiconductor manufacturing equipment in both periods. We had sales of short-term investments, net of purchases, that provided cash proceeds of $1.44 billion compared with $459 million in the year-ago period. 
Our cash flow from operations of $7.2 billion for the trailing 12 months again underscored the strength of our business model. Free cash flow for the trailing 12 months was $6.0 billion and represents 38.4% of revenue. This reflects the quality of our product portfolio, as well as the efficiency of our manufacturing strategy, including the benefit of 300-millimeter Analog production. 
We continue to expect our annual operating tax rate to be about 16% in 2019. 
Revenue of $3.59 billion decreased $195 million, or 5%, due to lower revenue from Embedded Processing and Analog. 
Gross profit of $2.26 billion was down $186 million, or 8%, due to lower revenue and reduced factory loadings. As a percentage of revenue, gross profit decreased to 62.9% from 64.6%. 
Accounts receivable were $1.44 billion, an increase of $233 million compared with the end of 2018. Days sales outstanding at the end of the first quarter of 2019 were 36 compared with 29 at the end of 2018. The following table contains information regarding our purchases of our common stock during the quarter.
