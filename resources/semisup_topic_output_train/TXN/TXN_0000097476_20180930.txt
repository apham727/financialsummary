Our Provision for income taxes was $354 million and $504 million for the third quarters of 2018 and 2017, respectively, and $842 million and $1.19 billion for the first nine months of 2018 and 2017, respectively.  
Interest and debt expense was $36 million and $19 million for the third quarters of 2018 and 2017, respectively, and $89 million and $57 million for the first nine months of 2018 and 2017, respectively. This was net of the amortization of the debt discounts, premiums and debt issuance costs. Capitalized interest was not material. 
Our centralized manufacturing and support organizations, such as facilities, procurement and logistics, provide support to our operating segments, including those in Other. Costs incurred by these organizations, including depreciation, are charged to the segments on a per-unit basis. Consequently, depreciation expense is not an independently identifiable component within the segmentsâ€™ results and, therefore, is not provided. 
We recognize shipping fees, if any, received from customers in revenue. We include shipping and handling costs in COR. The majority of our customers pay these fees directly to third parties.  
1. Description of business, including segment and geographic area information 
Revenue from products shipped into China, including Hong Kong, was $2.0 billion and $1.8 billion in the third quarters of 2018 and 2017, respectively, and $5.3 billion and $4.9 billion in the first nine months of 2018 and 2017, respectively. 
Total shares of 1,279,482 and 10,308,301 were issued from treasury shares during the third quarter and first nine months of 2018, respectively, related to stock compensation. 
The following geographic area information includes revenue based on product shipment destination. The revenue information is not necessarily indicative of the geographic area in which the end applications containing our products are ultimately consumed because our products tend to be shipped to the locations where our customers manufacture their products. Specifically, many of our products are shipped to our customers in China who may include these parts in the manufacture of their own end products, which they may in turn export to their customers around the world. 
Potentially dilutive securities representing 4 million and 5 million shares of common stock that were outstanding during the third quarters of 2018 and 2017, and 4 million and 6 million shares outstanding during the first nine months of 2018 and 2017, respectively, were excluded from the computation of diluted earnings per common share for these periods because their effect would have been anti-dilutive. Revenue of $4.26 billion increased $145 million, or 4 percent, due to higher revenue from Analog, partially offset by lower revenue from Embedded Processing.  
Gross profit of $7.87 billion was up $696 million, or 10 percent, primarily due to higher revenue. As a percentage of revenue, gross profit increased to 65.2 percent from 64.0 percent. 
Gross profit of $2.80 billion was up $148 million, or 6 percent, primarily due to higher revenue. As a percentage of revenue, gross profit increased to 65.8 percent from 64.5 percent. 
In our core businesses, Analog revenue grew 8 percent and Embedded Processing declined 4 percent from the same quarter a year ago. 
Embedded Processing revenue decreased due to Processors. Connected Microcontrollers revenue was about even. Operating profit decreased primarily due to lower revenue. 
Investing activities for the first nine months of 2018 used $1.58 billion compared with $229 million in the year-ago period. Capital expenditures were $808 million compared with $464 million in the year-ago period and were primarily for semiconductor manufacturing equipment in both periods. We had purchases of short-term investments, net of sales, that used cash of $763 million compared with proceeds from sales of short-term investments, net of purchases, that provided cash of $200 million in the year-ago period. 
Analog revenue increased due to Power and Signal Chain. High Volume revenue decreased. Operating profit increased primarily due to higher revenue and associated gross profit. 
Our cash flow from operations of $7.0 billion for the trailing 12 months again underscored the strength of our business model. Free cash flow for the trailing 12 months was $5.9 billion, or 37.5 percent of revenue. This reflects the quality of our product portfolio, as well as the efficiency of our manufacturing strategy, including the benefit of 300-millimeter Analog production. 
Revenue of $12.07 billion increased $856 million, or 8 percent, due to higher revenue from Analog and, to a lesser extent, Embedded Processing. The following table contains information regarding our purchases of our common stock during the quarter.
