Our Provision for income taxes was $301 million and $430 million for the second quarters of 2018 and 2017, respectively, and $488 million and $688 million for the first six months of 2018 and 2017, respectively.  
Interest and debt expense was $30 million and $20 million for the second quarters of 2018 and 2017, respectively, and $53 million and $38 million for the first six months of 2018 and 2017, respectively. This was net of the amortization of the debt discounts, premiums and debt issuance costs. Capitalized interest was not material. 
Our centralized manufacturing and support organizations, such as facilities, procurement and logistics, provide support to our operating segments, including those in Other. Costs incurred by these organizations, including depreciation, are charged to the segments on a per-unit basis. Consequently, depreciation expense is not an independently identifiable component within the segmentsâ€™ results and, therefore, is not provided. 
Revenue from products shipped into China, including Hong Kong, was $1.7 billion and $1.6 billion in the second quarters of 2018 and 2017, respectively, and $3.3 billion and $3.1 billion in the first six months of 2018 and 2017, respectively. 
We recognize shipping fees, if any, received from customers in revenue. We include shipping and handling costs in COR. The majority of our customers pay these fees directly to third parties.  
1. Description of business, including segment and geographic area information 
As of June 30, 2018, we had contract assets of $275 million. During the six months ended June 30, 2018, our contract assets were reduced by $8 million, due to $16 million of cash received offset by $8 million of income recognized. 
Total shares of 2,135,405 and 9,028,819 were issued from treasury shares during the second quarter and first six months of 2018, respectively, related to stock compensation. 
The following geographic area information includes revenue based on product shipment destination. The revenue information is not necessarily indicative of the geographic area in which the end applications containing our products are ultimately consumed because our products tend to be shipped to the locations where our customers manufacture their products. Specifically, many of our products are shipped to our customers in China who may include these parts in the manufacture of their own end products, which they may in turn export to their customers around the world. Inventory was $2.09 billion, an increase of $133 million from the end of 2017. Days of inventory at the end of the second quarter of 2018 were 135 compared with 134 at the end of 2017. 
Gross profit of $2.62 billion was up $245 million, or 10 percent, primarily due to higher revenue. As a percentage of revenue, gross profit increased to 65.2 percent from 64.3 percent. 
Gross profit of $5.07 billion was up $548 million, or 12 percent, primarily due to higher revenue. As a percentage of revenue, gross profit increased to 64.9 percent from 63.7 percent. 
Revenue increased 9 percent from the same quarter a year ago. Demand for our Analog and Embedded Processing products continued to be strong in the industrial and automotive markets.  
Investing activities for the first six months of 2018 provided $185 million compared with $259 million in the year-ago period. Capital expenditures were $438 million compared with $278 million in the year-ago period and were primarily for semiconductor manufacturing equipment in both periods. We had proceeds from sales of short-term investments, net of purchases, that provided cash of $621 million compared with $498 million in the year-ago period. 
Revenue of $7.81 billion increased $711 million, or 10 percent, due to higher revenue from Analog and Embedded Processing.  
Revenue of $4.02 billion increased $324 million, or 9 percent, due to higher revenue from Analog and Embedded Processing.  
Our cash flow from operations of $6.6 billion for the trailing 12 months again underscored the strength of our business model. Free cash flow for the trailing 12 months was $5.7 billion, or 36.6 percent of revenue. This reflects the quality of our product portfolio, as well as the efficiency of our manufacturing strategy, including the benefit of 300-millimeter Analog production. 
Other revenue decreased by $30 million, and operating profit declined by $17 million. The following table contains information regarding our purchases of our common stock during the quarter.
