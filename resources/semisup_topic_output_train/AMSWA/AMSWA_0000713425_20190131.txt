We recently updated our operating segments to reflect the fact that we provide our software solutions through three major operating segments, which are further broken down into a total of six major product and service groups.
The terms “fiscal 2019” and “fiscal 2018” refer to our fiscal years ending April 30, 2019 and 2018, respectively.
Amortization of sales commissions was $0.1 million for the three months ended January 31, 2019 and $0.7 million for the nine months ended January 31, 2019, which is included in sales and marketing expense in the accompanying condensed consolidated statements of operations.
The total amount of expense reimbursement included in professional services and other revenue was approximately $336,000 and $1.1 million for the three and nine months ended January 31, 2019, respectively, and approximately $419,000 and $1.4 million for the three and nine months ended January 31, 2018, respectively.
The Company’s results for the three and nine months ended January 31, 2019 are not necessarily indicative of the results expected for the full year.
The SCM segment also includes (i) Demand Management, Inc (“DMI”), which delivers affordable, easy-to-use SaaS supply chain planning solutions designed to increase forecast accuracy, improve customer service and reduce inventory to maximize profits and lower costs, (ii) New Generation Computing (“NGC”), which is a leading provider of cloud-based supply chain and product lifecycle management solutions for brands, retailers and consumer products companies, and (iii) Halo Business Intelligence (“Halo”), which is an advanced analytics software provider leveraging an innovative blend of artificial intelligence and machine learning technology to drive greater supply chain performance.
Consequently, it is not practical to show these items by operating segment.
No one customer accounted for more than 10% of total revenues for the three and nine months ended January 31, 2019 and 2018.
Revenue is derived from maintenance under which we provide customers with telephone consulting, product updates on a when and if available basis, and releases of new versions of products previously purchased by the customer, as well as error reporting and correction services.Our IT Consulting segment’s operating income increased by 32% and 29% for the three and nine months ended January 31, 2019 compared to same periods last year primarily due to increased revenues and gross margins.
Our SCM segment operating income decreased by 17% and 23% in the three and nine months ended January 31, 2019 compared to the same periods in the prior year primarily due to the recent Halo acquisition in the third quarter of fiscal 2018.
For the three and nine months ended January 31, 2019, sales and marketing expenses decreased 13% and increased 1%, respectively, when compared to the same periods a year ago, primarily due to lower commissions in the current quarter due to lower sales revenue and an increase in headcount for the nine months ended January 31, 2019 when compared to the same periods last year.
License fee gross margin percentage for the three and nine months ended January 31, 2019 decreased when compared to the same period in the prior year.

For fiscal 2019, we expect the global economy to improve modestly when compared to the prior year.We recorded exchange rate losses of approximately $21,000 and of $375,000 for the three and nine months ended January 31, 2019, respectively, compared to an exchange rate gain of approximately $75,000 for both the three months and nine months ended January 31, 2018, respectively.
