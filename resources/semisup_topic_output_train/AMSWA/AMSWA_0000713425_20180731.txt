We updated our operating segments to reflect the fact that we provide our software solutions through three major operating segments, which are further broken down into a total of six major product and service groups.
The three operating segments are (1) Supply Chain Management (SCM), (2) Information Technology (IT) Consulting and (3) Other.
We do not have any inter-segment revenue.
The Companys results for the three months ended July 31, 2018 are not necessarily indicative of the results expected for the full year.
Amortization of sales commissions was $0.2 million for the three months ended July 31, 2018, which is included in sales and marketing expense in the accompanying condensed consolidated statement of operations.
No one customer accounted for more than 10% of total revenues for the three months ended July 31, 2018 and 2017.
Consequently, it is not practical to show these items by operating segment.
The SCM segment consists of Logility, which is a leading provider of collaborative supply chain optimization and advanced retail planning solutions that help medium, large and Fortune 500 companies transform their supply chain operations to gain a competitive advantage.Our IT Consulting segments operating income increased by 55% for the three months ended July 31, 2018 compared to same period last year primarily due to increased revenues and gross margins.
Our SCM segment operating income decreased 48% in the three months ended July 31, 2018 compared to the same period in the prior year primarily due to lower revenues and the recent Halo acquisition in the third quarter of fiscal 2018.
Our SCM segment constituted approximately 99% and 100% of total license fee revenues for the three months ended July 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively.
Our gross margin percentage on subscription fees revenues increased from 58% for the three months ended July 31, 2017 to 66% for the three months ended July 31, 2018 primarily due to the increase in subscription revenue, compared to a lower incremental increase in cost.
Our Other segment operating loss increased 14% for the three months ended July 31, 2018 when compared to the prior year due to an increase in corporate expenses and a decrease in revenues.
Our Other segment license fee revenues increased by 67% for the three months ended July 31, 2018 when compared to the same period in the prior year primarily due to timing of additional sales to our existing ERP customers.
For fiscal 2019, we expect the global economy to improve modestly when compared to the prior year.We recorded an exchange rate loss of approximately $247,000 for the three months ended July 31, 2018 compared to an exchange rate gain of $41,000 for the same period in the prior year.Based on this evaluation, our principal executive officer and principal financial officer have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report.
