As a result, in the third quarter of fiscal 2018, we updated our operating segments to reflect the fact that we provide our software solutions through three major operating segments, which are further broken down into a total of six major product and service groups.
The three operating segments are (1) Supply Chain Management (SCM), (2) Information Technology (IT) Consulting and (3) Other.
The Companys results for the three and nine months ended January 31, 2018 are not necessarily indicative of the results expected for the full year.
In addition, Logility will continue to offer Halo standalone to complement other enterprise systems.
Consequently, it is not practical to show these items by operating segment.
