During the six months ended October 31, 2019, we recognized $23 million of revenue that was included in the deferred revenue balance as of April 30, 2019. 
Nature of Products and Services.
Subscription Fees. Subscription fees include SaaS revenues for the right to use the software for a limited period of time in an environment hosted by the Company or by a third party. The customer accesses and uses the software on an as-needed basis over the Internet or via a dedicated line; however, the customer has no right to take delivery of the software without incurring a significant penalty. The underlying arrangements typically include a single fee for the service that is billed monthly, quarterly or annually. The Company’s SaaS solutions represent a series of distinct services that are substantially the same and have the same pattern of transfer to the customer. Revenue from a SaaS solution is generally recognized ratably over the term of the arrangement.
The impact of the Company's leases on Condensed Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows is presented in the operating activities section, which mainly consisted of cash paid for operating lease liabilities of approximately $0.5 million and the amortization of the right of use assets and operating lease obligations of $10,000 during the six months ended October 31, 2019. The Company did not modify any existing leases or execute any new leases during the three and six months ended October 31, 2019.
Certain sales commissions incurred by the Company were determined to be incremental costs to obtain the related contracts, which are deferred and amortized ratably over the economic benefit period. These deferred commission costs are classified as current or non-current based on the timing of when the Company expects to recognize the expense. The current and non-current portions of deferred commissions are included in prepaid expenses and deferred sales commissions—noncurrent, respectively, in the Company’s Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. Total deferred commissions at October 31, 2019 and April 30, 2019 were $2.9 million and $2.3 million, respectively. Amortization of sales commissions was $0.4 million and $0.7 million for the three and six months ended October 31, 2019, respectively, which is included in sales and marketing expense in the accompanying Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations.

For fiscal 2020, we expect the global economy to improve modestly when compared to the prior year.
