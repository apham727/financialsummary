The Companys results for the three and six months ended October 31, 2018 are not necessarily indicative of the results expected for the full year.
We recently updated our operating segments to reflect the fact that we provide our software solutions through three major operating segments, which are further broken down into a total of six major product and service groups.
The three operating segments are (1) Supply Chain Management (SCM), (2) Information Technology (IT) Consulting and (3) Other.
Amortization of sales commissions was $0.4 million for the three months ended October 31, 2018 and $0.6 million for the six months ended October 31, 2018, which is included in sales and marketing expense in the accompanying condensed consolidated statements of operations.
The total amount of expense reimbursement included in professional services and other revenue was approximately $388,000 and $719,000 for the three and six months ended October 31, 2018, respectively, and approximately $421,000 and $947,000 for the three and six months ended October 31, 2017, respectively.
The SCM segment also includes (i) Demand Management, Inc (DMI), which delivers affordable, easy-to-use SaaS supply chain planning solutions designed to increase forecast accuracy, improve customer service and reduce inventory to maximize profits and lower costs, (ii) New Generation Computing (NGC), which is a leading provider of cloud-based supply chain and product lifecycle management solutions for brands, retailers and consumer products companies, and (iii) Halo Business Intelligence (Halo), which is an advanced analytics software provider leveraging an innovative blend of artificial intelligence and machine learning technology to drive greater supply chain performance.
No one customer accounted for more than 10% of total revenues for the three and six months ended October 31, 2018 and 2017.
Consequently, it is not practical to show these items by operating segment.Our IT Consulting segments operating income increased by 11% and 28% for the three and six months ended October 31, 2018 compared to same periods last year primarily due to increased revenues and gross margins.
For the three and six months ended October 31, 2018, sales and marketing expenses increased 20% and 8%, respectively, when compared to the same periods a year ago, primarily due to increased headcount in our SCM segment.
Our SCM segment operating income decreased by 15% and 27% in the three and six months ended October 31, 2018 compared to the same periods in the prior year primarily due to the recent Halo acquisition in the third quarter of fiscal 2018.
Our gross margin percentage on subscription fees revenues increased from 56% and 52% for the three and six months ended October 31, 2017 to 61% and 64% for the three and six months ended October 31, 2018, respectively, primarily due to the increase in subscription revenue, combined with a lower incremental increase in cost.
Our Other segment license fee revenues increased by 627% and 355%, respectively, for the three and six months ended October 31, 2018 when compared to the same period in the prior year primarily due to timing of additional sales to our existing ERP customers.
Our gross margin percentage on professional services and other revenues decreased from 32% for the three months ended October 31, 2017 to 27% for the three months ended October 31, 2018.
For the three and six months ended October 31, 2018, gross product research and development costs increased 14% and 17%, respectively, when compared to the same periods in the previous year due partially to the recent Halo acquisition in the third quarter of fiscal 2018 and increased headcount in our SCM segment.We recorded exchange rate losses of approximately $108,000 and of $355,000 for the three and six months ended October 31, 2018, respectively, compared to an exchange rate loss of approximately $41,000 and a gain of $400 for the three months and six months ended October 31, 2017, respectively.
