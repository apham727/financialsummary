During fiscal 2019, the Company committed to a plan to close its facility in Targovishte, Bulgaria, which produced diesel-electric submarine batteries. Management determined that the future demand for batteries of diesel-electric submarines was not sufficient given the number of competitors in the market. Of the estimated total charges of $30,000 for all these actions, the Company had recorded charges amounting to $20,242 in fiscal 2019, relating to severance and inventory and fixed asset write-offs. The Company recorded an additional $672 relating to non-cash charges in the first quarter of fiscal 2020.

Amortization expense, relating to debt issuance costs, included in interest expense was $378 and $313, respectively, for the quarters ended June 30, 2019 and July 1, 2018.

Service revenues related to the work performed for the Company’s customers by its maintenance technicians generally represent a separate and distinct performance obligation. Control for these services passes to the customer as the services are performed. Service revenues for the first quarter of fiscal 2020 and fiscal 2019 amounted to $60,718 and $35,482, respectively.Operating earnings increased $4.1 million or 6.5% in the first quarter of fiscal 2020, compared to the first quarter of fiscal 2019. Operating earnings, as a percentage of net sales, decreased 70 basis points in the first quarter of fiscal 2020, compared to the first quarter of fiscal 2019.
As a result of the above, total cash and cash equivalents decreased by $37.1 million to $262.1 million, in the first quarter of fiscal 2020 compared to a decrease by $9.6 million to $512.5 million, in the first quarter of fiscal 2019.
Other (income) expense, net in the first quarter of fiscal 2020 was income of $1.2 million compared to expense of $0.4 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2019. Foreign currency impact resulted in a gain of $1.3 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2020, compared to a foreign currency gain of $0.4 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2019.
Gross profit increased $36.2 million or 21.9% in the first quarter of fiscal 2020 compared to the first quarter of fiscal 2019. Gross profit, as a percentage of net sales, increased 120 basis points in the first quarter of fiscal 2020 compared to the first quarter of fiscal 2019. This increase during the current quarter in the gross profit margin is largely a function of commodity costs relative to pricing, as well the impact of Alpha's higher margins, partially offset by higher manufacturing costs.
The increase in interest expense in the first quarter of fiscal 2020 was primarily due to higher interest rates and higher average debt. Our average debt outstanding was $1,052.0 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2020 compared to $612.6 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2019. The increased borrowings were primarily to fund the Alpha acquisition in the third quarter of fiscal 2019.
Net sales increased $109.3 million or 16.3% in the first quarter of fiscal 2020 as compared to the first quarter of fiscal 2019. This increase was the result of a 22% increase due to the Alpha acquisition, partially offset by a 3% decrease in organic volume, a 2% decrease in foreign currency translation impact and a 1% decrease in pricing. 
The Asia segment's operating earnings, excluding restructuring charges, decreased 110 basis points in the first quarter of fiscal 2020, compared to the first quarter of fiscal 2019 due to lower organic volume. For the remaining three quarters of this fiscal year, we believe approximately 45% of the cost of our lead requirements is known. This takes into account the hedge contracts in place at June 30, 2019, lead purchased by June 30, 2019 that will be reflected in future costs under our FIFO accounting policy, and the benefit from our lead tolling program.
