During the third quarter of fiscal 2019, the Company recorded exit charges of $3,521 relating to the sale of 100% of the shares in GAZ Geräte- und Akkumulatorenwerk Zwickau GmbH, a wholly-owned German subsidiary. The transaction is planned to close on March 31, 2019, pending fulfillment of certain conditions contained in the sale and purchase agreement. The exit is a consequence of the Company's strategic decision to streamline its product portfolio and focus its efforts on new technologies. Other (income) expense, net in the third quarter of fiscal 2019 was $0.0 million compared to income of $0.3 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2018. Other (income) expense, net in the nine months of fiscal 2019 was income of $0.9 million compared to expense of $5.8 million in the nine months of fiscal 2018. Foreign currency impact resulted in a gain of $1.0 million and $3.2 million, in the third quarter and nine months of fiscal 2019, respectively, compared to a foreign currency gain of $0.7 million and a loss of $4.4 million in the third quarter and nine months of fiscal 2018, respectively. 
Gross profit decreased $2.6 million or 1.7% in the third quarter and decreased $0.2 million or 0.1% in the nine months of fiscal 2019 compared to the comparable prior year periods of fiscal 2018. Gross profit, as a percentage of net sales, decreased 120 basis points and 150 basis points in the third quarter and nine months of fiscal 2019 compared to the third quarter and nine months of fiscal 2018, respectively. This decrease in the gross profit margin in both the third quarter and nine months is primarily due to an increase in commodity costs of approximately $10 million and $40 million, respectively, which were more than offset by increases in organic volume and pricing, but still resulted in gross margin dilution.
As a result of the above, total cash and cash equivalents decreased by $125.0 million to $397.2 million, in the nine months of fiscal 2019 compared to an increase by $71.0 million to $571.3 million, in the comparable period of fiscal 2018.
As a result of the above, earnings before income taxes in the third quarter of fiscal 2019 decreased $19.6 million, or 31.4%, compared to the third quarter of fiscal 2018 and decreased $20.2 million or 11.2%, in the nine months of fiscal 2019, compared to the nine months of fiscal 2018. 
Operating earnings decreased $18.7 million or 27.4% and decreased $25.6 million or 12.6% in the third quarter and nine months of fiscal 2019, respectively, compared to the third quarter and nine months of fiscal 2018. Operating earnings, as a percentage of net sales, decreased 320 basis points and 190 basis points in the third quarter and nine months of fiscal 2019, respectively, compared to the third quarter and nine months of fiscal 2018, primarily due to an increase in commodity costs, freight, tariffs and or other duties, partially offset by organic volume improvement, price recoveries and cost saving initiatives. 
Net sales increased $21.1 million or 3.2% in the third quarter of fiscal 2019 as compared to the third quarter of fiscal 2018. This increase was the result of a 4% increase due to revenues from acquisitions and a 2% increase in pricing, partially offset by a 3% decrease in foreign currency translation impact. We estimate that a 10% increase in our cost of lead would have increased our cost of goods sold by approximately $18 million and $54 million, in the third quarter and nine months of fiscal 2019.The ability of Alpha and EnerSys to realize the anticipated benefits of the Transaction will depend, to a large extent, on our ability to combine Alpha’s and our businesses in a manner that facilitates growth opportunities and realizes anticipated synergies, and achieves the projected stand-alone cost savings and revenue growth trends identified by each company. It is expected that we will benefit from operational and general and administrative cost synergies resulting from the warehouse and transportation integration, direct procurement savings on overlapping materials, purchasing scale on indirect spend categories and optimization of duplicate positions and processes. We may also enjoy revenue synergies, driven by a strong portfolio of brands with exposure to higher growth segments and the ability to leverage our collective distribution strength. In order to achieve these expected benefits, we must successfully combine the businesses of Alpha and EnerSys in a manner that permits these cost savings and synergies to be realized and must achieve the anticipated savings and synergies without adversely affecting current revenues and investments in future growth. If we experience difficulties with the integration process or are not able to successfully achieve these objectives, the anticipated benefits of the Transaction may not be realized fully or at all or may take longer to realize than expected.
