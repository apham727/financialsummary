(Manta), a North American utility solutions provider located in Mississauga, Ontario, Canada, for a purchase price of $9.5 million in cash. Manta has annualized sales of approximately $8 million. Since the date of acquisition, the operating results for Manta have been included as a product line of Doble Engineering Company within the Company’s USG segment. Based on the preliminary purchase price allocation, the Company recorded approximately $0.4 million of accounts receivable, $1.1 million of inventory, $0.2 million of property, plant and equipment, $0.4 million of accounts payable and accrued expenses, $3.5 million of goodwill, $1.2 million of tradenames and $3.5 million of amortizable intangible assets consisting of customer relationships with a weighted average life of 13 years.

At June 30, 2018, the Company had $262 million of outstanding borrowings under the Credit Facility in addition to outstanding letters of credit of $8.3 million. The Company classified $20.0 million as the current portion of long-term debt as of June 30, 2018, as the Company intends to repay this amount within the next twelve month period; however, the Company has no contractual obligation to repay such amount during the next twelve month period. 
In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, (ASU 2014-09) which requires an entity to recognize the amount of revenue to which it expects to be entitled for the transfer of promised goods or services to customers. This guidance has been further clarified and amended. The new standard will be effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, and interim periods within those annual periods. The standard permits the use of either the retrospective or cumulative effect transition method. The Company has selected the cumulative effect method of transition to the new standard. Because the new standard impacts the Company’s business processes, systems and controls, we developed a project plan to guide the implementation. This project plan included analyzing the standard’s impact on our contract portfolio, comparing our historical accounting policies and practices to the requirements of the new standard, and identifying differences from applying the requirements of the new standard to our contracts. We developed internal controls to ensure that we adequately evaluated our portfolio of contracts under the five-step model to ensure proper assessment of our operating results under ASU 2014-09. We reported on the progress of the implementation to the Audit Committee and the Board of Directors on a regular basis during the project’s duration. The adoption of ASU 2014-09 will have one primary impact on our portfolio of contracts and our Consolidated Financial Statements which is that more of our contracts within our Filtration and Technical Packaging segments will recognize revenue and earnings over time as the work progresses versus at a single point of time. This standard will not change the total revenue or operating earnings recognized, only the timing of when those amounts are recognized. The Company is currently in the process of finalizing the effect that ASU 2014-09 will have on its consolidated financial statements and related disclosures. 
The Credit Facility requires, as determined by certain financial ratios, a facility fee ranging from 12.5 to 27.5 basis points per year on the unused portion. The terms of the facility provide that interest on borrowings may be calculated at a spread over the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) or based on the prime rate, at the Company’s election. The facility is secured by the unlimited guaranty of the Company’s material domestic subsidiaries and a 65% pledge of the material foreign subsidiaries’ share equity. The financial covenants of the Credit Facility include a leverage ratio and an interest coverage ratio. The weighted average interest rates were 3.17% and 2.97% for the three and nine-month periods ending June 30, 2018, respectively, and 2.11% and 1.90% for the corresponding periods of 2017. At June 30, 2018, the Company was in compliance with all debt covenants. 
The Company believes that the presentation of EBIT provides important supplemental information to investors to facilitate comparisons with other companies, many of which use similar non-GAAP financial measures to supplement their GAAP results. However, the Company’s non-GAAP financial measures may not be comparable to other companies’ non-GAAP financial performance measures. Furthermore, the use of non-GAAP financial measures is not intended to replace any measures of performance determined in accordance with GAAP. 
In August 2017, the FASB issued ASU 2017-12, Targeted Improvements to Accounting for Hedge Activities, which updates ASC 815, Derivatives and Hedging. This update is intended to amend the hedge accounting model to enable entities to better align the economics of risk management activities and financial reporting. The updates eliminate the requirement to separately measure and report hedge ineffectiveness and simplify hedge documentation and effectiveness assessment requirements. These updates are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, with early adoption permitted, and must be adopted using a modified retrospective approach. These updates are not expected to materially impact the Company’s results of operations.

Net sales increased $61.8 million, or 12.9%, to $540.5 million in the first nine months of 2018 from $478.7 million in the first nine months of 2017. The increase in net sales in the third quarter of 2018 as compared to the third quarter of 2017 was due to a $13.4 million increase in the USG segment, a $7.5 million increase in the Test segment and a $1.6 million increase in the Technical Packaging segment, partially offset by a $1.5 million decrease in the Filtration segment. The increase in net sales in the first nine months of 2018 as compared to the corresponding prior year period was due to a $47.7 million increase in the USG segment, a $13.6 million increase in the Test segment and a $3.8 million increase in the Technical Packaging segment, partially offset by a $3.3 million decrease in the Filtration segment. 
EBIT in the third quarter of 2018 was $5.9 million (13.1% of net sales) compared to $4.9 million (13.0% of net sales) in the third quarter of 2017. EBIT in the first nine months of 2018 was $13.8 million (11.2% of net sales) compared to $11.1 million (10.1% of net sales) in the first nine months of 2017.

EBIT in the third quarter of 2018 was $2.5 million (11.4% of net sales) compared to $2.4 million (11.9% of net sales) in the third quarter of 2017. EBIT in the first nine months of 2018 was $5.4 million (8.4% of net sales) compared to $5.7 million (9.5% of net sales) in the first nine months of 2017. The decrease in EBIT as a percent of net sales in the third quarter of 2018 and the decrease in EBIT in the first nine months of 2018 compared to the corresponding periods of 2017 was mainly due to product mix at Plastique including lower margin projects.

The increase in the third quarter and first nine months of 2018 compared to the corresponding periods of 2017 was primarily due to higher sales from the segment’s U.S. operations due to the timing of test and measurement chamber projects. 
In the third quarter of 2018, net sales of $22.0 million were $1.6 million, or 7.7%, higher than the $20.4 million in the third quarter of 2017. Net sales increased $3.8 million, or 6.4%, to $63.7 million in the first nine months of 2018 from $59.8 million in the first nine months of 2017. The increase in the third quarter and first nine months of 2018 compared to the corresponding periods of 2017 was primarily due to the increase in net sales from Plastique driven by fluctuations in currency ($2.5 million for the first nine months of 2018) and increased shipments to new customers.

The increase in the third quarter of 2018 compared to the third quarter of 2017 was mainly due to the sales contributions from the NRG, Morgan Schaffer and Vanguard Instruments acquisitions. The increase in the first nine months of 2018 compared to the first nine months of 2017 was mainly due to the sales contributions from NRG, Morgan Schaffer and Vanguard Instruments and new products and software solutions at Doble.
