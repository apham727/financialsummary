On April 1, 2019, we launched a joint venture in Hong Kong with SK hynix system ic Inc. ("SKHS"), which is a wholly-owned subsidiary of SK hynix Inc. ("SKH"), a South Korean company. The joint venture entity, SkyHigh Memory Limited ("SkyHigh") is controlled by SKHS. We contributed our NAND flash memory business to the joint venture. NAND is a commoditized product line that has traditionally experienced volatile sales results with low gross margins. Upon launch, SkyHigh entered into a wafer supply agreement with SKH, and back-end manufacturing and transition services agreements with Cypress. 
In fiscal 2018, the Company began implementation of a reduction in workforce (the "2018 Plan") which resulted in the elimination of approximately 130 positions across various functions. The Company anticipates that the remaining restructuring accrual balance of $0.1 million will be paid out in cash through the second quarter of fiscal 2019. 
During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018, the Company determined that its investment in Deca was other-than temporarily impaired and recognized a charge of $41.5 million in order to write down the carrying amount of the investment in Deca to the estimated fair value as of the end of fiscal 2018. Given the factors described above, there continues to be a substantial risk that the carrying value of our investment in Deca may become impaired in the future. If Deca is unable to (a) secure sufficient orders from its existing significant customers or other new customers, (b) raise sufficient funding, if needed, for continuing its operations, (c) consummate a strategic transaction that allows realization of its economic value, Cypress will be required to partially or fully impair the carrying value of its investment in Deca. The Company’s carrying value in Deca was $61.6 million and $65.1 million as of March 31, 2019 and December 30, 2018, respectively.
For the three months ended March 31, 2019, the Company has recognized a loss in other comprehensive income of $7.1 million for these interest rate swaps. 
The Company tracks its assets by physical location. Although management reviews asset information on a corporate level and allocates depreciation expense by segment, the Company’s CODM does not review asset information on a segment basis.
As part of this restructuring plan, the Company exited an office space leased by Spansion and recorded a reserve related to excess lease obligation for the building. During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018, the Company signed a termination agreement with the building’s owner. The lease termination cost was approximately $19.0 million. The Company paid $4.7 million during the fiscal 2018 and paid the remaining $14.3 million during the first quarter of fiscal 2019.
In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018, the Company allocated $65.7 million of goodwill previously recorded in the MPD segment to the NAND business being divested. The allocation was based on the relative estimated enterprise value of the NAND business and that of the MPD business. The intangible assets attributable to the NAND business acquired as part of a previous acquisition were $10.9 million. Based on an analysis carried out in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018, the Company recorded an impairment charge of $76.6 million which related to the goodwill and intangible assets allocated to the NAND business and classified as held-for-sale. During the first quarter of the fiscal 2019, the Company recognized an incremental loss of $3.5 million related to adjustments in the carrying value of certain assets and estimated costs of certain transition services.Revenues recorded by MCD decreased by $26.3 million, or 7.8%, in the three months ended March 31, 2019 compared to the same prior year period. The decrease was primarily due to the stage of a major end customer's product life-cycle in wireless connectivity and a decline in demand for memory products. 
Revenues recorded by MPD decreased by $16.9 million, or 6.9%, in the three months ended March 31, 2019 compared to the same prior year period. The decrease was primarily due to a decline in demand for NAND Flash products. 
Our gross margin improved to 37.6% in the three months ended March 31, 2019 from 36.5% in the three months ended April 1, 2018. The primary drivers of the improvement in gross margin were a shift in the product mix towards higher density memory products and a decrease in commoditized products, higher fab utilization, which increased from 74% in the three months ended April 1, 2018 to 83% in the three months ended March 31, 2019, and a reduction in the cost of certain products. This improvement was partially offset by a decrease in the sale of inventory that was previously written off or written down for the three months ended March 31, 2019 as compared to the same prior year period. The gross margin in the first quarter of fiscal 2019 and 2018 was benefited by 0.7% and 1.6%, respectively, from the sale of previously reserved inventory. Included in cost of revenues are amortization of intangible assets of $46.9 million and $48.1 million for the first quarters of fiscal years 2019 and 2018, respectively.
•a decrease of $21.9 million in price adjustments and other revenue reserves for sales to distributors due to an increase in revenue during the first three months of 2019;Our investment portfolio consists of a variety of financial instruments that expose us to interest rate risk, including, but not limited to, money market funds, and certificates of deposit. Due to the relatively short-term nature of our investment portfolio, we do not believe that an immediate increase in interest rates would have a material effect on the fair market value of our portfolio.On April 1, 2019, we launched a joint venture in Hong Kong with SK hynix system ic Inc.
