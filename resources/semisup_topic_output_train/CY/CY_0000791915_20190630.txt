The following tables present the Company's revenue disaggregated by segment, end use, revenue type and geographical locations. Revenue for the three months and six months ended June 30, 2019 reflects divestment of the Company's NAND business to SkyHigh Memory Limited ("SkyHigh"), a newly formed joint venture, which was completed on April 1, 2019. 
The Company designs, develops, manufactures and markets a broad range of solutions for embedded systems from the IoT, automotive, industrial, consumer electronics, and medical areas. 
Cypress Semiconductor Corporation (together with its consolidated subsidiaries, "Cypress" or the "Company") reports on a fiscal-year basis. The Company ends its quarters on the Sunday closest to the end of the applicable calendar quarter, except in a 53-week fiscal year, in which case the additional week falls into the fourth quarter of that fiscal year. Fiscal years 2019 and 2018 each contain(ed) 52 weeks. The second quarter of fiscal 2019 ended on June 30, 2019 and the second quarter of fiscal 2018 ended on July 1, 2018.
No options were granted during the three or six months ended June 30, 2019 and July 1, 2018.
Deca continues to be in the process of developing and testing a fan-out wafer level packaging technology. Deca’s estimated enterprise value is sensitive to its ability to achieve key product development and testing milestones. During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018, the Company determined that its investment in Deca was other-than-temporarily impaired and recognized a charge of $41.5 million in order to write down the carrying amount of the investment in Deca to the estimated fair value as of the end of fiscal 2018. Additional delays or failure by Deca to complete these milestones - similar to those previously experienced by Deca in fiscal 2018 - may have a significant adverse impact on Deca’s estimated enterprise value. 
On April 1, 2019, we launched a joint venture in Hong Kong with SK hynix system ic Inc. ("SKHS"), which is a wholly-owned subsidiary of SK hynix Inc. ("SKH"), a South Korean company. The joint venture entity, SkyHigh Memory Limited ("SkyHigh"), is controlled by SKHS. We contributed our NAND flash memory business to the joint venture. NAND is a commoditized product line that has traditionally experienced volatile sales results with low gross margins. Upon launch, SkyHigh entered into a wafer supply agreement with SKH, and back-end manufacturing and transition services agreements with Cypress. 
The Company tracks its assets by physical location. Although management reviews asset information on a corporate level and allocates depreciation expense by segment, the Company’s CODM does not review asset information on a segment basis.
In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018, the Company allocated $65.7 million of goodwill previously recorded in the MPD segment to the NAND business being divested. The allocation was based on the relative estimated enterprise value of the NAND business and that of the MPD business. The intangible assets attributable to the NAND business acquired as part of a previous acquisition were $10.9 million. Based on an analysis carried out in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018, the Company recorded an impairment charge of $76.6 million which related to the goodwill and intangible assets allocated to the NAND business. During the six months ended June 30, 2019, the Company recognized an incremental loss of $3.5 million related to adjustments in the carrying value of certain assets and estimated costs of certain transition services.
Prior to June 1, 2020, the Spansion Notes are exchangeable only under certain specified circumstances as described in the Spansion Notes Indenture. One such circumstance is that the Spansion Notes will be exchangeable during any fiscal quarter (and only during such fiscal quarter), if the closing sale price of the Company's common stock for at least 20 trading days (whether or not consecutive) during a period of 30 consecutive trading days ending on the last trading day of the immediately preceding fiscal quarter is greater than 130% of the exchange price on each applicable trading day. Such condition was met as of the last trading day of the Company's fiscal quarter ended June 30, 2019 and, accordingly, the Spansion Notes will be exchangeable at the option of their holders during the Company's fiscal quarter ending September 29, 2019.Our total revenue decreased by $91.9 million, or 14.7%, to $532.2 million in the three months ended June 30, 2019 compared to the same period in the prior year. Revenue from the NAND flash business which was divested on April 1, 2019 was $49.5 million in the three months ended July 1, 2018. Excluding the impact of the NAND flash business divestiture, our total revenues decreased by $42.4 million, or 7.4%, to $532.2 million for the three months ended June 30, 2019 compared to the same period in the prior year. The decrease was primarily due to demand softening across our NOR flash, microcontroller and wireless connectivity businesses.
Our total revenues decreased by $135.1 million, or 11.2%, to $1,071.2 million in the six months ended June 30, 2019 compared to the same period in the prior year. The decrease was attributable in part to the divestiture of our NAND flash business, which was completed on April 1, 2019. Revenue from the NAND flash business decreased by $63.4 million to $31.1 million in the six months ended June 30, 2019 compared to the same period in the prior year. The remainder of the decrease was primarily due to demand softening across our NOR flash, microcontroller and wireless connectivity businesses.
Revenues recorded by MPD decreased by $77.6 million, or 30.4%, in the three months ended June 30, 2019 compared to the same prior year period. The decrease was primarily due to the divestiture of our NAND flash business, which was completed on April 1, 2019, and due to a decline in revenue from NOR flash products. Revenue from the divested NAND flash business was $49.5 million in the three months ended July 1, 2018. 
Revenues recorded by MPD decreased by $94.5 million, or 18.9%, in the six months ended June 30, 2019 compared to the same prior year period. The decrease was primarily due to a decline in demand for NAND flash and NOR flash products, and the divestiture of our NAND flash business, which was completed on April 1, 2019. Revenue from the NAND flash business decreased by $63.4 million to $31.1 million in the six months ended June 30, 2019 compared to the same period in the prior year.Our investment portfolio consists of a variety of financial instruments that expose us to interest rate risk, including, but not limited to, money market funds, and certificates of deposit. Due to the relatively short-term nature of our investment portfolio, we do not believe that an immediate increase in interest rates would have a material effect on the fair market value of our portfolio.On April 1, 2019, we launched a joint venture in Hong Kong with SK hynix system ic Inc. ("SKHS"), which is a wholly-owned subsidiary of SK hynix Inc. ("SKH"), a South Korean company. The joint venture entity, SkyHigh Memory Limited ("SkyHigh"), is controlled by SKHS.

In particular, there is a substantial risk that the carrying value of our investment in Deca may become further impaired. Deca’s current and future revenues are dependent on a small number of significant customers. The loss of, material delay in placing orders by, or significant decrease in demand from, any of Deca's key customers would have a material adverse effect on Deca’s business, results of operations, and financial condition. As a result of declining orders in the second quarter of 2019, Deca will likely need to secure additional funding to support its growth and cash needs. Failure to secure such funding, if needed, will impact its ability to continue as a going concern. Deca's management is currently in the process of evaluating certain strategic alternatives. If Deca is unable to (a) secure sufficient orders from its existing significant customers or new customers, (b) raise sufficient funding, if needed, for continuing its operations, or (c) complete a strategic transaction that allows realization of its economic value, we may be required to record further impairment charges to partially or fully write down the carrying value of our investment in Deca. As of June 30, 2019, the carrying value of our investment in Deca was $28.6 million.
