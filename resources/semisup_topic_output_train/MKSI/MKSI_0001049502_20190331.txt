Gross profit as a percentage of net product revenues decreased by 5.2 percentage points for the three months ended March 31, 2019, compared to the same period in the prior year, primarily due lower revenue volumes and lower factory utilization.  
Gross profit as a percentage of net service revenues decreased by 1.7 percentage points for the three months ended March 31, 2019, compared to the same period in the prior year, primarily due to unfavorable product mix partially offset by favorable absorption.  
Selling, general and administrative expenses decreased by $0.4 million for the three months ended March 31, 2019, compared to the same period in the prior year.
