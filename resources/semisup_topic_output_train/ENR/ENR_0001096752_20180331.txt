For the three and six months ended March 31, 2018, the Company had income tax expense of $20.7 and $47.1, respectively, on Earnings before income taxes of $85.8 and $118.9, respectively. The effective tax rate for the three and six months ended March 31, 2018 was 24.1% and 39.7%, respectively. The difference between the federal statutory rate and the effective rate for the six months ended March 31, 2018 is primarily due to a $17.4 net transitional charge resulting from the enactment of The Tax Act, as discussed below. 
The Company completed the sale of its PlaytexÂ® gloves business to a household products company for $19.0 on October 26, 2017. The sale allows the Company to better focus and utilize its resources on its other product lines. Total assets sold were approximately $3.1, resulting in a pre-tax gain on sale of $15.9.
Acquisition of Jack Black. On March 1, 2018, the Company completed the acquisition of Jack Black, a luxury men's skincare products company based in the United States. The results of Jack Black for the post-acquisition period are included within the Company's results for the three and six months ended March 31, 2018.

In addition, pre-tax costs of $0.1 and $0.4 for the three and six months ended March 31, 2017, associated with obsolescence charges related to the exit of certain non-core product lines as part of the 2013 Restructuring were included in Cost of products sold. 
The Company incurred restructuring charges of $3.7 related to Project Fuel in the three months ended March 31, 2018. 
Expenses incurred under the 2013 Restructuring are reflected below, including the estimated impact of allocating such charges to segment results. 2013 Restructuring charges were only allocated to the Company's Wet Shave, Sun and Skin Care and Feminine Care segments for the three and six months ended March 31, 2017. The Company does not include restructuring costs in the results of its reportable segments. Sun and Skin Care net sales for the first six months of fiscal 2018 increased 1.5%, inclusive of a 2.3% increase due to acquisitions, a 3.4% decline due to the Playtex gloves sale and a 1.6% increase due to currency movements. Excluding the impact of acquisitions, the Playtex gloves sale and currency movements, organic net sales increased $2.0, or 1.0%, with strong performance in Skin Care and Grooming as growth in Bulldog and Wet Ones during the first six months were offset by declines in Hawaiian Tropic and the exit of the private label Suncare business. Banana Boat experienced slight growth sales through the first six months of fiscal 2018. 
Sun and Skin Care segment net sales and segment profit are affected by the seasonality of sun care products. As a result, segment net sales and segment profit tend to be higher in the second and third quarters of the fiscal year. 
Gross profit was $502.4 during the first six months of fiscal 2018, as compared to $537.6 in the prior year period. Gross margin as a percent of net sales for the first six months of fiscal 2018 was 46.7%, down 240 basis points as compared to the prior year period. The decline was primarily driven by lower sales volumes in Wet Shave and Feminine Care, unfavorable price mix from Wet Shave promotions and Sun Care returns and higher product costs, partially offset by favorable foreign currency impact.
Gross profit was $302.1 during the second quarter of fiscal 2018, as compared to $309.6 in the prior year period. Gross margin as a percent of net sales for the second quarter of fiscal 2018 was 49.7%, representing a 100 basis point decline over the prior year gross margin of 50.7%, primarily driven by unfavorable price mix due to increased Sun Care returns and higher promotional activity in support of new Wet Shave products. Volume mix negatively impacted margin by 10 basis points, while cost mix had a 30 basis point negative impact, largely driven by unfavorable transactional currency. 
Other (income) expense, net was income of $0.2 during the second quarter of fiscal 2018, compared to income of $6.6 in the second quarter of fiscal 2017. Other (income) expense, net was expense of $2.8 during the first six months of fiscal 2018, compared to income of $8.5 during first six months of fiscal 2017. The current year periods reflect the negative impact of foreign currency exchange contract gains and losses and the revaluation of nonfunctional currency balance sheet exposures.
The following table presents changes in net sales for the second quarter and first six months of fiscal 2018, as compared to the corresponding periods in fiscal 2017, and provides a reconciliation of organic net sales to reported amounts.

For both the quarter and six month period, the decreases in general corporate expenses over the prior period were primarily related to lower share-based and deferred compensation expense, as well as savings related to our ZBS program.
Feminine Care net sales for the second quarter of fiscal 2018 decreased $2.9, or 3.5%, inclusive of a 0.3% increase due to the impact of currency movements. Excluding the impact of currency movements, organic net sales decreased 3.8%due to the impact of currency movements largely driven by Tampons, specifically in the Gentle Glide and o.b. brands.
