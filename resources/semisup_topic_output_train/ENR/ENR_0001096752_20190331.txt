In January 2017, the FASB issued an ASU clarifying the definition of a business, reducing the number of transactions that need to be further evaluated, and providing a framework to assist entities in evaluating whether both an input and a substantive process are present. The amendments set forth in the ASU specify that when the fair value of the gross assets acquired or disposed of is concentrated in a single identifiable asset or a group of similarly identifiable assets, the integrated set of assets and activities is not a business. The guidance also requires that an integrated set of assets and activities must include, at a minimum, an input and a substantive process that together significantly contribute to the ability to create output to be considered a business and removes the evaluation of whether a market participant could replace the missing elements. The Company adopted the ASU beginning October 1, 2018. The impact of the ASU will be dependent upon the nature of any future acquisitions or dispositions made by the Company.Cash flow used by operating activities was $31.9 during the first six months of fiscal 2019, compared to cash from operating activities of $61.6 during the same period in the prior year. The decline in operating cash flow in the first six months of fiscal 2019 was primarily driven by working capital changes as the build in inventory for the Sun Care season in North America and the shift of Easter into the fiscal third quarter. Additionally, accounts payable were higher at the end of fiscal 2018 as compared to March 31, 2019, resulting from the timing of payments and reduction in spending.
For the second quarter of fiscal 2019, net sales were $546.7, a 10.1% decrease when compared with the prior year quarter. Excluding the impact of the acquisition of Jack Black and currency movements, organic net sales decreased 8.9% driven by declines in Wet Shave, North America Sun and Skin Care and Feminine Care businesses, partly offset by Infant Care and International Sun and Skin Care businesses. Organic net sales in both North America and Internationally declined 9%. The decline in net sales was driven by North America Wet Shave, Sun and Skin Care and Feminine Care, driven by competitive pressure in key retailers and product launches in the prior year period, as well as declines in International, which were largely driven by expected lower Wet Shave net sales in Asia Pacific due to commercial distribution changes implemented in Japan that created a difficult comparison to the prior year.
Gross profit was $444.4 during the first six months of fiscal 2019, as compared to $500.4 in the prior year period. Gross margin as a percent of net sales for the first six months of fiscal 2019 was 44.3%, down 220 basis points as compared to the prior year period. The impact of lower volumes across all segments (90 basis points) from prior year product launches and competition, unfavorable price mix in Wet Shave related to a price decrease in North America and Feminine Care (90 basis points), and unfavorable cost mix in Wet Shave and All Other (40 basis points). 
Sun and Skin Care segment net sales and segment profit are affected by the seasonality of sun care products. As a result, segment net sales and segment profit historically have been higher in the second and third quarters of the fiscal year. 
Gross profit was $250.9 during the second quarter of fiscal 2019, as compared to $301.1 in the prior year period. Gross margin as a percent of net sales for the second quarter of fiscal 2019 was 45.9%, representing a 360 basis point decline over the prior year gross margin of 49.5%. Excluding $0.4 of costs associated with the Sun Care Reformulation, gross margin decreased 350 basis points to 46.0%. The decline was the result of lower volumes across Wet Shave, Sun and Skin Care, and Feminine Care (90 basis points) from prior year product launches and competition, unfavorable price mix in Wet Shave and Feminine Care in North America (140 basis points), and unfavorable cost mix (120 basis points) in Wet Shave.

For the first six months of fiscal 2019, the declines in corporate expense was driven by savings generated through our corporate savings initiatives driving lower compensation expense and prior year one-time expenses such as severance and asset write offs.
Cash flow used by investing activities was $13.9 during the first six months of fiscal 2019, compared to cash used by investing activities of $88.9 during the same period in the prior year.

Capital expenditures totaled $22.9 during the first six months of fiscal 2019 and included $12.9 of capital expenditures in support of Project Fuel, compared to $27.6 during the same period in the prior year. Additionally, investing cash inflows of $5.0 and $5.3 were reclassified from operating activities as a result of collections on the deferred purchase price of accounts receivables sold. 
Project Fuel is an enterprise-wide transformational initiative, launched in the second fiscal quarter of 2018, designed to address all aspects of our business and cost structure, simplifying and transforming the organization, structure and key processes that will provide the necessary catalyst for further re-investment in the Company’s growth objectives while enabling us to achieve its desired future state operations.
