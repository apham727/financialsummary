Statement of Cash Flows Presentation. Certain amounts within Cash Flows from Operating Activities for the nine months ended June 30, 2018 have been reclassified to conform with the current period presentation. Net cash from operating activities for the nine months ended June 30, 2018 was not impacted by this change.Interest expense associated with debt for the third quarter of fiscal 2019 was $15.6 compared to $16.5 in the prior year quarter. For the first nine months of fiscal 2019, interest expense was $48.0 compared to $52.5 in the prior year period. The decline in interest expense was the result of lower average outstanding debt compared to the prior year. 
Gross profit was $736.6 during the first nine months of fiscal 2019, as compared to $802.1 in the prior year period. Gross margin as a percent of net sales for the first nine months of fiscal 2019 was 45.7%, down 160 basis points as compared to the prior year period. Excluding $1.5 of costs associated with the Sun Care reformulation, gross margin as a percent of net sales was 45.8%. A portion of the decline was a result of unfavorable price mix from price decreases for Wet Shave and Feminine Care in North America partially offset by favorable Sun and Skin Care returns. Gross margin was also impacted by lower volumes in Wet Shave due to competitive pressures, as well as unfavorable cost mix in Wet Shave and All Other which was partially offset by improvements in Sun and Skin Care and in Feminine Care. 
Sun and Skin Care segment net sales and segment profit are affected by the seasonality of Sun Care products. As a result, segment net sales and segment profit historically have been higher in the second and third quarters of the fiscal year. 
For the third quarter of fiscal 2019, net sales were $609.2, a 1.8% decrease when compared with the prior year quarter. Excluding the impact of currency movements, organic net sales decreased 0.3% driven by declines in the Wet Shave and Feminine Care businesses, partly offset by increased organic sales in the Sun and Skin Care business. Organic net sales declined in North America by 2.7% while International organic net sales grew 4.2%. Lower sales in North America were driven by declines in Wet Shave, due to distribution losses, lower pricing and an unfavorable comparison to the prior year launch of Intuition f.a.b.®, partly offset by growth in Sun and Skin Care. Sun and Skin Care growth reflected favorable timing of promotions and returns and the benefit from the shift in timing of the Easter holiday, offset by lower volumes, which were impacted by lower consumption rates, due to unfavorable weather across most markets. In International markets, organic sales increased in Wet Shave, benefiting from a favorable comparison to prior year sales in Japan, and in Sun and Skin Care, driven by strong Bulldog sales. 
Wet Shave net sales for the third quarter of fiscal 2019 decreased 3.9%, inclusive of a 2.2% decline due to currency movements. Excluding the impact of currency movements, organic net sales decreased $5.8, or 1.7%, as compared to the prior year, as volume growth, primarily in Asia Pacific, was more than offset by the impact of lower pricing and unfavorable product mix in North America. Total international organic net sales increased 4.9%, with growth in Men's and Women's System's and Disposables, and was largely attributable to Japan and the comparison to the prior year period which included significant inventory reductions. North America organic net sales declined 8.9% reflecting on-going competitive intensity, cycling of the prior year period's launch of Intuition f.a.b. and Hydro Sense®, and the impact of lower pricing on our Men's and Women's Systems products.
The following table presents changes in net sales for the third quarter and first nine months of fiscal 2019, as compared to the corresponding periods in fiscal 2018, and provides a reconciliation of organic net sales to reported amounts.
For the first nine months of fiscal 2019, net sales decreased 4.9%. Excluding the impact of the acquisition of Jack Black, the Playtex gloves sale, and currency movements, organic net sales decreased 4.3% versus the prior year period. From a geographic perspective, organic net sales in North America declined 6.1% while International organic net sales decreased 1.1%. The decline in organic net sales was across all segments in North America and International Wet Shave mainly in Europe, driven by competitive pressure in key retailers and the anniversary of prior year product launches and promotions. 
Sun and Skin Care net sales for the third quarter of fiscal 2019 increased 3.4%, inclusive of a 0.9% decline due to currency movements. Excluding the impact of currency movements, organic net sales increased $7.0, or 4.3% driven by growth in all geographic regions with the exception of Asia Pacific. North America organic net sales increased 5.0%, as the expected shift in phasing of sales to this fiscal quarter due to the later Easter holiday this year, as well as lower returns this fiscal quarter, more than offset the impact of weaker category consumption trends related largely to unfavorable early season weather. Organic net sales in International markets increased 1.8%, driven by growth in the Hawaiian Tropic and Bulldog brands.
