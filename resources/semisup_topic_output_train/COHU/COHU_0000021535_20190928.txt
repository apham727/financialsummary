Cohu incurred $9.8 million and $0.4 million of acquisition-related costs, and $37.8 million and $10.7 million of restructuring charges, for the Xcerra acquisition during fiscal year 2018 and first nine months of fiscal 2019, respectively.
We expect our competitors to continue to improve the design and performance of their current products and introduce new products with improved performance capabilities.
There may be only a limited number of persons with the requisite skills and relevant industry experience to serve in these positions and it may become increasingly difficult for us to hire personnel over time.
Should combined Cohu and Xcerra revenues decline after the Merger (as compared to last year), as they did year-to-date 2019 and are again forecasted to do so in fourth quarter 2019, Cohu may not be able to generate sufficient cash flow to pay its debt service obligations when due.
Further, Cohu has a niche position and relatively low share in the ATE market, and this market is primarily driven by two larger companies with significantly more resources to invest into the ATE market.
Additional investments in enterprise tools that focus on product life-cycle management, our customer experience, and supply chain management are in process to support our growing business.
