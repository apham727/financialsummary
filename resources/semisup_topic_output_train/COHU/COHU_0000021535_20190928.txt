Cohu’s ability to utilize Xcerra’s net operating loss and credit carryforwards is severely limited. 
Cohu cannot provide assurance that it will be able to continue paying dividends at the current rate or at all.    
Given the highly competitive and rapidly evolving technology environment in which we operate, we believe it is important to develop new product offerings to meet strategic opportunities as they evolve. This includes developing products that we believe are necessary to meet the future needs of the marketplace. We are currently investing in new product development programs to enable us to compete in the test contactor markets, while also investing in next generation test handlers and automated test equipment. We expect to continue to make investments and we may at any time, based on product need or marketplace demand, decide to significantly increase our product development expenditures in these or other products. The cost of investments in new product offerings can have a negative impact on our operating results. For example, our PANTHER wafer level package probe system has incurred significant development costs, but has not generated material revenues for us. There can be no assurance that new products we develop will be accepted in the marketplace or generate material revenues for us. 
We are exposed to the risks of operating a global business. 
The semiconductor equipment industry is intensely competitive and we face substantial competition from numerous companies throughout the world. The test handler industry, while relatively small in terms of worldwide market size compared to other segments of the semiconductor equipment industry, has several participants resulting in intense competitive pricing pressures. Future competition may include companies that do not currently supply test handlers. Some of our competitors are part of larger corporations that have substantially greater financial, engineering, manufacturing and customer support capabilities and provide more extensive product offerings. In addition, there are emerging semiconductor equipment companies that provide or may provide innovative technology incorporated in products that may compete successfully against our products. We expect our competitors to continue to improve the design and performance of their current products and introduce new products with improved performance capabilities. Our failure to introduce new products in a timely manner, the introduction by our competitors of products with perceived or actual advantages, or disputes over rights to use certain intellectual property or technology could result in a loss of our competitive position and reduced sales of, or margins on our existing products. Intense competition has adversely impacted our product average selling prices and gross margins on certain products. If we are unable to reduce the cost of our existing products and successfully introduce new lower cost products, then we expect that these competitive conditions would negatively impact our gross margin and operating results in the foreseeable future. 
If we cannot continue to develop, manufacture and market products and services that meet customer requirements for innovation and quality, our revenue and gross margin may suffer.  
We have increased investments in our test contactor business, and announced significant growth targets for the business over the next several years, but due to ongoing weak market conditions we have not achieved our growth goals in 2019, year-to-date. The test contactor market is fragmented, with many entrenched regional players, and subject to intense price competition and high customer support requirements. We believe that customer support and responsiveness and an ability to consistently meet tight deadlines is critical to our success. If we are unable to reduce the cost of our test contactor products, while also meeting customer support requirements and deadlines, then we expect that these competitive conditions would negatively impact our gross margin and operating results in the foreseeable future. 
A limited number of customers account for a substantial percentage of our net sales.  Interest income was $0.2 million and $0.3 million in the third fiscal quarter of 2019 and 2018, respectively. 
Our consolidated net sales increased 66.5% to $143.5 million in 2019, compared to $86.2 million in 2018. On October 1, 2018, we completed the acquisition of Xcerra and our net sales for the third fiscal quarter of 2019 include $81.3 million of net sales recognized by this business and is the driver of the increase in our net sales. Excluding the impact of the additional sales from Xcerra, net sales decreased year over year as a result of softer demand for smartphones, weaker automotive semiconductor demand, ongoing softness in the China market that is in part related to trade tensions between the U.S. and China and export restrictions. 
Our consolidated net sales increased 57.0% to $441.3 million in 2019, compared to $281.1 million in 2018. On October 1, 2018, we completed the acquisition of Xcerra and our net sales for the first nine months of 2019 include $238.9 million of net sales recognized by this business and is the driver of the increase in our net sales.
