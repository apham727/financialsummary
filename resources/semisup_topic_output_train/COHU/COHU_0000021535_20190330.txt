We expect our competitors to continue to improve the design and performance of their current products and introduce new products with improved performance capabilities.
Cohu incurred $9.8 million and $0.2 million of acquisition-related costs, and $37.8 million and $1.8 million of restructuring charges, for the Xcerra acquisition during fiscal year 2018 and first three months of fiscal 2019, respectively.
There may be only a limited number of persons with the requisite skills and relevant industry experience to serve in these positions and it may become increasingly difficult for us to hire personnel over time.
Should combined Cohu and Xcerra revenues decline after the Merger (as compared to last year), as they did in first quarter 2019 and are again forecasted to do so in second quarter 2019, Cohu may not be able to generate sufficient cash flow to pay its debt service obligations when due.
Additional investments in enterprise tools that focus on product life-cycle management, our customer experience, and supply chain management are in process to support our growing business.
No assurance can be given that we will continue to maintain our competitive position with these or other significant customers.
Given the highly competitive and rapidly evolving technology environment in which we operate, we believe it is important to develop new product offerings to meet strategic opportunities as they evolve.Other than for foreign currency exchange rate changes, there was no material change to our unrecognized tax benefits and related accrued interest and penalties during the three-month periods ended March 30, 2019 and March 31, 2018.
In computing the tax provision for the three months ended March 31, 2018 we used the ETR expected to be applicable for the full fiscal year.
As a result, our consumable products provide a more stable recurring source of revenue and generally do not have the same degree of cyclicality as our capital equipment products.We expect our competitors to continue to improve the design and performance of their current products and introduce new products with improved performance capabilities.
