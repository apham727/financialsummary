been partially offset by changes in U.S. tax law. These differences resulted in a decrease in the effective tax rate by 7 and 18 percentage points for the three-month periods ended April 1, 2018 and April 2, 2017, respectively. 
The Company's forward contracts are typically traded or executed in over-the-counter markets with a high degree of pricing transparency. The market participants are generally large commercial banks.
The total intrinsic values of stock options exercised for the three-month periods ended April 1, 2018 and April 2, 2017 were $28,088,000 and $53,043,000, respectively. The total fair values of stock options vested for the three-month periods ended April 1, 2018 and April 2, 2017 were $25,674,000 and $17,987,000, respectively.
The total stock-based compensation expense and the related income tax benefit recognized for the three-month period ended April 1, 2018 were $13,194,000 and $2,347,000, respectively, and for the three-month period ended April 2, 2017 were $7,483,000 and $2,439,000, respectively. No compensation expense was capitalized as of April 1, 2018 or December 31, 2017.
During the three-month period ended April 1, 2018, the Company recorded a $484,000 increase in reserves for income taxes, net of deferred tax benefit. Estimated interest and penalties included in these amounts totaled $70,000 for the three-month period ended April 1, 2018.
The weighted-average grant-date fair values of stock options granted during the three-month periods ended April 1, 2018 and April 2, 2017 were $21.62 and $14.95, respectively. 
The excess tax benefit arising from the difference between the deduction for tax purposes and the compensation cost recognized for financial reporting purposes from stock option exercises resulted in a decrease of the effective tax rate by 13 and 33 percentage points for the three-month periods ended April 1, 2018 and April 2, 2017, respectively. 
The Company did not record an other-than-temporary impairment of these financial assets during the three-month period ended April 1, 2018.
Shipping and handling activities for which the Company is responsible under the terms and conditions of the sale are not accounted for as performance obligations but as fulfillment costs. These activities are required to fulfill the Company’s promise to transfer the good and are expensed when revenue is recognized.
The Company identifies performance obligations as promises in contracts to transfer distinct goods or services. Standard products and services that the Company regularly sells separately are accounted for as distinct performance obligations. Application-specific customer solutions that are comprised of a combination of products and services are accounted for as one performance obligation to deliver a total solution to the customer. These solutions are provided to customers in a variety of industries, including the consumer electronics, logistics, and automotive industries. 
The Company recorded gross realized gains and gross realized losses on the sale of debt securities totaling $55,000 and $33,000, respectively, during the three-month period ended April 1, 2018 and $88,000 and $23,000, respectively, during the three-month period ended April 2, 2017. These gains and losses are included in "Investment income" on the Consolidated Statement of Operations. Prior to the sale of these securities, unrealized gains and losses for these debt securities, net of tax, are recorded in shareholders’ equity as other comprehensive income (loss).
Revenue for application-specific customer solutions is recognized at the point in time when the solution is validated, which is the point in time when the Company can objectively determine that the agreed-upon specifications in the contract have been met and the customer will accept the performance obligations in the arrangement. Although the customer may have taken legal title and physical possession of the goods when they arrived at the customer’s designed site, the significant risks and rewards of ownership transfer to the customer only upon validation. 
The Company recognizes revenue when it transfers the promised goods or services to the customer. Revenue for standard products is recognized at the point in time when the customer obtains control of the goods, which is typically upon delivery when the customer has legal title, physical possession, the risks and rewards of ownership, and an enforceable obligation to pay for the products. Revenue for services, which are not material, are typically recognized over the time the services are provided. Revenue for the first quarter of 2018 totaled $169,567,000, representing an increase of 22% from the first quarter of 2017 driven primarily by strong sales in the logistics and automotive industries. A shift in revenue mix toward service-
related revenue resulted in a slight decline in the gross margin percentage to 76% of revenue in the first quarter of 2018 compared to 77% of revenue in the first quarter of 2017. Operating expenses increased by 37% over the prior year due principally to the impact of headcount additions to support the higher revenue level and future growth plans. The operating income margin was 20% of revenue in the first quarter of 2018 compared to 27% of revenue in the first quarter of 2017. A lower tax benefit related to stock option exercises than the prior year resulted in a net income margin of 22% of revenue in the first quarter of 2018 compared to 33% of revenue in the first quarter of 2017. Net income per diluted share was $0.21 in the first quarter of 2018 compared to $0.25 in the first quarter of 2017.
As of the date of this report, we expect revenue for the second quarter of 2018 to increase sequentially from the first quarter of 2018. Although we expect this growth to come from a variety of industries, the most notable increase is expected to come from the consumer electronics industry due to the quarterly timing of revenue from large customer orders in this industry, which in turn is dependent upon the product introduction cycles of these customers. Despite the level of quarterly revenue currently anticipated from customers in the consumer electronics industry in the second quarter of 2018, we expect consumer electronics revenue to be lower for the full year 2018 as compared to 2017.
Revenue for the first quarter of 2018 totaled $169,567,000, representing an increase of $30,528,000, or 22%, from the first quarter of 2017. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates, primarily related to the translation of Euro-denominated revenue to U.S. Dollars, accounted for approximately 5% of the revenue increase. The remaining constant-currency increase of 17% was driven by higher sales in the logistics and automotive industries, partially offset by lower sales in the consumer electronics industry.
Research, Development, and Engineering Expenses increased by $8,306,000, or 36%, for the three-month period as detailed in the table below (in thousands).None.
