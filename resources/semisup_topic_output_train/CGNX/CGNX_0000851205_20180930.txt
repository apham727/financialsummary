Shipping and handling activities for which the Company is responsible under the terms and conditions of the sale are not accounted for as performance obligations but as fulfillment costs. These activities are required to fulfill the Company’s promise to transfer the goods and are expensed when revenue is recognized.
The Company identifies performance obligations as promises in contracts to transfer distinct goods or services. Standard products and services that the Company regularly sells separately are accounted for as distinct performance obligations. Application-specific customer solutions that are comprised of a combination of products and services are accounted for as one performance obligation to deliver a total solution to the customer. On-site support services that are provided to the customer after the solution is deployed are accounted for as a separate performance obligation. These solutions are provided to customers in a variety of industries, including the consumer electronics, logistics, and automotive industries. 
The Company recognizes revenue when it transfers the promised goods or services to the customer. Revenue for standard products is recognized at the point in time when the customer obtains control of the goods, which is typically upon delivery when the customer has legal title, physical possession, the risks and rewards of ownership, and an enforceable obligation to pay for the products. Revenue for services, which are not material, is typically recognized over the time the service is provided. 
Revenue for application-specific customer solutions is recognized at the point in time when the solution is validated, which is the point in time when the Company can objectively determine that the agreed-upon specifications in the contract have been met and the customer will accept the performance obligations in the arrangement. Although the customer may have taken legal title and physical possession of the goods when they arrived at the customer’s designated site, the significant risks and rewards of ownership transfer to the customer only upon validation. Revenue for on-site support services related to these solutions is recognized over the time the service is provided.

The Company identifies contracts with customers as agreements that create enforceable rights and obligations, which typically take the form of customer contracts or purchase orders. was driven primarily by lower order levels from a few large customers in the consumer electronics industry and was partially offset by growth in the logistics industry. The gross margin improved to 75% of revenue in the third quarter of 2018 from 74% of revenue in the third quarter of 2017, due primarily to a lower percentage of revenue related to application-specific customer solutions. Operating expenses in the third quarter of 2018 increased by 10% over the third quarter of 2017 due principally to the impact of headcount additions to support our future growth plans. As a result of the lower revenue and continued headcount investment, operating income decreased to 34% of revenue in the third quarter of 2018 from 42% of revenue in the third quarter of 2017. A decrease in tax expense primarily from revised estimates of the impact of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (the Tax Act) resulted in lower income tax expense than the prior year. Net income decreased to 35% of revenue in the third quarter of 2018 from 39% of revenue in the third quarter of 2017. Net income per diluted share was $0.45 in the third quarter of 2018 compared to $0.57 in the third quarter of 2017.
Gross margin as a percentage of revenue was 75% for both the three-month and nine-month periods in 2018, compared to 74% and 76% for same periods in 2017. The increase for the three-month period was due primarily to a lower percentage of revenue related to application-specific customer solutions. These solutions typically have lower gross margins due to the application configuration and deployment services included as part of the solution, as well as on-site support services provided after the solution is deployed. In addition, these solutions are often provided to large customers that may receive favorable pricing. Although there was also a lower percentage of revenue related to application-specific customer solutions for the nine-month period, this favorable impact was offset by unfavorable product mix.
As of the date of this report, we expect revenue for the fourth quarter of 2018 to decrease sequentially from the third quarter of 2018 due to lower sales in the consumer electronics industry, as well as anticipated lower demand from customers based in China. 
Revenue from customers based in the Americas increased by 7% for the three-month period and by 22% for the nine-month period driven by strong sales in the logistics industry.

Constant-currency revenue from customers based in Europe decreased by 9% for the nine-month period, and constant-currency revenue from customers based in Asia was relatively flat for the nine-month period.
