Revenue for the first quarter of 2019 totaled $173,484,000, representing an increase of 2% from the first quarter of 2018. Strong sales in the logistics industry were partially offset by slowing order trends in the automotive industry in the Americas, lower demand from customers based in Greater China, and the unfavorable impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates on revenue. Unfavorable absorption of manufacturing overhead costs over a declining inventory balance contributed to a decrease in the gross margin percentage to 73% of revenue in the first quarter of 2019 compared to 76% of revenue in the first quarter of 2018. Operating expenses increased by 2% over the prior year's first quarter due principally to the impact of headcount additions to support our future growth plans. Operating income was 17% of revenue in the first quarter of 2019 compared to 20% of revenue in the first quarter of 2018; net income was 19% of revenue in the first quarter of 2019 compared to 22% of revenue in the first quarter of 2018; and net income per diluted share was $0.19 in the first quarter of 2019 compared to $0.21 in the first quarter of 2018.

As of March 30, 2019, the Company had $863,687,000 in cash and investments. In addition, the Company has no long-term debt and does not anticipate needing debt financing in the near future. We believe that our strong cash position has put us in a relatively good position with respect to our longer-term liquidity needs.
Investment income increased by $1,665,000, or 51%, from the first quarter of 2018. The increase was due to higher yields on the Company's portfolio of debt securities, and to a lesser extent additional funds available for investment.
