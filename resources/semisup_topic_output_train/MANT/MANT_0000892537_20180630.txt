Changes in the balances of contract assets and contract liabilities are primarily due to the timing difference between our performance and our customers' payments. For the three months ended June 30, 2018, the amount of revenue that was included in the opening contract liabilities balance was $3.5 million. For the six months ended June 30, 2018, the amount of revenue that was included in the opening contract liabilities balance was $5.8 million.

Restricted Stock Activity— The following table summarizes the restricted stock activity during the year ended December 31, 2017 and the six months ended June 30, 2018. 
•Risk-free interest rate—The yield on zero-coupon U.S. Treasury strips was used to extrapolate a forward-yield curve. This “term structure” of future interest rates was then input into a numeric model to provide the equivalent risk-free rate to be used in the Black-Scholes-Merton model based on the expected term of the underlying grants.
We have an Estimate at Completion process in which management reviews the progress and execution of our performance obligations. As part of this process, management reviews information including, but not limited to, any outstanding key contract matters, progress towards completion and the related program schedule, identified risks and opportunities and the related changes in estimates of revenue and costs. The risks and opportunities include management’s judgment about the ability and cost to achieve the contract milestones and other technical contract requirements. Management must make assumptions and estimates regarding labor productivity and availability, the complexity of the work to be performed, the availability of materials, the length of time to complete the performance obligation, execution by our subcontractors, the availability and timing of funding from our customer and overhead cost rates, among other variables. A significant change in one or more of these estimates could affect the profitability of our contracts. For the three months ended June 30, 2018, the aggregate impact of adjustments in contract estimates increased our revenue by $4.3 million. For the six months ended June 30, 2018, the aggregate impact of adjustments in contract estimates increased our revenue by $5.8 million. No adjustment on any one contract was material to our condensed consolidated financial statements for the six months ended June 30, 2018.
We have $15.3 million outstanding on our letter of credit, of which $15.2 million is related to an outstanding performance bond in connection with a contract between ManTech MENA, LLC and Jadwalean International Operations and Management Company to fulfill technical support requirements for the Royal Saudi Air Force.
For the three months ended June 30, 2018 and 2017, options to purchase 251,250 shares and 381,987 shares, respectively, were outstanding but not included in the computation of diluted earnings per share because the options' effect would have been anti-dilutive. For the six months ended June 30, 2018 and 2017, options to purchase 280,833 shares and 270,649 shares, respectively, were outstanding but not included in the computation of diluted earnings per share because the options' effect would have been anti-dilutive. For the six months ended June 30, 2018 and 2017, there were 229,191 shares and 102,936 shares, respectively, issued from the exercise of stock options. 
Deferred contract costs - Costs of obtaining or fulfilling a contract that meet the criteria in ASC 340, Other Assets and Deferred Costs, are capitalized and amortized on a systematic basis that is consistent with the transfer of goods or services to the customer. Deferred contracts costs are reported on our condensed consolidated balance sheet within current or non-current other assets based on the expected life of the related contract. At June 30, 2018, we had $3.4 million of deferred contract costs. For the three months ended June 30, 2018 we recorded amortization expense of $0.2 million. For the six months ended June 30, 2018, we recorded amortization expense of $0.3 million. The increase in cost of services was primarily due to increases in revenue. As a percentage of revenue, direct labor costs were 48% for the three months ended June 30, 2018, compared to 49% for the same period in 2017. As a percentage of revenues, other direct costs, which include subcontractors and third party equipment and materials used in the performance of our contracts, was 37% for the three months ended June 30, 2018, compared to 36% fo the same period in 2017. 
The increase in general and administrative expenses was primarily due to an increase in bid and proposal spending, amortization of acquired intangibles and expenditures to support infrastructure.

We expect cost of services as a percentage of revenues to slightly increase for the remainder of 2018 due to typically higher levels of materials in the second half of the year.
Our operating cash flow is primarily affected by our ability to invoice and collect from our customers in a timely manner, our management of vendor payments and the overall profitability of our contracts. We bill most of our customers monthly after services are rendered. Our accounts receivable days sales outstanding were 68 and 69 for the three months ended June 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively. For the six months ended June 30, 2018 and 2017, our net cash from operating activities was $35.0 million and $63.3 million, respectively. The decrease in net cash flows from operating activities during the six months ended June 30, 2018 when compared to the same period in 2017 was primarily due to the timing of receivables.
The increase in general and administrative expenses was due to an increase in expenditures to support new contract awards and amortization expense from acquired intangibles.
The primary driver of our increase in revenues relates to revenues from new contract awards, growth on certain existing contracts and acquisitions. These increases were offset by contracts and tasks that ended and reduced scope of work on some contracts.

Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. The design of any system of controls also is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions. As a result, our disclosure controls and procedures are designed to provide reasonable assurance that such disclosure controls and procedures will meet their objectives.Item 6.Exhibits
