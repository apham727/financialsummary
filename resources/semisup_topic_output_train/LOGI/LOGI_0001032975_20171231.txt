We have historically targeted peripherals for the PC platform. Consumer demand for PCs, especially in our traditional, mature markets such as North America, Western and Nordic Europe, Japan and Australia, has been declining and we expect it to continue to decline in the future. As a result, consumer demand for PC peripherals in many of our markets is slowing and in some cases declining and we expect this trend may continue.
We have developed long-term value in our brands and have invested significantly in design and in our existing and new brands over the past several years. We believe that our design and brands have significantly contributed to the success of our business and that maintaining and enhancing our brands is very important to our future growth and success. Maintaining and enhancing our brands will require significant investments and will depend largely on our future design, products and marketing, which may not be successful and may damage our brands. Our brands and reputation are also dependent on third parties, such as suppliers, manufacturers, distributors, retailers, product 
Our competitors for Video Collaboration products include Cisco Systems, Inc., Polycom, Inc., and AVer Information Inc.
Video Collaboration. While we view the small and medium sized user groups' opportunity to be large and relatively unaddressed, this is a new and evolving market segment that we are developing. If the market opportunity proves to exist, we expect increasing competition from the large competitors in the video conferencing market as well as potential new entrants. 
As a result, we are focusing more of our attention, which may include the personnel, financial resources and management attention, on product innovations and growth opportunities, including products for the consumption of digital music, products for gaming, products for video collaboration, products for the digital home, and on other potential growth opportunities. Our investments may not result in the growth we expect, or when we expect it, for a variety of reasons including those described below.
PC Webcams. Our primary competitors for PC webcams are Microsoft Corporation and HP Inc. with various other manufacturers taking smaller market share. The worldwide market for consumer PC webcams has been declining, and as a result, fewer competitors have entered the market.
As a company operating in many markets and jurisdictions and expanding into new growth categories, and as a Swiss, dual - listed company, we are subject to risks associated with new, existing and potential future laws and regulations.
If we do not successfully coordinate the worldwide manufacturing and distribution of our products, we could lose sales.
The development of new products and services is very difficult and requires high levels of innovation. The development process is also lengthy and costly. There are significant initial expenditures for research and development, tooling, manufacturing processes, inventory and marketing, and we may not be able to recover those investments. If we fail to accurately anticipate technological trends or our usersâ€™ needs or preferences, are unable to complete the development of products and services in a cost-effective and timely fashion or are unable to appropriately increase production to fulfill customer demand, we will be unable to successfully introduce new products and services into the market or compete with other providers. Even if we complete the development of our new products and services in a cost-effective and timely manner, they may not be competitive with products developed by others, they may not achieve acceptance in the market at anticipated levels or at all, they may not be profitable or, even if they are profitable, they may not achieve margins as high as our expectations or as high as the margins we have achieved historically.Net sales of Pointing Devices decreased 1% for the three months ended and increased 1% for the nine months ended December 31, 2017, respectively, compared to the same periods of the prior fiscal year. The decrease for the three-month period was primarily driven by a decrease in sales of mice, partially offset by an increase in sales of trackball and presentation tools. The increase for the nine-month period was driven by an increase in sales of trackball and presentation tools, partially offset by the decrease in the sales of mice and other pointing devices. 
ITO for the three months ended December 31, 2017 was higher, compared to the same period of the prior fiscal year. The increase in inventories compared with December 31, 2016 was primarily driven by higher net sales.
For the three and nine months ended December 31, 2017, ASTRO contributed $33.5 million and $36.2 million to net sales, respectively, representing approximately 4% of our net sales for the three-month period and 2% for the nine-month period. For the nine months ended December 31, 2017, Saitek, which was acquired on September 15, 2016, contributed $8.4 million of sales increase, compared with the nine months ended December 31, 2016. 
Net sales of Mobile Speakers increased 38% and 15% for the three and nine months ended December 31, 2017, respectively, compared to the same period of the prior fiscal year. The increases for both periods were primarily due to the introduction of Ultimate Ears WONDERBOOM in early fiscal year 2018, and the launch of MEGABLAST and BLAST in the third quarter of fiscal year 2018.
