Intersegment sales for the three months ended April 30, 2019 and 2018 by the Commercial Solutions segment to the Government Solutions segment were $1,413,000 and $2,664,000, respectively. Intersegment sales for the nine months ended April 30, 2019 and 2018 by the Commercial Solutions segment to the Government Solutions segment were $14,515,000 and $7,613,000, respectively. There were nominal sales by the Government Solutions segment to the Commercial Solutions segment for these periods. All intersegment sales are eliminated in consolidation and are excluded from the tables above.
Our Government Solutions segment serves large government end-users (including those of foreign countries) that require mission-critical technologies and systems. Government solutions products include command and control applications (such as the design, installation and operation of data networks that integrate computing and communications, including both satellite and terrestrial links), ongoing network operation and management support services (including project management and fielding and maintenance solutions related to satellite ground terminals), troposcatter communications (such as digital troposcatter multiplexers, digital over-the-horizon modems, troposcatter systems and frequency converter systems) and RF power and switching technologies (such as solid-state high-power broadband amplifiers, identification friend or foe ("IFF") amplifiers and amplifiers used in the counteraction of improvised explosive devices).
During the three months ended October 31, 2018, we took steps to improve our future operating results and successfully consolidated our Government Solutions segment’s manufacturing facility located in Tampa, Florida with another facility that we maintain in Orlando, Florida. In doing so, we accrued $1,373,000 of facility exit costs, which were recorded in selling, general and administrative expenses in our Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations. 
During the second quarter of fiscal 2019, we began an evaluation and repositioning of our enterprise technology products in order to focus on providing higher margin solution offerings. This evaluation and repositioning continued during the third quarter and is ongoing. To date, we have ceased offering certain solutions, have worked with customers to wind-down certain legacy contracts and have not renewed certain contracts. In connection with this ongoing repositioning, we recorded $2,465,000 and $6,351,000, respectively, of estimated contract settlement costs in our Commercial Solutions segment during the three and nine months ended April 30, 2019.
Our Commercial Solutions segment serves commercial customers and smaller government customers, such as state and local governments, that require advanced communication technologies to meet their needs. This segment also serves certain large government customers (including the U.S. government) that have requirements for off-the-shelf commercial equipment. We believe this segment is a leading provider of satellite communications (such as satellite earth station modems and TWTAs), public safety systems (such as NG-911 technologies) and enterprise application technologies (such as messaging and trusted location-based technologies).
During the three months ended January 31, 2019, a customer that purchased a TCS 911 call handling software solution in December 2014 (which was more than one year prior to our acquisition of TCS) (the "TCS Legacy Customer") informed us that it experienced several network outages and that it would seek indemnification for any claims made against it as a result of such outages. We are not aware of any damage claims having been asserted against us and we have not been notified by the TCS Legacy Customer of any such claims asserted against it, in connection with such outages. Nevertheless, we have submitted notification to our insurance carriers for review and consideration of coverage for potential liability that may arise from these matters. Net Sales. Consolidated net sales were $170.4 million and $147.9 million for the three months ended April 30, 2019 and 2018, respectively, representing an increase of $22.5 million, or 15.2%. The period-over-period increase in net sales is primarily due to significantly higher net sales in our Government Solutions segment. Net sales by operating segment are discussed below. 
Net Sales. Consolidated net sales were $495.4 million and $403.2 million for the nine months ended April 30, 2019 and 2018, respectively, representing a significant increase of $92.2 million, or 22.9%. The significant period-over-period increase in net sales reflects significantly higher net sales in our Government Solutions segment and to a lesser extent, our Commercial Solutions segment. Net sales by operating segment are discussed below. 
Research and Development Expenses. Research and development expenses were $13.5 million and $12.8 million for the three months ended April 30, 2019 and 2018, respectively, representing an increase of $0.7 million, or 5.5%. As a percentage of consolidated net sales, research and development expenses were 7.9% and 8.7% for the three months ended April 30, 2019 and 2018, respectively.
Gross Profit. Gross profit was $183.4 million and $161.0 million for the nine months ended April 30, 2019 and 2018, respectively. The significant increase of $22.4 million reflects significantly higher net sales in our Government Solutions segment and, to a lesser extent, higher net sales in our Commercial Solutions segment, as discussed above. 
Acquisition Plan Expenses. During the third quarter of fiscal 2019, we incurred $1.7 million of total acquisition plan expenses. These expenses are recorded in our Unallocated segment and primarily related to our acquisitions of Solacom and the GD NG-911 business, as discussed above. During the third quarter of fiscal 2019, we initiated efforts to acquire a small technology company whose solution offerings are complementary to our existing business. There is no certainty that our acquisition plan efforts will be successful.
Acquisition Plan Expenses. During the nine months ended April 30, 2019, we incurred $4.6 million of total acquisition plan expenses. These expenses are recorded in our Unallocated segment and primarily related to our acquisitions of Solacom and the GD NG-911 business, as discussed above. During the third quarter of fiscal 2019, we initiated efforts to acquire a small technology company whose solution offerings are complementary to our existing business and we expect to incur approximately $1.1 million of acquisition plan expenses during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019. There is no certainty that our acquisition plan efforts will be successful.
Gross profit, as a percentage of consolidated net sales, for the three months ended April 30, 2019 was 37.8% as compared to 42.2% for the three months ended April 30, 2018. The decrease in gross profit, as a percentage of consolidated net sales, was largely driven by the significant period-to-period increase in net sales in our Government Solutions segment, as discussed above. This segment historically achieves lower gross margins than our Commercial Solutions segment. Gross profit, as a percentage of related segment net sales, is further discussed below.
The significant increase in our Government Solutions segment’s operating income, both in dollars and as a percentage of related segment net sales, was primarily due to significantly higher net sales, offset in part by higher research and development expenses, as discussed above. Looking forward, we expect fiscal 2019 operating income, in dollars and as a percentage of related segment net sales, to be significantly higher as compared to fiscal 2018.
Net sales in our Government Solutions segment were $80.8 million for the three months ended April 30, 2019 as compared to $57.9 million for the three months ended April 30, 2018, a significant increase of $22.9 million, or 39.6%. Our Government Solutions segment represented 47.4% of consolidated net sales for the three months ended April 30, 2019, as compared to 39.2% for the three months ended April 30, 2018. 
Selling, General and Administrative Expenses. Selling, general and administrative expenses were $33.4 million and $30.4 million for the three months ended April 30, 2019 and 2018, respectively, representing an increase of $3.0 million, or 9.9%. As a percentage of consolidated net sales, selling, general and administrative expenses were 19.6% and 20.6% for the three months ended April 30, 2019 and 2018, respectively. The decrease, as a percentage of consolidated net sales, is primarily attributable to the increase in our consolidated net sales. 
Research and Development Expenses. Research and development expenses were $40.7 million and $40.0 million for the nine months ended April 30, 2019 and 2018, respectively. As a percentage of consolidated net sales, research and development expenses were 8.2% and 9.9% for the nine months ended April 30, 2019 and 2018, respectively.
Gross Profit. Gross profit was $64.4 million and $62.4 million for the three months ended April 30, 2019 and 2018, respectively. The increase of $2.0 million reflects significantly higher net sales in our Government Solutions segment, as discussed above. Exhibit 101.LAB - XBRL Taxonomy Extension Labels Linkbase DocumentItem 1.
