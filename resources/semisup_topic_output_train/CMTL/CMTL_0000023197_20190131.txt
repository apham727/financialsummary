Intersegment sales for the three months ended January 31, 2019 and 2018 by the Commercial Solutions segment to the Government Solutions segment were $4,562,000 and $2,328,000, respectively. Intersegment sales for the six months ended January 31, 2019 and 2018 by the Commercial Solutions segment to the Government Solutions segment were $13,102,000 and $4,949,000, respectively. There were nominal sales by the Government Solutions segment to the Commercial Solutions segment for these periods. All intersegment sales are eliminated in consolidation and are excluded from the tables above.
During the three months ended October 31, 2018, we exited our Government Solutions segment's manufacturing facility located in Tampa, Florida and recorded a related charge of $1,373,000 in selling, general and administrative expenses on our Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations. See Note (10) - "Cost Reduction Actions."
Our Government Solutions segment serves large government end-users (including those of foreign countries) that require mission-critical technologies and systems. Government solutions products include command and control applications (such as the design, installation and operation of data networks that integrate computing and communications, including both satellite and terrestrial links), ongoing network operation and management support services (including project management and fielding and maintenance solutions related to satellite ground terminals), troposcatter communications (such as digital troposcatter multiplexers, digital over-the-horizon modems, troposcatter systems and frequency converter systems) and RF power and switching technologies (such as solid-state high-power broadband amplifiers, enhanced position location reporting system (commonly known as "EPLRS") amplifier assemblies, identification friend or foe ("IFF") amplifiers and amplifiers used in the counteraction of improvised explosive devices).
During the three months ended October 31, 2018, we took steps to improve our future operating results and successfully consolidated our Government Solutions segment’s manufacturing facility located in Tampa, Florida with another facility that we maintain in Orlando, Florida. In doing so, we accrued $1,373,000 of facility exit costs, which were recorded in selling, general and administrative expenses on our Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations. 
Our Commercial Solutions segment serves commercial customers and smaller government customers, such as state and local governments, that require advanced communication technologies to meet their needs. This segment also serves certain large government customers (including the U.S. government) that have requirements for off-the-shelf commercial equipment. We believe this segment is a leading provider of satellite communications (such as satellite earth station modems and TWTAs), public safety systems (such as NG911 technologies) and enterprise application technologies (such as messaging and trusted location-based technologies).Net Sales. Consolidated net sales were $164.1 million and $133.7 million for the three months ended January 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively, representing an increase of $30.4 million, or 22.7%. The significant period-over-period increase in net sales is primarily due to significantly higher net sales in our Government Solutions segment and, to a lesser extent, our Commercial Solutions segment. Net sales by operating segment are discussed below. 
Net Sales. Consolidated net sales were $325.0 million and $255.3 million for the six months ended January 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively, representing a significant increase of $69.7 million, or 27.3%. The significant period-over-period increase in net sales reflects significantly higher net sales in our Government Solutions segment and to a lesser extent, our Commercial Solutions segment. Net sales by operating segment are discussed below. 
The significant increase in our Government Solutions segment’s operating income, both in dollars and as a percentage of related segment net sales, was primarily due to significantly higher net sales at higher gross margins, as discussed above. Looking forward, we expect fiscal 2019 operating income, in dollars and as a percentage of related segment net sales, to be significantly higher as compared to fiscal 2018.
The significant increase in our Government Solutions segment’s operating income, both in dollars and as a percentage of related segment net sales, was primarily due to significantly higher net sales at higher gross margins, offset in part by $1.4 million of facility exit costs, as discussed above. Looking forward, we expect fiscal 2019 operating income, in dollars and as a percentage of related segment net sales, to be significantly higher as compared to fiscal 2018.
Research and Development Expenses. Research and development expenses were $14.0 million and $13.4 million for the three months ended January 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively, representing an increase of $0.6 million, or 4.5%. As a percentage of consolidated net sales, research and development expenses were 8.5% and 10.0% for the three months ended January 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively.
•During the second of quarter of fiscal 2019, we initiated efforts to acquire another small but growing technology solutions company, which we believe will further complement our product offerings. We expect to incur approximately $1.0 million of acquisition plan expenses during the third quarter of fiscal 2019. There is no certainty that our acquisition plan efforts will be successful.
Gross profit, as a percentage of consolidated net sales, for the three months ended January 31, 2019 was 37.3% as compared to 38.0% for the three months ended January 31, 2018. The decrease in gross profit, as a percentage of consolidated net sales, was almost entirely driven by the significant period-to-period increase in net sales in our Government Solutions segment, as discussed above. This segment historically achieves lower gross margins than our Commercial Solutions segment. Gross profit, as a percentage of related segment net sales, is further discussed below.
Research and Development Expenses. Research and development expenses were $27.2 million for both the six months ended January 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. As a percentage of consolidated net sales, research and development expenses were 8.4% and 10.7% for the six months ended January 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively.
Gross Profit. Gross profit was $119.0 million and $98.5 million for the six months ended January 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. The significant increase of $20.5 million reflects significantly higher net sales in our Government Solutions segment, as discussed above. 
In the aggregate, we expect fiscal 2019 net sales in our Commercial Solutions segment to increase as compared to fiscal 2018. We also expect this segment's net sales in each of the third and fourth quarters of fiscal 2019 to exceed the net sales achieved in the respective comparable quarters of fiscal 2018.
In the aggregate, we expect fiscal 2019 net sales in our Commercial Solutions segment to increase as compared to fiscal 2018. We also expect this segment's net sales in each of the third and fourth quarters of fiscal 2019 to exceed the net sales achieved in the respective comparable quarters of fiscal 2018.
Selling, General and Administrative Expenses. Selling, general and administrative expenses were $32.0 million and $27.2 million for the three months ended January 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively, representing an increase of $4.8 million, or 17.6%. As a percentage of consolidated net sales, selling, general and administrative expenses were 19.5% and 20.3% for the three months ended January 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. The decrease, as a percentage of consolidated net sales, is primarily attributable to the increase in our consolidated net sales.
