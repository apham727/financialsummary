Intersegment sales for the three months ended October 31, 2018 and 2017 by the Commercial Solutions segment to the Government Solutions segment were $8,540,000 and $2,621,000, respectively. There were nominal sales by the Government Solutions segment to the Commercial Solutions segment for these periods. All intersegment sales are eliminated in consolidation and are excluded from the tables above.
During the three months ended October 31, 2018, we exited our Government Solutions segment's manufacturing facility located in Tampa, Florida and recorded a related charge of $1,373,000 in selling, general and administrative expenses on our Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations. See Note (9) - "Cost Reduction Actions."
Our Government Solutions segment serves large government end-users (including those of foreign countries) that require mission-critical technologies and systems. Government solutions products include command and control applications (such as the design, installation and operation of data networks that integrate computing and communications, including both satellite and terrestrial links), ongoing network operation and management support services (including project management and fielding and maintenance solutions related to satellite ground terminals), troposcatter communications (such as digital troposcatter multiplexers, digital over-the-horizon modems, troposcatter systems and frequency converter systems) and RF power and switching technologies (such as solid-state high-power broadband amplifiers, enhanced position location reporting system (commonly known as "EPLRS") amplifier assemblies, identification friend or foe ("IFF") amplifiers and amplifiers used in the counteraction of improvised explosive devices).
Our Commercial Solutions segment serves commercial customers and smaller government customers, such as state and local governments, that require advanced communication technologies to meet their needs. This segment also serves certain large government customers (including the U.S. government) that have requirements for off-the-shelf commercial equipment. We believe this segment is a leading provider of satellite communications (such as satellite earth station modems and TWTAs), public safety systems (such as NG911 technologies) and enterprise application technologies (such as messaging and trusted location-based technologies).
Sales to U.S. government customers include sales to the U.S. Department of Defense ("DoD"), intelligence and civilian agencies, as well as sales directly to or through prime contractors. Domestic sales include sales to commercial customers, as well as to U.S. state and local governments. Included in domestic sales, are sales to Verizon Communications Inc. ("Verizon"). Sales to Verizon were 11.7% of consolidated net sales for the three months ended October 31, 2017. International sales for the three months ended October 31, 2018 and 2017 include sales to U.S. domestic companies for inclusion in products that are sold to international customers. Except for the U.S., no individual country (including sales to U.S. domestic companies for inclusion in products that are sold to a foreign country) represented more than 10% of consolidated net sales for the three months ended October 31, 2018 and 2017. 
ESPP stock-based compensation expense primarily relates to the 15% discount offered to participants in the ESPP. During the three months ended October 31, 2018 and 2017, we recorded benefits of $130,000 and $62,000, respectively, which primarily represents the recoupment of certain share units.On December 6, 2018, our Board of Directors declared a dividend of $0.10 per common share, payable on February 15, 2019 to stockholders of record at the close of business on January 16, 2019. Future dividends remain subject to compliance with financial covenants under our Credit Facility as well as Board approval. 
Based on our current spending plans, we expect fiscal 2019 selling, general and administrative expenses, in dollars, to be higher and, as a percentage of consolidated net sales, to be similar to the percentage achieved in fiscal 2018.
Acquisition Plan Expenses. During the three months ended October 31, 2018, we initiated a targeted acquisition plan related to a small but growing technology solutions company and incurred $1.1 million of acquisition plan expenses. These expenses are recorded in our unallocated segment.
Gross Profit. Gross profit was $57.8 million and $47.7 million for the three months ended October 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. The increase of $10.1 million reflects significantly higher net sales in our Government Solutions segment, as discussed above. 
Gross profit, as a percentage of consolidated net sales, for the three months ended October 31, 2018 was 35.9% as compared to 39.3% for the three months ended October 31, 2017. The decrease in gross profit, as a percentage of consolidated net sales, was almost entirely driven by the significant period-to-period increase in net sales in our Government Solutions segment, as discussed above. This segment historically achieves lower gross margins than our Commercial Solutions segment. The three months ended October 31, 2017 also included a favorable warranty settlement which resulted in a reduction of $0.7 million to cost of sales in our unallocated segment. Gross profit, as a percentage of related segment net sales, is further discussed below.
The decrease from 34.5% to 22.75% is principally attributable to the passage of Tax Reform which reduced the statutory income tax rate from 35.0% to 21.0%. Such decrease was partially offset by the repeal of the domestic production activities deduction and lower tax deductions for certain executive compensation expenses.
In aggregate, we expect fiscal 2019 sales in our Commercial Solutions segment to increase as compared to fiscal 2018. From a timing perspective, we currently expect our second quarter fiscal 2019 sales to be higher than the amount we achieved during the first quarter of fiscal 2019 with additional growth in both the third and fourth quarters of fiscal 2019. Although there are a number of items which could shift between quarters, we currently expect our fourth quarter of fiscal 2019 to be the peak quarter of sales for our Commercial Solutions segment. 
Amortization of Intangibles. Amortization relating to intangible assets with finite lives was $4.3 million (of which $3.5 million was for the Commercial Solutions segment and $0.8 million was for the Government Solutions segment) for the three months ended October 31, 2018 and $5.3 million (of which $4.4 million was for the Commercial Solutions segment and $0.8 million was for the Government Solutions segment) for the three months ended October 31, 2017. The decrease from $5.3 million to $4.3 million was the result of certain intangible assets in our Commercial Solutions segment that became fully amortized in fiscal 2018. 
Because our consolidated gross profit, as a percentage of consolidated net sales, depends on the volume of sales, sales mix and related gross profit for each individual segment, it is inherently difficult to forecast. Nevertheless, based on expected bookings, expected timing of our performance on orders and the anticipated increase of Government Solutions segment net sales as a percentage of consolidated net sales, we currently expect our consolidated gross profit, as a percentage of consolidated net sales, for fiscal 2019 to be lower than the percentage we achieved in fiscal 2018.
Net Sales. Consolidated net sales were $160.8 million and $121.6 million for the three months ended October 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively, representing an increase of $39.2 million, or 32.2%. The significant period-over-period increase in net sales reflects significantly higher net sales in our Government Solutions segment and to a lesser extent, our Commercial Solutions segment. Net sales by operating segment are discussed below. 
International sales for the three months ended October 31, 2018 and 2017 (which include sales to U.S. domestic companies for inclusion in products that are sold to international customers) were $39.3 million and $28.3 million, respectively. Except for the U.S., no individual country (including sales to U.S. domestic companies for inclusion in products that are sold to a foreign country) represented more than 10.0% of consolidated net sales for the three months ended October 31, 2018 and 2017.
