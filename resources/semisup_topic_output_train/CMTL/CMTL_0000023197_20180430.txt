Amortization expense for the three months ended April 30, 2018 and 2017 was $5,269,000 and $5,468,000, respectively. Amortization expense for the nine months ended April 30, 2018 and 2017 was $15,806,000 and $17,555,000, respectively.
Intersegment sales for the three months ended April 30, 2018 and 2017 by the Commercial Solutions segment to the Government Solutions segment were $2,664,000 and $2,812,000, respectively. Intersegment sales for the nine months ended April 30, 2018 and 2017 by the Commercial Solutions segment to the Government Solutions segment were $7,613,000 and $9,297,000, respectively. There were nominal sales by the Government Solutions segment to the Commercial Solutions segment for these periods. All intersegment sales are eliminated in consolidation and are excluded from the tables above.
Domestic sales include sales to commercial customers, as well as to U.S. state and local governments. Included in domestic sales, are sales to Verizon which represented 9.8% and 10.6% of consolidated net sales for the three and nine months ended April 30, 2018, respectively. Sales to Verizon were less than 10.0% of consolidated net sales for the three and nine months ended April 30, 2017. 
Our Commercial Solutions segment serves commercial customers and smaller government customers, such as state and local governments, that require advanced communications technologies to meet their needs. This segment also serves certain large government customers (including the U.S. government) when they have requirements for off-the-shelf commercial equipment. Commercial solutions products include satellite earth station communications equipment such as modems and traveling wave tube amplifiers, public safety technologies including those that are utilized in next generation 911 systems and enterprise technologies such as trusted location and text-messaging platforms.
Our Government Solutions segment serves large U.S. and foreign government end-users that require mission critical technologies and systems. Government solutions products include command and control technologies (such as mobile satellite transceivers used on the Blue Force Tracking-1 and Blue Force Tracking-2 programs), troposcatter technologies systems (such as digital troposcatter multiplexers, digital over-the-horizon modems, troposcatter systems and frequency converter systems) and RF power and switching technologies products (such as solid-state high-power narrow and broadband amplifiers, enhanced position location reporting system ("EPLRS") amplifier assemblies, identification friend or foe amplifiers and amplifiers used in the counteraction of improvised explosive devices).
International sales for the three months ended April 30, 2018 and 2017 (which include sales to U.S. domestic companies for inclusion in products that are sold to international customers) were $36,316,000 and $34,131,000, respectively. International sales for the nine months ended April 30, 2018 and 2017 (which include sales to U.S. domestic companies for inclusion in products that are sold to international customers) were $100,030,000 and $116,588,000, respectively. Given our year-to-date performance, we are targeting fiscal 2018 Adjusted EBITDA to grow close to 6.0% over the $70.7 million we achieved in fiscal 2017. In addition, despite the absence of $6.7 million of BFT-1 intellectual property license fees (which the U.S. Army is no longer obligated to pay us to support the BFT-1 system), we expect Adjusted EBITDA, as a percentage of fiscal 2018 consolidated net sales, to be close to 13.0%, which is slightly higher than the 12.8% we achieved in fiscal 2017. We believe these targeted financial metrics demonstrate the strength of our business. If order flow remains strong and we are able to achieve all of our fiscal 2018 business goals, it is possible that our fiscal 2018 Adjusted EBITDA financial metrics could be higher than our targeted amounts. 
On June 6, 2018, our Board of Directors declared a dividend of $0.10 per common share, payable on August 17, 2018 to stockholders of record at the close of business on July 16, 2018. Future dividends remain subject to compliance with financial covenants under our Secured Credit Facility, as amended, as well as Board approval. 
Based on our current spending plans, we expect fiscal 2018 selling, general and administrative expenses, as a percentage of consolidated net sales, to be comparable to fiscal 2017.

Net sales during the three months ended April 30, 2018 of both enterprise technology solutions (such as our location and messaging platforms) and safety and security technology solutions (such as our wireless and next generation 911 ("NG911") platforms) were higher as compared to the net sales we achieved during the three months ended April 30, 2017. During our third quarter of fiscal 2018, we were awarded a $10.1 million multi-year contract to provide one of the largest wireless carriers in the U.S. with a hosted, advanced location services platform which leverages our Position Determining Engine ("PDE"). Under this competitively awarded contract, the U.S. wireless carrier is expected to migrate existing location services from a competitive solution to our more advanced, secure and reliable technologies. Also, we were awarded a two-year multi-million dollar contract to provide Next Generation ("NG") Text to 911 emergency services for the state of Maryland. Through this contract award, 911 call centers located across the state of Maryland will be outfitted to receive and respond to text messages sent to 911. In our view, these contract awards validate that our enterprise technology solutions and safety and security technology solutions are more advanced, secure and reliable than any existing competitive technology. Market conditions remain favorable and we expect that aggregate net sales of these solutions in fiscal 2018 will be higher than in fiscal 2017.
Net Income. During the three months ended April 30, 2018, consolidated net income was $8.2 million as compared to $4.4 million during the three months ended April 30, 2017. 
Net Sales. Consolidated net sales were $147.9 million and $127.8 million for the three months ended April 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively, representing an increase of $20.1 million, or 15.7%. The period-over-period increase in net sales was due primarily to higher net sales in both our Commercial Solutions segment and Government Solutions segment. Net sales by operating segment are discussed below. 
Net sales of our satellite earth station products in fiscal 2018 also reflect the benefit of orders received for our HeightsTM Dynamic Network Access Technology ("HEIGHTS" or "HDNA") solutions. We continue to see signs that our HEIGHTS solutions are gaining traction. We believe HEIGHTS is a revolutionary technology that is designed to deliver the highest Internet Protocol bits per Hertz in its class, as well as robust reliability. HEIGHTS has been and will continue to be a cornerstone of our future research and development efforts. Although the sales cycle for this product line is longer than our historical satellite earth station product line sales cycle, to-date, we have announced several important customer wins for this product line and our pipeline of opportunities continues to grow. For example, during the third quarter of fiscal 2018, we announced that Orange Business Services, one of the largest telecommunications operations and IT services companies in the world, selected HEIGHTS to help them support relief projects in two African countries. We believe this order bodes well for the future given the purchasing influence that Orange Business Services has in other countries. 
During the three months ended April 30, 2018, we recorded a net discrete tax expense of less than $0.1 million. Our effective tax rate for the three months ended April 30, 2017 reflects a net discrete tax expense of $0.3 million. Excluding discrete tax items for the three months ended April 30, 2018, our estimated effective tax rate would have been 27.0%. Our effective tax rate, excluding discrete tax items, for the three months ended April 30, 2017 was 36.0%. The decrease from 36.0% to 27.0% is principally attributable to the passage of Tax Reform which reduced the statutory income tax rate from 35.0% to 21.0%, or a blended income tax rate of approximately 27.0%.
International sales for the three months ended April 30, 2018 and 2017 (which include sales to U.S. domestic companies for inclusion in products that are sold to international customers) were $36.3 million and $34.1 million, respectively. Except for the U.S., no individual country (including sales to U.S. domestic companies for inclusion in products that are sold to a foreign country) represented more than 10.0% of consolidated net sales for the three months ended April 30, 2018 and 2017. 
Net Sales. Consolidated net sales were $403.2 million and $402.6 million for the nine months ended April 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively, representing an increase of $0.6 million, or 0.1%. The period-over-period increase in net sales was due primarily to higher net sales in our Commercial Solutions segment offset by lower net sales in our Government Solutions segment. Net sales by operating segment are discussed below. Exhibit 101.LAB - XBRL Taxonomy Extension Labels Linkbase DocumentItem 1. Legal Proceedings
