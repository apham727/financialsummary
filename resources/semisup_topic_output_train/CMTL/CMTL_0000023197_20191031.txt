Intersegment sales for the three months ended October 31, 2019 and 2018 by the Commercial Solutions segment to the Government Solutions segment were $1,899,000 and $8,540,000, respectively. There were nominal sales by the Government Solutions segment to the Commercial Solutions segment for these periods. All intersegment sales are eliminated in consolidation and are excluded from the tables above.
During the second quarter of fiscal 2019, we began an evaluation and repositioning of our public safety and location technologies solutions in order to focus on providing higher margin solution offerings. To date, we have ceased offering certain solutions, have worked with customers to wind-down certain legacy contracts and have not renewed certain contracts. In connection with this ongoing evaluation and repositioning, during the three months ended October 31, 2019, we recorded $230,000 of estimated contract settlement costs in our Commercial Solutions segment.
Our Government Solutions segment provides mission-critical technologies (such as tactical satellite-based networks and ongoing support for complicated communications networks) and high-performance transmission technologies (such as troposcatter systems and solid-state, high-power amplifiers) to large government end-users (including those of foreign countries), large international customers and domestic prime contractors.
A customer that purchased a TCS 911 call handling software solution in December 2014 (which was more than one year prior to our acquisition of TCS) (the "TCS Legacy Customer") informed us in fiscal 2019 that it experienced several network outages and that it would seek indemnification for any claims made against it as a result of such outages. 
Our Commercial Solutions segment offers satellite ground station technologies (such as modems and amplifiers) and public safety and location technologies (such as 911 call routing and mapping solutions) to commercial customers and smaller government customers, such as state and local governments. This segment also serves certain large government customers (including the U.S. government) that have requirements for off-the-shelf commercial equipment.
ESPP stock-based compensation expense primarily relates to the 15% discount offered to participants in the ESPP. During the three months ended October 31, 2019 and 2018, we recorded benefits of $310,000 and $130,000, respectively, which primarily represents the recoupment of certain share units.
During the three months ended October 31, 2018, we took steps to improve our future operating results and successfully consolidated our Government Solutions segment’s manufacturing facility located in Tampa, Florida with another facility that we maintain in Orlando, Florida. In doing so, during the three months ended October 31, 2018, we recorded $1,373,000 of facility exit costs in selling, general and administrative expenses in our Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations. As discussed further in Note (12) - "Leases," on August 1, 2019, we adopted Topic 842 and, as required by the new standard, reclassified $568,000 of estimated facility exit costs to the current portion of operating lease liabilities. On December 4, 2019, our Board of Directors declared a dividend of $0.10 per common share, payable on February 14, 2020 to stockholders of record at the close of business on January 15, 2020. Future dividends remain subject to compliance with financial covenants under our Credit Facility, as amended, as well as Board approval. 
In October 2019, we announced that the U.S Army awarded us a contract with a $98.6 million ceiling to provide global field support services for military satellite communication ("SATCOM") terminals around the world. These SATCOM terminals provide inter and intra-theater network communications with worldwide reach back capability. The field support contract covers diverse engineering and technical skills to support these SATCOM terminals, including logistics, help desk, network engineering, security engineering, RF and satellite system engineering and support. To date, the contract has been funded at $24.4 million with additional funding expected to occur across the twelve-month performance period plus a possible six-month extension period. Additionally, in November 2019, the U.S. government announced that our teaming partner on a U.S. Marine Corps troposcatter opportunity was awarded a 10-year $325.0 million "IDIQ" contract to provide 172 next-generation troposcatter systems and related services. The teaming partner announced that it intends to subcontract the manufacture and delivery of these troposcatter systems to Comtech, including the test support, logistics and training documentation, training execution, fielding support and sustainment. We are currently negotiating contract terms with our teaming partner and expect our initial order soon. We believe this multi-year opportunity validates Comtech’s market leading troposcatter technologies and expertise. 
International sales for the three months ended October 31, 2019 and 2018 (which include sales to U.S. domestic companies for inclusion in products that are sold to international customers) were $39.4 million and $39.3 million, respectively. Except for the U.S., no individual country (including sales to U.S. domestic companies for inclusion in products that are sold to a foreign country) represented more than 10.0% of consolidated net sales for the three months ended October 31, 2019 and 2018.
Amortization of stock-based compensation expense recorded as selling, general and administrative expenses was $0.7 million in the three months ended October 31, 2019 as compared to $0.9 million in the three months ended October 31, 2018. Amortization of stock-based compensation is not allocated to our two reportable operating segments.
Gross Profit. Gross profit was $63.6 million and $57.8 million for the three months ended October 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. The increase of $5.8 million reflects significantly higher net sales in our Commercial Solutions segment, offset in part by a decrease in sales in our Government Solutions segment, as discussed above.
The increase in our Government Solutions segment’s operating income for the three months ended October 31, 2019, both in dollars and as a percentage of related segment net sales, was due primarily to the $1.4 million of facility exit costs that we incurred during the three months ended October 31, 2018, as discussed above. Excluding such facility exit costs, operating income in our Government Solutions segment for the three months ended October 31, 2018 would have been $8.0 million, or 9.7% of related segment sales. The decrease, both in dollars and as a percentage of related segment net sales, in the three months ended October 31, 2019 was due primarily to the decrease in net sales, as discussed above. Looking forward, given expected sales and product mix assumptions, as discussed above, we expect fiscal 2020 operating income, in dollars, to be comparable to the amount achieved in fiscal 2019, and as a percentage of related segment net sales, to be slightly lower than the 9.2% achieved in fiscal 2019.
In order to position ourselves to take advantage of additional growth opportunities and meet our strategic objectives, during the second quarter of fiscal 2020, we expect to incur approximately $2.4 million of acquisition plan expenses for companies whose solution offerings are complementary to our business. There is no certainty that our acquisition plan efforts will be successful and total acquisition plan expenses in the second quarter of fiscal 2020 may ultimately be higher.
Net Sales. Consolidated net sales were $170.3 million and $160.8 million for the three months ended October 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively, representing an increase of $9.5 million, or 5.9%. The period-over-period increase in net sales reflects significantly higher net sales in our Commercial Solutions segment, offset in part by a decrease in our Government Solutions segment. Net sales by operating segment are discussed below.
Our Government Solutions segment's gross profit, as a percentage of related segment net sales, for the three months ended October 31, 2019 increased slightly in comparison to the three months ended October 31, 2018. Based on the mix and anticipated timing of shipments and performance related to orders currently in our backlog and the mix and timing of expected new orders and related net sales, gross profit for this segment, as a percentage of related segment net sales, for fiscal 2020 is expected to be similar or slightly lower than the level achieved in fiscal 2019.Exhibit 101.SCH - XBRL Taxonomy Extension Schema DocumentItem 1.
