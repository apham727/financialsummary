During the first quarter of 2018 the company recorded its meetings, incentives, conference, events (“M.I.C.E.“) revenue on a net basis for its Via.com division. The net amount reported in operating revenues was $256 thousand ($2.06 million gross revenue less associated costs of $1.8 million). During the second quarter the company determined that it is the principal to these transactions under the relevant guidance in Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, and the gross basis presentation is more appropriate for these type of revenue transactions. As a result the second quarter’s revenues included the gross presentation of the first quarter amounts. This resulted in an increase in the second quarter’s operating revenues of $1.80 million and costs of services provided of $1.8 million. Additionally the M.I.C.E. revenue pertaining to the second quarter was $1.14 million gross revenue, reported in Operating Revenues of the Company’s Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income, and associated costs of $1.03 million, reported in Costs of Services Provided of the Company’s Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income.
In the geographical information table above the significant changes to long-lived assets from June 30, 2017 to June 30, 2018 were comprised of an increase in the United States of $4.4 million primarily due to capitalized continuing medical education product costs and the continued build out of our global corporate headquarters campus in Johns Creek, Georgia.
