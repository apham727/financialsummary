 The Company’s selling, general and administrative expenses for the fiscal quarter ended July 1, 2018 included $320,500 of non-cash stock-based compensation expense. The Company’s selling, general and administrative expenses for the fiscal quarter ended June 25, 2017 included $247,600 of non-cash stock-based compensation expense. Stock-based compensation expense is primarily related to our Performance Stock Units (PSUs), Restricted Stock Units (RSUs) and Stock Options, granted or outstanding under the Company’s Third Amended and Restated Stock and Incentive Plan (the “1994 Plan”).   
 The PSUs cancelled during fiscal 2019 related to the fiscal 2018 grant of PSUs, which had a one-year measurement period (fiscal 2018). The PSUs were cancelled because the applicable fiscal 2018 performance targets were not fully attained. Per the provisions of the 1994 Plan, the shares related to these forfeited and cancelled PSUs were added back to the 1994 Plan and became available for future issuance under the 1994 Plan.   Selling, General and Administrative Expenses. Total selling, general and administrative expenses increased 3.9% for the first quarter of fiscal 2019, compared to the first quarter of fiscal 2018. Selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenues decreased from 19.9% for the first quarter of fiscal 2018, to 19.2% for the first quarter of fiscal 2019.  
 The increase in our selling, general and administrative expenses was primarily due to the increase in our information technology expense of $0.8 million during the first quarter of fiscal 2019, compared to the first quarter of fiscal 2018. We continue to invest in our information technology infrastructure to support our sales initiatives.   
 Our first quarter fiscal year 2019 gross profit increased by 5.3%, compared to the first quarter of fiscal year 2018. The increase in gross profit was primarily the result of the increase in revenue discussed above, and in 
 Our first quarter fiscal 2019 revenue increased by 7.8% compared to the first quarter of fiscal 2018. We experienced first quarter fiscal 2019 revenue growth within our commercial segments of 16.2% and a decrease in revenue in the retail segment of 7.9%, as compared to the first fiscal quarter of 2018. The growth in our commercial segment was driven by increases in our public carrier, government and, private system operators markets. For the retail segment, year over year, revenue declined due, in part, to the timing of two Samsung Galaxy phone launches. The prior launch occurred in the first quarter of fiscal 2018, while the most recent launch instead occurred in the fourth fiscal quarter of 2018, contributing to a decline in year over year first quarter revenue. On the product side, revenue increased in our base station infrastructure and our installation, test and maintenance categories by 25.8% and 6.3%, respectively. Revenue decreased in our network systems and our mobile device accessories categories by 4.4% and 7.4%, respectively, for the first quarter of fiscal 2019, compared to the same quarter last year.   
 Total Revenues. Revenues for the first quarter of fiscal 2019 increased 7.8% compared with the first quarter of fiscal 2018. Within our commercial segment, revenues in our public carrier market increased by 51.7%. This growth was primarily driven by our ability to expand market share with Tier 1 Carrier installers and contractors. We also experienced revenue growth within our government and private system operators markets of 9.3% and 2.8%, respectively, over the prior year quarter. The increase in revenue from our government market was primarily related to increased spending by government contractors related to state and local government fiscal year ends. The increase in revenue for our private system operators is primarily driven by increases from manufacturing and mining customers. Revenues in our value-added resellers market decreased slightly by 1.0%. The growth in our commercial segment was partially offset by a decline in our retail segment of 7.9%, as compared to the first fiscal quarter of 2018. The first fiscal quarter of 2018 included retail segment revenue associated with the introduction by Samsung of a new Galaxy phone. This year, Samsung again introduced a new Galaxy phone, but did so earlier in the calendar year, leading to the receipt of a significant portion of related revenues in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018, instead of the first quarter of fiscal 2019.   
part the result of slightly compressed gross profit margins caused by changes in customer and product mix, including a lower percentage of proprietary Ventev® sales as compared to the prior year period and a larger percentage of overall sales from the public carrier market. Total selling, general and administrative expenses increased by 3.9% compared to the prior-year quarter. The new tax law that went into effect in the third quarter of fiscal 2018 resulted in a significantly lower tax rate in the first quarter of fiscal 2019 as compared to the first quarter of fiscal 2018. As a result of the factors discussed above, net income increased by 69.6% and diluted earnings per share increased by 62.5% compared to the prior-year quarter.   Item 5. Other Information.   Item 1.
