 Our third quarter fiscal 2018 revenue decreased by 0.6% compared to the third quarter of fiscal 2017. We experienced third quarter fiscal 2018 revenue growth within our commercial segments of 4.2% and a decrease in revenue in the retail segment of 7.9%. The growth in our commercial segment is driven by increases in our government, private system operators and value-added resellers market. This growth was partially offset by a decrease in revenue in our public carrier market, which decreased by 12.1%, as compared to the same quarter last year. The decline in our public carrier market is primarily due to timing-related order delays. For the retail segment, revenue declined due, in part, to the timing of the iPhone launch. On the product side, revenue 
 Compensation and benefit expense decreased by $0.8 million for the first nine months of fiscal 2018, compared to the first nine months of fiscal 2017.

 Our third quarter fiscal year 2018 gross profit decreased by 1.2%, compared to the third quarter of fiscal year 2017. The decrease in gross profit was primarily the result of the decrease in revenue discussed above, and in part the result of slightly compressed gross profit margins caused by changes in customer and product mix, including a lower percentage of proprietary Ventev® sales as compared to the prior year period. Total selling, general and administrative expenses decreased by 1.6% compared to the prior-year quarter. The new tax law signed in December also provided a benefit of approximately $0.3 million in this year’s third quarter. As a result, net income increased by 27.9% and diluted earnings per share increased by 26.7% compared to the prior-year quarter.  
 Total Gross Profit. Gross profit for the first nine months of fiscal 2018 increased by 3.3% compared to the first nine months of fiscal 2017. Within our commercial segment, gross profit in our public carriers market increased by 7.4%. Gross profit in our government and our private system operator markets increased by 9.8% and 6.3%, respectively. This growth in our commercial segment was partially offset by a decrease in our value-added resellers market revenue of 3.0%. Within our retail market, gross profit increased by 5.0% in the first nine months of fiscal 2018 as compared to 2017. Overall gross profit margin decreased from 20.9% in the first nine months of fiscal 2017 to 20.6% in the first nine months of fiscal 2018. This decline was primarily caused by a change in product and customer mix, including the increase in lower margin sales in our public carrier market.    Item 5. Other Information.   Item 1.
