 The Company’s selling, general and administrative expenses for the fiscal quarter and nine months ended December 30, 2018 includes $274,100 and $979,400, respectively, of non-cash stock-based compensation expense. The Company’s selling, general and administrative expenses for the fiscal quarter and nine months ended December 24, 2017 included $243,500 and $745,400, respectively, of non-cash stock-based compensation expense. Stock-based compensation expense is primarily related to our Performance Stock Units (PSUs), Restricted Stock Units (RSUs) and Stock Options, granted or outstanding under the Company’s Third Amended and Restated Stock and Incentive Plan (the “1994 Plan”).   
 The PSUs cancelled during fiscal 2019 primarily related to the fiscal 2018 grant of PSUs, which had a one-year measurement period (fiscal 2018). These PSUs were cancelled because the applicable fiscal 2018 performance targets were not fully satisfied. Per the provisions of the 1994 Plan, the shares related to these forfeited and cancelled PSUs were added back to the 1994 Plan and became available for future issuance under the 1994 Plan.   Information technology expense increased $1.4 million during the first nine months of fiscal 2019, compared to the first nine months of fiscal 2018. We continue to invest in our information technology infrastructure to support our sales initiatives.  
 Selling, General and Administrative Expenses. Total selling, general and administrative expenses increased by $4.0 million for the first nine months of fiscal 2019, compared to the first nine months of fiscal 2018. Selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenues decreased from 19.0% for the first nine months of fiscal 2018, to 18.6% for the first nine months of fiscal 2019.  
 Selling, General and Administrative Expenses. Total selling, general and administrative expenses increased by $81,600 for the third quarter of fiscal 2019, compared to the third quarter of fiscal 2018. Selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenues decreased from 18.7% for the third quarter of fiscal 2018, to 18.1% for the third quarter of fiscal 2019.  
 Our third quarter fiscal year 2019 gross profit increased by 4.7%, compared to the third quarter of fiscal year 2018. The increase in gross profit was primarily the result of the increase in revenue discussed above. Gross margin for the third quarter fiscal year 2019 and fiscal year 2018 was 20.4% and 20.2%, respectively. The improvement in gross margin was a result of lower freight expenses and improved profitability in our non-public carrier sales. Selling, General and Administrative expenses for the third quarter fiscal year 2019 were up 
 Selling, general and administrative expenses were consistent as compared to the third quarter of fiscal 2018, despite the 4.1% increase in sales. There was an increase of $0.5 million in corporate support expense, primarily related to bad debt expenses, an increase of $0.3 million in information technology infrastructure to support our sales initiatives, and an increase of $0.2 million in compensation and benefits expense, during the third quarter of fiscal 2019 as compared to the third quarter of fiscal 2018. These increases were offset by the $0.9 million decrease in marketing expense.  
 Our third quarter fiscal 2019 revenue increased by 4.1% compared to the third quarter of fiscal 2018. We experienced third quarter fiscal 2019 revenue growth within our commercial segment of 7.8% and a decrease in revenue in the retail segment of 2.1%, as compared to the third fiscal quarter of 2018. The growth in our commercial segment was driven by an increase in our public carrier market related to increased sales to Tier 1 carriers and associated contractors. For the retail segment, revenue decreased due, in part, to the decline in lower consumer traffic in retail stores and a decrease in Ventev mobile device accessory sales. Among our product categories, revenue increased in our base station infrastructure category by 18.7%.   
 Total Gross Profit. Gross profit for the first nine months of fiscal 2019 increased by 5.0% compared to the first nine months of fiscal 2018. Within our commercial segment, gross profit in our public carrier market and our value-added resellers and integrators market increased by 35.2% and 1.6%, respectively, for the first nine months of fiscal 2019 compared to the first nine months of fiscal 2018. This growth in our commercial segment was partially offset by a decrease in our retail segment by 1.0%. Overall gross profit margin decreased from 20.6% for the first nine months of fiscal 2018 to 20.2% for the first nine months of fiscal 2019. This decline was primarily caused by a change in customer mix, including the increase in lower margin sales in the public carrier market.   
 Total Revenues. Revenues for the third quarter of fiscal 2019 increased 4.1% compared with the third quarter of fiscal 2018. Revenues in our public carrier market increased by 47.9%. This growth was primarily driven by our ability to expand market share with Tier 1 Carrier installers and contractors. The growth in our public carrier market was partially offset by a 2.1% and 5.4% decline in sales to the retail market and the value-added resellers and integrators market.   Item 5.
