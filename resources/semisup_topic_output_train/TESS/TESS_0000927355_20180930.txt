 The Company’s selling, general and administrative expenses for the fiscal quarter and six months ended September 30, 2018 includes $384,800 and $705,300, respectively, of non-cash stock-based compensation expense. The Company’s selling, general and administrative expenses for the fiscal quarter and six months ended September 24, 2017 included $254,300 and $501,900, respectively, of non-cash stock-based compensation expense. Stock-based compensation expense is primarily related to our Performance Stock Units (PSUs), Restricted Stock Units (RSUs) and Stock Options, granted or outstanding under the Company’s Third Amended and Restated Stock and Incentive Plan (the “1994 Plan”).   
 The PSUs cancelled during fiscal 2019 primarily related to the fiscal 2018 grant of PSUs, which had a one-year measurement period (fiscal 2018). These PSUs were cancelled because the applicable fiscal 2018 performance targets were not fully satisfied. Per the provisions of the 1994 Plan, the shares related to these forfeited and cancelled PSUs were added back to the 1994 Plan and became available for future issuance under the 1994 Plan.   Selling, General and Administrative Expenses. Total selling, general and administrative expenses increased by $3.9 million for the first six months of fiscal 2019, compared to the first six months of fiscal 2018. Selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenues decreased from 19.1% for the first six months of fiscal 2018, to 18.9% for the first six months of fiscal 2019.  
 Selling, General and Administrative Expenses. Total selling, general and administrative expenses increased by $2.8 million for the second quarter of fiscal 2019, compared to the second quarter of fiscal 2018. Selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenues increased from 18.4% for the second quarter of fiscal 2018, to 18.6% for the second quarter of fiscal 2019.  
 Our second quarter fiscal year 2019 gross profit increased by 4.9%, compared to the second quarter of fiscal year 2018. The increase in gross profit was primarily the result of the increase in revenue discussed above. 
 Our second quarter fiscal 2019 revenue increased by 9.3% compared to the second quarter of fiscal 2018. We experienced second quarter fiscal 2019 revenue growth within our commercial segments of 11.0% and an increase in revenue in the retail segment of 5.9%, as compared to the second fiscal quarter of 2018. The growth in our commercial segment was driven by increases in our public carrier markets on account of increased sales to Tier 1 carriers and associated contractors. For the retail segment, year over year, revenue increased due, in part, to successful execution of the iPhone XS and the XS Max launches as well as growth in Ventev mobile device accessory sales. On the product side, revenue increased in our base station infrastructure, installation, test and maintenance and mobile device accessories categories by 27.0%, 15.8%, and 5.9% respectively. Revenue decreased in our network systems category by 22.7%, for the second quarter of fiscal 2019, compared to the same quarter last year.   
 Total Gross Profit. Gross profit for the first six months of fiscal 2019 increased by 5.1% compared to the first six months of fiscal 2018. Within our commercial segment, gross profit in our public carriers and integrators and value-added reseller market increased by 31.6% and 2.7%, respectively. This growth in our commercial segment was partially offset by a decrease in our retail segment by 1.8%. Overall gross profit margin decreased from 20.7% in the first six months of fiscal 2018 to 20.1% in the first six months of fiscal 2019. This decline was primarily caused by a change in customer mix, including the increase in lower margin sales in the public carrier market.   
 Total Revenues. Revenues for the first six months of fiscal 2019 increased 8.6% compared with the first six months of fiscal 2018. Within our commercial segment, revenues in our public carrier market increased by 48.2%, largely due to increased spending among Tier 1 carrier and contractors customers, and also due in part to better execution of our selling strategy in this market. As for integrators and value-added reseller market, there is a slight decrease in revenue by 0.4%. The growth in the commercial segment was partially offset by a decline in our retail segment of 1.1% due, in part, to consolidation of our customer base within this market.  
 Total Gross Profit. Gross profit for the second quarter of fiscal 2019 increased by 4.9% compared to the second quarter of fiscal 2018. Overall gross profit margin decreased slightly from 20.6% in the second quarter of fiscal 2018 to 19.8% in the second quarter of fiscal 2019. This decline was caused primarily due to higher freight expenses and change in customer mix. Within our commercial segment, gross profit in our public carrier, and integrators and value-added reseller markets increased by 26.6%, and 3.1%, respectively. We continue to experience margin compression within the public carrier market because of increases in sales with larger customers. Within our retail market, gross profit decreased by 0.4% in the second quarter of fiscal 2019 as compared to 2018, due to higher freight costs, particularly air freight from foreign vendors.   
Gross margin for the second quarter fiscal year 2019 and fiscal year 2018 was 19.8% and 20.6% respectively. The primary reason for the decrease in margin is higher freight expenses and changes in customer mix associated with the large increase in public carrier revenues. The freight increases are related to the growth in project business, primarily in the carrier market as well as a higher portion of international air shipments of Ventev inventory. Selling, General and Administrative expenses for the second quarter fiscal year 2019 were up 11% compared to the second quarter fiscal year 2018. The increase is related to increased freight costs and other variable operations costs primarily related to our large carriers and retail customers. As a result of the factors discussed above, net income decreased by 32.9% and diluted earnings per share decreased by 33.3% compared to the prior-year quarter.   Item 5. Other Information.   Item 1.
