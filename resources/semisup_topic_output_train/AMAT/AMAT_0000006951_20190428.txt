•the inappropriate scale of acquired entities’ critical resources or facilities for business needs.
During the six months ended April 28, 2019, the increase in goodwill was primarily due to acquisitions completed in the second quarter of fiscal 2019, which were not significant to Applied’s results of operations.
Applied’s effective tax rates for the second quarter of fiscal 2019 and 2018 were 12.3 percent and 12.8 percent, respectively. The effective tax rate for the second quarter of fiscal 2019 was lower than the same period in the prior fiscal year primarily due to tax expense of $71 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2018 for adjustments to the transition tax and remeasurement of deferred tax assets as a result of the Tax Act. Excluding the tax expense of $71 million, the effective tax rate for the second quarter of fiscal 2019 was higher than the rate in the same period of the prior fiscal year primarily due to changes in the geographical composition of income which includes jurisdictions with differing tax rates.

The industries that Applied serves can be volatile and difficult to predict.
Applied’s effective tax rates for the first half of fiscal 2019 and 2018 were 12.8 percent and 48.2 percent, respectively. The effective tax rate for the first half of fiscal 2019 was lower than the same period in the prior fiscal year primarily due to tax expense of $1.1 billion in the first half of fiscal 2018 for the transition tax and remeasurement of deferred tax assets as a result of the Tax Act. Excluding the tax expense of $1.1 billion, the effective tax rate for the first half of fiscal 2019 was higher than the rate in the same period of the prior fiscal year primarily due to tax expense of $81 million in the first half of fiscal 2019 related to changes in uncertain tax positions and the excess tax benefit from share-based compensation in the first half of fiscal 2019 being $45 million less than in the same period in the prior fiscal year. The effective tax rate for the first half of fiscal 2019 was also higher due to changes in the geographical composition of income which includes jurisdictions with differing tax rates.
As of April 28, 2019, Applied’s reporting units include Semiconductor Product Group and Imaging and Process Control Group, which combine to form the Semiconductor Systems reporting segment, Applied Global Services, and Display and Adjacent Markets. 
Applied is exposed to the risks of operating a global business.
The following customers accounted for at least 10 percent of Applied’s net sales for the six months ended April 28, 2019, and sales to these customers included products and services from multiple reportable segments.
Applied is exposed to various risks related to the global regulatory environment.Net sales for the three and six months ended April 28, 2019 increased compared to the same periods in the prior year primarily due to higher customer spending for services and legacy systems. Operating income for the three and six months ended April 28, 2019 compared to the same periods in the prior year increased due to higher net sales, partially offset by higher expenses related to an increase in headcount. Operating margin for the three months ended April 28, 2019 decreased slightly compared to the same period in the prior year primarily due to an increase in headcount to support revenue growth. In the three months ended April 28, 2019, two customers each accounted for more than 10 percent of this segment’s total net sales.
Gross margin in the three and six months ended April 28, 2019 decreased compared to the same periods in the prior year primarily due to the decrease in net sales and unfavorable changes in customer and product mix. Gross margin during the three months ended April 28, 2019 and April 29, 2018 included $22 million and $21 million of share-based compensation expense, respectively. Gross margin during the six months ended April 28, 2019 and April 29, 2018 included $44 million and $43 million of share-based compensation expense, respectively. 
Net sales for the three and six months ended April 28, 2019 decreased compared to the same periods in the prior year primarily due to lower customer investments in mobile and TV display manufacturing equipment. Operating income and operating margin for the three and six months ended April 28, 2019 decreased compared to the same periods in the prior year, reflecting lower net sales and unfavorable changes in customer and product mix. In the three months ended April 28, 2019, three customers each accounted for at least 10 percent of this segment’s net sales, and together they accounted for approximately 84 percent of this segment’s total net sales.
For the three and six months ended April 28, 2019 compared to the same periods in the prior year, net sales decreased primarily due to decreased customer investments in semiconductor and display manufacturing equipment, partially offset by an increase in services revenue. The Semiconductor Systems segment continued to represent the largest contributor of total net sales.
Marketing and selling expenses increased slightly in the three and six months ended April 28, 2019 compared to the same periods in fiscal 2018 primarily due to additional headcount, partially offset by lower variable compensation expenses. Marketing and selling expenses during the three months ended April 28, 2019 and April 29, 2018 included $7 million and $8 million of share-based compensation expense, respectively. Marketing and selling expenses during the six months ended April 28, 2019 and April 29, 2018 included $15 million and $16 million of share-based compensation expense, respectively.•the inappropriate scale of acquired entities’ critical resources or facilities for business needs.
