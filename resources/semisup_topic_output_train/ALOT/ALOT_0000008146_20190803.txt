In fiscal 2018, AstroNova, Inc. entered into an Asset Purchase and License Agreement with Honeywell International, Inc. (Honeywell) to acquire an exclusive, perpetual, world-wide license to manufacture Honeywells narrow-format flight deck printers for two aircraft families along with certain inventory used in the manufacturing of the licensed printers. The purchase price included a guaranteed minimum royalty payment of $15.0 million, to be paid over ten years, based on gross revenues from the sales of the printers, paper and repair services of the licensed products. The royalty rates vary based on the year in which they are paid or earned and product sold or service provided, and range from single-digit to mid double-digit percentages of gross revenue.

For the three and six months ended July 28, 2018, the diluted per share amounts do not reflect common equivalent shares outstanding of 273,275 and 340,575, respectively.

We normally do not have contract assets, which are primarily unbilled accounts receivable that are conditional on something other than the passage of time. Our contract liabilities, which represent billings in excess of revenue recognized, are related to advanced billings for purchased service agreements and extended warranties and were $321,000 and $373,000 at August 3, 2019 and January 31, 2019, respectively, and are recorded as deferred revenue in the condensed consolidated balance sheet. The decrease in the deferred revenue balance during the six months ended August 3, 2019 is primarily due to approximately $412,000 of revenue recognized during the period that was included in the deferred revenue balance at January 31, 2019, offset by cash payments received in advance of satisfying performance obligations.  
The guaranteed minimum royalty payment obligation was recorded at the present value of the minimum annual royalty payments using a present value factor of 2.8%, which is based on the estimated after-tax cost of debt for similar companies.

At August 3, 2019, the current portion of the outstanding guaranteed minimum royalty obligation of $2.0 million is to be paid over the next twelve months and is reported as a current liability and the remainder of $9.0 million is reported as a long-term liability on the Companys condensed consolidated balance sheet. In addition to the guaranteed minimum royalty payments, the Company also incurred excess royalty expense of $0.1 million and $0.7 million, respectively, for the three and six month periods ended August 3, 2019 and $0.9 and $1.3 million, respectively, for the three and six month periods ended July 28, 2018 which is included in cost of revenue in the Companys consolidated statements of income.

The Company reported net income of $2.7 million, or $0.36 per diluted share, for the first six months of the current year. On a comparable basis, net income for the first six months of the prior year was $2.0 million, or $0.29 per diluted share, which included $0.8 million of after-tax income, or $0.12 per diluted share, as a result of a change in accounting estimates in the prior years first quarter for product cost and operating expenses related to a transition services agreement entered into with Honeywell in connection with the Honeywell Agreement. In addition, during the first quarter of fiscal 2019, a change in accounting estimate for revenue subject to customer rebates under the Honeywell Agreement increased net income by $0.3 million or $0.05 per diluted share. Return on revenue was 3.8% for the first six months of fiscal 2020 compared to 3.1% for the first six months of fiscal 2019.

Revenue through domestic channels for the second quarter of the current year was $20.6 million, an increase of 3.4% over the prior years second quarter. International revenue for the second quarter of the current year was $12.9 million, a 7.3% decrease over the previous year second quarter, and represents 38.3% of AstroNovas second quarter revenue. Current year second quarter international revenue includes an unfavorable foreign exchange rate impact of $0.3 million.  
Supplies revenue in the first half of the current year was $37.8 million, representing a 9.3% increase over the prior years first six months revenue of $34.6 million. The current year increase in supplies revenue is due primarily to the increase in inkjet printer supplies and labels sales, tempered by lower thermal film and electrophotographic supplies revenue in the Product Identification segment.  
Revenue from the Product Identification segment increased 1.7% in the second quarter of the current year, with revenue of $22.1 million compared to $21.8 million in the same period of the prior year. The current quarter increase in revenue is primarily attributable to the increase in supplies revenue, as the Companys installed base of printers continues to grow. Specifically, this includes inkjet supply revenue, which experienced double digit growth as compared to the same period in the prior year. Also contributing to the increase in revenue for the current quarter was a 10.6% increase in service and other revenue. Although the overall revenue increase was slightly tempered by lower sales in Product Identifications hardware product line, the segment experienced a significant revenue contribution from the introduction of the new QL -300 printer, and both QuickLabels monochromatic printers and TrojanLabels T2-C printers experienced continued growth during the current quarter. Product Identifications current quarter segment operating profit was $2.2 million, reflecting a profit margin of 10.0%. This compares to the prior years second quarter segment profit of $2.2 million and related profit margin of 9.9%. The slight increase in Product Identification current year second quarter segment operating margin is primarily due to higher sales and product mix.   Item 1A.
