Our products are distributed through our own sales force and authorized dealers in the United States. We also sell to customers outside of the United States primarily through our Company offices in Canada, China, Europe, Mexico and Southeast Asia as well as through independent dealers and representatives. AstroNova, Inc. products are employed around the world in a wide range of aerospace, apparel, automotive, avionics, chemical, computer peripherals, communications, distribution, food and beverage, general manufacturing, packaging and transportation applications.  
In May 2015 (fiscal year 2016), the Company granted an aggregate of 80,000 time-based and 155,000 performance-based RSUs (“2016 RSUs”) to certain officers of the Company. The time-based 2016 RSUs vest in four equal annual installments commencing on the first anniversary of the grant date. The performance-based 2016 RSUs vest over three years based upon the increase in revenue, if any, achieved each fiscal year relative to a three-year revenue increase goal. Performance-based 2016 RSUs that are earned based on organic revenue growth are fully vested when earned, while those earned based on revenue growth via acquisitions vest annually over a three-year period following the fiscal year in which the revenue growth occurs. Any performance-based 2016 RSUs that were not earned at the end of fiscal 2018 were forfeited. The expense for such shares was recognized in the fiscal year in which the results were achieved, however, the shares were not fully earned until approved by the Compensation Committee in the first quarter of the following fiscal year. Based upon revenue in fiscal 2018, 2017 and 2016, 33,638, 9,025 and 15,810 shares of the performance based RSUs were earned in the first quarter of fiscal 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively.  
The majority of our hardware products contain embedded operating systems and data management software which is included in the purchase price of the equipment. The software is deemed incidental to the systems as a whole as it is not sold or marketed separately and its production costs are minor compared to those of the hardware system. Hardware and software elements are typically delivered at the same time and are accounted for as a single performance obligation for which revenue is recognized at the point in time when ownership is transferred to the customer.  
On September 28, 2017, AstroNova, Inc. entered into an Asset Purchase and License Agreement (the “Honeywell Agreement”) with Honeywell International, Inc. to acquire an exclusive perpetual world-wide license to manufacture Honeywell’s narrow-format flight deck printers for two aircraft families along with certain inventory used in the manufacturing of the licensed printers. The purchase price consisted of an initial upfront payment of $14.6 million in cash. The Honeywell Agreement also provided for guaranteed minimum royalty payments of $15.0 million, to be paid to Honeywell over the next ten years, based on gross revenues from the sales of the printers, paper and repair services of the licensed products. The royalty rates vary based on the year in which they are paid or earned and product sold or service provided, and range from single-digit to mid double-digit percentages of gross revenue.  
Includes additional $0.4 million related to the payment in fiscal 2019 in accordance with the terms of the TSA.  
In the second quarter of the current year, $3.0 million was drawn on the revolving credit facility, of which $1.5 million was repaid and $1.5 million remains outstanding as of October 27, 2018. The outstanding balance bears interest at a weighted average annual rate of 5.5% and $38,000 of interest has been accrued on this obligation and included in other expense in the accompanying condensed consolidated income statement for the three and nine months ended October 27, 2018. As of October 27, 2018, there is $8.5 million available for borrowing under the revolving credit facility.  
Significant judgments primarily include the identification of performance obligation arrangements as well as the pattern of delivery for those services.  
We normally do not have contract assets, which are primarily unbilled accounts receivable that are conditional on something other than the passage of time. Our contract liabilities, which represent billings in excess of revenue recognized, are related to advanced billings for purchased service agreements and extended warranties and were $374,000 and $367,000 at October 27, 2018 and January 31, 2018, respectively, and are recorded as deferred revenue in the condensed consolidated balance sheet. The slight increase in the deferred revenue at October 27, 2018 is primarily due to approximately $610,000 of revenue recognized during the period that was included in the deferred revenue balance at January 31, 2018, offset by cash payments received in advance of satisfying performance obligations.  
We may perform service at the request of the customer, generally for the repair and maintenance of products previously sold. These services are short in duration, typically less than one month, and total less than 9% of revenue for the nine months ended October 27, 2018. Revenue is recognized as services are rendered and accepted by the customer. We also provide service agreements on certain of our Product Identification equipment. Service agreements are purchased separately from the equipment and provide for the right to obtain service and maintenance on the equipment for a period of typically one to two years. Accordingly, revenue on these agreements is recognized over the term of the agreements. The portion of service agreement contracts that are uncompleted at the end of any reporting period are included in deferred revenue.  Product Identification—offers product identification and digital label printer hardware, software, servicing contracts, parts and supplies. Supplies includes the media (substrate) and ink, toner, and thermal transfer ribbon used with the Company’s printers and the various parts used to maintain the printers.  
Revenue for the first nine months of the current year was $99.5 million, representing a 23.3% increase compared to the previous year’s first nine months of revenue of $80.7 million. Revenue through domestic channels for the first nine months of the current year was $60.8 million, an increase of 19.2% from the prior year. International revenue for the first nine months of the current year was $38.7 million, a 30.3% increase from the previous year. The current year’s first nine months international revenue included a favorable foreign exchange rate impact of $0.9 million.  
The decreased cash and investment position at October 27, 2018 as compared to year end, primarily resulted from increased cash used in operations as discussed above, principal payments of long-term debt of $4.0 million, dividends paid of $1.4 million and cash used to acquire property, plant and equipment of $1.9 million.  
Supplies revenue in the first nine months of the current year was $52.7 million, representing a 10.4% increase over the prior year’s first nine months revenue of $47.7 million. The current year increase in supplies revenue is related primarily to increases in digital color printer supplies product revenue, and label and tag revenue in the Product Identification segment.
