Non-U.S. sales, as reflected in Part 1 Item 1. Business, accounted for approximately 92%, 92%, and 93% of total revenue in the three months ended September 29, 2019 and fiscal years 2019, and 2018, respectively. We expect that international sales will continue to account for a substantial majority of our total revenue in future years.
Revenue of $198.0 million included in deferred revenue at June 30, 2019 was recognized during the three months ended September 29, 2019.
The Company provides standard warranties on its systems. The liability amount is based on actual historical warranty spending activity by type of system, customer, and geographic region, modified for any known differences such as the impact of system reliability improvements.
Semiconductor manufacturers must make a substantial investment to qualify and integrate wafer processing equipment into a semiconductor production line. We believe that once a semiconductor manufacturer selects a particular supplier’s processing equipment, the manufacturer generally relies upon that equipment for that specific production line application for an extended period of time, especially for customers that are more focused on tool reuse. Accordingly, we expect it to be more difficult to sell our products to a given customer for a product line application if that customer initially selects a competitor’s equipment for the same product line application.

The slight decrease in gross margin as a percentage of revenue in the September 2019 quarter compared to the September 2018 quarter is primarily due to lower factory utilization, partially offset by changes in customer and product mix, and lower amortization expense related to intangibles acquired through business combinations. 
In the September 2019 quarter, revenue decreased 8% compared to the June 2019 quarter, reflecting lower customer demand for semiconductor equipment. The decline in gross margin as a percentage of revenue in the September 2019 quarter compared to the June 2019 quarter was mainly driven by customer and product mix. The decrease in operating expenses in the September 2019 quarter compared to the June 2019 quarter, was mainly driven by decreases in supplies and employee-related costs due to reduced working days in the September quarter. 
Interest income decreased in the September 2019 quarter compared to the June 2019 quarter as a result of lower cash balances and lower yield. Interest income increased compared to the September 2018 quarter as a result of higher cash balances and higher yield.None.We continuously reassess our strategic resource allocation choices in response to the changing business environment.
