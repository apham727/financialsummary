Outsource providers and component suppliers have played and will continue to play a key role in our manufacturing operations, field installation and support, and many of our transactional and administrative functions, such as information technology, facilities management, and certain elements of our finance organization. These providers and suppliers might suffer financial setbacks, be acquired by third parties, become subject to exclusivity arrangements that preclude further business with us, or be

The Company provides standard warranties on its systems. The liability amount is based on actual historical warranty spending activity by type of system, customer, and geographic region, modified for any known differences such as the impact of system reliability improvements.
Non-U.S. sales, as reflected in Part 1 Item 1. Business, accounted for approximately 91%, 92%, and 92% of total revenue in the six months ended December 24, 2017 and fiscal years 2017, and 2016, respectively. We expect that international sales will continue to account for a substantial majority of our total revenue in future years.
On August 28, 2017, the Company completed the acquisition of the outstanding shares of Coventor, Inc. (“Coventor”), a privately-held company that is a provider of simulation and modeling solutions for semiconductor process technology, micro-electromechanical systems (MEMS), and the Internet of Things, for a total purchase consideration of $137.6 million. 
Semiconductor manufacturers must make a substantial investment to qualify and integrate wafer processing equipment into a semiconductor production line. We believe that once a semiconductor manufacturer selects a particular supplier’s processing equipment, the manufacturer generally relies upon that equipment for that specific production line application for an extended period of time, especially for customers that are more focused on tool reuse. Accordingly, we expect it to be more difficult to sell our products to a given customer if that customer initially selects a competitor’s equipment for the same product line application.
The Company recorded an income tax expense of $744.2 million and $841.2 million for the three and six months ended December 24, 2017, which yielded an effective tax rate of approximately 101.4% and 59.2%, respectively.
•Our failure to meet, or violation of, regulatory or other legal obligations, such as the timely publication or filing of financial statements, tax forms and other required communications.
Acquired existing technology represents the fair value of products that have reached technological feasibility and are a part of Coventor’s product offerings and customer relationships represent the fair values of the underlying relationships and agreements with Coventor’s customers. Interest income increased in the December 2017 quarter compared to the December 2016 quarter as a result of higher yield. Interest income increased in the six months ended December 2017 compared to the six months ended December 2016 as a result of an increase in yield and longer portfolio duration.
Gross margin as a percentage of revenue increased in the December 2017 quarter compared to the September 2017 and the December 2016 quarter, as well as, in the six months ended December 24, 2017 compared to the same period in 2016 primarily due to favorable changes in customer and product mix. 
Our customer base includes leading semiconductor memory, foundry, and integrated device manufacturers that make products such as non-volatile memory (“NVM”), DRAM memory, and logic devices. We aim to increase our strategic relevance with our customers by contributing more to their continued success. Our core technical competency is integrating hardware, process, materials, software, and process control enabling results on the wafer.
In the December 2017 quarter, revenue increased compared to the September 2017 quarter primarily as a result of increased investments from our memory customers. Gross margin as a percentage of revenue in the December 2017 quarter increased as compared to the September 2017 quarter primarily due to favorable customer and product mix. Operating expenses in the December 2017 quarter increased compared to the September 2017 quarter mainly due to an increase in employee headcount and outside services. The December 2017 quarter results were negatively impacted by a one-time provisional charge associated with the recently enacted U.S. tax reform legislation.None.We Depend on Creating New Products and Processes and Enhancing Existing Products and Processes for Our Success.
