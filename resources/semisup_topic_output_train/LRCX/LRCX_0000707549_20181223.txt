Revenue of $151.7 million and $412.7 million included in deferred revenue at June 25, 2018 was recognized during the three and six months ended December 23, 2018, respectively.
•a failure to release new or enhanced versions of our products on a timely basis.
•impairing our ability to obtain additional financing in the future.
The Company provides standard warranties on its systems. The liability amount is based on actual historical warranty spending activity by type of system, customer, and geographic region, modified for any known differences such as the impact of system reliability improvements.
Non-U.S. sales, as reflected in Part 1 Item 1. Business, accounted for approximately 95%, 93%, and 92% of total revenue in the six months ended December 23, 2018 and fiscal years 2018, and 2017, respectively. We expect that international sales will continue to account for a substantial majority of our total revenue in future years.
Outsource providers and component suppliers have played and will continue to play a key role in our manufacturing operations, field installation and support, and many of our transactional and administrative functions, such as information technology, facilities management, and certain elements of our finance organization. These providers and suppliers might suffer financial setbacks, be acquired by third parties, become subject to exclusivity arrangements that preclude further business with us, or be unable to meet our requirements or expectation due to their independent business decisions or force majeure events that could interrupt or impair their continued ability to perform as we expect.
Semiconductor manufacturers must make a substantial investment to qualify and integrate wafer processing equipment into a semiconductor production line. We believe that once a semiconductor manufacturer selects a particular supplier’s processing equipment, the manufacturer generally relies upon that equipment for that specific production line application for an extended period of time, especially for customers that are more focused on tool reuse. Accordingly, we expect it to be more difficult to sell our products to a given customer if that customer initially selects a competitor’s equipment for the same product line application.
The Company recorded an income tax expense of $90.9 million and $148.9 million for the three and six months ended December 23, 2018, which yielded an effective tax rate of approximately 13.8% and 11.9%, respectively.
•Our failure to meet, or violation of, regulatory or other legal obligations, such as the timely publication or filing of financial statements, tax information and other required communications.
While we have implemented ISO 27001 compliant security procedures and virus protection software, intrusion prevention systems, identity and access control, and emergency recovery processes, and we carefully select our third-party providers of information systems, to mitigate risks to the information systems that we rely on, those mitigation and protection systems cannot be guaranteed to be fail-safe and we may still suffer cyber-related incidents. Gross margin as a percentage of revenue remained flat in the December 2018 quarter compared to the September 2018 quarter primarily due to higher factory utilization, offset by changes in customer and product mix. The decrease in gross margin as a percentage of revenue in the December 2018 quarter compared to the December 2017 quarter is primarily due to lower factory utilization and changes in customer and product mix. In the six months ended December 23, 2018, gross margin as a percentage of revenue decreased compared to the same period in the prior year primarily due to lower factory utilization and changes in customer and product mix. 
Revenue for the December 2018 quarter increased 8% from the September 2018 quarter, reflecting higher customer demand for semiconductor equipment. Revenue for the December 2018 quarter decreased 2% compared to the same prior year period, and decreased 4% in the six months ended December 23, 2018 compared to the same period in 2017, reflecting lower customer demand for semiconductor equipment.
Interest income decreased in the December 2018 quarter compared to the September 2018 and December 2017 quarters as a result of lower cash balances, partially offset by higher yield. Interest income decreased in the six months ended December 23, 2018 compared to the same period in 2017 as a result of lower cash balances.We maintain disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over final reporting that are designed to comply with Rule 13a-15 of the Exchange Act. In designing and evaluating the controls and procedures associated with each, management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives, and that the effectiveness of controls cannot be absolute because the cost to design and implement a control to identify errors or mitigate the risk of errors occurring should not outweigh the potential loss caused by the errors that would likely be detected by the control. Moreover, we believe that a control system cannot be guaranteed to be 100% effective all of the time. Accordingly, a control system, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the control system’s objectives will be met.We Depend on Creating New Products and Processes and Enhancing Existing Products and Processes for Our Success. Consequently, We Are Subject to Risks Associated with Rapid Technological Change
•a failure to release new or enhanced versions of our products on a timely basis.
•challenges maintaining reliable and uninterrupted sources of supply.
•impairing our ability to obtain additional financing in the future.
During periods of rapid growth or decline in demand for our products and services, we face significant challenges in maintaining adequate financial and business controls, management processes, information systems, and procedures for training, assimilating, and managing our workforce, and in appropriately sizing our supply chain infrastructure and facilities, work force, and other components of our business on a timely basis. If we do not adequately meet these challenges during periods of increasing or declining demand, our gross margins and earnings may be negatively impacted.
