We recorded an income tax benefit for the second quarter of 2019 of $26 thousand at an effective tax rate of -16.3 %, compared to an income tax provision during the second quarter of 2018 of $305 thousand at an effective tax rate of 20.1%. For the six months ended June 30, 2019, we recorded an income tax provision of $89 thousand at an effective tax rate of 8.7%, compared to an income tax provision during the six months ended June 30, 2018 of $483 thousand at an effective tax rate of 20.4%. The effective tax rate for the both the second quarter of 2019 and six months ended June 30, 2019 was lower as it included the foreign-derived intangible income (“FDII”) deduction under the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the “Tax Reform Act”) as well as near breakeven pre-tax income in the second quarter of 2019. The FDII deduction was not included in the effective tax rate for the second quarter of 2018 or six months ended June 30, 2018 as the interpretive guidance for the deduction was not yet released. 
For the three months ended June 30, 2019, our Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.09 per share, totaling $671 thousand, which was paid on June 14, 2019 to common shareholders of record at the close of business on May 20, 2019. For the three months ended June 30, 2018, dividends declared and paid totaled $663 thousand, or $0.09 per share. Dividends declared and paid totaled $1.3 million, or $0.18 per share for both the six months ended June 30, 2019 and 2018.

In 2016, the United Kingdom voted to depart from the European Union, known as Brexit and subsequently notified the European Council of its intention to leave the E.U. and began to negotiate the terms of the future relationship between the U.K. and the E.U. upon exit. We have taken certain actions in response to Brexit and in anticipation of E.U. legal requirements and the U.K.’s separation from the E.U. The potential impact from Brexit on us and on our results of operations is unclear. The actual effects of Brexit will depend upon many factors, including the final results of the Brexit negotiations. We do not, however, expect Brexit to have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations as 15% and 10% of our total revenues for the three and six months ended June 30, 2019, respectively, are attributable to our U.K. operations. However, we cannot predict the direction Brexit-related matters may take or the impact on our European operations, including our U.K. subsidiary. 
We have elected certain practical expedients available under ASC 842 upon adoption. We have applied the practical expedient which allows prospective transition to ASC 842 on January 1, 2019. Under this transition practical expedient, we did not reassess lease classification, embedded leases or initial direct costs. We have applied the practical expedient for short-term leases. We have lease agreements that include lease and non-lease components, and we have not elected the practical expedients to combine these components for any of our leases. The adoption of ASC 842 had no effect on our Consolidated Statement of Income or Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows. Upon adoption of ASC 842, we recorded a $3.7 million right-of-use asset and a $3.9 million lease liability. The adoption of the new standard had no impact on retained earnings. Our operating income decreased $1.4 million, or 56%, during the first six months of 2019 compared to the first six months of 2018 due to a decrease in sales of 15% and a 3% increase in operating expenses, partially offset by a 390 basis point increase of gross margin during the first six months of 2019 compared to the first six months of 2018. 
  ●  Inventories increased $2.5 million, or 28%, due to the buildup of inventory on hand to support future anticipated sales in the casino and gaming and restaurant solutions markets.      
Gross profit decreased $1.1 million, or 8% in the first half of 2019 compared to the first half of 2018 due to a 15% decline in sales during the first half of 2019 compared to the same period in the prior year. The decrease in gross profit was partially offset by a 390 basis point increase in gross margin during the first half of 2019 compared to the first half of 2018. The increased gross margin reflects a favorable shift in sales mix towards higher-value, technology-driven solutions, as well as lower sales of POS printers and lottery printers, which carry lower margins than our other products. 
The decrease in domestic restaurant solutions terminal sales in the second quarter of 2019 compared to the second quarter of 2018 was driven primarily by BOHA! terminal sales to two large corporate customers in the second quarter of 2018 that did not reoccur in the second quarter of 2019. During the second quarter of 2019, we experienced continued growth in our sales of BOHA! software, launched during the first quarter of 2019. Sales of BOHA! software recognized on a SaaS subscription basis increased by 24% in the second quarter of 2019 compared to the first quarter of 2019. 
The decrease in domestic POS automation and banking sales in the first half of 2019 compared to the first half of 2018 was primarily driven by a 24% decrease in domestic sales of our Ithaca® 9000 printer, as sales to McDonald’s decreased during the first half of 2019 compared to the same period in 2018. 
International sales for the second quarter of 2019 decreased $0.8 million, or 23%, from the same period in 2018 due primarily to a 27% decrease in sales in the international casino and gaming market. 
The decrease in domestic revenue from TSG for the first half of 2019 as compared to the first half of 2018 was due primarily to 42% lower sales of replacement parts due to lower sales of lottery printer spare parts to IGT. This decrease was partially offset by increased service revenue of 36% as well as higher label sales related to our restaurant solutions products of 230%. 
International restaurant solutions sales increased during the first half of 2019 compared to the first half of 2018 due to increased sales of the AccuDate 9700 terminal through our Asian and European distributors. 
International sales decreased $300 thousand, or 5%, primarily driven by an 11% decrease of international casino and gaming sales. This decrease was partially offset by a 55% increase from our international TSG market in the first six months of 2019 compared to the first six months of 2018. 
General and administrative expenses increased $158 thousand, or 4%, in the first six months of 2019 compared to the first six months of 2018 due primarily to higher professional and legal expenses. These increases were partially offset by lower recruiting expense incurred during the first six months of 2019 compared to the first six months of 2018. 
The decrease in domestic restaurant solutions terminal sales in the first half of 2019 compared to the first half of 2018 was driven by lower sales of our AccuDate 9700 terminal to our former U.S. distributor and lower sales of our BOHA! terminal to two large corporate customers, in support of large-scale, multi-quarter rollouts of the terminal in the first half of last year that did not reoccur in 2019. This decrease was partially offset by increased sales of our AccuDate Pro terminal. 
The decrease in both domestic and international POS automation and banking product revenue for the second quarter of 2019 compared to the second quarter of 2018 was primarily driven by a 26% decrease in sales of our Ithaca® 9000 printer, largely to McDonald’s. We expect sales of our Ithaca® 9000 to McDonald’s to be lower in 2019 compared to 2018.  Item 5.   OTHER INFORMATION       Item 1.   LEGAL PROCEEDINGS
