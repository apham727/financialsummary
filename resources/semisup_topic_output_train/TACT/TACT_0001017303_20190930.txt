The results of operations for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2019 are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for the full year. 
We ended the third quarter of 2019 with $1.2 million in cash and cash equivalents, of which $0.2 million was held by our U.K. subsidiary, and no debt outstanding. 
We recorded an income tax benefit for the third quarter of 2019 of $143 thousand at an effective tax rate of -59.3 %, compared to an income tax provision during the third quarter of 2018 of $581 thousand at an effective tax rate of 18.4%. For the nine months ended September 30, 2019, we recorded an income tax benefit of $54 thousand at an effective tax rate of -4.3%, compared to an income tax provision during the nine months ended September 30, 2018 of $1.1 million at an effective tax rate of 19.2%. The effective tax rate for the both the third quarter of 2019 and nine months ended September 30, 2019 was unusually low and a benefit as it included the foreign-derived intangible income (“FDII”) deduction under the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the “Tax Reform Act”) as well as near breakeven pre-tax income in the second and third quarters of 2019. The FDII deduction was not included in the effective tax rate for the third quarter of 2018 or nine months ended September 30, 2018, as the interpretive guidance for the deduction was not yet released.

For the three months ended September 30, 2019, our Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.09 per share, totaling $672 thousand, which was paid on September 16, 2019 to common shareholders of record at the close of business on August 20, 2019. For the three months ended September 30, 2018, dividends declared and paid totaled $665 thousand, or $0.09 per share. Dividends declared and paid totaled $2.0 million, or $0.27 per share for both the nine months ended September 30, 2019 and 2018. Our operating income decreased $4.3 million, or 75%, during the first nine months of 2019 compared to the first nine months of 2018 due to a decrease in sales of 19% and a 5% increase in operating expenses, partially offset by a 140 basis point increase of gross margin during the first nine months of 2019 compared to the first nine months of 2018. 
The decrease in sales of Printrex printers during the first nine months of 2019 compared to the first nine months of 2018 resulted from a 16% decrease in domestic and international sales in the oil and gas market. This decrease was partially offset by higher sales from the international medical and mobile market during the first nine months of 2019 compared to the first nine months of 2018. 
  ●  Inventories increased $4.2 million, or 47%, due to the buildup of inventory on hand to support future anticipated sales in the casino and gaming and restaurant solutions markets.      
The decrease in international sales of our casino and gaming products in the third quarter of 2019 compared to the third quarter of 2018 was due to a 20% decrease in sales of our thermal casino printers due primarily to lower sales to a large OEM in Europe. The decrease was partially offset by 37% higher international sales of our off-premise gaming printers during the third quarter of 2019 compared to the third quarter of 2018, primarily to an OEM in Europe for sports betting, as well as stronger sales in Australia. 
The decrease in domestic revenue from TSG for the first nine months of 2019 as compared to the first nine months of 2018 was due primarily to 37% lower sales of replacement parts due to lower sales of lottery printer spare parts to IGT. This decrease was partially offset by increased service revenue of 31% during the first nine months of 2019 compared to the first nine months of 2018. 
Gross profit decreased $3.5 million, or 17%, in the first nine months of 2019 compared to the first nine months of 2018 due largely to a 19% decline in sales during the first nine months of 2019 compared to the same period in the prior year, partially offset by a 140 basis point increase in gross margin during the first nine months of 2019 compared to the first nine months of 2018. The increased gross margin reflects lower manufacturing overhead spending and a favorable shift in sales mix towards higher-value, technology-driven solutions, as well as lower sales of POS printers and lottery printers, which carry lower margins than our other products. 
The decrease in domestic POS automation and banking sales in the first nine months of 2019 compared to the first nine months of 2018 was primarily driven by a 25% decrease in domestic sales of our Ithaca® 9000 printer, as sales to McDonald’s decreased during the first nine months of 2019 compared to the same period in 2018. 
International restaurant solutions sales increased during the first nine months of 2019 compared to the first nine months of 2018 due to increased sales of the AccuDate 9700 terminal through a European distributor and sales of our BOHA! solutions to a casino operator in Asia. 
International sales decreased $0.6 million, or 8%, primarily driven by an 11% decrease of international casino and gaming sales. This decrease was partially offset by a 24% increase from our international TSG market and a 41% increase from our international restaurant solutions market during the first nine months of 2019 compared to the first nine months of 2018. 
Internationally, TSG revenue increased during the first nine months of 2019 compared to the first nine months of 2018 primarily due to a 38% increase in sales of replacement parts and accessories to international casino and gaming customers. This increase was partially offset by a 41% decrease of international consumable sales during the first nine months of 2019 compared to the first nine months of 2018. 
The decrease in domestic sales of our casino and gaming products for the first nine months of 2019 compared to the first nine months of 2018 was due primarily to a 24% decrease in domestic sales of our thermal casino printer, driven primarily by a large order from a domestic casino operator for replacement printers during 2018 that did not reoccur in 2019, as well as lower sales to our domestic OEMs. Additionally, domestic sales of our off-premise gaming printers decreased 95% during the first nine months of 2019 compared to the first nine months of 2018 due to sales to an OEM in the 2018 period that we do not expect to reoccur in 2019. Domestic EPICENTRAL™ software sales decreased 38%, as we had no new installations during the first nine months of 2019 compared to one new installation during the same period for 2018.  ●  We did not design and maintain effective controls over user access within the Company’s ERP system, Oracle, to ensure appropriate segregation of duties and to adequately restrict user access to appropriate personnel. Specifically, the provisioning and user recertification controls are not designed to ensure users maintain proper segregation of duties and therefore could have inappropriate access rights (the “Access Control Weakness”).     
 ●  To address the Access Control Weakness, we are utilizing the services of an Oracle consulting firm and an accounting firm unrelated to PwC, to assist us in analyzing and reviewing Oracle access for all users. Upon completion of this analysis, we plan to modify the designated Oracle responsibilities for each employee for which a conflict has been identified to remove any Oracle transactional responsibilities that we believe are conflicting and reassign those responsibilities to a different employee to ensure proper segregation of duties. In addition, we plan to enhance and implement provisioning and user certification controls to ensure we maintain the appropriate segregation of duties within Oracle following the analysis.     The United Kingdom’s anticipated withdrawal from the European Union may have a negative effect on global economic conditions, financial markets and our business, including our U.K. subsidiary.
