We ended the third quarter of 2019 with $1.2 million in cash and cash equivalents, of which $0.2 million was held by our U.K. subsidiary, and no debt outstanding.
The FDII deduction was not included in the effective tax rate for the third quarter of 2018 or nine months ended September 30, 2018, as the interpretive guidance for the deduction was not yet released.
Dividends declared and paid totaled $2.0 million, or $0.27 per share for both the nine months ended September 30, 2019 and 2018.
The effective tax rate for the both the third quarter of 2019 and nine months ended September 30, 2019 was unusually low and a benefit as it included the foreign-derived intangible income (“FDII”) deduction under the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the “Tax Reform Act”) as well as near breakeven pre-tax income in the second and third quarters of 2019.
Sales and usage-based taxes are excluded from revenues.Our operating income decreased $4.3 million, or 75%, during the first nine months of 2019 compared to the first nine months of 2018 due to a decrease in sales of 19% and a 5% increase in operating expenses, partially offset by a 140 basis point increase of gross margin during the first nine months of 2019 compared to the first nine months of 2018.
The decrease was partially offset by 37% higher international sales of our off-premise gaming printers during the third quarter of 2019 compared to the third quarter of 2018, primarily to an OEM in Europe for sports betting, as well as stronger sales in Australia.
Gross profit decreased $3.5 million, or 17%, in the first nine months of 2019 compared to the first nine months of 2018 due largely to a 19% decline in sales during the first nine months of 2019 compared to the same period in the prior year, partially offset by a 140 basis point increase in gross margin during the first nine months of 2019 compared to the first nine months of 2018.
  ●  Inventories increased $4.2 million, or 47%, due to the buildup of inventory on hand to support future anticipated sales in the casino and gaming and restaurant solutions markets.
This decrease was partially offset by higher sales from the international medical and mobile market during the first nine months of 2019 compared to the first nine months of 2018.
This increase was partially offset by a 41% decrease of international consumable sales during the first nine months of 2019 compared to the first nine months of 2018.
Net sales for the first nine months of 2019 decreased $8.2 million, or 19%, from the same period in 2018.
Net sales for the third quarter of 2019 decreased $4.2 million, or 26%, from the same period in 2018.
The decrease in domestic POS automation and banking sales in the first nine months of 2019 compared to the first nine months of 2018 was primarily driven by a 25% decrease in domestic sales of our Ithaca® 9000 printer, as sales to McDonald’s decreased during the first nine months of 2019 compared to the same period in 2018.
This decrease was partially offset by increased service revenue of 48% resulting largely from increased repairs of POS printers for McDonald’s. ●  We did not design and maintain effective controls over user access within the Company’s ERP system, Oracle, to ensure appropriate segregation of duties and to adequately restrict user access to appropriate personnel.
