The results of operations for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2018 are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for the full year. 
For a majority of our revenue, which consists of printers, terminals, consumables, and replacement parts, the Company recognizes revenue as of a point of time. The transaction price is recognized upon shipment of the order when control of the goods is transferred to the customer and at the time the performance obligation is fulfilled. We also sell a software solution, EPICENTRAL™, that enables casino operators to create promotional coupons and marketing messages and to print them in real-time at the slot machine. EPICENTRALTM is primarily comprised of both a software component, which is licensed to the customer, and a hardware component. EPICENTRAL™ software and hardware are integrated to deliver the system's full functionality. The transaction prices from EPICENTRAL™ software license and hardware are recognized upon installation and formal acceptance by the customer when control of the license is transferred to the customer. For out-of-warranty repairs, the transaction price is recognized after completion of the repair work is completed and the printer or terminal is returned to the customer, as control of the product is transferred to the customer. 
For the three months ended September 30, 2018, our Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.09 per share, totaling $665 thousand, which was paid on September 14, 2018 to common shareholders of record at the close of business on August 20, 2018. For the three months ended September 30, 2017, dividends declared and paid totaled $661 thousand, or $0.09 per share. For the nine months ended September 30, 2018 and 2017, dividends declared and paid totaled $2.0 million, or $0.27 per share, and $1.9 million, or $0.26 per share, respectively.

Costs to Obtain a Contract – Costs to obtain a contract, such as sales commissions, were previously expensed as incurred. The Company applied the practical expedient for contracts with customers for a term of twelve months or less, in accordance with ASC 340-40-25-4, which allows TransAct to continue to expense sales commissions as incurred, since the expected amortization period of the cost to obtain a contract is less than 12 months. No amounts were capitalized as of the adoption of ASC 606 or as of September 30, 2018. Our operating income increased by $373 thousand, or 7%, during the first nine months of 2018 compared to the first nine months of 2017 primarily due to a 220 basis point increase in gross margin. The increase in operating income from the improved gross margin was partially offset by a 3% increase in operating expense. 
The decrease in domestic POS automation and banking sales in the first nine months of 2018 compared to the first nine months of 2017 was primarily driven by a 74% decrease in sales of our legacy banking and other POS printers as we continue to deemphasize these products. These decreases were partially offset by a slight increase in sales of our Ithaca® 9000 printers of 1% during the first nine months of 2018 compared to the first nine months of 2017, as sales rebounded to prior year, near-record levels during the second and third quarters of 2018. 
  ●  Inventories increased $4.2 million, or 47%, due to the buildup of inventory on hand to support future anticipated sales in the casino and gaming and restaurant solutions markets.     
International sales increased $2 million, or 31%, primarily driven by 63% higher international sales in the casino and gaming market. This increase was partially offset by a $1.1 million sales decrease in our international lottery market during the first nine months of 2018 compared to the first nine months of 2017. 
The decrease in international lottery sales in the first nine months of 2018 compared to the first nine months of 2017 was primarily due to a sale of lottery printers to IGT for the Canadian lottery in the first nine months of 2017 and no comparable sale occurring in the first nine months of 2018. 
International restaurant solutions sales increased during the first nine months of 2018 compared to the first nine months of 2017 due to increased sales of the AccuDate 9700 for McDonald’s through our Asian distributor. 
While we expect casino and gaming sales to increase in the fourth quarter of 2018 compared to the fourth quarter of 2017, we do not expect domestic and international sales of our thermal casino printers to continue at the level experienced during the third quarter of 2018 for the remainder of 2018, as the third quarter results included two large orders that we do not expect to reoccur in 2018. 
  ●  Inventories decreased $1.5 million, or 16%, due to the sell through of inventory on hand to support sales in the third quarter of 2017.     
The decrease in domestic restaurant solutions terminal sales in the third quarter of 2018 compared to the third quarter of 2017 was driven by lower sales of our AccuDate 9700 terminal due to lower sales to McDonald's. This decrease was partially offset by increased sales of our newer AccuDate XL2e terminal to three large corporate customers in support of large-scale, multi-quarter rollouts of the terminal. Shipments of AccuDate XL2e terminals exceeded sales of AccuDate 9700 terminals for the second consecutive quarter in the third quarter of 2018. We expect full year 2018 sales of our restaurant solutions terminals to be relatively consistent with full year 2017 sales. 
The decrease in domestic revenue from TSG for the third quarter of 2018 as compared to the prior year period was due primarily to decreased replacement part sales and non-Printrex consumable product sales. Replacement part sales decreased 44% due to lower sales of lottery printer spare parts to IGT. Non-Printrex consumables declined 15% due to lower sales of our legacy HP inkjet cartridges used in our banking printers, as we continue to deemphasize our sales of this commoditized consumable product and expect to exit the banking market at the end of 2018. The decreases were partially offset by increased AccuDate label sales which quadrupled during the third quarter of 2018 compared to the third quarter of 2017. Based on our backlog of orders and contractual commitments for replacement parts for our installed base of lottery printers, we expect TSG sales to decrease for the full year 2018 compared to the unusually high level of spare parts sales, largely from lottery printer spare part sales to IGT, during 2017. 
The increase in sales of Printrex printers in the third quarter of 2018 compared to third quarter of 2017 resulted from a 67% increase in domestic and international sales of our oil and gas printers. This increase was partially offset by 97% lower domestic and international sales of our medical and mobile printers in the third quarter of 2018 compared to the third quarter of 2017. We expect Printrex sales for the full year of 2018 to be higher than 2017, as we expect a continued modest recovery in the global oil and gas industry to more than offset lower expected sales of medical and mobile printers as we shift our focus to our higher value, technology-enabled restaurant solutions and casino and gaming products. 
The increase in domestic POS automation and banking product revenue from the third quarter of 2017 was driven by a 22% increase in sales of our Ithaca® 9000 printer, as sales to McDonald’s have returned to the near record levels experienced during 2017. We expect this level of sales to McDonald’s to decrease during the fourth quarter of 2018. This increase was partially offset by 81% lower domestic sales of our legacy banking and other POS printers for the third quarter of 2018 compared to the third quarter of 2017. We expect sales of these legacy products to continue to decline during the remainder of 2018, as we expect to exit the banking market at the end of 2018 and have shifted our focus to our newer products. Our management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer (our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, respectively), evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of September 30, 2018. The term “disclosure controls and procedures,” as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act, means controls and other procedures of a company that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission’s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to the Company’s management, including its principal executive and principal financial officers, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Management recognized that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives, and management necessarily applies its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures. Based on the evaluation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of September 30, 2018, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that, as of such date, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective at the reasonable assurance level. None.
