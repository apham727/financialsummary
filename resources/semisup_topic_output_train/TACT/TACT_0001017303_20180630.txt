The results of operations for the three and six months ended June 30, 2018 are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for the full year. 
For the three months ended June 30, 2018, our Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.09 per share, totaling $663 thousand, which was paid on June 15, 2018 to common shareholders of record at the close of business on May 21, 2018. For the three months ended June 30, 2017, dividends declared and paid totaled $663 thousand, or $0.09 per share. For the six months ended June 30, 2018 and 2017, dividends declared and paid totaled $1.3 million, or $0.18 per share, and $1.3 million, or $0.17 per share, respectively. 
For a majority of our revenue, which consists of printers, terminals, consumables, and replacement parts, the Company recognizes revenue as of a point of time. The transaction price is recognized upon shipment of the order when control of the goods is transferred to the customer and at the time the performance obligation is fulfilled. We also sell a software solution, EPICENTRAL™, that enables casino operators to create promotional coupons and marketing messages and to print them in real-time at the slot machine. EPICENTRALTM is primarily comprised of both a software component, which is licensed to the customer, and a hardware component. EPICENTRAL™ software and hardware are integrated to deliver the system's full functionality. The transaction prices from EPICENTRAL™ software license and hardware are recognized upon installation and formal acceptance by the customer when control of the license is transferred to the customer. For out-of-warranty repairs, the transaction price is recognized after completion of the repair work is completed and the printer or terminal is returned to the customer, as control of the product is transferred to the customer. 
3. Accrued product warranty liability 
Costs to Obtain a Contract – Costs to obtain a contract, such as sales commissions, were previously expensed as incurred. The Company applied the practical expedient for contracts with customers for a term of twelve months or less, in accordance with ASC 340-40-25-4, which allows TransAct to continue to expense sales commissions as incurred, since the expected amortization period of the cost to obtain a contract is less than 12 months. No amounts were capitalized as of the adoption of ASC 606 or as of June 30, 2018. 
Performance obligations are satisfied over-time if the customer receives the benefits as we perform work, if the customer controls the asset as it is being produced, or if the product being produced for the customer has no alternative use and we have a contractual right to payment. For our separately priced extended warranty and maintenance agreements (including free one-year maintenance received by the customers upon completion of EPICENTRAL™ installation) revenue is recognized over-time as the customer receives the benefit. The transaction price from the maintenance services is recognized ratably over-time, using output methods, as control of the services is transferred to the customer. For extended warranties, the transaction price is recognized ratably over the warranty period, using output methods, as control of the services is transferred to the customer. Our operating income decreased by $248 thousand, or 9%, during the first half of 2018 compared to the first half of 2017 primarily due to a 2% decrease in sales and a 6% increase in operating expenses, somewhat offset by a 220 basis point increase in gross margin in the first half of 2018 compared to the first half of 2017. 
Our operating income increased $312 thousand, or 24%, in the second quarter of 2018 compared to the second quarter of 2017, and our operating margin increased to 11% of net sales largely due to higher gross profit resulting from an 8% increase in sales, as well as proportionately lower operating expenses as a percentage of net sales, in the second quarter of 2018 compared to the prior year period. 
  ●  Inventories increased $2.5 million, or 28%, due to the buildup of inventory on hand to support future anticipated sales in the casino and gaming and restaurant solutions markets.     
The increase in sales of Printrex printers in the second quarter of 2018 compared to second quarter of 2017 resulted from a 84% increase in domestic and international sales of our oil and gas printers. This increase was partially offset by 76% lower sales of our medical and mobile printers in the second quarter of 2018 compared to the second quarter of 2017. We expect Printrex sales for the full year of 2018 to be higher than 2017, as we expect a continued modest recovery in the global oil and gas industry to more than offset lower expected sales of medical and mobile printers as we shift our focus to our higher value, technology-enabled restaurant solutions and casino and gaming products. 
Internationally, TSG revenue increased due to a 98% increase in sales of replacement parts and accessories in the second quarter of 2018 compared to the second quarter of 2017. 
International sales increased $920 thousand, or 20%, primarily driven by 65% higher international sales in the casino and gaming market. This increase was partially offset by a $1.1 million sales decrease in our international lottery market during the first half of 2018 compared to the first half of 2017. 
The increase in both domestic and international POS automation and banking product revenue from the second quarter of 2017 was driven by an 21% increase in sales of our Ithaca® 9000 printer, as sales to McDonald's have returned to the near record levels experienced during 2017. We expect this level of sales to McDonald's to continue into the third quarter of 2018. This increase was partially offset by 71% lower sales of our legacy banking and other POS printers for the second quarter of 2018 compared to the second quarter of 2017. We expect sales of these legacy products to continue to decline during the second half of 2018, as expect to exit the banking market at the end of 2018 and have shifted our focus to our newer products. 
International restaurant solutions sales increased during the first half of 2018 compared to the first half of 2017 due to increased sales of the AccuDate 9700 for McDonald's through our Asian distributor. 
The decrease in domestic POS automation and banking sales in the first half of 2018 compared to the first half of 2017 was primarily driven by a 72% decrease in sales of our legacy banking and other POS printers during the first half of 2018 as we continue to deemphasize these products. Sales also decreased during the first half of 2018 compared to the first half of 2017 due to a 7% decline in sales of our Ithaca® 9000 printer due to lower sales to McDonald's in the first quarter of 2018, but which subsequently rebounded to prior year, near-record levels in the second quarter of 2018. 
Internationally, TSG revenue increased primarily due to a 57% increase in sales of replacement parts and accessories in the first half of 2018 compared to the first half of 2017. 
The increase in domestic restaurant solutions terminal sales in the second quarter of 2018 compared to the second quarter of 2017 was driven by the initial shipments of the AccuDate XL to two existing customers in support of large-scale, multi-quarter rollouts of the terminal. This increase was partially offset by decreased sales of our AccuDate 9700 terminal to our former U.S. distributor during the second quarter of 2018 compared to the second quarter of 2017. Shipments of AccuDate XL terminals exceeded sales of AccuDate 9700 terminals for the first time in the second quarter of 2018. We expect sales of our restaurant solutions terminals to continue to increase in 2018 compared to 2017 as we benefit from the strategic selling and marketing investments implemented during 2017. 
International sales for the second quarter of 2018 increased $2.3 million, or 221%, from the same period in 2017 due primarily to a 267% increase in sales in the international casino and gaming market. None.
