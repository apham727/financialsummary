Our products are also targets for cyber attacks, including those products utilized in cloud-based environments as well as our cloud service offerings.
Further, we face potential gross margin pressures resulting from our ASPs declining more rapidly than our cost of goods sold.
Our success depends, in significant part, on the proprietary nature of our technology, including non-patentable IP such as our process technology.
The success of our branded products depends in part on the positive image that consumers have of our brands.
The technology infrastructure and systems of our suppliers, vendors, service providers, cloud solution providers and partners may also experience such attacks.
We seek to be an industry-leading developer, manufacturer and provider of innovative storage solutions, balancing our core hard drive and flash memory business with growing investments in newer areas that we believe will provide us with higher growth opportunities.
Even if our products meet customer specifications, our sales to these customers are dependent upon the customers choosing our products over those of our competitors and purchasing our products in sufficient volume, our ability to supply our products in sufficient quantity and in a timely manner and, with respect to OEM partners, the OEMsâ€™ ability to create, market and successfully sell products containing our solutions.
We experience cyber attacks of varying degrees on our technology infrastructure and systems and, as a result, unauthorized parties have obtained in the past, and may in the future obtain, access to our computer systems and networks, including cloud-based platforms.
The complexity of the technology involved and the uncertainty of IP litigation increase the IP risks we face.
Client Solutions consist of HDDs and SSDs embedded into external storage products and removable flash-based products.Our revenue for Data Center Devices and Solutions increased 5.6% year over year, primarily driven by an increase in sales from our capacity enterprise HDD, partially offset by our lower sales of eSSDs and performance enterprise HDDs.
DIO increased by 20 days over the prior year, primarily reflecting increases in hard drive inventory to re-establish capacity enterprise to normal levels and, to a lesser extent, increases in flash inventory.Our products are also targets for cyber attacks, including those products utilized in cloud-based environments as well as our cloud service offerings.
Further, we face potential gross margin pressures resulting from our ASPs declining more rapidly than our cost of goods sold.
Increases in the cost for certain critical materials and components and oil may increase our costs of manufacturing and transporting our products and key components and may result in lower operating margins if we are unable to pass these increased costs on to our customers.
