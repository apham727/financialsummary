The goodwill is primarily attributable to anticipated revenue growth from the combined company product portfolio, expected synergies of the combined company, and the assembled workforce of KMG.
In particular, China is a fast-developing market for the semiconductor industry, and is an area of potential continued growth for us.
We utilize and rely upon a global workforce.
 The Company’s effective tax rate for the first quarter of fiscal 2019 was 20.4%, compared to 108.4% in the same quarter last year.
We have identified our Performance Materials segment as another area of potential continued growth and the product offerings in our Performance Materials segment are similarly concentrated.
The adjustments to segment EBITDA for the three months ended December 31, 2018 represent addbacks of KMG acquisition and integration related expenses, and a charge for the write-up of inventory acquired from KMG to fair value, for inventory sold in the period.
We acquired KMG to extend and strengthen our position as one of the leading suppliers of consumable materials to the semiconductor industry and to expand our portfolio with the addition of KMG’s performance materials business, which we believe will enable us to be a leading global provider of performance products and services to the pipeline operations and energy industries.
Electronic Materials includes products and solutions for the semiconductor industry.
Protection of intellectual property is particularly important in our industry because we develop complex technical formulas and processes for products that are proprietary in nature and differentiate our products from those of our competitors.
Revenue from external customers and segment adjusted EBITDA shown for Performance Materials for the quarter ended December 31, 2017 includes Cabot Microelectronics’ legacy QED business and an immaterial business that was sold in March 2018.
Net sales of the acquired KMG business since the Acquisition Date through December 31, 2018 were $62,001.We generated $13.7 million in cash flows from operating activities in the first three months of fiscal 2019, compared to $30.6 million in cash from operating activities in the first three months of fiscal 2018.
Revenue for our first quarter of fiscal 2019 was $221.8 million, which represented an increase of 58.4% from the first quarter of fiscal 2018.
Net income was $13.4 million in our first quarter of fiscal 2019, which was $16.5 million higher than the net loss reported in the first quarter of fiscal 2018, which included a $32.9 million charge related to the Tax Act.
Excluding revenue from KMG businesses, Cabot Microelectronics revenue increased $19.8 million, or 14.1%.We expect these technological changes, and this drive toward lower costs, higher quality and performance and higher yields, will continue in the future.
Industry analysts predict that this trend will continue, which means the semiconductor industry will be comprised of fewer and larger participants in the future if their prediction is correct.
In particular, China is a fast-developing market for the semiconductor industry, and is an area of potential continued growth for us.
