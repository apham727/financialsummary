During the nine months ended June 30, 2018 and 2017, our five largest customers accounted for approximately 57% of our revenue for each of the periods. During the nine months ended June 30, 2018, Samsung, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) and Hynix Semiconductor were our largest customers, accounting for approximately 18% and 12% and 10%, respectively, of our revenue. During the nine months ended June 30, 2017, Samsung, TSMC, and Micron Technology, Inc. were our largest customers, accounting for approximately 16%, 13%, and 11%, respectively, of our revenue. 
During the first quarter of fiscal 2018, development of our in-process technology was completed, and we reclassified $4,000 to product technology under other intangible assets subject to amortization. 
We operate predominantly in one reportable segment, as defined under ASC 280 "Segment Reporting" â€“ the development, manufacture, and sale of CMP consumables. 
For the nine months ended June 30, 2018 and 2017, approximately 0.1 million and 0.4 million shares, respectively, attributable to outstanding stock options were excluded from the calculation of diluted earnings per share. 
For both the three months ended June 30, 2018 and 2017, approximately 0.1 million shares attributable to outstanding stock options were excluded from the calculation of diluted earnings per share. 
Our effective tax rate was 18.3% and 47.0% for the three and nine months ended June 30, 2018, respectively, compared to a 22.4% and 21.1% effective income tax rate for the three and nine months ended June 30, 2017. The significant increase in our effective tax rate for the nine months ended June 30, 2018 compared to the prior year is primarily driven by discrete adjustments related to the enactment of the Tax Act in the United States in December 2017. Other factors that impacted the Company's effective tax rate for the three and nine months ended June 30, 2018 were primarily related to benefits in excess of compensation cost from share based compensation recorded in the income statement (as opposed to equity prior to October 2017), the absence of benefits of a tax holiday in South Korea that expired as of October 2017, and benefits related to changes in prior year tax positions. 
Cabot Microelectronics Corporation ("Cabot Microelectronics'', "the Company'', "us'', "we'', or "our'') supplies high-performance polishing slurries and pads used in the manufacture of advanced integrated circuit (IC) devices within the semiconductor industry, in a process called chemical mechanical planarization (CMP). CMP polishes surfaces at an atomic level, thereby helping to enable IC device manufacturers to produce smaller, faster and more complex IC devices with fewer defects. We develop, produce and sell CMP slurries for polishing many of the conducting and insulating materials used in IC devices. We develop, manufacture and sell CMP polishing pads, which are used in conjunction with slurries in the CMP process. We also develop and provide products for demanding surface modification applications in other industries through our Engineered Surface Finishes (ESF) business. For additional information, refer to Part 1, Item 1, "Business", in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2017. 
We utilize and rely upon a global workforce. If we fail to attract and retain the necessary managerial, technical and customer support personnel, our business and our ability to maintain existing and obtain new customers, develop new products and provide acceptable levels of customer service could suffer. We compete worldwide with other industry participants for qualified personnel, particularly those with significant experience in the semiconductor industry. The loss of services of key employees, or our inability to obtain or maintain visas or other travel or residency documents on their behalf with respect to our business needs, could harm our business and results of operations. Periodically, we engage in succession planning for our key employees, and our Board of Directors reviews succession planning for our executive officers, including our chief executive officer, on an annual basis. 
The results of operations for the quarter ended December 31, 2017 and nine months ended June 30, 2018 include a correction to prior period amounts, which we determined to be immaterial to the prior periods to which they relate and are expected to be immaterial to our fiscal 2018 results. The adjustments, relating primarily to accumulated earnings taxes of a foreign operation, increased the income tax expense for the first quarter of fiscal 2018 by $2,071. Separately, in Note 14 of this Report on Form 10-Q, we discuss the effects of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act ("Tax Act") on our financial statements.  
In particular, China is a fast-developing market for the semiconductor industry, and is an area of potential continued growth for us. As business volume between China and the rest of the world continues to grow, there is risk that geopolitical, regulatory, trade and political matters could adversely affect business for companies like ours based on the complex relationships among China, the United States, and other countries in the Asia Pacific region, which could have a material adverse impact on our business. In addition, there are risks that the Chinese government may, among other things, require the use of local suppliers, compel companies that do business in China to partner with local companies to conduct business, and provide incentives to government-backed local customers to buy from local suppliers rather than companies like ours, all of which could adversely impact our business, including our results of operations. 
  During the three and nine months ended June 30, 2018, we recorded $858 and $2,602 of shared-based compensation expense associated with executive transitions, respectively. Net income was $35.2 million for the three months ended June 30, 2018, which represented an increase of 76.4%, or $15.2 million, from the three months ended June 30, 2017. The significant increase was primarily due to higher revenue and higher gross margin, partially offset by higher operating expenses. 
Total research, development and technical expenses were $38.6 million for the nine months ended June 30, 2018, which represented a decrease of 7.8%, or $3.2 million, from the nine months ended June 30, 2017. The decrease was primarily due to lower professional expenses of $1.0 million, lower supplies and equipment costs used in research and development of $0.7 million, and lower depreciation and amortization expense of $0.6 million. 
Selling and marketing expenses were $18.8 million for the nine months ended June 30, 2018, which represented a decrease of 15.0%, or $3.3 million, from the nine months ended June 30, 2017. The decrease was primarily due to lower staffing-related costs of $1.6 million, lower severance expense of $0.7 million, lower information technology expenses of $0.6 million, and lower depreciation and amortization expense of $0.3 million. 
Net income was $61.8 million for the nine months ended June 30, 2018, which represented an increase of 2.3%, or $1.4 million, from the nine months ended June 30, 2017. The increase was primarily due to higher revenue and a higher gross margin, partially offset by higher operating expenses and the $32.6 million initial unfavorable impact of the Tax Act enacted in December 2017. 
Revenue was $433.4 million for the nine months ended June 30, 2018, which represented a 17.0%, or $63.0 million, increase from the nine months ended June 30, 2017. The increase in revenue was primarily driven by a $42.4 million increase due to higher sales volume, a $20.4 million increase due to higher value product mix, and a $4.0 million increase due to exchange rate fluctuations, partially offset by a $3.8 million decrease due to price changes. Revenue from tungsten slurries, dielectrics slurries and polishing pads increased 15.9%, 17.7%, and 19.4%, respectively, from the comparable period of fiscal 2017. During the nine months ended June 30, 2018 and 2017, our five largest customers accounted for approximately 57% of our revenue for each of the periods. During the nine months ended June 30, 2018, Samsung, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) and Hynix Semiconductor were our largest customers, accounting for approximately 18% and 12% and 10%, respectively, of our revenue. During the nine months ended June 30, 2017, Samsung, TSMC, and Micron Technology, Inc. were our largest customers, accounting for approximately 16%, 13%, and 11%, respectively, of our revenue. 
Our business is substantially dependent on CMP slurries and pads, which account for the majority of our revenue. Our business would suffer if these products became obsolete or if consumption of these products decreased. Our success depends on our ability to keep pace with technological changes and advances in the semiconductor industry, and to adapt, improve and customize our products for advanced IC applications in response to evolving customer needs and industry trends. Since its inception, the semiconductor industry has experienced technological changes and advances in the design, manufacture, performance and application of IC devices. Our customers continually pursue lower cost of ownership and higher quality and performance of materials consumed in their manufacturing processes, including CMP slurries and pads, as a means to reduce costs, increase the yield in their manufacturing facilities, and achieve desired performance of the IC devices they produce. We expect these technological changes, and this drive toward lower costs, higher quality and performance and higher yields, will continue in the future. Potential technology developments in the semiconductor industry, as well as our customers' efforts to reduce consumption of CMP consumables, including through use of smaller quantities, could render our products less important to the IC device manufacturing process.
