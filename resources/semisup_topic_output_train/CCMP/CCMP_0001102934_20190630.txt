The goodwill is primarily attributable to anticipated revenue growth from the combined company product portfolio, expected synergies of the combined company, and the assembled workforce of KMG.
In particular, China continues to be a fast-developing market for the semiconductor industry, and an area of potential continued growth for us.
We utilize and rely upon a global workforce.
We acquired KMG to extend and strengthen our position as one of the leading suppliers of consumable materials to the semiconductor industry and to expand our portfolio with the addition of KMG’s performance materials businesses, which we believe enables us to become a leading global provider of performance products and services to the pipeline operations and energy industries.
We have identified our Performance Materials segment as another area of potential continued growth and the product offerings in our Performance Materials segment are similarly concentrated.
The Company’s effective income tax rate was 52.1% and 36.9% for the three and nine months ended June 30, 2019, respectively, compared to an effective income tax rate of 18.3% and 47.0% for the three and nine months ended June 30, 2018, respectively.
The adjustments to segment EBITDA for the three and nine months ended June 30, 2019 represent addbacks of KMG acquisition and integration related expenses, and a charge for the write-up of inventory acquired from KMG to fair value, for inventory sold in the period, and costs related to KMG-Bernuth warehouse fire.
In the same three and nine months ended June 30, 2019, we also recorded a charge of $42 and $14,869, respectively related to the fair value write-up of acquired inventory sold, which is included in Cost of sales in the Consolidated Statements of Income.
The long-term investment was adjusted to $1,411 in the third quarter of fiscal 2019 to reflect its fair value as of June 30, 2019.
Approximately 0.1 million and 0.2 million shares for the three and nine months ended June 30, 2019, respectively, and 0.1 million shares for both the three and nine months ended June 30, 2018, attributable to outstanding stock options were excluded from the calculation of diluted earnings per share.Total cost of sales was $156.5 million for the three months ended June 30, 2019, which represented an increase of 124.4%, or $86.8 million, from the three months ended June 30, 2018, primarily due to the Acquisition.

Other expense was $0.5 million for three months ended June 30, 2019, compared to other income of $0.5 million from the three months ended June 30, 2018.We expect these technological changes, and this drive toward lower costs, higher quality and performance and higher yields, will continue in the future.
Industry analysts predict that this trend will continue, which means the semiconductor industry will be comprised of fewer and larger participants in the future if their prediction is correct.
In particular, China continues to be a fast-developing market for the semiconductor industry, and an area of potential continued growth for us.
