Our cloud and license business engages in the sale, marketing and delivery of our applications and infrastructure technologies through cloud and on-premise deployment models, including our cloud services and license support offerings, and our cloud license and on-premise license offerings.
During the first half of fiscal 2020 and full year of fiscal 2019, we acquired certain companies and purchased certain technology and development assets primarily to expand our products and services offerings.
We have three businesses—cloud and license, hardware and services—each of which is comprised of a single operating segment.
Our hardware business provides Oracle Engineered Systems, servers, storage, industry-specific hardware, operating systems, virtualization, management and other hardware-related software to support diverse IT environments.
Our services business provides services to customers and partners to help maximize the performance of their investments in Oracle applications and infrastructure technologies.
our fourth fiscal quarter and the related cash flows are typically highest in the following quarter (i.e., in the first fiscal quarter of the next fiscal year) as we receive payments from these contracts.
Cloud services and license support contracts provide customers with access to the latest updates to the applications and infrastructure technologies as they become available and for which the customer contracted and also include related technical support services over the contractual term.
All three of our businesses market and sell our offerings globally to businesses of many sizes, government agencies, educational institutions and resellers with a worldwide sales force positioned to offer the combinations that best meet customer needs.
We are organized by line of business and geographically.
Infrastructure ecosystem revenues represent the sum of infrastructure related cloud services and license support revenues; and infrastructure related license revenues.In constant currency, total revenue growth in the Americas and Asia Pacific regions was partially offset by a decline in revenues in the EMEA region during the second quarter of fiscal 2020.
In constant currency, our total operating margin and operating margin as a percentage of total revenues increased slightly during the fiscal 2020 periods presented due to the constant currency increases in our total revenues.
Our cloud and license business engages in the sale, marketing and delivery of our applications and infrastructure technologies through various deployment models, including license support offerings; Oracle Cloud Services offerings; and cloud license and on-premise license offerings.
We expect these trends to continue.
In constant currency, total margin and total margin as a percentage of revenues for our hardware business increased during the fiscal 2020 periods presented, relative to the corresponding prior year periods, primarily due to lower expenses.
Our cloud and license business’ margin has historically trended upward over the course of the four quarters within a particular fiscal year due to the historical upward trend of our cloud and license business’ revenues over those quarterly periods and because the majority of our costs for this business are generally fixed in the short term.
In constant currency, the Americas and Asia Pacific regions contributed to our cloud and license business’ revenue growth, while the EMEA region was flat, during the second quarter of fiscal 2020.
In constant currency, the Americas, EMEA and Asia Pacific regions contributed 28%, 15% and 57%, respectively, to the growth in our total revenues during the first half of fiscal 2020.“Risk Factors” in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for our fiscal year ended May 31, 2019.
