As a result, in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017, we updated our operating segments.
Fiscal 2017 Acquisition of NetSuite Inc., a Related Party
Our Oracle Cloud SaaS and Cloud PaaS and IaaS offerings deliver certain of our applications, platform and infrastructure technologies on a subscription basis via cloud-based deployment models that we host, manage and support.
Our cloud and on-premise software line of business markets, sells and delivers a broad spectrum of applications, platform and infrastructure technologies through our cloud offerings and software offerings.
Goodwill generated from our acquisition of NetSuite was primarily attributable to synergies expected to arise after the acquisition.
The unaudited pro forma financial information for the three and nine months ended February 28, 2018 presented the historical results of Oracle for the three and nine months ended February 28, 2018 as we did not complete any material acquisitions during the first nine months of fiscal 2018.
During fiscal 2017, we acquired certain companies and purchased certain technology and development assets primarily to expand our cloud-based offerings.
In the third quarter of fiscal 2018 the Act was signed into law.In constant currency, total margin as a percentage of revenues increased in the third quarter of fiscal 2018 primarily due to the increase in revenues, and was flat in the first nine months of fiscal 2018.
These constant currency expense decreases were partially offset by higher expenses during the third quarter of fiscal 2018 related to higher cloud SaaS expenses and cloud PaaS and IaaS expenses resulting primarily from increased headcount and infrastructure expenses to support the increases in our cloud SaaS revenues and cloud PaaS and IaaS revenues; and higher general and administrative expenses that were primarily related to higher professional fees that were legal related.
In recent periods, we have placed significant strategic emphasis on growing our cloud SaaS and cloud PaaS and IaaS revenues, which represented 16% of our total consolidated revenues during each of the third quarter and first nine months of fiscal 2018, and 13% and 12% of our total consolidated revenues during the third quarter and first nine months of fiscal 2017, respectively.
In constant currency, our total operating margin and operating margin as a percentage of total revenues increased during the third quarter of fiscal 2018 as our total revenues grew while our total expenses declined.
In constant currency, total margin and total margin as a percentage of total services revenues decreased during the third quarter of fiscal 2018, primarily due to the decrease in revenues for this business.
To address this demand, we have increased our investments in and focus on the development, marketing and sale of our cloud-based applications, platform and infrastructure technologies resulting in higher growth of our cloud SaaS and cloud PaaS and IaaS revenues as customer preferences have pivoted to the Oracle Cloud for new deployments and as customers migrate to and expand with the Oracle Cloud for their existing on-premise workloads.
In constant currency, our total operating margin increased during the first nine months of fiscal 2018 due to the increase in our total revenues and operating margin as a percentage of total revenues remained flat.
We have a deep understanding as to how applications, platform and infrastructure technologies interact and function with one another within IT environments.
The increases in our constant currency cloud SaaS and cloud PaaS and IaaS revenues during the fiscal 2018 periods presented were primarily due to the continued strategic emphasis we placed on selling, marketing and growing our cloud offerings and we expect these revenue trends will continue.
In constant currency, total cloud and on-premise software expenses increased in the fiscal 2018 periods presented relative to the corresponding prior year periods primarily due to higher cloud SaaS, PaaS and IaaS expenses resulting primarily from increased headcount and technology infrastructure expenses that were incurred to support the related cloud SaaS and cloud PaaS and IaaS revenues increases; and higher sales and marketing expenses primarily resulting from increased headcount.Item 1A.
