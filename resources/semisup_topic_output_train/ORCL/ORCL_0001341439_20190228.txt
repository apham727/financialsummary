The comparability of our operating results in the third quarter and first nine months of fiscal 2019 compared to the corresponding prior year periods was impacted by the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (the Tax Act), which was effective for us starting in our third quarter of fiscal 2018.
Our cloud and license business engages in the sale, marketing and delivery of our applications and infrastructure technologies through cloud and on-premise deployment models including our cloud services and license support offerings; and our cloud license and on-premise license offerings.
During the first nine months of fiscal 2019 and the full fiscal year of 2018, we acquired certain other companies and purchased certain technology and development assets primarily to expand our products and services offerings.
In the third quarter of fiscal 2018, the Tax Act was signed into law.
Our effective tax rates were 11.1% and 12.6%, respectively, for the three and nine months ended February 28, 2019, respectively, and 226.8% and 96.4%, respectively, for the three and nine months ended February 28, 2018, respectively.
Goodwill generated from our acquisition of Aconex was primarily attributable to synergies expected to arise after the acquisition and is not expected to be tax deductible.
In each fiscal year, our cloud and license business’ contractual activities are typically highest in our fourth fiscal quarter and the related cash flows are typically highest in the following quarter (i.e., in the first fiscal quarter of the next fiscal year) as we receive payments from these contracts.
We have three businesses— cloud and license, hardware and services —each of which is comprised of a single operating segment.
Cloud services revenues include revenues from Oracle Cloud Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) and Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS) offerings (collectively, Oracle Cloud Services), which deliver applications and infrastructure technologies, respectively, via cloud-based deployment models that we develop functionality for, provide unspecified updates and enhancements for, host, manage and support and that customers access by entering into a subscription agreement with us for a stated period.
Our hardware business provides Oracle Engineered Systems, servers, storage, industry-specific hardware, operating systems, virtualization, management and other hardware-related software to support diverse IT environments.
License support contracts provide customers with rights to unspecified software product upgrades, maintenance releases and patches released during the term of the support period and include internet access to technical content, as well as internet and telephone access to technical support personnel.The comparability of our operating results in the third quarter and first nine months of fiscal 2019 compared to the same periods of fiscal 2018 was impacted by our recent acquisitions.
In constant currency, our total operating margins and operating margin as a percentage of total revenues increased during the fiscal 2019 periods presented primarily due to the increases in our total revenues.
In constant currency, the Americas, EMEA and Asia Pacific regions contributed 28% and 33%, respectively, 32% and 37%, respectively, and 40% and 30%, respectively, to the growth in our total revenues during the third quarter and first nine months of fiscal 2019, respectively.
In constant currency, total margin increased slightly during the third quarter of fiscal 2019 relative to the corresponding prior year period, while total margin as a percentage of total services revenues was constant during the third quarter of fiscal 2019.
Excluding the effects of currency rate fluctuations, our cloud and license segment’s total margin increased during the fiscal 2019 periods presented, relative to the corresponding prior year periods, primarily due to the fiscal 2019 increases in revenues for this segment, while total fiscal 2019 margins as a percentage of revenues decreased slightly due to expenses growth for this segment.
In constant currency, total margin and total margin as percentage of revenues for our hardware segment increased during the fiscal 2019 periods presented, relative to the corresponding prior year periods, due to lower expenses.
These constant currency fiscal 2019 hardware revenues decreases were partially offset by certain fiscal 2019 hardware revenues increases related to our Oracle Engineered Systems offerings, primarily Oracle Exadata.Item 1A.
