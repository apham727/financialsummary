Item 1. Legal Proceedings Total unit sales decreased to 2,956 in the first quarter of 2018 from 3,099 in the same period of 2017. 
Net sales increased 11% for the 13-week period ended March 31, 2018 when compared to the year-ago quarter. The outdoor, aviation, marine, and fitness segments collectively increased by 18%, contributing 80% of total revenue. Fitness was the largest portion of our revenue mix at 23% in the first quarter of 2018 compared to 22% in the first quarter of 2017. Auto revenue represented the largest portion of our revenue mix in the first quarter of 2017 at 25% and declined to 20% in the first quarter of 2018. 
Selling, general and administrative expense increased 15% in absolute dollars and was relatively flat as a percent of revenues compared to the year-ago quarter. The absolute dollar increase was primarily attributable to personnel costs and expenses from prior year acquisitions in the first quarter of 2018. All segments, except for marine, were relatively flat as a percent of revenues. The marine segment increase as a percent of revenues was primarily due to expenses resulting from prior year acquisitions in the first quarter of 2018. 
Operating income increased 22% in absolute dollars and increased 180 basis points as a percent of revenue when compared to the first quarter of 2017. The growth in operating income on an absolute dollar and percent of revenue basis resulted from revenue growth and an increase in gross margin percent, while operating expenses as a percent of revenue remained relatively flat, as discussed above 
Research and development expense increased 16% primarily due to engineering personnel costs related to our wearable product offerings, aviation, and expenses resulting from prior year acquisitions within the marine segment. In absolute dollars, research and development costs increased $19.8 million when compared with the year-ago quarter and increased 90 basis points as a percent of revenue. Our research and development spending is focused on product development, improving existing software capabilities, and exploring new categories. 
Cost of goods sold increased 6% in absolute dollars compared to the prior year quarter. The increase in revenues outpaced the increase in cost of goods sold, which resulted in a 190 basis point decrease in cost of goods sold as a percent of revenues compared to the year-ago quarter. 
The $99.3 million increase in cash used in investing activities in the first quarter of 2018 compared to the first quarter of 2017 was primarily due to increased net purchases of marketable securities of $88.8M and cash payments for acquisitions of $9.4 million. 
Advertising expense decreased 20% in absolute dollars compared to the year-ago quarter. The overall decrease in absolute dollars was driven primarily by decreased cooperative advertising associated with customer mix and fitness media, partially offset by an increase in outdoor media.
