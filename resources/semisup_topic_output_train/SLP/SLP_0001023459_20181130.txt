On June 1, 2017, as part of the acquisition of DILIsym Services, Inc. the Company acquired certain developed technologies associated with the drug induced liver disease (DILI). These technologies were valued at $2,850,000 and are being amortized over 9 years under the straight-line method. Amortization expense for the three months ended November 30, 2018 and 2017 was $79,167 and is included in cost of revenues. Accumulated amortization as of November 30, 2018 and August 31, 2018 was $475,000 and $395,833, respectively. 
Amortization expense for each of the three month periods ended November 30, 2018 and 2017 was $89,375, respectively. According to policy in addition to normal amortization, these assets are tested for impairment as needed. 
We generate revenue primarily from the sale of software licenses and providing consulting services to the pharmaceutical industry for drug development. 
We generate revenue primarily from the sale of software licenses and providing consulting services to the pharmaceutical industry for drug development. Cost of Revenues as a percentage of revenue increased by 4.5% in 1QFY19 to 29.2% as compared to 24.7% in 1QFY18. 
In addition, we actively seek strategic acquisitions to expand the pharmaceutical software and services business. 
Overall gross margin decrease by 4.1% to 70.8% in 1QFY19 from 75.4% in 1QFY18. 
Major pharmaceutical companies conduct drug discovery and development efforts through their internal development staffs and through outsourcing. Smaller companies generally need to outsource a greater percentage of this research. Thus, we compete not only with other software suppliers and scientific consulting service providers, but also with the in-house development and scientific consulting teams at some of the larger pharmaceutical companies. 
We are a global leader focused on improving the ways scientists use knowledge and data to predict the properties and outcomes of pharmaceutical and biotechnology agents, and are one of only two global companies who provide a wide range of early discovery, preclinical, and clinical consulting services and software. Our innovations in integrating new and existing science in medicinal chemistry, computational chemistry, pharmaceutical science, biology, physiology, and machine learning into our software have made us the leading software provider for PBPK modeling and simulation, prediction of molecular properties from structure, and prediction of drugs to induce liver injury or to treat nonalcoholic fatty liver disease. 
KIWI Version 1.6 was released in September 2016. This version introduced major enhancements in the functionality of visualization tools offered by the platform. These enhancements include simplifying the creation of plots and comparing them across multiple models, thus accelerating the model refinement process. In addition, analysts could now conveniently copy visualization preferences across projects, improving consistency and facilitating collaboration and communication with clients and colleagues. 
Drug development programs rely increasingly on modeling and simulation analyses to support decision-making and submissions to regulatory agencies. To ensure high-quality analyses, organizations must not only apply high-quality science, but must also be able to support the science by being able to validate the results. KIWI is a cloud-based web application that was developed to efficiently organize, process, maintain, and communicate the volume of data and results generated by pharmacologists and scientists over the duration of a drug development program. The validated workflow and tools within KIWI promote traceability and reproducibility of results.  Item 1. Legal Proceedings
