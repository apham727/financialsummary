Revenue concentration shows that international sales accounted for 35.6% and 31.8% of net sales for the three months ended November 30, 2017 and 2016, respectively. Four customers accounted for 7%, 7% (a dealer account in Japan representing various customers), 6% and 6% of net sales during the three months ended November 30, 2017. Three customers accounted for 9%, 7% (a dealer account in Japan representing various customers), and 6% of net sales during the three months ended November 30, 2016. 
Rent expense, including common area maintenance fees for the three months ended November 30, 2017, and 2016 was $135,877, and $122,949, respectively. 
Total amortization expense for intellectual property agreements for the three months ended November 30, 2017 and 2016 was $320,417 and $188,750, respectively. Accumulated amortization as of November 30, 2017 was $2,326,458 and $2,095,417 as of August 31, 2017. 
The Company designs and develops pharmaceutical simulation software to promote cost-effective solutions to a number of problems in pharmaceutical research and in the education of pharmacy and medical students, and it provides consulting services to the pharmaceutical and chemical industries. Recently, the Company has begun to explore developing software applications for defense and for health care outside of the pharmaceutical industry.

On June 1, 2017, as part of the acquisition of DILIsym Services, Inc. the Company acquired certain developed technologies associated with the drug induced liver disease (DILI). These technologies were valued at $2,850,000 and are being amortized over 9 years under the straight-line method. Amortization expense for the three months ended November 30, 2017 was $79,176 and is included in cost of revenues. Accumulated amortization as of November 30, 2017 and August 31, 2017 was $158,333 and $79,176, respectively. 
Amortization expense for each of the three month periods ended November 30, 2017 and 2016 was $89,375 and $36,875, respectively. According to policy in addition to normal amortization, these assets are tested for impairment as needed. 
Amortization of capitalized software development costs is calculated on a product-by-product basis on the straight-line method over the estimated economic life of the products (not to exceed five years). Amortization of software development costs amounted to $285,310 and $284,217 for the three months ended November 30, 2017 and 2016, respectively. We expect future amortization expense to vary due to increases in capitalized computer software development costs. Comparison of Three Months Ended November 30, 2017 and 2016. 
Our business strategy is to do the things we need to do to promote growth both organically (i.e., by expanding our current products and services through in-house efforts) and by acquisition. We believe in the “Built to Last” approach - that the fundamental science and technologies that underlie our business units are the keys both to improving our existing products and to expanding the product line with new products that meet our various customers’ needs. We believe the continued growth of our pharmaceutical software and services business segment is the result of steadily increasing adoption of simulation and modeling software tools across the pharmaceutical industry, as well as the world-class expertise we offer as consultants to assist companies involved in the research and development of new medicines. We have received a continuing series of study contracts with pharmaceutical companies ranging from several of the largest in the world to a number of medium-sized and smaller companies in the U.S. and Europe. 
Cost of Revenues as a percentage of revenue remained fairly constant decreasing by 0.1% in 1QFY18 to 24.6% as compared to 24.7% in 1QFY17. 
We are a global leader focused on improving the ways scientists use knowledge and data to predict the properties and outcomes of pharmaceutical and biotechnology agents, and are one of only two global companies who provide a wide range of preclinical and clinical consulting services and software. Our innovations in integrating new and existing science in medicinal chemistry, computational chemistry, pharmaceutical science, biology, physiology, and machine learning into our software have made us the leading software provider for PBPK modeling and simulation and for prediction of molecular properties from structure. 
The pharmaceutical industry has been rapidly adopting cloud technology as a solution to ever-expanding computer processing needs. Leveraging our 20-plus years of experience in providing an architecture supporting modeling and simulation efforts, we have developed KIWI as a secure, validated, enterprise-scale environment, enabling global teams to collaborate on model-based decision making. KIWI has proven to be a valuable platform for encouraging interdisciplinary discussions about the model development process and interpretation of results. We continue to receive positive feedback about the functionality implemented in KIWI and the value of the approach we have taken to harness cloud technology. We continue to improve functionality and collaboration within the KIWI platform, and we expect the licensing fee will be a source of recurring revenue for further development and growth. KIWI Version 1.3 was released in May 2015. This version of KIWI provides our user community with access to new features that accelerate completion of modeling projects by decreasing run times and facilitating the comparison and exporting of results across models. These features include dynamic comparisons of model parameter estimates and diagnostic plots, export of model run records for regulatory submissions, and accelerated infrastructure with the upgrade to the latest versions of NONMEM® and Perl-speaks-NONMEM running in a 64-bit Linux environment. 
Major pharmaceutical companies conduct drug discovery and development efforts through their internal development staffs and through outsourcing. Smaller companies generally need to outsource a greater percentage of this research. Thus, we compete not only with other software suppliers, but also with the in-house development teams at some of the larger pharmaceutical companies. 
KIWI Version 1.6 was released in September 2016. This new version introduced major enhancements in the functionality of visualization tools offered by the platform. These enhancements include simplifying the creation of plots and comparing them across multiple models, thus accelerating the model refinement process. In addition, analysts can now conveniently copy visualization preferences across projects, improving consistency and facilitating collaboration and communication with clients and colleagues. 
Consolidated software and software-related sales increased $342,000 or 10.0%, while consolidated consulting and analytical study revenues increased $1.31 million or 65.3% over 1QFY17. None.
