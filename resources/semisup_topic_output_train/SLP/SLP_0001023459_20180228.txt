Revenue concentration shows that international sales accounted for 41% and 36% of net sales for the six months ended February 28, 2018 and 2017, respectively. Three customers accounted for 7% (a dealer account in Japan representing various customers), 7%, and 5% of net sales during the six months ended February 28, 2018. Four customers accounted for 7% (a dealer account in Japan representing various customers), 6%, 6%, and 6% of sales for the six months ended February 28, 2017. 
Amortization expense for each of the three-month and six-month periods ended February 28, 2018 and 2017 was $89,375 and $36,875, and $178,750 and $73,750, respectively. According to policy, in addition to normal amortization, these assets are tested for impairment as needed. 
On June 1, 2017, as part of the acquisition of DILIsym Services, Inc. the Company acquired certain developed technologies associated with the drug induced liver disease (DILI). These technologies were valued at $2,850,000 and are being amortized over 9 years under the straight-line method. Amortization expense for the three months and six months ended February 28, 2018 was $79,176 and $158,333, respectively, and is included in cost of revenues. Accumulated amortization as of February 28, 2018 and August 31, 2017 were $237,500 and $79,176, respectively. 
The Company designs and develops pharmaceutical simulation software to promote cost-effective solutions to a number of problems in pharmaceutical research and in the education of pharmacy and medical students, and it provides consulting services to the pharmaceutical and chemical industries. Recently, the Company has begun to explore developing software applications for defense and for health care outside of the pharmaceutical industry. 
Amortization of capitalized software development costs is calculated on a product-by-product basis using the straight-line method over the estimated economic life of the products (not to exceed five years). Amortization of software development costs amounted to $335,723 and $289,659 for the three months ended February 28, 2018 and 2017, respectively, and $621,032 and $573,876 for the six months ended February 28, 2018 and 2017, respectively. We expect future amortization expense to vary due to increases in capitalized computer software development costs.

Our business strategy is to do the things we need to do to promote growth both organically (i.e., by expanding our current products and services through in-house efforts) and by acquisition. We believe in the “Built to Last” approach - that the fundamental science and technologies that underlie our business units are the keys both to improving our existing products and to expanding the product line with new products that meet our various customers’ needs. We believe the continued growth of our pharmaceutical software and services business segment is the result of steadily increasing adoption of simulation and modeling software tools across the pharmaceutical industry, as well as the world-class expertise we offer as consultants to assist companies involved in the research and development of new medicines. We have received a continuing series of study contracts with pharmaceutical companies ranging from several of the largest in the world to a number of medium-sized and smaller companies in the U.S. and Europe. 
We believe our proprietary machine-learning software engine has a wide variety of potential applications and we intend to pursue funding to develop customized tools to further monetize our investment in this technology by expanding our markets beyond the life sciences and chemistry. In addition, we are examining a variety of expanded capabilities to add to the basic modeling engine to accommodate even larger data sets (“big data analytics”) and new applications. 
We continue enhancing KIWI as part of our five-year, almost-$5 million contract with a leading global research foundation. 
Development of our software is focused on expanding product lines, designing enhancements to our core technologies, and integrating existing and new products into our principal software architecture and platform technologies. We intend to continue to offer regular updates to our products and to continue to look for opportunities to expand our existing suite of products and services.    Item 1. Legal Proceedings
