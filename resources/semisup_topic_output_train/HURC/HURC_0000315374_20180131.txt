We design, manufacture and sell computerized (i.e., Computer Numeric Control) machine tools, consisting primarily of vertical machining centers (mills) and turning centers (lathes), to companies in the metal cutting industry through a worldwide sales, service and distribution network.
As such, we adopted this standard in the first quarter of fiscal 2018.
Participants will have the ability to earn between 50% of the target number of the PSUs – TSR for achieving threshold performance and 200% of the target number of the PSUs – TSR for achieving maximum performance.
Participants will have the ability to earn between 50% of the target number of the PSUs - ROIC for achieving threshold performance and 200% of the target number of the PSUs - ROIC for achieving maximum performance.
The year-over-year increase in our warranty reserve was primarily due to an increase in unit sales volume, as well as an increase in average warranty cost per machine as our product mix of machines under warranty shifted to more complex, higher-performance machines.
During the first three months of fiscal 2018 and 2017, we recorded $549,000 and $351,000, respectively, as stock-based compensation expense related to grants under our equity plans.

During the first three months of fiscal 2018, approximately 56% of our revenues were attributable to customers in Europe, where we typically sell more of our higher-performance, higher-priced VMX series machines.
The increase in sales of Computerized Machine Tools during the first quarter of fiscal 2018 compared to the corresponding prior year period was primarily due to increased customer demand from customers across all three regions and for all product lines (Hurco, Takumi and Milltronics).
Readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements.
The increase in Asian Pacific sales for the first quarter of 2018 was primarily attributable to increased customer demand of Hurco and Takumi vertical milling machines in China, and included a notable increase in sales of Hurco machines in Southeast Asia.
The increase in European sales for the first quarter of fiscal 2018 was primarily attributable to increased customer demand for Hurco and Takumi vertical milling machines in Germany, the United Kingdom, France and Italy.
This increase was primarily attributable to slight increased customer demand for higher-performance Hurco machines.
