Effective August 2018, the Company consolidated its organizational structure to drive growth and address the convergence in the Industrial IoT, public safety, and 4G infrastructure markets and the emergence of new technologies such as 5G (the “Reorganization”). The Company’s operations, engineering, business development, sales and marketing, and operational general and administrative functions were consolidated into a single enterprise-wide organization. As a result of the Reorganization that occurred in the third quarter 2018, the Company’s Chief Executive Officer, as the chief operating decision maker (“CODM”) began assessing operating profits and identified assets at the enterprise level for resource allocations. In connection with the Reorganization, the Board of Directors appointed a Chief Operating Officer who maintains regular contact with the CODM to discuss operating activities, financial  
The goodwill is related to the test and measurement product line, not to the whole Company. Due to the reorganization in the third quarter 2018, the Company’s operations, engineering, business development, sales and marketing, and operational general and administrative functions were consolidated into a single enterprise-wide organization. As such, there are no longer reportable segments. The Company does have discrete financial information necessary to perform goodwill impairment testing for the reporting unit under the accounting guidance. The Company evaluates the goodwill based on the cash flows for the test and measurement product line. The cash flows for the test and measurement product line are only prepared for testing goodwill and were not reviewed by the Company’s CODM for business planning purposes.

All of the Company’s revenue relates to contracts with customers. The Company’s accounting contracts are from purchase orders or purchase orders combined with purchase agreements. The majority of the Company’s revenue is recognized on a “point-in-time” basis and a nominal amount of revenue is recognized “over time”. For the sale of antenna products and test and measurement products, the Company satisfies its performance obligations generally at the time of shipment or upon delivery based on the contractual terms with its customers. For products shipped on consignment, the Company recognizes revenue upon delivery from the consignment location. For its test and measurement software tools, the Company has a performance obligation to provide software maintenance and support for one year. The Company recognizes revenues for the maintenance and support over this period.  Our first quarter 2019 revenues of $20.6 million decreased by $1.1 million or 5.3% compared to revenues of $21.7 million for the same period in 2018. Revenues decreased for the antenna product line by $2.7 million or 15.1% and increased for the test and measurement product line by $1.5 million or 38.4% compared to the first quarter 2018. Revenues decreased for the antenna product line due to lower revenues with Enterprise Wi-Fi applications and increased for the test and measurement due to sales of 5G products. The gross profit of $8.7 million, increased by $0.8 million, or 10.1% compared to gross profit of $7.9M for the same period in 2018, due to a higher mix of test and measurement product revenues and due to an increase in the gross margin percentage for antenna products. Primarily based on higher gross margins, we recorded a lower operating loss for the three months ended March 31, 2019 as compared to the first quarter 2018. The operating loss was $0.5 million and $1.2 million for the three months ended March 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively.  
We reported a total operating loss of $0.5 million during the three months ended March 31, 2019 and an operating loss of $1.2 million for the three months ended March 31, 2018. The reduction in the operating loss was primarily due to higher gross margins from the higher mix of test and measurement product revenues.  
Research and development expenses increased by approximately $0.1 million for the three months ended March 31, 2019 compared to the same period in 2018. The increase is primarily due to spending on investments for 5G test and measurement equipment and for wireless products development for Industrial IoT.  
Revenues decreased 5.3% for the three months ended March 31, 2019 compared to the same period in 2018. For the three months ended March 31, 2019, the decrease in revenues for the antenna product line was due to lower sales for Enterprise Wi-Fi applications. Revenues for the test and measurement product line increased 38.4% for the three months ended March 31, 2019 compared to the same period in 2018 due to sales of test equipment in connection with early deployments of 5G infrastructure in the U.S., Europe and Asia. 
Sales and marketing expenses decreased approximately $0.2 million for the three months ended March 31, 2019 compared to the same period in 2018 due to lower headcount related expenses in North America for sales and marketing employees and due to lower marketing expenses.  David A. Neumann  All of our employees in Tianjin, China are represented by a labor union, and our employees in Beijing, China are represented by a separate labor union pursuant to the requirements of China’s National Labor Law. These two labor unions do not have collective bargaining rights. We are in the process of transitioning several product lines from our Tianjin facility to additional contract manufacturers in China and elsewhere throughout 2019 and 2020. The transition of manufacturing will result in a reduction of a significant portion of our workforce in Tianjin, China. We are currently negotiating severance arrangements for these workers.
