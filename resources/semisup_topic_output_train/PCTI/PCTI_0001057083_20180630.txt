Competition in the antenna markets addressed by the Connected Solutions segment is fragmented. Competitors include Airgain, Amphenol, Laird, Pulse, and Taoglas. The Company seeks out product applications that command a premium for product performance and customer service, and it avoids commodity markets. 
PCTEL Connected Solutions designs and manufactures precision antennas. PCTEL antennas are deployed primarily in small cells, enterprise Wi-Fi access points, fleet management and transit systems, and in equipment and devices for the IIoT. Revenue growth in these markets is driven by the increased use of wireless communications and increased complexity occurring in these markets. PCTEL antennas are primarily sold to original equipment manufacturer (“OEM”) providers where they are designed into the customer’s solution. 
Competitors for PCTEL’s test tool products include OEMs such as Anritsu, Berkley Varitronics, Digital Receiver Technology, and Rohde and Schwarz.

PCTEL RF Solutions provides test tools that improve the performance of wireless networks globally, with a focus on LTE, public safety, and emerging 5G technologies. Network operators, neutral hosts, and equipment manufacturers rely on PCTEL’s scanning receivers and testing solutions to analyze, design, and optimize their networks. Revenue growth is driven by the implementation and roll out of new wireless technology standards (i.e. 3G to 4G, 4G to 5G). PCTEL test equipment is sold directly to wireless carriers or to OEMs who integrate the Company’s products into their solutions which are then sold to wireless carriers. 
The $0.6 million decrease in the net book value of intangible assets at June 30, 2018 compared to December 31, 2017 relates to amortization expense for the six months ended June 30, 2018.  
During the quarter ended June 30, 2017, the Company approved a plan to sell its Network Engineering Services business (“Engineering Services”) and shift its focus to research and development driven radio frequency (“RF”) products. On July 31, 2017, the Company sold substantially all of the assets of the Company’s Engineering Services business to Gabe’s Construction Co., Inc. (“Gabe’s”) for a purchase price of $1.45 million. The Engineering Services business provided design, testing, commissioning, optimization, and consulting services for cellular, Wi-Fi and public safety networks and was a reporting unit within the RF Solutions segment. The disposition of Engineering Services qualified as a discontinued operation for reporting purposes due to the material significance of its historical results and because this disposition represented a strategic shift by the Company to focus on products. As such, the Company reported the results of its Engineering Services business as discontinued operations beginning with the quarter ended June 30, 2017. The Company restated the results of Engineering Services as discontinued operations for the three and six months ended June 30, 2017. See Note 5 for more information on discontinued operations.

The following table represents the customers that accounted for 10% or more of revenues during the three and six months ended June 30, 2018 and 2017. 
Conducting business in foreign countries involves additional financial, operating, and regulatory risks. Sales and marketing expenses increased approximately $0.2 million for the three months ended June 30, 2018 and decreased $0.1 million for the six months ended June 30, 2018 compared to the same periods in 2017. For the three months ended June 30, 2018, sales and marketing expenses were higher by $0.2 million for the RF Solutions segment and approximately even for the Connected Solutions segment compared to the same period in 2017. During the six months ended June 30, 2018, sales and marketing expenses for the Connected Solutions segment declined $0.3 million, offsetting higher sales and marketing expenses of $0.2 million for the RF Solutions segment compared to the same period in 2017. The expense decrease for the Connected Solutions segment is due to headcount reductions in sales and marketing at the end of the first quarter 2017. The expense increase for RF Solutions for the three and six months ended June 30, 2018 was due to additions to sales and marketing headcount. 
Our second quarter 2018 revenues of $21.6 million increased by $0.1 million, or 0.4% compared to revenues of $21.5 million for the same period in 2017. Revenues increased for the Connected Solutions segment by $0.6 million or 3.6%, but these higher revenues were offset when revenues for the RF Solutions segment declined by $0.5 million or 11.3%. For the second quarter 2018, we recorded an operating loss of $1.6 million compared to an operating loss of $0.3 million in the second quarter 2017. Revenues for the six months ended June 30, 2018 of $43.3 million declined by $1.2 million or 2.6% compared to revenues of $44.5 million for the same period in 2017. Revenues declined in the RF Solutions segment by $2.3 million or 21.9%, but revenues increased in the Connected Solutions segment by $1.1 million or 3.2%. For the six months ended June 30, 2018, we recorded an operating loss of $2.8 million compared to an operating loss of $0.3 million during the same period in 2017. For both the three and six months ended June 30, 2018, the increase in revenues for the Connected Solutions segment was due to increased sales in the Enterprise Wi-Fi vertical market, while the decrease in revenues for the RF Solutions segment was primarily due to lower capital spending by U.S. carriers and also lower revenues in the Asia Pacific region because 2017 included some large projects in China and Japan. The operating loss for both the three and six months ended June 30, 2018 was primarily the result of the negative gross margin impact of lower revenues generated by the RF Solutions segment and a lower gross margin percentage for the Connected Solutions segment. Operating expenses were lower for the six months ended June 30, 2018 compared to the same period in 2017 as lower general and administrative expenses offset higher research and development expenses.  
Research and development expenses increased approximately $0.4 million for the three months ended June 30, 2018 and increased $0.6 million for the six months ended June 30, 2018 compared to the same periods in 2017. The increase during the three months ended June 30, 2018 consists of higher expenses of $0.2 million for the Connected Solutions segment and higher expenses of $0.2 million for the RF Solutions segment compared to the same period in the prior year. The increase during the six months ended June 30, 2018 consists of higher expenses of $0.5 million for the Connected Solutions segment and higher expenses of $0.1 million for the RF Solutions segment compared to the same period in the prior year. Expenses for both segments were higher compared to the prior year periods due to additional headcount and equipment required to support investments in growth areas.  
We reported a total operating loss of $1.6 million during the three months ended June 30, 2018 and an operating loss of $2.8 million for the six months ended June 30, 2018. The operating losses were primarily the result of lower profits for the RF Solutions segment and lower gross profits for the Connected Solutions segment. Due to lower revenues we recorded operating losses of $0.4 million and $0.7 million for RF Solutions segment during the three and six months ended June 30, 2018, respectively, compared to income for the same periods in 2017. Operating profit for the Connected Solutions segment was lower by approximately $0.8 million during the three months ended June 30, 2018 and lower by $1.0 million for the six months ended June 30, 2018 compared to the prior year primarily due to a lower gross profit percentage. Within the corporate function, expenses were lower by $0.3 million and $0.6 million, respectively in the three and six months ended June 30, 2018 due to lower expenses related to the Short-Term Incentive Plan (“STIP”) and because the same periods in 2017 included expenses related to the CEO transition. 
Amortization expense within operating expenses was $0.1 million and $0.2 million during the three and six months ended June 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively. Between the first quarter 2017 and the second quarter 2018, there were no changes to intangible assets that impacted amortization expense  None.
