Competition in the antenna markets addressed by the Connected Solutions segment is fragmented. Competitors include Airgain, Amphenol, Laird, Pulse, and Taoglas. The Company seeks out product applications that command a premium for product performance and customer service, and it avoids commodity markets. 
PCTEL Connected Solutions designs and manufactures precision antennas. PCTEL antennas are deployed primarily in small cells, enterprise Wi-Fi access points, fleet management and transit systems, and in equipment and devices for the IIoT. Revenue growth in these markets is driven by the increased use of wireless communications and increased complexity occurring in these markets. PCTEL antennas are primarily sold to original equipment manufacturer (“OEM”) providers where they are designed into the customer’s solution. 
Depreciation and amortization expense was approximately $0.7 million and $0.6 million for the three months ended March 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. Amortization for capital leases is included in depreciation and amortization expense. See Note 10 for information related to capital leases. 
Competitors for PCTEL’s test tool products include OEMs such as Anritsu, Berkley Varitronics, Digital Receiver Technology, and Rohde and Schwarz. 
The $0.3 million decrease in the net book value of intangible assets at March 31, 2018 compared to December 31, 2017 relates to amortization expense for the three months ended March 31, 2018.  
During the quarter ended June 30, 2017, the Company approved a plan to sell its Network Engineering Services business (“Engineering Services”) and shift its focus toward research and development driven radio frequency (“RF”) products. On July 31, 2017, the Company sold its Network Engineering Services business to Gabe’s Construction Co., Inc. (“Gabe’s”). The Company filed a Form 8-K related to the disposition on August 4, 2017.  
PCTEL RF Solutions provides test tools that improve the performance of wireless networks globally, with a focus on LTE, public safety, and emerging 5G technologies. Network operators, neutral hosts, and equipment manufacturers rely on PCTEL’s scanning receivers and testing solutions to analyze, design, and optimize their networks. Revenue growth is driven by the implementation and roll out of new wireless technology standards (i.e. 3G to 4G, 4G to 5G). PCTEL test equipment is sold directly to wireless carriers or to OEMs who integrate the Company’s products into their solutions which are then sold to wireless carriers. 
During the quarter ended June 30, 2017, the Company approved a plan to sell its Network Engineering Service business (“Engineering Services”) and shift its focus toward research and development driven radio frequency (“RF”) products. On July 31, 2017, the Company sold substantially all of the assets of the Company’s Engineering Services business to Gabe’s Construction Co., Inc. (“Gabe’s”) for a purchase price of $1.45 million. The Engineering Services business provided design, testing, commissioning, optimization, and consulting services for cellular, Wi-Fi and public safety networks and was a reporting unit within the RF Solutions segment. Due to the significance of its historical results and because this disposition represented a strategic shift by the Company to focus on products, the disposition of Engineering Services also qualified as a discontinued operation for reporting purposes. As such, the Company reported the results of its Engineering Services business as discontinued operations beginning with the quarter ended June 30, 2017. The Company restated the results of Engineering Services as discontinued operations for the quarter ended March 31, 2017. See Note 5 for more information on discontinued operations.
