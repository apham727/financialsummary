Depreciation and amortization expense was approximately $0.7 million for the three months ended September 30, 2019 and 2018, respectively. Depreciation and amortization expense was approximately $2.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2019 and 2018, respectively. Amortization for finance leases is included in depreciation and amortization expense. See Note 10 for information related to finance leases. 
Until the Reorganization, PCTEL operated in two segments for reporting purposes, Connected Solutions and RF Solutions. The CODM assessed operating profits and identified assets for the Connected Solutions and RF Solutions segments for resource allocations. Each segment had its own general manager as well as its own engineering, business development, sales and marketing, and operational general and administrative functions. 
The following tables are the product line revenues and gross profits for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2019 and 2018. 
There were no customers that accounted for 10% or more of revenues during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2019 and 2018. 
Effective August 2018, the Company consolidated its organizational structure to drive growth and address the convergence in the Industrial IoT, public safety, and 4G infrastructure markets and the emergence of new technologies such as 5G (the “Reorganization”). The Company’s operations, engineering, business development, sales and marketing, and operational general and administrative functions were consolidated into a single enterprise-wide organization. As a result of the Reorganization that occurred in the third quarter 2018, the Company’s Chief Executive Officer, as the chief operating decision maker (“CODM”) began assessing operating  
The intrinsic value of service-based restricted shares that vested during the three months ended September 30, 2019 and 2018 was $32 and $36 respectively. The intrinsic value of service-based restricted shares that vested during the nine months ended September 30, 2019 and 2018 was $2.2 million and $0.8 million, respectively.  
The condensed consolidated statements of operations include $0.9 million and $0.8 million of stock compensation expense for the three months ended September 30, 2019 and 2018, respectively. The condensed consolidated statements of operations include $3.2 million and $2.6 million of stock compensation expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2019 and 2018, respectively. The Company accounts for forfeitures as they occur.  
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market and include material, labor and overhead costs using the first-in, first-out method of costing. Inventories as of September 30, 2019 and December 31, 2018 were composed of raw materials, sub-assemblies, work-in-process and finished goods. The Company had consigned inventory with customers of $0.2 million and $0.9 million at September 30, 2019 and December 31, 2018, respectively. The Company records allowances to reduce the value of inventory to the lower of cost or market, including allowances for excess and obsolete inventory. Reserves for excess inventory are calculated based on our estimate of inventory in excess of normal and planned usage. Obsolete reserves are based on our identification of inventory where the carrying value is above net realizable value. The allowance for inventory losses was $3.4 million and $3.3 million at September 30, 2019 and at December 31, 2018, respectively. 
All of the Company’s revenue relates to contracts with customers. The Company’s accounting contracts are from purchase orders or purchase orders combined with purchase agreements. The majority of the Company’s revenue is recognized on a “point-in-time” basis and a nominal amount of revenue is recognized “over time”. For the sale of antenna products and test and measurement products, the Company satisfies its performance obligations generally at the time of shipment or upon delivery based on the contractual terms with its customers. For products shipped on consignment, the Company recognizes revenue upon delivery from the consignment location. For its test and measurement software tools, the Company has a performance obligation to provide software maintenance and support for one year. The Company recognizes revenues for the maintenance and support over this period.

The intrinsic value of service-based restricted stock units that vested and were issued as shares during the nine months ended September 30, 2019 and 2018 was $30 and $29, respectively. No service-based restricted stock units vested during the three months ended September 30, 2019 or 2018.   Our third quarter 2019 revenues were $23.6 million and increased by $5.2 million or 28.2% compared to revenues of $18.4 million for the same period in 2018. Third quarter 2019 revenues increased by $3.7 million or 103.6% to $7.2 million for the test and measurement products compared to the third quarter 2018 and increased by $1.6 million or 10.7% to $16.5 million for the antenna products. Revenues increased for the test and measurement product line primarily due to sales of 5G products for early deployment. Revenues increased for the antenna products due to higher revenues with intelligent transportation products. The gross profit of $10.6 million, increased by $3.9 million compared to the same period in 2018 due to both a higher product mix of test and measurement product line revenues and an increase in the gross margin percentage for antenna products. Primarily based on higher gross profit margins, we recorded an operating income of $0.9 million for the three months ended September 30, 2019 compared to an operating loss of $2.4 million during the third quarter 2018.  
Revenues for the nine months ended September 30, 2019 were $67.7 million, an increase of $6.0 million, or 9.7% compared to the same period in 2018. Test and measurement revenues increased by $8.6 million to $20.3 million compared to the same period in 2018. Antenna product revenues decreased by $2.6 million or 5.1% to $47.6 million primarily due to lower revenues with enterprise Wi-Fi applications and small cell antennas. Revenues increased for the test and measurement products due to sales of 5G products for early deployment. The gross profit of $30.0 million increased by $7.6 million compared to gross profit for the same period in 2018, due to a higher product mix of test and measurement product revenues and due to an increase in the gross margin percentage for antenna products. Because of higher gross profit margins, we recorded an operating income of $1.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2019 as compared to an operating loss of $5.2 million for the same period in 2018. 
For the three months ended September 30, 2019, we recorded net income of $1.3 million compared to a net loss of $1.7 million for the same period in 2018, and for the nine months ended September 30, 2019 we recorded net income of $2.0 million compared to a net loss of $3.8 million for the same period in 2018. For both the three and nine months ended September 30, 2019, higher gross margins as well as other income offset higher operating expenses Gross margins increased during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2019 compared to same periods in 2018 due to a higher mix of test and measurement product revenues and an improvement in the gross margin percentage for antenna products.  
Sales and marketing expenses were approximately the same for the three months ended September 30, 2019 compared to the same period in 2018 and decreased $0.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2019 compared to the same period in 2018. For the nine months ended September 30, 2019, lower expenses for sales headcount in North America offset higher corporate marketing expenses.  
Revenues increased 28.2% and 9.7% for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2019 compared to the same periods primarily due to higher revenues for test and measurement products. Revenues for the test and measurement product line increased 103.6% and 73.6% for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2019 compared to the three and nine months ended September 30, 2018 primarily due to sales in connection with early deployments of 5G infrastructure in the U.S., Europe and Asia. For the three months ended September 30, 2019, revenues increased for the antenna product line by 10.7%, compared to the same period in 2018, based on increased revenues for intelligent transportation systems offset lower revenues for small cell antennas and for enterprise Wi-Fi applications. Antenna revenues declined by 5.1% for the nine months ended September 30, 2019 compared to the same period in 2018, primarily due to decreased demand for small cell antennas and for enterprise Wi-Fi applications. The decline in revenues for small cell antennas is primarily due to lower demand from one customer, Huawei Technologies Co., Ltd. As a result of the unexpected U.S. restrictions on trading with Huawei, Huawei’s demand for our products declined because Huawei was not able to purchase other U.S. sourced components for their networks.  PCTEL, Inc.,  We have a manufacturing facility in Tianjin, China and an engineering design center in Beijing, China. All our Tianjin, China employees are represented by a labor union, and our employees in Beijing, China are represented by a separate labor union pursuant to the requirements of China’s National Labor Law. These two labor unions do not have collective bargaining rights. In order to optimize the cost structure of our antenna product line and increase our competitiveness, we have engaged several contract manufacturers over the last several years to manufacture certain antennas and we are in the process of transitioning manufacturing of antenna products from our Tianjin facility to contract manufacturers in China and elsewhere. We expect the transition to be substantially completed by the end of our 2020 fiscal year (the “Transition Period”) and we expect to recognize cumulative pre-tax charges of approximately $1.0 million consisting of severance and other transition costs. It is expected that a total of approximately 140 positions, or approximately 35% of the Company’s entire full-time global workforce, will be eliminated over the course of the Transition Period at an aggregate cost of approximately $0.9 million. These separation costs will be paid in cash. Other non-cash costs associated with the transition to contract manufacturers include fixed asset dispositions estimated to be $0.1 million. We recognized restructuring expenses of $0.3 million during the third quarter ended September 30, 2019. We anticipate that the remaining charges will be recognized as restructuring expenses during the fourth quarter of 2019 and the first half of 2020. We expect to make cash payments for employee separation costs during the fourth quarter of 2019 and the first half of 2020.
