PCTEL RF Solutions provides test tools that improve the performance of wireless networks globally, with a focus on LTE, public safety, and emerging 5G technologies. Network operators, neutral hosts, and equipment manufacturers rely on PCTEL’s scanning receivers and testing solutions to analyze, design, and optimize their networks. Revenue growth is driven by the implementation and roll out of new wireless technology standards (i.e. 3G to 4G, 4G to 5G). PCTEL test equipment is sold directly to wireless carriers or to OEMs who integrate the Company’s products into their solutions which are then sold to wireless carriers. 
During the quarter ended June 30, 2017, the Company approved a plan to sell its Network Engineering Services business (“Engineering Services”) and shift its focus to research and development driven radio frequency (“RF”) products. On July 31, 2017, the Company sold substantially all of the assets of the Company’s Engineering Services business to Gabe’s Construction Co., Inc. (“Gabe’s”) for a purchase price of $1.45 million. The Engineering Services business provided design, testing, commissioning, optimization, and consulting services for cellular, Wi-Fi and public safety networks and was a reporting unit within the RF Solutions segment. The disposition of Engineering Services qualified as a discontinued operation for reporting purposes due to the material significance of its historical results and because this disposition represented a strategic shift by the Company to focus on products. As such, the Company reported the results of its Engineering Services business as discontinued operations beginning with the quarter ended June 30, 2017.

Sales and marketing expenses decreased approximately $0.3 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2018 compared to the same periods in 2017. For the three months ended September 30, 2018, sales and marketing expenses were lower by $0.2 million for the RF Solutions segment and lower by $0.1 million for the Connected Solutions segment compared to the same period for each of the segments, respectively, in 2017.

During the nine months ended September 30, 2018, sales and marketing expenses for the Connected Solutions segment declined $0.4 million, offsetting higher sales and marketing expenses of $0.1 million for the RF Solutions segment compared to the same period in 2017. The expense decrease for the Connected Solutions segment is due to headcount reductions in sales and marketing at the end of the first quarter 2017. The expense increase for RF Solutions for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2018 was due to additions to sales and marketing headcount offset by lower sales commission expenses. 
million, offsetting a net operating loss of $0.1 million and income tax expense of $0.2 million. The net loss for the nine months ended September 30, 2017 reflects a net operating loss of $0.7 million, offsetting a gain on the sale of the business of $0.5 million.  
Research and development expenses increased approximately $0.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2018 and increased $0.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2018 compared to the same periods in 2017. During the three months ended September 30, 2018, expenses for the Connected Solutions segment were higher by $0.3 million and expenses for the RF Solutions segment were approximately the same compared to the same period in the prior year. The increase during the nine months ended September 30, 2018 consists of higher expenses of $0.8 million for the Connected Solutions segment and higher expenses of $0.1 million for the RF Solutions segment compared to the same period in the prior year. Expenses for both segments were higher compared to the prior year periods due to additional headcount and equipment required to support investments in growth areas.  
The decrease in revenues for the RF Solutions segment for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2018 was primarily due to lower capital spending by U.S. carriers and also lower revenues in the Asia Pacific region because 2017 included some larger projects in China. For the three months ended September 30, 2018, the decrease in revenues for the Connected Solutions segment was due to lower sales in the industrial and public safety vertical markets. For the nine months ended September 30, 2018, the decrease in revenues for the Connected Solutions segment was due to lower sales in the industrial and public safety vertical markets, offset by increased sales in the Enterprise Wi-Fi vertical market. The operating loss for both the three and nine months ended September 30, 2018 was primarily the result of the negative gross margin impact of lower revenues generated by the RF Solutions segment and a lower gross margin percentage for the Connected Solutions segment. Operating expenses were lower for the nine months ended September 30, 2018 compared to the same period in 2017 as lower general and administrative expenses offset higher research and development expenses.
