Depreciation and amortization expense was approximately $0.7 million for the three months ended June 30, 2019 and 2018, respectively. Depreciation and amortization expense was approximately $1.4 million for the six months ended June 30, 2019 and 2018, respectively. Amortization for finance leases is included in depreciation and amortization expense. See Note 10 for information related to finance leases. 
The following tables are the product line revenues and gross profits for the three and six months ended June 30, 2019 and 2018. 
Until the Reorganization, PCTEL operated in two segments for reporting purposes, Connected Solutions and RF Solutions. The CODM assessed operating profits and identified assets for the Connected Solutions and RF Solutions segments for resource allocations. Each segment had its own general manager as well as its own engineering, business development, sales and marketing, and operational general and administrative functions. 
The $0.5 million decrease in the net book value of intangible assets at June 30, 2019 compared to December 31, 2018 relates to amortization expense for the six months ended June 30, 2019.  
The following table represents the customers that accounted for 10% or more of revenues during the three and six months ended June 30, 2019 and 2018. 
Effective August 2018, the Company consolidated its organizational structure to drive growth and address the convergence in the Industrial IoT, public safety, and 4G infrastructure markets and the emergence of new technologies such as 5G (the “Reorganization”). The Company’s operations, engineering, business development, sales and marketing, and operational general and administrative functions were consolidated into a single enterprise-wide organization. As a result of the Reorganization that occurred in the third quarter 2018, the Company’s Chief Executive Officer, as the chief operating decision maker (“CODM”) began assessing operating  
profits and identified assets at the enterprise level for resource allocations. In connection with the Reorganization, the Board of Directors appointed a Chief Operating Officer who maintains regular contact with the CODM to discuss operating activities, financial results, forecasts, and plans for the Company’s businesses. All operating profit and cash flows are measured and managed at the enterprise level.  
The condensed consolidated statements of operations include $1.4 million and $1.1 million of stock compensation expense for the three months ended June 30, 2019 and 2018, respectively. The condensed consolidated statements of operations include $2.3 million and $1.8 million of stock compensation expense for the six months ended June 30, 2019 and 2018, respectively. The Company accounts for forfeitures as they occur.  
The intrinsic value of service-based restricted shares that vested during the three months ended June 30, 2019 was $8. The intrinsic value of service-based restricted shares that vested during the six months ended June 30, 2019 and 2018 was $2.1 million and $0.8 million, respectively. No service-based restricted shares vested during the three months ended June 30, 2018.  
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market and include material, labor and overhead costs using the first-in, first-out method of costing. Inventories as of June 30, 2019 and December 31, 2018 were composed of raw materials, sub-assemblies, work-in-process and finished goods. The Company had consigned inventory with customers of $0.2 million and $0.9 million at June 30, 2019 and December 31, 2018, respectively. The Company records allowances to reduce the value of inventory to the lower of cost or market, including allowances for excess and obsolete inventory. Reserves for excess inventory are calculated based on our estimate of inventory in excess of normal and planned usage. Obsolete reserves are based on our identification of inventory where the carrying value is above net realizable value. The allowance for inventory losses was $3.2 million at June 30, 2019 and $3.3 million at December 31, 2018. 
shares that may be issued under the 2019 LTIP is 300,015 as of June 30, 2019. During the three months and six months ended June 30, 2019, the shares that can be earned at target and the maximum shares that can be earned declined by 2,680 and 4,690, respectively due to employee terminations.  
All of the Company’s revenue relates to contracts with customers. The Company’s accounting contracts are from purchase orders or purchase orders combined with purchase agreements. The majority of the Company’s revenue is recognized on a “point-in-time” basis and a nominal amount of revenue is recognized “over time”. For the sale of antenna products and test and measurement products, the Company satisfies its performance obligations generally at the time of shipment or upon delivery based on the contractual terms with its customers. For products shipped on consignment, the Company recognizes revenue upon delivery from the consignment location. For its test and measurement software tools, the Company has a performance obligation to provide software maintenance and support for one year. The Company recognizes revenues for the maintenance and support over this period.  For the three months ended June 30, 2019 we recorded net income of $0.9 million compared to a net loss of $1.2 million for the same period in 2018, and for the six months ended June 30, 2019 we recorded net income of $0.6 million compared to a net loss of $2.1 million for the same period in 2018. For both the three and six months ended June 30, 2019 higher gross margins as well as other income offset higher operating expenses Gross margins increased during the three and six months ended June 30, 2019 compared to same periods in 2018 because of a higher mix of test and measurement product revenues and due to an improvement in the gross margin percentage for antenna products.  
Sales and marketing expenses were approximately the same for the three months ended June 30, 2019 compared to the same period in 2018 and decreased $0.2 million for the six months ended June 30, 2019 compared to the same period in 2018. For the six months ended June 30, 2019, higher corporate marketing expenses offset lower expenses for sales headcount in North America.  
Our second quarter 2019 revenues were $23.5 million and increased by $1.9 million or 8.9% compared to revenues of $21.6 million for the same period in 2018. Second quarter 2019 revenues increased by $3.4 million or 82.0% to $7.5 million for the test and measurement product line compared to the second quarter 2018 and decreased by $1.5 million or 8.4% to $16.0 million for the antenna product line. Revenues decreased for the antenna product line due to lower revenues with enterprise Wi-Fi applications and small cell antennas. Revenues increased for the test and measurement product line due to increased sales of 5G products. The gross profit of $10.7 million, increased by $2.9 million compared to the same period in 2018 due to both a higher product mix of test and measurement product line revenues and an increase in the gross margin percentage for antenna products. Primarily based on higher gross profit margins, we recorded an operating income of $0.6 million for the three months ended June 30, 2019 compared to an operating loss of $1.6 million during the second quarter 2018.  
Revenues increased 8.9% for the three months ended June 30, 2019 compared to the same period in 2018 and 1.8% for the six months ended June 30, 2019. For the three months and six months ended June 30, 2019, the decrease in revenues for the antenna product line of 8.4% and 11.7%, compared to the same periods in 2018, was due to lower sales for small cell antennas and for enterprise Wi-Fi applications. Revenues for the test and measurement product line increased 82.0% and 60.6% for the three and six months ended June 30, 2019 compared to the same periods in 2018 due to sales of test equipment in connection with early deployments of 5G infrastructure in the U.S., Europe and Asia. 
Research and development expenses were approximately the same for the three and six months ended June 30, 2019 compared to the same periods in 2018. Spending on investments for 5G test and measurement equipment and for wireless products development for Industrial IoT offset the impact of cost reductions from 2018.  PCTEL, Inc.,  We have a manufacturing facility in Tianjin, China and an engineering design center in Beijing, China. All our Tianjin, China employees are represented by a labor union, and our employees in Beijing, China are represented by a separate labor union pursuant to the requirements of China’s National Labor Law. These two labor unions do not have collective bargaining rights. In order to optimize the cost structure of our antenna product line and increase our competitiveness, we have engaged several contract manufacturers over the last several years to manufacture certain antennas and we are in the process of transitioning the manufacturing of antenna products from our Tianjin facility to contract manufacturers in China and elsewhere. We expect the transition to be substantially completed by the end of our 2020 fiscal year (the “Transition Period”) and we expect to recognize cumulative pre-tax charges of approximately $1.0 million consisting of severance and other transition costs. It is expected that a total of approximately 140 positions, or approximately 35% of the Company’s entire full-time global workforce, will be eliminated over the course of the Transition Period at an aggregate cost of approximately $0.9 million. These separation costs will be paid in cash. Other non-cash costs associated with the transition to contract manufacturers include fixed asset dispositions estimated to be $0.1 million. We anticipate that these charges will be recognized as restructuring expenses during the third and fourth quarter of 2019. We expect to make cash payments for employee separation costs during the second half of 2019 and the first half of 2020.
