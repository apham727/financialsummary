 The weighted average grant date fair value of restricted stock units granted during the three months ended March 31, 2018 and 2017 was $25.41 and $20.76, respectively. The weighted average grant date fair value of restricted stock units granted during the six months ended March 31, 2018 and 2017 was $33.61 and $14.32, respectively. The fair value of restricted stock units vested during the three months ended March 31, 2018 and 2017 was $0.1 million and $0.6 million, respectively. The fair value of restricted stock units vested during the six months ended March 31, 2018 and 2017 was $19.1 million and $11.9 million, respectively. During the six months ended March 31, 2018 and 2017, the Company remitted $6.3 million and $3.8 million, respectively, for withholding taxes on vested restricted stock units, of which $0.1 million was paid by the Company during the six months ended March 31, 2017. There were no taxes on vested restricted stock units paid by the Company during the six months ended March 31, 2018.

 The Company establishes reserves for estimated costs of product warranties based on historical information. Product warranty reserves are recorded at the time product revenue is recognized, and retrofit accruals are recorded at the time  Research and development expenses were $13.1 million and $26.3 million, respectively, during the three and six months ended March 31, 2018 as compared to $11.3 million and $22.2 million, respectively, during the corresponding periods of the prior fiscal year. The increase of $1.8 million during the second quarter of fiscal year 2018 as compared to the second quarter of fiscal year 2017 reflects higher costs of $1.0 million within the Brooks Semiconductor Solutions Group segment and $0.8 million within the Brooks Life Sciences segment. The increase of $4.1 million during the first half of fiscal year 2018 as compared to the first half of fiscal year 2017 reflects higher costs of $2.3 million within the Brooks Semiconductor Solutions Group segment and $1.8 million within the Brooks Life Sciences segment. Higher research and development expenses during the three and six months ended March 31, 2018 as compared to the three and six months ended March 31, 2017 were primarily attributable to higher employee-related costs and project spending to support new product development and the growth of our business.

Gross margin increased in the Brooks Semiconductor Solutions Group segment by 3.0 percentage points and in the Brooks Life Sciences segment by 0.9 percentage points. We reported gross margins of 40.2% for the six months ended March 31, 2018 compared to 36.9% for the corresponding period of the prior fiscal year. Gross margin increased in the Brooks Semiconductor Solutions Group segment by 4.5 percentage points and decreased by 0.1 points in the Brooks Life Sciences segment, as compared to the prior period. Cost of revenue for the three and six months ended March 31, 2018 included $1.0 million and $1.9 million, respectively, of charges for amortization related to completed technology as compared to $1.1 million and $2.1 million, respectively, incurred during the corresponding periods of the prior fiscal year. Cost of revenue for the six months ended March 31, 2018 also included $1.2 million of charges related to the sale of inventories obtained in acquisitions to which a step-up in value was applied in purchase accounting. There were no such charges during the three months ended March 31, 2018. The three and six months ended March 31, 2017 included $0.4 million and $0.5 million, respectively of such charges. Excluding the purchasing accounting impact and the amortization of completed technology, margins expanded 2.2 percentage points and 3.3 percentage points, respectively, during the three and six months ended March 31, 2018 as compared to the corresponding periods of the prior fiscal year.

 Results of Operations- Revenue for the three months ended March 31, 2018 increased to $207.3 million, or by 22%, as compared to the corresponding period of the prior fiscal year. Gross margin was 40.6% for the second quarter of fiscal year 2018 as compared to 38.1% for the second quarter of fiscal year 2017, which resulted in an increase in gross profit of $19.7 million. Operating expenses were $60.4 million during the second quarter of fiscal year 2018 as compared to $49.7 million during the second quarter of fiscal year 2017, an increase of $10.7 million. Operating income was $23.8 million during the second quarter of fiscal year 2018 as compared to $14.8 million for the corresponding period of the prior fiscal year. Revenue growth and gross margin improvement drove higher gross profits of $19.7 million, partially offset by an increase in operating expenses. Net income was $67.0 million for the three months ended March 31, 2018 as compared to $14.0 million for the corresponding period of the prior fiscal year. The increase of $53.0 million was primarily attributable to the decrease in income taxes of $47.3 million driven by the substantial release of the tax valuation allowance of $46.2 million and an increase in operating income of $9.0 million, as noted above. These increases were partially offset by higher non-operating expenses of $1.9 million compared to the corresponding period of the prior fiscal year, primarily related to interest expense on the term loan and lower net income from equity method investments of $1.4 million.
