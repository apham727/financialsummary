 Item 1. Legal Proceedings   
 On April 6, 2018, the Company acquired approximately 93% of the outstanding capital stock of Tec-Sem Group AG (“Tec-Sem”), a Switzerland-based manufacturer of semiconductor fabrication automation equipment with a focus on reticle management. The total cash payment made by the Company as of June 30, 2018 was $12.8 million, net of cash acquired and subject to working capital adjustments. The Company expects to acquire the remaining 7% noncontrolling interest upon the completion of certain procedural steps. The acquisition of Tec-Sem expands the Company’s contamination control solutions business within the Brooks Semiconductor Solutions Group segment.    We reported gross margins of 39.9% for the three months ended June 30, 2018 compared to 39.4% for the corresponding period of the prior fiscal year. Gross margin increased in the Brooks Semiconductor Solutions Group segment by 0.6 percentage points and in the Brooks Life Sciences segment by 0.7 percentage points in the 2018 period over the 2017 period. We reported gross margins of 40.1% for the nine months ended June 30, 2018 compared to 37.8% for the corresponding period of the prior fiscal year. Gross margin increased in the Brooks Semiconductor Solutions Group segment by 3.1 percentage points and 0.1 points in the Brooks Life Sciences segment in the 2018 period, as compared to the prior period. Cost of revenue for the three and nine months ended June 30, 2018 included $1.5 million and $3.4 million, respectively, of charges for amortization related to completed technology as compared to $1.1 million and $3.1 million, respectively, during the corresponding periods of the prior fiscal year. Cost of revenue for the three and nine months ended June 30, 2018 also included $0.7 million and $1.9 million, respectively of charges related to the inventory step-up in purchase accounting, as compared to $0.1 million and $0.5 million, respectively, during the corresponding periods of the prior fiscal year. Excluding the purchasing accounting impact related to inventory step-up and the amortization of completed technology, gross margins expanded 0.9 percentage points and 2.5 percentage points, respectively, during the three and nine months ended June 30, 2018 as compared to the corresponding periods of the prior fiscal year.  
nine months ended June 30, 2018 each included $0.7 million of charges related to the inventory step-up in purchase accounting. Cost of revenue for the nine months ended June 30, 2017 included $0.1 million of such charges. Excluding the purchase accounting impact and the amortization of completed technology, margins expanded 1.2 percentage points and 3.2 percentage points, respectively, during the three and nine months ended June 30, 2018 as compared to the corresponding periods of the prior fiscal year.  
 Research and development expenses were $14.2 million and $40.5 million, respectively, during the three and nine months ended June 30, 2018 as compared to $12.0 million and $34.1 million, respectively, during the corresponding periods of the prior fiscal year. The increase of $2.2 million during the third quarter of fiscal year 2018 as compared to the third quarter of fiscal year 2017 reflects greater investments in the 2018 period of $1.4 million within the Brooks Semiconductor Solutions Group segment and $0.8 million within the Brooks Life Sciences segment. The increase of $6.4 million during the nine months ended June 30, 2018 as compared to the corresponding periods of the prior fiscal year reflects greater investments in the 2018 period of $3.7 million within the Brooks Semiconductor Solutions Group segment and $2.6 million within the Brooks Life Sciences segment. Higher research and development expenses during the three and nine months ended June 30, 2018 as compared to the same periods of prior fiscal year were primarily attributable to higher employee related costs and project spending to support new product development and the growth of our business as well as research and development costs associated with new acquisitions made during the nine months ended June 30, 2018.   
 Results of Operations- Revenue for the nine months ended June 30, 2018 increased to $620.1 million, or by 21%, as compared to the corresponding period of the prior fiscal year. Gross margin was 40.1% for the nine months ended June 30, 2018 as compared to 37.8% for the nine months ended June 30, 2017, which resulted in an increase in gross profit of $55.6 million. Operating expenses were $177.3 million during the nine months ended June 30, 2018 as compared to $146.3 million during the nine months ended June 30, 2017, an increase of $31.0 million. Operating income was $71.3 million during the nine months ended June 30, 2018 as compared to $46.7 million for the corresponding period of the prior fiscal year. Revenue growth and gross margin improvement drove higher gross profits of $55.6 million, partially offset by an increase in operating expenses. Net income was $106.1 million for the nine months ended June 30, 2018 as compared to $45.2 million for the corresponding period of the prior fiscal year. The increase of $60.9 million was primarily attributable to the decrease in income taxes of $47.6 million driven by the substantial release of the tax valuation allowance of $45.6 million and an increase in operating income of $24.6 million. These increases were partially offset by higher net non-operating expenses of $11.3 million compared to the corresponding period of the prior fiscal year, primarily related to increased interest expense of $6.6 million mainly due to the term loan, higher foreign exchanges losses of $1.5 million and the impact of a $1.8 million gain recorded on the settlement of our investment in Biocision, LLC, or BioCision, during the nine months ended June 30, 2017. In addition, income from equity method investments decreased during the nine months ended June 30, 2018 by $2.3 million compared to the nine months ended June 30, 2017.   
 Our Brooks Semiconductor Solutions Group segment reported revenue of $173.8 million for the three months ended June 30, 2018 compared to $145.0 million for the corresponding period of the prior fiscal year, an increase of 28.8 million, or 20%. Revenue for the segment was $474.4 million during the nine months ended June 30, 2018, compared to $406.2 million for the corresponding period of the prior fiscal year, an increase of $68.1 million, or 17%. The increase in both periods were primarily driven by increases in sales of robotic automation products, cryogenic pump products and semiconductor services and related spare parts, partially offset by a decline in sales of contamination controls systems. 
 Our Brooks Semiconductor Solutions Group segment reported gross margins of 40.6% for the three months ended June 30, 2018 as compared to 40.1% for the corresponding period of the prior fiscal year. The increase is driven by volume leverage of fixed costs partially offset by higher warranty expense. Our Brooks Semiconductor Solutions Group segment reported gross margins of 41.2% for the nine months ended June 30, 2018 as compared to 38.1% for the corresponding period of the prior fiscal year. The increase was driven by a favorable mix, volume leverage and lower costs related to materials. Cost of revenue for the three and nine months ended June 30, 2018 included $1.2 million and $2.3 million, respectively, of charges for amortization related to completed technology as compared to $0.6 million and $1.9 million, respectively, incurred during the corresponding periods of the prior fiscal year. The results for the three and
