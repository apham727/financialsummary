 The Company and ULVAC Corporation of Chigasaki, Japan each own a 50% stake in the joint venture, ULVAC Cryogenics, Inc (“UCI”).

Research and development expenses were $13.2 million during the three months ended December 31, 2017 as compared to $10.8 million during the corresponding period of the prior fiscal year. The increase of $2.4 million reflects higher costs of $1.4 million within the Brooks Semiconductor Solutions Group segment and $1.0 million within the Brooks Life Sciences segment which were primarily attributable to higher employee-related costs and project spending to support new product development and the growth of our business.   
 We reported gross margins of 39.7% for the three months ended December 31, 2017 compared to 35.6% for the corresponding period of the prior fiscal year. Gross margin increased in the Brooks Semiconductor Solutions Group segment by 6.0 percentage points and declined in the Brooks Life Sciences segment by 1.2 percentage points. Cost of revenue for the three months ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 included $0.9 million and $1.0 million, respectively, of charges for amortization related to completed technology, as well as $1.2 million and $0.1 million, respectively, of charges related to the sale of inventories obtained in acquisitions to which a step-up in value was applied in purchase accounting. Excluding the purchasing accounting impact and the amortization of completed technology, margins expanded 4.6 percentage points.  
 Our Brooks Life Sciences segment reported gross margins of 33.2% for the three months ended December 31, 2017 as compared to 34.4% for the corresponding period of the prior fiscal year. The decrease was a result of higher production costs and higher charges related to the sale of inventories obtained in acquisitions to which a step-up in value was applied in purchase accounting. Such charges were $1.2 million during the three months ended December 31, 2017 compared to $0.1 million during the corresponding period of the prior fiscal year. These increases were partially offset by a more favorable mix of products and services, volume leverage and higher margins on automated storage systems, consumables, and sample storage services. Cost of revenue during each of the three months ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 also included $0.4 million of amortization related to completed technology. Excluding the purchasing accounting impact and the amortization of completed technology, margins expanded 0.7 percentage points.  
 During the three months ended December 31, 2017, we recorded income of $2.2 million from our equity method investments as compared to $1.9 million during the corresponding period of the prior fiscal year.

 changes in foreign currency exchange rates. Cost of revenue during the three months ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 included $0.5 million and $0.6 million, respectively, of amortization related to completed technology. Excluding the amortization of completed technology, margins expanded 5.9 percentage points.   
  Capital expenditures are made primarily for increasing capacity, replacing equipment, supporting new product development and improving information technology infrastructure. Capital expenditures were $2.7 million during the first quarter of fiscal year 2018 as compared to $3.8 million during the corresponding period of the prior fiscal year. The decrease of $1.1 million was primarily attributable to lower investments made in our capital asset infrastructure during the first quarter of fiscal year 2018 compared to the corresponding period of the prior fiscal year.  
 We reported revenue of $189.3 million for the three months ended December 31, 2017, compared to $160.0 million for the corresponding period of the prior fiscal year, an increase of $29.4 million, or 18%. We reported revenue growth in both the Brooks Semiconductor Solutions Group segment and the Brooks Life Sciences segment. The impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates favorably affected revenue by $2.4 million during the three months ended December 31, 2017 when compared to the corresponding period of the prior fiscal year.
