On April 6, 2018, the Company acquired approximately 93% of the outstanding capital stock of Tec-Sem Group AG (“Tec-Sem”), a Switzerland-based manufacturer of semiconductor fabrication automation equipment with a focus on reticle management. During the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2018, the Company acquired the remaining 7% noncontrolling interest upon the completion of certain procedural steps. The total cash payment to acquire the business was $15.6 million, net of cash acquired and subject to working capital adjustments. The acquisition of Tec-Sem has expanded the Company’s contamination control solutions business within the Brooks Semiconductor Solutions Group segment. 
serving scientific and business operations functions. In a typical customer workflow, a biological sample is collected, processed and analyzed with results interpreted and used to make scientific judgements. Critical or valuable samples are then annotated and stored for many years in environments where they can be easily retrieved for additional study. These operating segments provide services across this workflow. Both of these operating segments offer services meeting the standards of Good Manufacturing Practices set forth by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.
