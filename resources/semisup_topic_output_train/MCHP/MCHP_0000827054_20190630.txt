Depreciation expense attributed to property, plant and equipment was $46.2 million and $38.0 million for the three months ended June 30, 2019 and 2018, respectively.
Note 3. Business Acquisitions 
Our business is dependent on distributors to service our end customers.
We are dependent on wafer foundries and other contractors to perform key manufacturing functions for us, and our licensees of our SuperFlash and other technologies also rely on foundries and other contractors.
The Company recognized impairment charges of $0.5 million and $2.0 million in the three months ended June 30, 2019 and 2018, respectively. 
We rely on outside wafer foundries for a significant portion of our wafer fabrication needs. Specifically, during the first three months of fiscal 2020, approximately 61% of our net sales came from products that were produced at outside wafer foundries compared to 57% of our net sales in fiscal 2019. We also use several contractors located primarily in Asia for a portion of the assembly and testing of our products. Specifically, during the first three months of fiscal 2020, approximately 55% of our assembly requirements and 46% of our test requirements were performed by third party contractors compared to approximately 62% of our assembly requirements and 51% of our test requirements during fiscal 2019. Our reliance on third party contractors and foundries increased as a result of our acquisitions of Microsemi, Atmel, Micrel and other companies. The disruption or termination of any of our contractors could harm our business and operating results.
Sales to distributors accounted for approximately 50% of our net sales in the first three months of fiscal 2020 and approximately 51% of our net sales in fiscal 2019. We do not have long-term agreements with our distributors, and we and our distributors may each terminate our relationship with little or no advance notice.
Our technology licensing business exposes us to various risks.
The product lines listed above are included entirely in the Company's semiconductor product segment with the exception of the licensing, memory and other product line, which includes products from both the semiconductor product and technology licensing segments.Net sales of our analog, interface, mixed signal and timing products increased 16.4% in the three-month period ended June 30, 2019 compared to the three-month period ended June 30, 2018 due primarily to our acquisition of Microsemi. 
Our gross profit in the three-month period ended June 30, 2019 was $815.2 million, or 61.6% of net sales, compared to $642.0 million, or 52.9% of net sales, in the three-month period ended June 30, 2018. 
Our FPGA product line was primarily acquired as part of our acquisition of Microsemi on May 29, 2018. Sales of our FPGA products accounted for approximately 6.9% of our net sales for the three-month period ended June 30, 2019 compared to approximately 3.1% of our net sales for the three-month period ended June 30, 2018. This increase is due primarily to our acquisition of Microsemi.
Net cash provided by operating activities was $380.6 million in the three months ended June 30, 2019 compared to $302.4 million in the three months ended June 30, 2018. The increase in net cash provided by operating activities was primarily due to higher operating cash flows resulting from synergies realized from our process efficiencies and restructuring efforts related to our acquisition of Microsemi.•actual or anticipated announcements of technical innovations or new products by us or our competitors.
