•actual or anticipated announcements of technical innovations or new products by us or our competitors.
We are dependent on wafer foundries and other contractors to perform key manufacturing functions for us, and our licensees of our SuperFlash and other technologies also rely on foundries and other contractors.
A strong position in the Chinese market is a key component of our global growth strategy. The market for integrated circuit products in China is highly competitive, and both international and domestic competitors are aggressively seeking to increase their market share. Increased competition or economic weakness in the China market may make it difficult for us to achieve our desired sales volumes in China. In particular, economic conditions in China remain uncertain and we are unable to predict whether such uncertainty will continue or worsen in future periods. 
We rely on outside wafer foundries for a significant portion of our wafer fabrication needs. Specifically, during the first three months of fiscal 2019 and during fiscal 2018, approximately 42% of our net sales, excluding Microsemi which relies on outside wafer foundries for substantially all of their wafer fabrication needs, came from products that were produced at outside wafer foundries. We also use several contractors located primarily in Asia for a portion of the assembly and testing of our products. Specifically, during the first three months of fiscal 2019, approximately 52% of our assembly requirements and 33% of our test requirements, excluding Microsemi which relies on contractors for substantially all of their assembly needs, were performed by third party contractors compared to approximately 58% of our assembly requirements and 36% of our test requirements during fiscal 2018. Our reliance on third party contractors and foundries increased as a result of our acquisitions of Microsemi, Atmel, Micrel, SMSC, Supertex and ISSC. The disruption or termination of any of our contractors could harm our business and operating results.
Sales through distributors accounted for approximately 53% of our net sales in the first three months of fiscal 2019 and approximately 54% of our net sales in fiscal 2018. We do not have long-term agreements with our distributors, and we and our distributors may each terminate our relationship with little or no advance notice.
In addition to acquisitions, we have in the past, and expect in the future, to enter into joint development agreements or other business or strategic relationships with other companies. These transactions are subject to a number of risks similar to those we face with our acquisitions including our ability to realize the expected benefits of any such transaction, to successfully market and sell any products resulting from such transactions or to successfully integrate any technology developed through such transactions.Net cash provided from operating activities was $302.4 million in the three months ended June 30, 2018, compared to $345.0 million in the three months ended June 30, 2017. The decrease in net cash provided from operating activities was primarily due to higher expenses as a result of our acquisition of Microsemi in the three months ended June 30, 2018.
Our gross profit in the three-month period ended June 30, 2018 was $642.0 million, or 52.9% of net sales, compared to $584.4 million, or 60.1% of net sales, in the three-month period ended June 30, 2017. 
Sales of our analog, interface, mixed signal and timing products accounted for approximately 27.4% of our net sales for the three months ended June 30, 2018 compared to approximately 24.6% of our net sales for the three months ended June 30, 2017. The increase is due to our acquisition of Microsemi, whose analog, interface, mixed signal and timing product line accounted for a relatively higher percentage of their total net sales in the one-month period ended June 30, 2018.
Selling, general and administrative expenses increased $49.7 million, or 43.5%, for the three months ended June 30, 2018 over the same period last year. The primary reason for the increase in selling, general and administrative expenses was additional costs from our acquisition of Microsemi, including approximately $26.4 million of acquisition-related legal and professional service expenses. 
Amortization of acquired intangible assets for the three months ended June 30, 2018 was $133.7 million, compared to $120.8 million for the three months ended June 30, 2017. The primary reasons for the increase were increased amortization from our acquisition of Microsemi partially offset by decreased amortization of intangible assets from our prior acquisitions. 
Sales of our memory products accounted for approximately 4.1% of our net sales for the three-month period ended June 30, 2018 compared to approximately 5.1% of our net sales for the three-month period ended June 30, 2017. •actual or anticipated announcements of technical innovations or new products by us or our competitors.

We may lose sales if suppliers of raw materials, components or equipment fail to meet our or our customers' needs or increase costs.
