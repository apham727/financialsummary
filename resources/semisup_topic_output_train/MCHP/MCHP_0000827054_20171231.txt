•actual or anticipated announcements of technical innovations or new products by us or our competitors.
We are dependent on wafer foundries and other contractors to perform key manufacturing functions for us, and our licensees of our SuperFlash and other technologies also rely on foundries and other contractors.
A strong position in the Chinese market is a key component of our global growth strategy. The market for integrated circuit products in China is highly competitive, and both international and domestic competitors are aggressively seeking to increase their market share. Increased competition or economic weakness in the China market may make it difficult for us to achieve our desired sales volumes in China. In particular, economic conditions in China remain uncertain and we are unable to predict whether such uncertainty will continue or worsen in future periods. 
We rely on outside wafer foundries for a significant portion of our wafer fabrication needs. Specifically, during the first nine months of fiscal 2018, approximately 42% of our net sales came from products that were produced at outside wafer foundries. During fiscal 2017, approximately 41% of our net sales came from products that were produced at outside wafer foundries. We also use several contractors located primarily in Asia for a portion of the assembly and testing of our products. Specifically, during the first nine months of fiscal 2018, approximately 61% of our assembly requirements and 38% of our test requirements were performed by third party contractors compared to approximately 64% of our assembly requirements and 40% of our test requirements during fiscal 2017. Our reliance on third party contractors and foundries increased as a result of our acquisitions of Atmel, Micrel, SMSC, Supertex and ISSC. The disruption or termination of any of our contractors could harm our business and operating results.
In addition to acquisitions, we have in the past, and expect in the future, to enter into joint development agreements or other business or strategic relationships with other companies. These transactions are subject to a number of risks similar to those we face with our acquisitions including our ability to realize the expected benefits of any such transaction, to successfully market and sell any products resulting from such transactions or to successfully integrate any technology developed through such transactions.
Sales through distributors accounted for approximately 54.2% of our net sales in the first nine months of fiscal 2018 and approximately 55.3% of our net sales in fiscal 2017. We do not have long-term agreements with our distributors, and we and our distributors may each terminate our relationship with little or no advance notice.Our gross profit in the three months ended December 31, 2017 was $607.1 million, or 61.1% of net sales, compared to $465.3 million, or 55.8% of net sales, in the three months ended December 31, 2016. Our gross profit in the nine months ended December 31, 2017 was $1,805.6 million, or 60.6% of net sales, compared to $1,224.4 million, or 48.9% of net sales, in the nine months ended December 31, 2016. 
Selling, general and administrative expenses for the three months ended December 31, 2017 were $109.1 million, or 11.0% of net sales, compared to $111.0 million, or 13.3% of net sales, for the three months ended December 31, 2016. Selling, general and administrative expenses for the nine months ended December 31, 2017 were $337.6 million, or 11.3% of net sales, compared to $388.7 million, or 15.5% of net sales, for the nine months ended December 31, 2016. Selling, general and administrative expenses include salary expenses related to field sales, marketing and administrative personnel, advertising and promotional expenditures and legal expenses. Selling, general and administrative expenses also include costs related to our direct sales force, CEMs and ESEs who work in sales offices worldwide to stimulate demand by assisting customers in the selection and use of our products.
Our net sales for the quarter ended December 31, 2017 were $994.2 million, a decrease of 1.8% from the previous quarter's net sales of $1,012.1 million. The decrease in net sales in the three months ended December 31, 2017 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2017 was primarily due to the impact of seasonality on our business.
Sales of our analog, interface, mixed signal and timing products accounted for approximately 23.3% and 23.8% of our net sales for the three and nine months ended December 31, 2017, respectively, compared to approximately 26.5% and 26.3% of our net sales for the three and nine months ended December 31, 2016, respectively. 
Net sales of our memory products increased 4.2% and 8.0% in the three and nine months ended December 31, 2017, respectively, compared to the three and nine months ended December 31, 2016. These sales increases were due primarily to growth in our business driven by favorable economic and semiconductor industry conditions. 
We are committed to continuing our investment in new and enhanced products, including development systems, and in our design and manufacturing process technologies. We believe these investments are significant factors in maintaining our competitive position. Our current research and development activities focus on the design of new microcontrollers, digital signal controllers, memory, analog and mixed-signal products, Flash-IP systems, development systems, software and application-specific software libraries. We are also developing new design and process technologies to achieve further cost reductions and performance improvements in our products.•actual or anticipated announcements of technical innovations or new products by us or our competitors.
