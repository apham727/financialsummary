The effective tax rate was 20.0% and 51.7% for the three months ended September 30, 2019 and 2018, respectively and 19.9% and (174.7)% for the nine months ended September 30, 2019 and 2018, respectively. The change in the effective tax rate for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2019 compared to the respective prior year periods was primarily due to the acquisition of DST during the nine months ended September 30, 2018 and the relative impact of permanent book to tax differences on reduced pre-tax book income in 2018 that occurred as a result. 
We have certain lease agreements with our unconsolidated real estate joint ventures. We recognized operating lease expense of $0.7 million and $2.1 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2019, respectively, related to these lease agreements. 
We have certain sublease agreements in place with 3rd parties to lease portions of our office space. In addition, we serve as a lessor in other lease agreements for real estate and storage facilities. Total gross sublease and other rental income recognized during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2019 were approximately $2.2 million and $6.9 million, respectively.  
Our total operating lease costs were $19.8 million and $59.5 million during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2019, respectively. Cash paid for amounts included in operating lease liabilities was $18.5 million and $54.9 million during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2019, respectively, and is included in operating cash flows. Total right-of-use assets obtained in exchange for operating lease liabilities was $22.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2019. Our weighted average remaining lease term and weighted average discount rates as of September 30, 2019 were 8.4 years and 5.0%, respectively. 
Stock options and SARs representing 9.5 and 11.5 million shares were outstanding for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2019, respectively, but were not included in the computation of diluted EPS because the effect of including them would be anti-dilutive. Stock options and SARs representing 4.4 and 5.2 million shares were outstanding for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2018, respectively, but were not included in the computation of diluted EPS because the effect of including them would be anti-dilutive.  
Deferred revenues primarily represent unrecognized fees billed or collected for maintenance and professional services. Deferred revenues are recognized as (or when) we perform under the contract. Deferred revenues are recorded on a net basis with contract assets at the contract level. Accordingly, as of September 30, 2019 and December 31, 2018, approximately $42.2 million and $32.4 million, respectively, of deferred revenue is presented net within contract assets arising from the same contracts. The amount of revenues recognized in the period that was included in the opening deferred revenues balance was $38.0 million and $184.4 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2019, respectively. The amount of revenues recognized in the period that was included in the opening deferred revenues balance was $33.1 million and $164.1 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2018, respectively. 
During the nine months ended September 30, 2019, the fair value of our non-marketable equity securities was adjusted upward by $0.5 million.  Nine Months Ended September 30, 2019 and 2018. Our revenues increased $1,119.3 million, or 48.5%, primarily due to our acquisitions, which partially included DST and CACEIS in the second quarter of 2018 and Eze and Intralinks in the fourth quarter of 2018, which, combined, contributed $1,092.8 million to the increase in revenues. Excluding the impact of acquisitions, revenues increased primarily due to an increase in revenues for institutional and investment management products, advisory and wealth management products and our fund administration services, partially offset by decreased revenues within the DST business and the unfavorable impact from foreign currency translation, which reduced revenues by $20.8 million. Software-enabled services revenues increased $1,031.0 million, or 55.3%, primarily due to the acquisitions, which contributed $1,051.7 million to the increase in revenues, as well as from a continued increase in demand for our fund administration services and services for advisory and wealth managers. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in software-enabled services revenues within the DST business and the unfavorable impact from foreign currency translation of $16.5 million. License, maintenance and related revenues increased $88.3 million, or 19.8%, primarily due to increased license revenues for institutional and investment management products and advisory and wealth management products, as well as the acquisitions, which contributed $41.1 million to the increase in revenues. The unfavorable impact from foreign currency translation was $4.3 million. 
Other (expense) income, net. We had other expense, net of $10.3 million and other income, net of $27.1 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2019, respectively. During the three months ended September 30, 2019, other expense, net included investment losses and dividend income of $10.1 million. The remaining portion of other expense, net consisted primarily of foreign currency transaction losses. During the nine months ended September 30, 2019, other income, net included investment gains and dividend income of $27.8 million. The remaining portion of other income, net consisted primarily of foreign currency transaction losses. We had other income, net of $13.7 million and $14.8 million for the three and nine months ended September, 30, 2018, respectively. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2018, other income, net included investment gains and dividend income of $12.1 million and $13.4 million, respectively. The remaining portion of other income, net consists primarily of foreign currency transaction gains and losses. 
Item 2.   
Three Months Ended September 30, 2019 and 2018. Our revenues increased $151.8 million, or 15.3%, primarily due to our acquisitions, which included Eze Software Group, LLC (“Eze”) and Intralinks Holdings, Inc. (“Intralinks”) in the fourth quarter of 2018, which, combined, contributed $147.8 million in revenues. Excluding the impact of acquisitions, revenues increased due to an increase in revenues for institutional and investment management products, advisory and wealth management products and our fund administration services. These increases were partially offset by decreased revenues within the DST business and the unfavorable impact from foreign currency translation, which reduced revenues by $9.0 million. Software-enabled services revenues increased $132.7 million, or 16.0%, primarily due to the acquisitions, which added revenues of $146.9 million, as well as from a continued increase in demand for our fund administration services and services for advisory and wealth managers. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in software-enabled services revenues within the DST business and the unfavorable impact from foreign currency translation of $7.9 million. License, maintenance and related revenues increased $19.1 million, or 11.6%, primarily due to increased license revenues for institutional and investment management products, as well as the acquisitions, which added revenues of $0.9 million. The unfavorable impact from foreign currency translation was $1.1 million. 
Client funds obligations include our transfer agency client balances invested overnight as well as our contractual obligations to remit funds to satisfy client pharmacy claim obligations and are recorded on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet when incurred, generally after a claim has been processed by us. Our contractual obligations to remit funds to satisfy client obligations are primarily sourced by funds held on behalf of clients. We had $1,045.7 million of client funds obligations at September 30, 2019. 
Net cash provided by operating activities was $755.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2019. Cash provided by operating activities primarily resulted from net income of $296.9 million adjusted for non-cash items of $556.5 million, partially offset by changes in our working capital accounts (excluding the effect of acquisitions) totaling $98.4 million. The changes in our working capital accounts were driven by a decrease in accrued expenses, an increase in contract assets and changes in income taxes prepaid and payable, partially offset by decreases in prepaid expenses and other assets, increase in deferred revenues, a decrease in accounts receivable and an increase in accounts payable. The decrease in accrued expenses was primarily due to the payment of annual employee bonuses in the first quarter of 2019. The increase in contract assets was primarily due to new term license deals. The decrease in accounts receivable was primarily due to a decrease in days’ sales outstanding. The decrease in prepaid expenses and other assets and the increase in accounts payable were primarily due to the timing of payments. The increase in deferred revenues is related to a multi-year $250.0 million license agreement signed in the third quarter of 2019 with an up-front payment of $48.0 million, which we received in the three months ended September 30, 2019 and an additional $202.0 million due in the three months ending December 31, 2019. We recognized $15.0 million related to this agreement in the three months ended September 30, 2019. The license revenue is expected to be recognized over approximately four years.  
Our cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash and cash equivalents, including amounts held on behalf of clients, were $1,273.0 million at September 30, 2018, an increase of $1,208.3 million from $64.7 million at December 31, 2017. The increase in cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash and cash equivalents is primarily due to proceeds received from our borrowings and common stock offering, the impact of restricted cash and cash equivalents held by DST as well as cash provided by operations and proceeds from stock option exercises. These increases were partially offset by cash used for acquisitions, repayments of debt, payment of dividends and capital expenditures.  
Investing activities used net cash of $40.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2019, primarily related to $51.1 million in capitalized software development costs and $48.0 million in capital expenditures, partially offset by proceeds from sales and maturities of investments of $46.1 million, the collection of other non-current receivables of $7.7 million, cash received of $3.2 million related to purchase price adjustments for prior acquisitions and $2.1 million in proceeds from unconsolidated affiliates. 
Interest expense, net. We had net interest expense of $98.5 million and $304.4 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2019, respectively, compared to $78.1 million and $173.7 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2018, respectively. The increase in interest expense, net for 2019 as compared to 2018 relates primarily to increased borrowings in connection with our acquisitions of DST, Eze and Intralinks and, to a lesser extent, higher average interest rates. These facilities are discussed further in “Liquidity and Capital Resources”. We derive service revenues from investment earnings related to cash balances maintained in bank accounts on which we are the agent for clients. The balances maintained in the bank accounts will fluctuate. For the nine months ended September 30, 2019, we had average daily cash balances of approximately $2.3 billion maintained in such accounts. We estimate that a 100 basis point change in the interest earnings rate would equal approximately $9.0 million of net income on an annual basis. The effect of changes in interest rates attributable to earnings derived from cash balances we hold for clients is offset by changes in interest rates on our variable debt.  Share repurchases were made pursuant to our Common Stock Repurchase Program authorized by our Board of Directors on August 8, 2019. The program allows for the purchase of up to $500 million of outstanding common stock in one or more transactions on the open market or in privately negotiated purchases.
