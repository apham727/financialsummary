The effective tax rate was 51.7% and 14.5% for the three months ended September 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively and (174.7)% and 16.5% for the nine months ended September 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively. The change in the effective tax rate for the three months ended September 30, 2018 and nine months ended September 30, 2018 was primarily due to the relative proportionate impact of permanent book to tax differences and discrete items on reduced pre-tax book income in 2018 as well as  
The Company recorded an increase to retained earnings of $65.8 million, or $47.9 million net of tax, as of January 1, 2018 due to the cumulative impact of adopting ASC 606, with the impact primarily related to the Company’s term license revenues. The impact to revenues for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2018 related to these adjustments was a decrease of $7.2 million and $28.6 million, respectively. 
The Company reported revenues of $3.7 million and $1,030.3 million from CACEIS and DST, respectively, from their respective acquisition dates through September 30, 2018. 
The Company primarily offers software-enabled outsourcing services in which the Company utilizes its own software to offer comprehensive fund administration services for alternative investment managers, including fund manager services, transfer agency services, funds-of-funds services, tax processing and accounting. The Company also uses its own software applications to provide healthcare organizations a variety of medical and pharmacy benefit solutions to satisfy their information processing, quality of care, cost management concerns and payment integrity programs. The Company’s healthcare solutions include claims adjudication, benefit management, care management, business intelligence and other ancillary services. The Company also offers subscription-based on-demand software applications that are managed and hosted at the Company’s facilities. The software-enabled services arrangements provide an alternative for clients who do not wish to install, run and maintain complicated financial software. Under these arrangements, the client does not have the right to take possession of the software, rather, the Company agrees to provide access to its applications, remote use of its equipment to process transactions, access to client’s data stored on its equipment, and connectivity between its environment and the client’s computing systems.  
The Company had $474.8 million of investments as of September 30, 2018 as compared to no investments as of December 31, 2017. The increase in investments was the result of acquiring the net assets of DST in the second quarter of 2018.  
The Company generates revenues in the form of software license fees and related maintenance and services fees. License fees include perpetual license fees and term license fees that differ mainly in the duration over which the customer benefits from the software. Maintenance and services primarily consist of fees for maintenance services (including support and unspecified upgrades and enhancements when and if they are available) and to a lesser extent professional services which focus on both deployment and training the Company’s customers to fully leverage the use of its products although the user can benefit from the software without the Company’s assistance.  
Stock options and SARs representing 4.4 and 5.2 million shares were outstanding for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2018, respectively, but were not included in the computation of diluted EPS because the effect of including them would be anti-dilutive. Stock options and SARs representing 0.6 and 10.7 million shares were outstanding for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2017, respectively, but were not included in the computation of diluted EPS because the effect of including them would be anti-dilutive.  
The Company does not account for significant financing components if the period between when the Company transfers the promised product or service to the client and when the client pays for that product or service will be one year or less.  
As of September 30, 2018, revenue of approximately $305.1 million is expected to be recognized from remaining performance obligations for license, maintenance and related revenues, of which $210.3 million is expected to be recognized over the next twelve months.  
The fair value of acquired accounts receivable balances for CACEIS and DST approximates the contractual amounts due from acquired customers, except for approximately $6.1 million of contractual amounts that are not expected to be collected as of the acquisition date and that were also reserved by CACEIS and DST. 
Public offering. In April 2018, the Company completed a public offering of its common stock. The offering included 30.3 million newly issued shares of common stock sold by the Company (including 3.9 million shares of common stock sold pursuant to the underwriters’ option to purchase additional shares) at an offering price to the public of $47.50 per share for which the Company received total net proceeds of approximately $1.4 billion.  Interest expense, net. We had net interest expense of $78.1 million and $173.7 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2018, respectively, compared to $26.3 million and $81.6 million for the three and nine months ended September 30,  
Acquisition of DST Systems, Inc. 
Three and Nine Months Ended September 30, 2018 and 2017. The increase in total operating expenses in 2018 was primarily due to our acquisitions, which added expenses of $121.5 million and $356.9 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2018, respectively. Included in these costs are severance charges of $1.4 million and $21.6 million in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2018, respectively, related to the elimination of redundant positions within the acquired businesses. The impact from foreign currency translation reduced costs by $0.8 million and increased costs by $1.7 million for the three and nine month periods, respectively. Total operating expenses in both periods also increased due to higher personnel-related costs, higher legal-related expenses, and higher stock-based compensation. 
Investing activities used net cash of $36.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2017, primarily related to $29.8 million in capital expenditures and $8.1 million in capitalized software development costs partially offset by cash received of $1.8 million related to purchase price adjustments for prior acquisitions. 
Investing activities used net cash of $4,669.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2018, primarily related to cash paid for business acquisitions (net of cash acquired) of $4,633.6 million, $28.5 million in capital expenditures, $29.3 million in capitalized software development costs and $15.4 million in investments in securities, partially offset by proceeds from sales and maturities of investments of $28.1 million and proceeds from the sale of property and equipment of $9.6 million. 
Three Months Ended September 30, 2018 and 2017. Our revenues increased $574.2 million, or 137.3%, primarily due to our acquisitions, which included CommonWealth Fund Services Ltd. (“CommonWealth”) in the fourth quarter of 2017 and DST and CACEIS North America (“CACEIS”) in the second quarter of 2018 which, combined, contributed $563.2 million in revenues. Additionally, revenues increased due to increased demand for our software-enabled services. The increase in revenues was partially offset by the unfavorable impact from foreign currency translation, which reduced revenue by $2.1 million. Software-enabled services revenues increased $545.2 million, or 193.3%, primarily due to the acquisitions, which added revenues of $534.7 million, as well as from a continued increase in demand for our fund administration services and services for advisory and wealth managers. The unfavorable impact from foreign currency translation was $0.6 million. License, maintenance and related revenues increased $29.0  
2017, respectively. The increase in interest expense, net for the three and nine month periods reflects incremental borrowings in connection with our acquisition of DST and, to a lesser extent, higher average interest rates. These increases were partially offset by the impact of repayments of the Prior Credit Agreement.  These facilities are discussed further in “Liquidity and Capital Resources”. Item 6.
