Depreciation expense for the three and six months ended June 30, 2019 was $31.1 million and $63.1 million, respectively. Depreciation expense for the three and six months ended June 30, 2018 was $28.5 million and $35.3 million, respectively. 
The effective tax rate was 22.0% and (61.0)% for the three months ended June 30, 2019 and 2018, respectively and 19.9% and (87.7)% for the six months ended June 30, 2019 and 2018, respectively. The change in the effective tax rate for the three and six months ended June 30, 2019 compared to the respective prior year periods was primarily due to the acquisition of DST during the three months ended June 30, 2018 and the relative impact of permanent book to tax differences on reduced pre-tax book income in 2018 that occurred as a result. 
We have certain lease agreements with our unconsolidated real estate joint ventures. We recognized operating lease expense of $0.7 million and $1.4 million for the three and six months ended June 30, 2019, respectively, related to these lease agreements. 
We have certain sublease agreements in place with 3rd parties to lease portions of our office space. In addition, we serve as a lessor in other lease agreements for real estate and storage facilities. Total gross sublease and other rental income recognized during the three and six months ended June 30, 2019 were approximately $2.2 million and $4.7 million, respectively.  
Stock options and SARs representing 4.1 and 4.4 million shares were outstanding for the three and six months ended June 30, 2019, respectively, but were not included in the computation of diluted EPS because the effect of including them would be anti-dilutive. No dilutive securities have been included in the diluted EPS calculation for the three and six months ended June 30, 2018 due to our reported net loss for the three and six months then ended. 
Our total operating lease costs were $19.8 million and $39.7 million during the three and six months ended June 30, 2019, respectively. Cash paid for amounts included in operating lease liabilities was $18.6 million and $36.4 million during the three and six months ended June 30, 2019, respectively, and is included in operating cash flows. Our weighted average remaining lease term and weighted average discount rates as of June 30, 2019 were 8.4 years and 5.0%, respectively. 
During the six months ended June 30, 2019, the fair value of our non-marketable equity securities was adjusted upward by $0.5 million.  
parties jointly submitted 315 of the demands for arbitration to the American Arbitration Association. The remaining demands for arbitration have not yet been submitted. 
Deferred revenues primarily represent unrecognized fees billed or collected for maintenance and professional services. Deferred revenues are recognized as (or when) we perform under the contract. Deferred revenues are recorded on a net basis with contract assets at the contract level. Accordingly, as of June 30, 2019 and December 31, 2018, approximately $39.9 million and $32.4 million, respectively, of deferred revenue is presented net within contract assets arising from the same contracts. The amount of revenues recognized in the period that was included in the opening deferred revenues balance was $59.6 million and $146.4 million for the three and six months ended June 30, 2019, respectively. The amount of revenues recognized in the period that was included in the opening deferred revenues balance was $54.4 million and $131.0 million for the three and six months ended June 30, 2018, respectively. Interest expense, net. We had net interest expense of $104.3 million and $205.9 million for the three and six months ended June 30, 2019, respectively, compared to $70.2 million and $95.6 million for the three and six months ended June 30, 2018, respectively. The increase in interest expense, net for 2019 as compared to 2018 relates primarily to increased borrowings in connection with our acquisitions of DST, Eze and Intralinks and, to a lesser extent, higher average interest rates. These facilities are discussed further in “Liquidity and Capital Resources”. 
Equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates, net. We had equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates, net of $2.2 million for the three and six months ended June 30, 2019, respectively, compared to $1.1 million for the three and six months ended June 30, 2018, respectively. This is primarily related to our joint venture International Financial Data Services L.P. (“IFDS L.P.”) and represents our proportionate share of IFDS L.P.’s net income, offset by amortization of basis differences. 
Six Months Ended June 30, 2019 and 2018. Our revenues increased $967.5 million, or 73.4%, primarily due to our acquisitions, which partially included DST and CACEIS in the second quarter of 2018 and Eze and Intralinks in the fourth quarter of 2018, which, combined, contributed $945.0 million in revenues. Excluding the impact of acquisitions, revenues increased primarily due to an increase in term license revenues and increased demand for our fund administration services, with such increases partially offset by a decrease in software-enabled services revenues within the DST business. The increase in revenues was partially offset by the unfavorable impact from foreign currency translation, which reduced revenues by $11.8 million. Software-enabled services revenues increased $898.3 million, or 86.7%, primarily due to the acquisitions, which added revenues of $904.8 million, as well as from a continued increase in demand for our fund administration services and services for advisory and wealth managers. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in software-enabled services revenues within the DST business. The unfavorable impact from foreign currency translation was $8.6 million. License, maintenance and related revenues increased $69.2 million, or 24.6%, primarily due to increased term license revenues as well as the acquisitions, which added revenues of $40.2 million. The unfavorable impact from foreign currency translation was $3.3 million. 
Three Months Ended June 30, 2019 and 2018. Our revenues increased $252.2 million, or 28.2%, primarily due to our acquisitions, which partially included DST Systems, Inc. (“DST”) and CACEIS North America (“CACEIS”) in the second quarter of 2018 and Eze Software Group, LLC (“Eze”) and Intralinks Holdings, Inc. (“Intralinks”) in the fourth quarter of 2018, which, combined, contributed $241.6 million in revenues. Excluding the impact of acquisitions, revenues increased due to increased term license revenues and increased demand for our fund administration services, with such increases partially offset by a decrease in software-enabled services revenues within the DST business. The increase in revenues was partially offset by the unfavorable impact from foreign currency translation, which reduced revenues by $9.2 million. Software-enabled services revenues increased $221.1 million, or 29.8%, primarily due to the acquisitions, which added revenues of $236.2 million, as well as from a continued increase in demand for our fund administration services and services for advisory and wealth managers. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in software-enabled services revenues within the DST business. The unfavorable impact from foreign currency translation was $7.3 million. License, maintenance and related revenues increased $31.1 million, or 20.2%, primarily due to increased term license revenues as well as the acquisitions, which added revenues of $5.4 million. The unfavorable impact from foreign currency translation was $1.8 million. 
Investing activities used net cash of $4,648.8 million for the six months ended June 30, 2018, primarily related to cash paid for business acquisitions (net of cash acquired) of $4,622.3 million, $22.4 million in capital expenditures, $16.5 million in capitalized software development costs and $4.3 million in investments in securities, partially offset by proceeds from sales and maturities of investments of $11.7 million and proceeds from the sale of property and equipment of $4.7 million. 
Net cash provided by operating activities was $416.6 million for the six months ended June 30, 2019. Cash provided by operating activities primarily resulted from net income of $201.9 million adjusted for non-cash items of $341.2 million, partially offset by changes in our working capital accounts (excluding the effect of acquisitions) totaling $126.5 million. The changes in our working capital accounts were driven by decreases in accrued expenses, increases in contract assets, changes in income taxes prepaid and payable and decreases in deferred revenue, partially offset by decreases in prepaid expenses and other assets, decreases in accounts receivable and increases in accounts payable. The decrease in accrued expenses was primarily due to the payment of annual employee bonuses in the first quarter of 2019. The increase in contract assets was primarily due to new term license deals. The decrease in accounts receivable was primarily due to a decrease in days’ sales outstanding. The decrease in prepaid expenses and other assets and the increase in accounts payable were primarily due to the timing of payments.  
Other income, net. We had other income, net of $33.9 million and $37.4 million for the three and six months ended June 30, 2019, respectively. During the three and six months ended June 30, 2019, other income, net included investment gains of $29.5 million and $36.9 million, respectively. The remaining portion of other income, net consisted primarily of foreign currency transaction gains and losses. We had other income, net of $0.6 million and $1.1 million for the three and six months ended June, 30, 2018, respectively. During the three and six months ended June 30, 2018, other income, net consisted primarily of net investment gains and dividend income on our investments offset by foreign currency transaction losses. 
Investing activities used net cash of $26.7 million for the six months ended June 30, 2019, primarily related to $32.5 million in capitalized software development costs and $27.0 million in capital expenditures, partially offset by proceeds from sales and maturities of investments of $22.5 million, the collection of other non-current receivables of $5.2 million, cash received of $3.2 million related to purchase price adjustments for prior acquisitions and $2.1 million in proceeds from unconsolidated affiliates. At June 30, 2019, we had total variable interest rate debt of approximately $5.9 billion. As of June 30, 2019, a 1% increase in interest rates would result in an increase in interest expense of approximately $59.1 million per year. Item 6.
