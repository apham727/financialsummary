The change in the effective tax rate for the three months ended March 31, 2019 was primarily due to the increased recognition of windfall tax benefits from stock awards in the current year, partially offset by a proportionate change in the composition of income before income taxes from foreign and domestic tax jurisdictions.

Stock options and SARs representing 5.7 and 0.2 million shares were outstanding for the three months ended March 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively, but were not included in the computation of diluted EPS because the effect of including them would be anti-dilutive.

Deferred revenues primarily represent unrecognized fees billed or collected for maintenance and professional services. Deferred revenues are recognized as (or when) we perform under the contract. Deferred revenues are recorded on a net basis with contract assets at the contract level. Accordingly, as of March 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018, approximately $37.5 million and $32.4 million, respectively, of deferred revenue is presented net within contract assets arising from the same contracts.

Interest expense, net. We had net interest expense of $101.6 million in 2019 compared to $25.3 million in 2018. The increase in interest expense, net for 2019 as compared to 2018 relates primarily to increased borrowings in connection with our acquisitions of DST, Eze and Intralinks and, to a lesser extent, higher average interest rates. These facilities are discussed further in “Liquidity and Capital Resources”. 
Three Months Ended March 31, 2019 and 2018. Our revenues increased $715.3 million, or 169.5%, primarily due to our acquisitions, which included DST Systems, Inc. (“DST”) and CACEIS North America (“CACEIS”) in the second quarter of 2018 and Eze Software Group, LLC (“Eze”) and Intralinks Holdings, Inc. (“Intralinks”) in the fourth quarter of 2018, which, combined, contributed $703.4 million in revenues. Additionally, revenues increased due to increased demand for our software-enabled services. The increase in revenues was partially offset by the unfavorable impact from foreign currency translation, which reduced revenues by $2.7 million. Software-enabled services revenues increased $677.2 million, or 229.7%, primarily due to the acquisitions, which added revenues of $668.7 million, as well as from a continued increase in demand for our fund administration services and services for advisory and wealth managers. The unfavorable impact from foreign currency translation was $1.2 million. License, maintenance and related revenues increased $38.1 million, or 30.0%, primarily due to the acquisitions, which added revenues of $34.8 million.

Net cash provided by operating activities was $137.4 million for the three months ended March 31, 2019. Cash provided by operating activities primarily resulted from net income of $80.8 million adjusted for non-cash items of $193.4 million, partially offset by changes in our working capital accounts (excluding the effect of acquisitions) totaling $136.8 million. The changes in our working capital accounts were driven by decreases in accrued expenses, changes in income taxes prepaid and payable and increases in accounts receivable, partially offset by decreases in contract assets and prepaid expenses and other assets, as well as increases in deferred revenue and accounts payable. The decrease in accrued expenses was primarily due to the payment of annual employee bonuses in the three months ended March 31, 2019. The increase in accounts receivable was primarily due to a slight increase in days’ sales outstanding as well as the billing of receivables for annual maintenance invoices that are typically billed in the first quarter of each year. The decrease in prepaid expenses and other assets and the increase in accounts payable was primarily due to the timing of payments.  
Net cash provided by operating activities was $69.9 million for the three months ended March 31, 2018. Cash provided by operating activities primarily resulted from net income of $51.3 million adjusted for non-cash items of $64.3 million, partially offset by changes in our working capital accounts (excluding the effect of acquisitions) totaling $45.7 million. The changes in our working capital accounts were driven by decreases in accrued expenses, accounts payable and deferred revenue and an increase in accounts receivable, partially offset by changes in contract assets and income taxes prepaid and payable. The decrease in accrued expenses was primarily due to the payment of annual employee bonuses in the first quarter of 2018. The decrease in accounts payable was primarily due to the timing of payments. The decrease in deferred revenue and change in contract assets was primarily due to the adoption of ASC 606. The increase in accounts receivable was primarily due to an increase in days’ sales outstanding related to receivables for annual maintenance invoices that are typically billed in the first quarter of each year. 
Financing activities used net cash of $48.8 million for the three months ended March 31, 2018, representing net repayments of debt totaling $61.3 million, $14.5 million in quarterly dividends paid and $2.1 million in withholding taxes paid related to equity award net share settlements, partially offset by proceeds of $29.1 million from stock option exercises. We derive service revenues from investment earnings related to cash balances maintained in bank accounts on which we are the agent for clients. The balances maintained in the bank accounts will fluctuate. For the three months ended March 31, 2019, we had average daily cash balances of approximately $2.6 billion maintained in such accounts.
