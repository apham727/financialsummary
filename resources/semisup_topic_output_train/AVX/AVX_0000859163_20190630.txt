Net cash provided by operating activities was $32.1 million in the three month period ended June 30, 2019 compared to $97.6 million of cash provided by operating activities in the three month period ended June 30, 2018. 
Selling, general and administrative expenses in the three month period ended June 30, 2019 were $41.9 million, or 10.4% of net sales, compared to $40.3 million, or 8.9% of net sales, in the three month period ended June 30, 2018. When compared to the same quarter last year, the overall increase in these expenses is primarily due to higher legal fees partially offset by lower selling expenses as a result of the lower sales. 
Overall sales percentages decreased in the Asian and European regions as a result of the weaker Chinese economy and weaker automotive markets while sales increased in our American region compared to the same three-month period last year. Sales in the Asian, American, and European markets represented 29%, 29% and 42% of total sales, respectively, for the three month period ended June 30, 2019. This compares to 31%, 25% and 44% of total sales for the Asian, American, and European regions in the same period last year, respectively. 
As a result of the factors discussed above, net income for the three month period ended June 30, 2019 was $54.7 million compared to net income of $56.0 million for the same three month period last year. 
Our net income for the three months ended June 30, 2019 was $54.7 million, or $0.32 per share, compared to net income of $56.0 million, or $0.33 per share, for the three months ended June 30, 2018. 
Electronic Components sales decreased $41.7 million, or 13.1% to $277.5 million in the three month period ended June 30, 2019 compared to sales of $319.2 million during the same period last year driven by unfavorable global macro-economic conditions partially offset by increased electronic content in automobiles, global defense spending, and technological advances across a broad range of IoT products. The increase in Ceramic Components is primarily due to higher demand and a more favorable pricing environment during the quarter ended June 30, 2019 compared to the same quarter last year. Tantalum Components have declined during the quarter ended June 30, 2019 compared to the same period last year as a result of lower demand, primarily in Asia, resulting from the decline in the Chinese economy in addition to higher inventory levels in the sales channel in all regions, particularly with our distribution customers. The decline in Advanced Components during the quarter ended June 30, 2019 compared to the same quarter last year has been impacted by approximately $17 million of sales for Kyocera product which is no longer sold by AVX in addition to a slower mobile phone market. 
Interconnect, Sensing and Control Devices product sales decreased $10.6 million to $124.3 million in the three month period ended June 30, 2019 compared to $134.9 million during the same period last year. This decrease is primarily attributable to a decrease of automotive manufacturing globally. 
Income from operations was $58.7 million in the three month period ended June 30, 2019 compared to $68.0 million in the three month period ended June 30, 2018. This decrease was a result of the factors described above. 
Our sales to independent electronic distributor customers represented 38% of total sales for the three month period ended June 30, 2019, compared to 40% for the three month period ended June 30, 2018. Overall, distributor sales activity decreased when compared to the same period last year as inventory remains higher than normal within the distribution channel resulting from the slower global economy and shortened lead times for certain products making distributors reluctant to take on additional inventory. Our sales to distributor customers involve specific ship-and-debit and stock rotation programs for which sales allowances are recorded as reductions in sales. Such allowance charges were $5.3 million, or 3.5% of gross sales to distributor customers for the three month period ended June 30, 2019, and $6.4 million, or 3.5% of gross sales to distributor customers, for the three month period ended June 30, 2018. Applications under such programs for the three month periods ended June 30, 2019 and 2018 were approximately $5.1 million and $6.2 million, respectively. 
Gross profit in the three month period ended June 30, 2019 was $100.6 million, compared to a gross profit of $108.3 million in the three month period ended June 30, 2018. This overall decrease in dollars is primarily attributable to lower sales partially offset by strong margins. Gross profit as a percentage of sales for the three month period ended June 30, 2019 was 25.1% compared to 23.9% for the three month period ended June 30, 2018. This increase in gross profit as a percentage of sales is reflective of our continued focus on the sale of value-added components with better margin opportunities, increased operational efficiencies, and an improved pricing environment in the global marketplace when compared to the same quarter last year. Costs due to currency movement were favorably impacted by $8.0 million when compared to the same period last year. 
Net sales in the three month period ended June 30, 2019 decreased $52.3 million or 11.5%, to $401.8 million compared to $454.1 million in the three month period ended June 30, 2018. The decrease in revenue was attributable to lower volumes resulting from weaker global market conditions reflecting a slowdown in the Asian markets resulting from a weaker Chinese economy due to tariffs and other economic issues in addition to reduced automotive manufacturing across all regions. Customers remained cautious with higher than normal inventory levels in the sales channel, particularly at our distribution customers, contributing to lower overall demand, primarily in the automotive, cellular, and consumer markets. The market demand remains strong in the aerospace, defense, and medical markets. Overall demand for our products is being driven by the power of electronics to enhance the user experience in automotive, wearables, smartphones, drones, solid state drives, personal and industrial robots, virtual reality devices, smart home control and security devices enabled through the internet within a broad category called IoT, or Internet of Things. Sales were unfavorably impacted by approximately $8.7 million as a result of currency movement due to the strengthening of the U.S. Dollar as compared to the Japanese Yen and Euro when compared to the same period last year. 
Our customers consist of multi-national original equipment manufacturers, or OEMs, independent electronic component distributors, and electronic manufacturing service providers, or EMSs. We market our products through our own direct sales force and independent manufacturers’ representatives, based upon market characteristics and demands. We coordinate our sales, marketing, and manufacturing organizations by strategic customer account and globally by region. 
The provision for income tax for the three month period ended June 30, 2019 was $8.5 million compared to $14.8 million for the three month period ended June 30, 2018. Our effective tax rate for the quarter ended June 30, 2019 was approximately 13%. The decrease in the effective tax rate is due to a discrete tax benefits occurring during the quarter. This benefit is principally due to an increase in foreign tax credits on foreign withholding obligations. Excluding these adjustments, the effective tax rate would be approximately 21% for the quarter ended June 30, 2019. 
Purchases of property and equipment were $34.4 million in the three month period ended June 30, 2019 and $38.0 million in the three month period ended June 30, 2018. Expenditures in the current quarter were primarily made in connection with strategic building expansion and equipment purchase activities in our Fountain Inn, South Carolina facilities and our plants in El Salvador and Malaysia. We expect to continue making strategic capital investments in our Electronic Component and Interconnect, Sensing and Control Devices product lines and estimate that we will incur capital expenditures of approximately $100 million in fiscal 2020. The actual amount of capital expenditures will depend upon the outlook for end-market demand and timing of capital projects.
