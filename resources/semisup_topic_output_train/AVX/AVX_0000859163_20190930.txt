Gross profit in the three month period ended September 30, 2019 was $79.5 million, compared to a gross profit of $126.5 million in the three month period ended September 30, 2018. Gross profit as a percentage of sales for the three month period ended September 30, 2019 was 21.1% compared to 27.7% for the three month period ended September 30, 2018. This overall decrease in dollars is primarily the result of weaker demand for our products from the slower global economy when compared to the same quarter last year. In addition, margin as a percentage of sales declined due to a lower margin mix and pricing pressure on commercial ceramic and tantalum components. Costs due to currency movement were favorably impacted by $11.4 million when compared to the same period last year.

Costs due to currency movement were favorably impacted by $19.4 million when compared to the same period last year. 
Our sales to independent electronic distributor customers represented 36% of total sales for the three month period ended September 30, 2019, compared to 43% for the three month period ended September 30, 2018. Overall, distributor sales activity decreased when compared to the same period last year as inventory remains higher than normal within the distribution channel resulting from the slower global economy and shortened lead times for certain products making distributors reluctant to take on additional inventory particularly in the Americas and Europe. Our sales to distributor customers involve specific ship-and-debit and stock rotation programs for which sales allowances are recorded as reductions in sales. Such allowance charges were $5.3 million, or 3.9% of gross sales to distributor customers for the three month period ended September 30, 2019, and $7.1 million, or 3.7% of gross sales to distributor customers, for the three month period ended September 30, 2018. Applications under such programs for the three month periods ended September 30, 2019 and 2018 were approximately $4.9 million and $6.7 million, respectively. 
Interconnect, Sensing and Control Devices product sales decreased $3.5 million to $120.6 million in the three month period ended September 30, 2019 compared to $124.1 million during the same period last year. This decrease is primarily attributable to a decrease of automotive manufacturing across all regions in addition to unfavorable currency movement due to the stronger U.S. Dollar compared to the Euro. 
Our net income for the three months ended September 30, 2019 was $33.5 million, or $0.20 per share, compared to net income of $72.1 million, or $0.43 per share, for the three months ended September 30, 2018.
