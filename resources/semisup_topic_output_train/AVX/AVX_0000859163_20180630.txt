Net cash provided by operating activities was $97.6 million in the three month period ended June 30, 2018 compared to $63.5 million of cash provided by operating activities in the three month period ended June 30, 2017. 
As a result of the factors discussed above, net income for the three month period ended June 30, 2018 was $56.0 million compared to net income of $31.5 million for the same three month period last year. 
Our net income for the three months ended June 30, 2018 was $56.0 million, or $0.33 per share, compared to net income of $31.5 million, or $0.19 per share, for the three months ended June 30, 2017. 
Income from operations was $68.0 million in the three month period ended June 30, 2018 compared to $42.4 million in the three month period ended June 30, 2017. This increase was a result of the factors described above. 
Electronic Components sales increased $17.5 million, or 5.8% to $319.2 million in the three month period ended June 30, 2018 compared to sales of $301.7 million during the same period last year driven by favorable global macro-economic conditions, increased electronic content in automobiles, increased global defense spending, and technological advances across a broad range of IoT products. Sales increases for our Ceramic and Tantalum Components were partially offset by sales decreases in our Advanced Component group primarily due to the previously announced decision by Kyocera to market and sell globally using Kyocera’s salesforce rather than Kyocera continuing to have AVX resell such products globally. Kyocera Resale sales were $17.2 million for the three month period ended June 30, 2018 compared to $76.7 million for the three month period ended June 30, 2017. Sales in our Advanced Component group were favorably impacted by $31.9 million attributable to our acquisition of Ethertronics when compared to the same quarter last year.  
Gross profit in the three month period ended June 30, 2018 was $108.3 million, compared to a gross profit of $73.8 million in the three month period ended June 30, 2017. This overall increase in dollars is primarily attributable to higher sales in addition to improved margins. Gross profit as a percentage of sales for the three month period ended June 30, 2018 was 23.9% compared to 22.3% for the three month period ended June 30, 2017. This increase in gross profit as a percentage of sales is reflective of our continued focus on the sale of value added components with better margin opportunities, increased operational efficiencies, and an improved pricing environment in the global marketplace. Costs due to currency movement were unfavorably impacted by $4.4 million when compared to the same period last year. 
On January 31, 2018, AVX acquired Ethertronics, Inc. ("Ethertronics") for $128,242 net of cash and debt acquired. The Ethertronics business is now named AVX Antenna and is consolidated with our Electronic Components segment. The purchase of Ethertronics expands AVX’s extensive electronic product offering into the antenna technology market and will provide new and exciting growth opportunities for AVX going forward. 
Our customers consist of multi-national original equipment manufacturers, or OEMs, independent electronic component distributors, and electronic manufacturing service providers, or EMSs. We market our products through our own direct sales force and independent manufacturers’ representatives, based upon market characteristics and demands. We coordinate our sales, marketing, and manufacturing organizations by strategic customer account and globally by region. 
Purchases of property and equipment were $38.0 million in the three month period ended June 30, 2018 and $21.8 million in the three month period ended June 30, 2017. Expenditures in the current quarter were primarily made in connection with strategic building expansion and equipment purchase activities in our Fountain Inn, South Carolina facilities and our plants in El Salvador, and Malaysia. We expect to continue making strategic capital investments in our Electronic Component and Interconnect, Sensing and Control Devices product lines and estimate that we will incur capital expenditures of approximately $110 million in fiscal 2019. The actual amount of capital expenditures will depend upon the outlook for end-market demand and timing of capital projects. 
We evaluate gross versus net presentation on revenues from products purchased and resold in accordance with the revenue recognition criteria outlined in ASC 606. Based on the evaluation of our resale arrangements with Kyocera, including consideration of the primary indicators set forth in ASC 606, we record revenue related to products purchased and resold on a gross basis. 
The following geographic data is based upon net sales generated by operations located within particular geographic areas. Substantially all of the sales in the Americas region were generated in the United States. 
We evaluate performance of our segments based upon sales and operating profit. There are no intersegment revenues. We allocate the costs of shared resources between segments based on each segment’s usage of the shared resources. Cash, accounts receivable, investments in securities, and certain other assets, which are centrally managed, are not readily allocable to operating segments. 
During the three month periods ended March 31, 2018 and June 30, 2018, there have been no transfers of assets or liabilities between levels within the fair value hierarchy. 
The results of operations for AVX Antenna since the acquisition date are included in the accompanying consolidated statement of operations. We recorded approximately $64,800 of identifiable intangible assets and $75,625 of goodwill. The acquired intangible assets relate to the Ethertronics trade name, existing technology and customer relationships which are being amortized over ten, ten, and thirteen years, respectively. We recognized revenue of $31,941 from AVX Antenna in the three month period ended June 30, 2018. 
On April 25, 2013, AVX was named as a defendant in a patent infringement case filed in the United States District Court for the District of Delaware captioned Greatbatch, Inc. v. AVX Corporation. This case alleged that certain AVX products infringe on one or more of six Greatbatch patents. On January 26, 2016, the jury returned a verdict in favor of the plaintiff in the first phase of a segmented trial and a mixed verdict in the second phase of a segmented trial, and found damages to Greatbatch in the amount of $37,500, which was recorded in fiscal 2016. That verdict was later vacated by the court on March 30, 2018. The amount of damages will be subject to further legal proceedings including a potential trial on damages, which we expect to occur in fiscal 2019. AVX is continuing to litigate the case. 
We had total reserves of approximately $18,618 and $18,750 at March 31, 2018 and June 30, 2018, respectively, related to various environmental matters and sites, including those discussed above. These reserves are classified in the Consolidated Balance Sheets as $3,329 and $3,461 in accrued expenses at March 31, 2018 and June 30, 2018, respectively, and $15,289 in other non-current liabilities at both March 31, 2018 and June 30, 2018. The amounts recorded for identified environmental liabilities are based on estimates. Periodically, we review amounts recorded and adjust them to reflect additional legal and technical information that becomes available. Uncertainties about the status of laws, regulations, regulatory actions, technology, and information related to individual sites make it difficult to develop an estimate of the reasonably possible aggregate environmental remediation exposure. Accordingly, these costs could differ from our current estimates.
