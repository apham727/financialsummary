As a result of the factors discussed above, net loss for the three month period ended December 31, 2017 was $93.2 million compared to net income of $35.5 million for the same three month period last year. 
As a result of the factors discussed above, net loss for the nine month period ended December 31, 2017 was $26.9 million compared to net income of $91.9 million for the same nine month period last year. 
Our sales to independent electronic distributor customers represented 45.0% of total sales for the nine month period ended December 31, 2017, compared to 45.1% for the nine month period ended December 31, 2016. Overall, distributor sales activity increased when compared to the same nine month period last year as distributors increased order activity during the past several quarters in response to good end-market demand and extended product delivery lead times during the nine month period ended December 31, 2017. Our sales to distributor customers involve specific ship-and-debit and stock rotation programs for which sales allowances are recorded as reductions in sales. Such allowance charges were $22.6 million, or 4.5% of gross sales to distributor customers, for the nine month period ended December 31, 2017, and $19.6 million, or 4.4% of gross sales to distributor customers, for the nine month period ended December 31, 2016. Applications under such programs for the nine month period ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 were approximately $21.9 million and $16.4 million, respectively. 
Income from operations was $45.3 million in the three month period ended December 31, 2017 compared to $50.9 million in the three month period ended December 31, 2016. This decrease was a result of the factors described above. 
Passive Components sales decreased $1.5 million, or 0.6% to $229.5 million in the three month period ended December 31, 2017 compared to sales of $231.0 million during the same period last year. Sales increases for our Ceramic and Tantalum component groups were due to increased demand for our products across most markets resulting from favorable global market conditions and increased demand for our electronic component products resulting from technological advances across a broad range of IoT products. These increases were offset by sales decreases in our Advanced component group primarily due to a reduction in sales of certain advanced ceramic capacitors which were the subject of intellectual property litigation whereby our sales of those products generally ended in March of 2017. 
Passive Components sales increased $33.3 million, or 5.1% to $689.4 million in the nine month period ended December 31, 2017 compared to sales of $656.1 million during the same nine month period last year. The increase in Passive Components product sales was driven by increased volume in our Ceramic and Tantalum Components across most markets resulting from favorable global market conditions and increased demand for our electronic component products resulting from technological advances across a broad range of IoT products. These increases were offset by sales decreases in our Advanced component group primarily due to a reduction in sales of certain advanced ceramic capacitors which were the subject of intellectual property litigation whereby our sales of those products ended in March of 2017. 
Our net loss for the three months ended December 31, 2017 was $93.2 million, or $0.55 per share, compared to net income of $35.5 million, or $0.21 per share, for the three months ended December 31, 2016. 
Income from operations was $132.5 million in the nine month period ended December 31, 2017 compared to $118.5 million in the nine month period ended December 31, 2016. This increase was a result of the factors described above. 
Our net loss for the nine months ended December 31, 2017 was $26.9 million, or $0.16 per share, compared to net income of $91.9 million, or $0.55 per share, for the nine months ended December 31, 2016. 
Other income, net was $8.4 million for the nine month period ended December 31, 2017 compared to $9.2 million for the same nine month period last year. This decrease was primarily due to higher foreign exchange gains resulting from currency fluctuations and a gain on the sale of an idle facility of $1.6 million for the nine month period ended December 31, 2016, partially offset by interest of $2.3 million related to refunded income taxes in the prior quarter ended September 30, 2017. 
KDP and KCD Resale sales decreased $5.7 million, or 7.8%, to $68.2 million in the three month period ended December 31, 2017 compared to $73.9 million during the same period last year. This decrease is primarily a result of the gradual phase out of KDP and KCD Resale products resulting from the previously announced decision by Kyocera to market its manufactured passive component and interconnect products globally using Kyocera’s sales force rather than continuing to have AVX resell such products starting January 1, 2018. 
Our customers are multi-national original equipment manufacturers, or OEMs, independent electronic component distributors, and electronic manufacturing service providers, or EMSs. We market our products through our own direct sales force and independent manufacturers’ representatives, based upon market characteristics and demands. We coordinate our sales, marketing, and manufacturing organizations by strategic customer account and globally by region. 
AVX notified Kyocera pursuant to the Products Supply and Distribution Agreement in February 2017 of its intent, effective April 1, 2018, to market its manufactured products in Japan using AVX’s sales force rather than continuing to have Kyocera resell such products in this territory. AVX will pay commissions to Kyocera on sales by AVX, in the applicable territory, of products designed into customer applications by Kyocera prior to April 1, 2018 of 2.0% in fiscal year 2019, 1.5% in fiscal year 2020, and 1.0% in fiscal year 2021. Sales of AVX resale products by Kyocera were $6.3 million and $16.4 million for the three and nine month periods ended December 31, 2017. 
KDP and KCD Resale sales decreased $4.8 million, or 2.2%, to $212.0 million in the nine month period ended December 31, 2017 compared to $216.8 million during the same period last year. This decrease is primarily a result of the gradual phase out of KDP and KCD Resale products resulting from the previously announced decision by Kyocera to market its manufactured passive component and interconnect products globally using Kyocera’s sales force rather than continuing to have AVX resell such products starting January 1, 2018. 
Purchases of property and equipment were $65.2 million in the nine month period ended December 31, 2017 and $45.6 million in the nine month period ended December 31, 2016. Expenditures in the current quarter were primarily made in connection with strategic building expansion and equipment purchase activities in our Fountain Inn, South Carolina facilities and our plants in the Czech Republic, Germany, El Salvador, and Malaysia. We expect to incur total capital expenditures of approximately $80.0 million in fiscal 2018. The actual amount of capital expenditures will depend upon the outlook for end-market demand and timing of capital projects. 
Kyocera notified AVX pursuant to the Products Supply and Distribution Agreement in December 2016 of its intent, effective January 1, 2018, to market its manufactured passive component and interconnect products globally using Kyocera’s sales force rather than continuing to have AVX resell such products in the Americas, Europe and Asia. Kyocera will pay commissions to AVX on sales by Kyocera, in the applicable territories, of products designed into customer applications by AVX prior to January 1, 2018 of 2.0% in calendar year 2018, 1.5% in calendar year 2019, and 1.0% in calendar year 2020.
