This decrease is primarily a result of the gradual phase out of KDP and KCD Resale products resulting from the previously announced decision by Kyocera to market its manufactured passive component and interconnect products globally using Kyocera’s sales force rather than continuing to have AVX resell such products starting January 1, 2018.
This rate decrease resulted in an estimated net decrease in AVX’s French net deferred tax assets and liabilities of $14.3 million, which is also reflected as a discrete charge in this quarter’s tax provision.
We did not have any similar charges in the nine month period ended December 31, 2017.
