The segment net sales reported above represent sales to external customers. Segment operating income, which is used in management’s evaluation of segment performance, represents net sales less all operating expenses. Identifiable assets are those assets used by each segment in its operations. 
Installation is a separate performance obligation, except for our digital signage products. For digital signage products, installation is not a separate performance obligation as the product and installation is the combined item promised in digital signage contracts. The Company is not always responsible for installation of products it sells and has no post-installation responsibilities other than standard warranties.

The Company’s contracts with customers have an expected duration of one year or less, as such we apply the practical expedient to expense sales commissions as incurred, and have omitted disclosures on the amount of remaining performance obligations.    Net inventories of $49.6 million at September 30, 2018 decreased $1.4 million from $51.0 million at June 30, 2018. The decrease of $1.4 million is the result of a decrease in gross inventory of $0.9 million and an increase in obsolescence reserves of $0.5 million. Based on a strategy of balancing inventory reductions with customer service and the timing of shipments, net inventory increased 1.8 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2019 in the Graphics Segment which was more than offset by a decrease in net inventory in the Lighting Segment of $3.2 million. 
The Company used cash of $0.7 million related to investing activities in the first quarter of fiscal 2019 as compared to a source of $1.0 million in the same period of the prior year, resulting in an unfavorable change of $1.7 million. Capital expenditures for the first quarter of fiscal 2019 increased $0.2 million to $0.6 million from the same period in fiscal 2018. The Company sold its Woonsocket manufacturing facility for $1.5 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2018 which contributed to the change in cash flow from investing activities from fiscal 2018 to fiscal 2019. 
Selling and administrative expenses of $3,395,000 in the first quarter of fiscal 2019 decreased $0.2 million or 5.4% from the same period of fiscal 2018 primarily as a result of decreased wage and benefit expense. 
Lighting Segment net sales of $61,432,000 in the first quarter of fiscal 2019 decreased 10.2% from fiscal 2018 same period net sales of $68,428,000. The Lighting Segment’s net sales of light fixtures having solid-state LED technology totaled $49.7 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2019 which represent 91% of total lighting product net sales. There continues to be a reduction in the Company’s traditional lighting sales (metal halide and fluorescent light sources) as customers convert from traditional lighting to light fixtures having solid-state LED technology.  
The Company used $0.6 million of cash related to financing activities in the first quarter of fiscal 2019 compared to a source of cash of $0.8 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2018. The $1.3 million unfavorable change in cash flow was the net result of borrowings in excess of payments of long term debt of $1.4 million. 
The Company reported a net income of $1,749,000 in the first quarter of fiscal 2019 compared to a net loss of $(15,629,000) in the same period of the prior year. The change between a net loss in fiscal 2018 to net income in fiscal 2019 is mostly driven by the $28 million pre-tax goodwill impairment charge in fiscal 2018 with no comparable event in fiscal 2019. When the impact of the fiscal 2018 goodwill impairment charge and the fiscal 2019 restructuring and plant costs are removed from the reported results, the fiscal 2019 adjusted net income of $2,203,000 increased $0.5 million or 27% from fiscal 2018 adjusted net income of $1,734,000. The change in adjusted net income is primarily the net result of decreased net sales, decreased gross profit, decreased selling and administrative expenses, increased interest expense, and a lower tax rate. Diluted earnings per share of $0.07 was reported in the first quarter of fiscal 2019 as compared to $(0.61) diluted loss per share in the same period of fiscal 2018. The weighted average common shares outstanding for purposes of computing diluted earnings per share in the first quarter of fiscal 2019 were 26,365,000 shares as compared to 25,791,000 shares in the same period last year. 
Fiscal 2019 first quarter operating income of $2.9 million increased $27.7 million from an operating loss of $(24,814,000) in the first quarter of fiscal 2018. The $27.7 million change from an operating loss in fiscal 2018 to operating income in fiscal 2019 was mostly the result of a pre-tax $28 million goodwill impairment charge in the Lighting Segment in fiscal 2018. Adjusted fiscal 2019 operating income of $3.5 million (which reflects the removal of plant closure costs) increased 10.6% from adjusted fiscal 2018 operating income of $3.2 (which reflects the removal of the goodwill impairment). Refer to “Non-GAAP Financial Measures” below. The increase in adjusted operating income was the result of decreased net sales and decreased gross profit more than offset by a decrease in selling and administrative expenses. Also contributing to the period-over-period results is a one-time adjustment to the Company’s paid-time-off policy in fiscal 2019 which resulted in a favorable pre-tax adjustment to earnings of $1.2 million. 
The Company reported $518,000 net interest expense in the first quarter of fiscal 2019 compared to $403,000 net interest expense in the first quarter of fiscal 2019. The change from interest expense from fiscal 2018 to fiscal 2019 is the result of higher interest rates on the Company’s line of credit and higher commitment fees on its unused portion of the line of credit. 101.LAB XBRL Taxonomy Extension Label Linkbase Document
