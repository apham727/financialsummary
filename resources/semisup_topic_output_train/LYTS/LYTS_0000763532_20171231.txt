Revenue from the management of media content and digital hardware related to active digital signage is recognized evenly over the service period with the customer. Media content service periods with most customers range from one month to one year. 
Shipping and handling revenue coincides with the recognition of revenue from sale of the product. 
Product revenue is recognized on product-only orders upon passing of title and risk of loss, generally at time of shipment. In certain arrangements with customers, as is the case with the sale of some of our solid-state LED (light emitting diode) video screens, revenue is recognized upon customer acceptance of the video screen at the job site. Product revenue related to orders where the customer requires the Company to install the product is recognized when the product is installed. The Company provides product warranties and certain post-shipment service, support and maintenance of certain solid state LED video screens. 
The Company maintains an inventory reserve for obsolete and excess inventory. The Company first determines its obsolete inventory reserve by considering specific known obsolete items, and then by applying certain percentages to specific inventory categories based upon inventory turns. The Company uses various tools, in addition to inventory turns, to identify which inventory items have the potential to become obsolete. A combination of financial modeling and qualitative input factors are used to establish excess and obsolete inventory reserves and management adjusts these reserves as more information becomes available about the ultimate disposition of the inventory item.
