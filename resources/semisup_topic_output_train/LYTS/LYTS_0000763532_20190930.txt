The decrease of $0.4 million is the result of a decrease in gross inventory of $0.3 million and an increase in obsolescence reserves of $0.1 million. Based on a strategy of balancing inventory reductions with customer service and the timing of shipments, net inventory decreased 0.8 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2020 in the Graphics Segment which more than offset an increase in net inventory in the Lighting Segment of $0.4 million.

Selling and administrative expenses of $8,060,000 in the first quarter of fiscal year 2020 decreased $3.6 million from the same period of fiscal 2019 selling and administrative expenses of $11,625,000, primarily due to the $4.8 million gain on the sale of the New Windsor, New York facility. When the $4.8 million gain is removed from fiscal 2020 results, there was a $1.3 million or 11.1% increase in selling and administrative expenses.
