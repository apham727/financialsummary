Net inventories of $54.1 million at December 31, 2018 increased $3.1 million from $51.0 million at June 30, 2018.

Fiscal 2019 second quarter operating loss of $(20.3) million represents a $24.8 million change from operating income of $4.6 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2018. The $24.8 million change from operating income in fiscal 2018 to an operating loss in fiscal 2019 was mostly the result of a pre-tax $20.2 million goodwill impairment charge in the Lighting Segment in the second quarter of fiscal 2019. Adjusted fiscal 2019 second quarter operating income of $1.5 million decreased $3.1 million or 66% from adjusted fiscal 2018 operating income of $4.6 million. Refer to “Non-GAAP Financial Measures” below. The decrease in adjusted operating income was the result of decreased net sales and decreased gross profit slightly offset by a decrease in selling and administrative expenses.

The Lighting Segment first half fiscal 2019 operating loss of $(14,602,000) increased $3.1 million from an operating loss of $(17,655,000) in the same period of fiscal 2018 primarily due to a $20.2 million pre-tax goodwill impairment charge in fiscal 2019 compared to a $28 million pre-tax goodwill impairment charge in fiscal 2018. When the goodwill impairment charges and the restructuring charges of $1,623,000 ($1,598,000 in cost of sales and $25,000 in selling and administrative expenses) are removed from both fiscal years, fiscal 2019 adjusted operating income of $7,369,000 was $3.0 million lower than fiscal 2018 adjusted operating income of $10,345,000. The reduction in sales volume and gross profit was partially offset by lower selling and administrative expenses. 
Lighting Segment net sales of $63,654,000 in the second quarter of fiscal 2019 decreased 8% from fiscal 2018 same period net sales of $69,174,000.
