During the three months ended September 30, 2018, Teradyne recorded $1.7 million for employee severance charges, primarily in Semiconductor Test, and $0.8 million of acquisition related compensation, partially offset by a $0.8 million gain for the decrease in the fair value of the Universal Robots contingent consideration liability.  
Discrete tax items recorded in the three and nine months ended October 1, 2017 amounted to expense of $0.3 million and benefit of $6.1 million, respectively. The $0.3 million of discrete tax expense recorded in the three months ended October 1, 2017 was primarily composed of $0.8 million of expense related to non-taxable foreign exchange loss, partially offset by $0.2 million of benefit from reductions in tax reserves and $0.2 million of benefit from stock based compensation. The $6.1 million of discrete tax benefit recorded in the nine months ended October 1, 2017 was primarily composed of $6.7 million of benefit from stock-based compensation, $0.7 million of benefit related to U.S. research and development tax credits, and $0.5 million of benefit from reductions in tax reserves, partially offset by $1.1 million of expense related to non-taxable foreign exchange loss, and $1.0 million of tax expense related to actuarial gains.  
As of September 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017, Teradyne had $38.6 million and $36.3 million, respectively, of reserves for uncertain tax positions. The $2.3 million net increase in reserves for uncertain tax positions is primarily composed of additions related to transfer pricing and U.S. research and development tax credits.  
During the nine months ended September 30, 2018, Teradyne recorded $7.9 million for employee severance charges, primarily in Semiconductor Test, and $4.1 million for acquisition related expenses and compensation, partially offset by a $9.2 million gain for the decrease in the fair value of the Universal Robots contingent consideration liability.  
 audit and $0.4 million of other discrete tax benefit. The $6.5 million of discrete benefits recorded in the nine months ended September 30, 2018 consisted of $8.9 million of discrete tax benefit net of $2.4 million of discrete tax expense. The $8.9 million of discrete tax benefit was composed of $7.8 million from stock based compensation, $0.5 million resulting from the resolution of an audit and $0.6 million of other discrete tax benefit. The $2.4 million of discrete tax expense was composed of $1.7 million from the remeasurement of deferred tax assets as a result of reductions in tax rates and $0.7 million of other discrete tax expense.  The increase of $14.1 million in selling and administrative expenses was due primarily to higher spending in the Industrial Automation segment due to higher sales and marketing spending in Universal Robots and due to the acquisitions of MiR and Energid in 2018.  
The decrease in Semiconductor Test revenues of $194.9 million, or 14.5%, was driven primarily by a decrease in sales in the mobility, image sensor and microcontroller test segments, partially offset by an increase in memory test segment sales. The increase in Industrial Automation revenues of $61.1 million, or 52.8%, was due to higher demand for collaborative robotic arms and the acquisition of MiR, completed in April 2018. MiR added $11.1 million of revenue in the nine months ended September 30, 2018. The increase in System Test revenues of $50.2 million, or 44.8%, was primarily due to higher sales of 3.5 hard disk drive and system level testers in Storage Test. The increase in Wireless Test revenues of $8.2 million, or 9.8%, was primarily due to higher demand for next generation wireless products, partially offset by lower demand for connectivity test systems.  
The increase in Semiconductor Test revenues of $20.4 million, or 5.1%, was driven primarily by an increase in the memory test sales, partially offset by lower mobility test segment sales. The increase in Industrial Automation revenues of $25.8 million, or 64.0%, was due to higher demand for collaborative robotic arms and the acquisition of MiR, completed in April 2018. MiR added $6.5 million of revenue in the three months ended September 30, 2018. The increase in System Test revenues of $14.0 million, or 39.3%, was primarily due to higher sales in Storage Test of 3.5 hard disk drive and system level testers. The increase in Wireless Test revenues of $3.4 million, or 11.0%, was primarily due to higher demand for next generation wireless products, partially offset by lower demand for connectivity test systems.  
The decrease in System Test engineering expenses was offset by an increase in engineering spending in Industrial Automation.  
The decrease in income before income taxes in Semiconductor Test was driven primarily by lower revenues due to a decrease in sales in the mobility, image sensor, and microcontroller test segments, partially offset by an increase in memory test segment sales. The increase in income before income taxes in System Test was primarily due to higher sales in Storage Test of 3.5 hard disk drive and system level testers. The increase in income before income taxes in Wireless Test was primarily due to higher demand for next generation wireless products, partially offset by lower demand for connectivity test systems. The increase in loss before income taxes in Industrial Automation was primarily due to an increase in intangible assets amortization expense from the acquisitions of MiR and Energid in 2018.  
Operating activities during the nine months ended October 1, 2017 provided cash of $479.0 million. Changes in operating assets and liabilities provided cash of $6.3 million. This was due to a $50.8 million increase in operating liabilities partially offset by a $44.5 million increase in operating assets.  In January 2018, our Board of Directors cancelled the December 2016 stock repurchase program and authorized a new stock repurchase program for up to $1.5 billion of common stock. We intend to repurchase $750 million in 2018. During the nine months ended September 30, 2018, we repurchased 13.8 million shares of common stock for $562.3 million at an average price of $40.62 per share.
