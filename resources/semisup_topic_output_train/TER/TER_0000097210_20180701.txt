Aggregate intangible asset amortization expense was $9.8 million and $17.5 million, respectively, for the three and six months ended July 1, 2018 and $8.2 million and $16.1 million, respectively, for the three and six months ended July 2, 2017.  
Realized gains recorded in the three and six months ended July 1, 2018 were $0.1 million and $0.4 million, respectively. Realized losses recorded in the three and six months ended July 1, 2018 were $0.0 million and $1.5 million, respectively. Realized gains recorded in the three and six months ended July 2, 2017 were  
Inventory reserves at July 1, 2018 and December 31, 2017 were $103.2 million and $102.9 million, respectively.  
For the period from April 25, 2018 to July 1, 2018, MiR contributed $4.5 million of revenues and had a $(1.5) million loss from operations before income taxes.  
In the three and six months ended July 1, 2018, the fair value of contingent consideration for the earn-out in connection with the acquisition of Universal Robots was decreased by $3.5 million and $8.5 million, respectively, primarily due to a decrease in forecasted revenue. In the three and six months ended July 2, 2017, the fair value of contingent consideration for the earn-out in connection with the acquisition of Universal Robots was increased by $1.5 million and $2.1 million, respectively, primarily due to a decrease in the discount rate.  
The effective tax rate for the three months ended July 1, 2018 and July 2, 2017 was 15.8% and 15.4%, respectively. The effective tax rate for the six months ended July 1, 2018 and July 2, 2017 was 12.9%.  
During the three months ended July 1, 2018, Teradyne recorded $2.5 million of acquisition related expenses, and $2.4 million for employee severance charges, primarily in Semiconductor Test, partially offset by a $3.5 million gain for the decrease in the fair value of the Universal Robots contingent consideration liability.  
Teradyne has four reportable segments (Semiconductor Test, System Test, Industrial Automation and Wireless Test). Each of the Semiconductor Test, System Test, and Wireless Test segments is also an individual  
During the six months ended July 1, 2018, Teradyne recorded $6.3 million for employee severance charges, primarily in Semiconductor Test and Industrial Automation, $3.3 million for acquisition related expenses, partially offset by an $8.5 million gain for the decrease in the fair value of the Universal Robots contingent consideration liability.  
As of July 1, 2018 and December 31, 2017, Teradyne had $37.9 million and $36.3 million, respectively, of reserves for uncertain tax positions. The $1.6 million net increase in reserves for uncertain tax positions is primarily composed of additions related to transfer pricing exposures and U.S. research and development tax credits.  
Pro forma results for the three and six months ended July 1, 2018 were adjusted to exclude $2.3 million and $2.9 million, respectively, of acquisition related costs, and $0.4 million of non-recurring expense related to fair value adjustment to acquisition-date inventory.  
Discrete tax items recorded in the three and six months ended July 2, 2017 amounted to expense of $0.5 million and benefit of $6.5 million, respectively. The $0.5 million of discrete tax expense recorded in the three months ended July 2, 2017 was primarily composed of $1.0 million of expense related to actuarial gains, $0.7 million of expense from non-taxable foreign exchange loss and $1.0 million of benefit from stock based compensation, and $0.2 million of other discrete tax benefit. The $6.5 million of discrete tax benefit recorded in the six months ended July 2, 2017 was primarily composed of $6.5 million of benefit from stock-based  The decrease in Semiconductor Test revenues of $215.3 million, or 22.7%, was driven primarily by a decrease in sales in the mobility and image sensor test segments, partially offset by an increase in memory test segment sales. The increase in System Test revenues of $36.1 million, or 47.1%, was primarily due to higher sales of 3.5 hard disk drive and system level testers in Storage Test. The increase in Industrial Automation revenues of $35.3 million, or 46.7%, was due to higher demand for collaborative robotic arms and the acquisition of MiR, completed in April of 2018. MiR added $4.5 million of revenue in the six months ended July 1, 2018. The increase in Wireless Test revenues of $4.8 million, or 9.0%, was primarily due to increased sales of connectivity test systems.  
The decrease in Semiconductor Test revenues of $233.1 million, or 39.3%, was driven primarily by a decrease in mobility test segment sales. The increase in System Test revenues of $33.0 million, or 89.9%, was primarily due to higher sales in Storage Test of 3.5 hard disk drive and system level testers. The increase in Industrial Automation revenues of $22.8 million, or 58.0%, was due to higher demand for collaborative robotic arms and the acquisition of MiR, completed in April of 2018. MiR added $4.5 million of revenue in the three months ended July 1, 2018. The increase in Wireless Test revenues of $7.5 million, or 27.1%, was primarily due to higher demand for connectivity test systems.  
Gross profit as a percent of revenue increased by 0.1 points, as a result of an increase related to product mix primarily in Semiconductor Test, partially offset by a decrease due to lower sales in Semiconductor Test.  
The decrease in income before income taxes in Semiconductor Test was driven primarily by lower revenues due to a decrease in sales in the mobility and image sensor test segments, partially offset by an increase in memory test segment sales. The increase in income before income taxes in System Test was primarily due to higher sales in Storage Test of 3.5 hard disk drive and system level testers. The increase in income before income taxes in Wireless Test was primarily due to higher sales of connectivity test systems. The decrease in loss before income taxes in Industrial Automation was primarily due to an increase in sales for collaborative robotic arms and the acquisition of MiR, partially offset by an increase in intangible assets amortization expense from the acquisitions of MiR and Energid in 2018.  
Gross profit as a percent of revenue increased by 2.2 points, as a result of an increase related to product mix primarily in Semiconductor Test.  
The increase of $15.0 million in selling and administrative expenses was due primarily to higher spending in Industrial Automation, partially offset by lower variable compensation.  In January 2018, our Board of Directors cancelled the December 2016 stock repurchase program and authorized a new stock repurchase program for up to $1.5 billion of common stock. We intend to repurchase $750 million in 2018. During the six months ended July 1, 2018, we repurchased 8.8 million shares of common stock for $360.8 million at an average price of $40.82 per share.
