Revenue from Contracts with Customers” were $562.5 million and $1,054.9 million, respectively. For the three and six months ended June 30, 2019, Teradyne also recognized $1.7 million and $3.4 million, respectively, of revenues from leases of Teradyne systems, which are accounted for outside of ASC 606. 
During the three and six months ended June 30, 2019, Teradyne recognized $13.3 million and $33.4 million, respectively, that was previously included within the deferred revenue and customer advances balances. During the three and six months ended July 1, 2018, Teradyne recognized 
On April 25, 2018, Teradyne acquired all of the issued and outstanding shares of Mobile Industrial Robots Aps (“MiR”), a Danish limited liability company located in Odense, Denmark. MiR is the leading maker of collaborative autonomous mobile robots for industrial applications. MiR is part of Teradyne’s Industrial Automation segment.  
The computation of diluted net income per common share for the three and six months ended July 1, 2018 excludes the effect of the potential vesting of 0.6 million and 0.5 million shares, respectively of restricted stock units because the effect would have been anti-dilutive.   
million of acquisition related compensation and expenses. The increase of $9.4 million in selling and administrative expenses was due primarily to higher spending in Industrial Automation from higher sales and marketing spending in Universal Robots and MiR. MiR was acquired on April 25, 2018.  
During the three months ended June 30, 2019 and July 1, 2018, we scrapped $2.6 million and $1.1 million of inventory, respectively. During the three months ended June 30, 2019 and July 1, 2018, we sold $0.4 million and $1.9 million of previously written-down or 
The decrease in Semiconductor Test revenues of $17.6 million, or 2.4%, was driven primarily by a decrease in memory test sales, partially offset by higher sales related to 5G infrastructure, higher image sensor test sales and higher service revenues. The increase in Industrial Automation revenues of $30.0 million, or 27.1%, was due to higher demand for collaborative robotic arms and the acquisition of MiR, which was acquired on April 25, 2018. The increase in System Test revenues of $18.9 million, or 16.8%, was primarily due to higher sales in Storage Test of 3.5” hard disk drive testers and higher sales in Production Board Test due to 5G. The increase in Wireless Test revenues of $12.6 million, or 21.8%, was primarily due to higher demand for millimeter wave and cellular test products driven by new wireless standards and 5G partially offset by lower sales in connectivity test products.   
The increase in Semiconductor Test revenues of $14.8 million, or 4.1%, was driven primarily by an increase in semiconductor test sales for 5G infrastructure and higher service revenues, partially offset by lower microcontroller, power linear and mobile image sensor test sales.  
During the six months ended June 30, 2019 and July 1, 2018, we scrapped $3.0 million and $1.5 million of inventory, respectively. During the six months ended June 30, 2019 and July 1, 2018, we sold $1.1 million and $4.2 million of previously written-down or 
The increase of $6.1 million in engineering and development expenses was primarily due to higher spending in Industrial Automation and Wireless Test.
