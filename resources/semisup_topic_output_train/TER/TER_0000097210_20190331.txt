The effective tax rate for the three months ended March 31, 2019 and April 1, 2018 was (16.1)% and 9.2%, respectively.  
Aggregate intangible asset amortization expense was $10.6 million and $7.7 million, for the three months ended March 31, 2019 and April 1, 2018, respectively.  
Pro forma results for the three months ended April 1, 2018 were adjusted to exclude $0.6 million of acquisition related costs.  
In the three months ended March 31, 2019, the fair value of contingent consideration for the earn-out in connection with the acquisition of MiR was increased by $3.0 million. In the three months ended April 1, 2018, the fair value of contingent consideration for the earn-out in connection with the acquisition of Universal Robots was decreased by $5.0 million, primarily due to a decrease in forecasted revenue.  
During the three months ended April 1, 2018, Teradyne recorded a $5.0 million credit for the decrease in the fair value of the Universal Robots contingent consideration liability, partially offset by $3.9 million recorded for employee severance charges, primarily in Semiconductor Test, and $0.8 million of acquisition related expenses.  
 manufacturing and marketing of collaborative robotic arms, autonomous mobile robots and advanced robotic control software. The Wireless Test segment includes operations related to the design, manufacturing and marketing of wireless test products and services.  
For the three months ended March 31, 2019 and April 1, 2018, Teradyne also recognized $1.7 million and $4.3 million, respectively, of revenues from leases of Teradyne systems, which are accounted for outside of ASC 606.  
During the three months ended March 31, 2019 and April 1, 2018, Teradyne granted 0.1 million and 0.1 million, respectively, of PBIT PRSUs with a grant date fair value of $35.67 and $46.62, respectively.  
On April 25, 2018, Teradyne acquired all of the issued and outstanding shares of Mobile Industrial Robots Aps (MiR), a Danish limited liability company located in Odense, Denmark. MiR is the leading maker of collaborative autonomous mobile robots for industrial applications. MiR is part of Teradynes Industrial Automation segment.  
During the three months ended April 1, 2018, Teradyne repurchased 2.9 million shares of common stock for $134.3 million at an average price of $45.69 per share.  
The following table provides information about disaggregated revenue by primary geographical market, major product line and timing of revenue recognition.  
As of March 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018, Teradyne had $13.5 million and $43.4 million, respectively, of reserves for uncertain tax positions. The $29.9 million net decrease in reserves for uncertain tax positions is composed of reductions in uncertain tax positions amounting to $22.4 million related to transfer pricing and $7.4 million associated with U.S. research and development tax credits. These reductions resulted from the conclusion of the U.S. Federal income tax audit for the year ended December 31, 2015.  
During the three months ended March 31, 2019 and April 1, 2018, there were no transfers in or out of Level 1, Level 2, or Level 3 financial instruments.  The increase of $2.4 million in engineering and development expenses was primarily due to higher spending in Industrial Automation and Wireless Test, partially offset by lower spending in Semiconductor Test.  
The decrease in Semiconductor Test revenues of $32.4 million, or 8.7%, was driven primarily by a decrease in memory test sales and lower mobility test sales, partially offset by higher image sensor test sales. The increase in Industrial Automation revenues of $17.3 million, or 35.5%, was due to higher demand for collaborative robotic arms and the acquisition of MiR, which was acquired in April 2018. MiR added $9.1 million of revenue in the three months ended March 31, 2019.  
The increase in System Test revenues of $15.2 million, or 35.3%, was primarily due to higher sales in Storage Test of 3.5 hard disk drive and higher sales in Production Board Test. The increase in Wireless Test revenues of $6.5 million, or 28.9%, was primarily due to higher demand for millimeter wave and cellular test products.  
During the three months ended April 1, 2018, we recorded an inventory provision of $3.5 million included in cost of revenues primarily due to downward revisions to previously forecasted demand levels of which $2.2 million was related to Semiconductor Test, $0.8 million was related to Wireless Test, $0.3 million was related to System Test, and $0.2 million was related to Industrial Automation.  
Operating activities during the three months ended March 31, 2019 provided cash of $18.0 million. Changes in operating assets and liabilities used cash of $134.2 million. This was due to a $63.3 million increase in operating assets and a $70.9 million decrease in operating liabilities.  
The decrease in income before income taxes in Semiconductor Test was driven primarily by a decrease in memory test sales and lower mobility test sales partially offset by higher image sensor test sales. The increase in income before income taxes in System Test was primarily due to higher sales in Storage Test of 3.5 hard disk drive and higher sales in Production Board Test. The increase in income before income taxes in Wireless Test was primarily due to higher demand for millimeter wave and cellular test products. The decrease in income before income taxes in Industrial Automation was primarily due to increased intangible assets amortization expense from the acquisitions of MiR and Energid in 2018.
