The decrease in net income per share for the three and six months ended December 31, 2018 was due to lower sales, lower gross profit and an increase in selling, general and administrative expenses when compared to the same periods in 2017 as discussed above.
Selling, general and administrative expenses were $1,295,687 for the three months ended December 31, 2018; an increase of $313,317, compared to the three months ended December 31, 2017.
This increase in spending reduced the gross profit percentage by 7.2% and 8.0% for the three and six month periods, respectively.
Gross profit as a percentage of sales was 20.8% and 26.7%, for the same periods, respectively.
The increase for the six months ended December 31, 2018 as compared to the same period in 2017 relates primarily to the increases described for the three month period, however, for the six-month period ended December 31, 2018, the increases were offset, in part, by a reduction in travel, and incurred marketing costs.
Other income for the three months ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 was $53,361 and $43,289, respectively.
New orders received in the first six months of fiscal year 2019 were approximately $13.4 million as compared to $14.3 million of new orders received in the first six months of fiscal 2018.

Net cash provided by investing activities increased in the six months ended December 31, 2018 as compared to the same period in 2017 is primarily due to an increase in maturing investments offset, in part, by an increase in spending for the purchase of property, plant and equipment.
Management expects revenues in fiscal year 2019 to be higher than revenues during fiscal year 2018 but expects the gross profit margin to be lower in fiscal year 2019 than the gross profit margin during fiscal year 2018.
The increase in cash used in operating activities compared to the prior year primarily relates to a decrease in net income and income tax payable and the increase in inventories attributed to the sales volume and backlog increases offset, in part, by a decrease in prepaid expenses and other current assets, the collection of trade receivables and the increase in accounts payable.
For the six months ended December 31, 2018, the decrease in net sales is primarily due to the timing of power supply shipments related to a specific military contract which had significant shipments in the prior fiscal year, offset in part by an increase in build to print sales.
Net sales to two significant customers represented 54.4% and 61.0% of the Company’s total sales for the six-month period ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively.
