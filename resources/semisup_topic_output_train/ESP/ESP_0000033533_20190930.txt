Net sales decreased for the three months ended September 30, 2019 to $5,923,819 as compared to $8,337,399 for the same period in 2018. The decrease in net sales is primarily due to a decrease in build to print sales. 
The Company currently believes that the cash flow generated from operations and when necessary, from cash and cash equivalents will be sufficient to meet its long-term funding requirements for the foreseeable future. 
Management expects revenues in fiscal year 2020 to approximate revenues during fiscal year 2019 and expects the gross profit margin to be higher in fiscal year 2020 than the gross profit margin during fiscal year 2019. This expectation is driven primarily by orders already in our backlog that will be shipped in fiscal year 2020 with lower anticipated aggregate production costs than with the product mix shipped during fiscal 2019. As factors such as engineering delays, competition and product costs impact gross profit margins, management will continue to evaluate our sales strategy, employment levels, and facility costs. 
Net income for the three months ended September 30, 2019, was $81,776 or $0.03 per share, basic and diluted, compared to $61,671 or $0.03 per share, basic and diluted, for the three months ended September 30, 2018. The increase in net income in the current quarter resulted from the increase in the gross profit percentage primarily attributable to the decrease in incurred spending related to a specific engineering design contract, offset in part, by a decrease in sales. In addition, the increase in net income in the current quarter was reduced by an increase in incurred selling, general, and administrative expenditures, lower other income and an increase in the provision for income taxes when compared to the same periods in 2018, all discussed above. 
A significant portion of the Company’s business is the production of military and industrial electronic equipment for use by the U.S. and foreign governments and certain industrial customers. Net sales to three significant customers represented 56.7% of the Company’s total sales for the three-month period ended September 30, 2019. Net sales to two significant customers represented 62.5% of the Company’s total sales for the three-month period ended September 30, 2018. This high concentration level with these customers presents significant risk. A loss of one of these customers or programs related to these customers could significantly impact the Company. Historically, a small number of customers have accounted for a large percentage of the Company’s total sales in any given fiscal year. 
Other income for the three months ended September 30, 2019 and 2018 was $47,489 and $76,070, respectively. The decrease for the three months ended is primarily due to the reduction in investment securities offset, in part, by the gradual increase in the current yield percentages earned on the investment securities. Interest income is a function of the level of investments and investment strategies which generally tend to be conservative.  
Gross profits for the three months ended September 30, 2019 and 2018 were $1,136,348 and $992,934, respectively. Gross profit as a percentage of sales was 19.2% and 11.9%, for the same periods, respectively. The primary factors in determining the change in gross profit and net income are overall sales levels and product mix. The gross profits on mature products and build to print contracts are typically higher as compared to products which are still in the engineering development stage or in early stages of production. In the case of the latter, the Company can incur what it refers to as “loss contracts,” primarily on engineering design contracts in which the Company invests with the objective of developing future product sales. In any given accounting period the mix of product shipments between higher margin programs and less mature programs, and expenditures associated with loss contracts, has a significant impact on gross profit and net income. The gross profit percentage increased in the three months ended September 30, 2019 as compared to the same period in 2018 primarily due to the decrease in incurred spending related to a specific engineering design contract when compared to the same period in 2018. 
New orders received in the first three months of fiscal year 2020 were approximately $7.0 million as compared to $6.9 million of new orders received in the first three months of fiscal 2019. It is presently anticipated that a minimum of $29.2 million of orders comprising the September 30, 2019 backlog will be filled during the fiscal year ending June 30, 2020. The minimum of $29.2 million does not include any shipments, which may be made against orders subsequently received during the fiscal year ending June 30, 2020. The estimate of the September 30, 2019 backlog to be shipped in fiscal year 2020 is subject to future events, which may cause the amount of the backlog actually shipped to differ from such estimate. 
In order to maintain a balanced business, we are continuing to place an emphasis on securing “build to print” opportunities, which will allow production work to go directly to the manufacturing floor, limiting the impact on our engineering staff. This effort will keep our manufacturing team busy while engineering development designs transition to production. 
Management believes that the Company's reserve for bad debts of $3,000 is adequate given the customers with whom the Company does business. Historically, bad debt expense has been minimal. 
During the three months ended September 30, 2019 and 2018, the Company expended $94,070 and $611,995, respectively, for plant improvements and new equipment. The Company has budgeted approximately $300,000 for new equipment and plant improvements in fiscal year 2020. Management anticipates that the funds required will be available from current operations. 
There is competition in all classes of products manufactured by the Company, ranging from divisions of the largest electronic companies, to many small companies. The Company's sales do not represent a significant share of the industry's market for any class of its products. The principal methods of competition for electronic products of both a military and industrial nature include, among other factors, price, product performance, the experience of the particular company and history of its dealings in such products.
