CSP Inc. ("CSPI" or "the Company" or "we" or "our") was incorporated in 1968 and is based in Lowell, Massachusetts. To meet the diverse requirements of its commercial and defense customers worldwide, CSPI and its subsidiaries develop and market IT integration solutions, advanced security and managed services, purpose built network adapters, and high-performance cluster computer systems. The Company operates in two segments, its High Performance Products (“HPP”) segment and its Technology Solutions (“TS”) segment.
The following table lists customers from which the Company derived revenues in excess of 10% of total revenues for the three months ended December 31, 2017, and 2016.
The following tables presents certain operating segment information for the three months ended December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016.
Non-vested restricted stock awards of 170,000 and 149,000 shares were excluded from the diluted income per share calculation for the three months ended December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016, respectively, as there was a net loss and their inclusion would have been anti-dilutive. 
In July 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-11, Inventory (Topic 330) Simplifying the Measurement of Inventory, which requires entities to measure inventory at the lower of cost and net realizable value, except for inventory measured using last-in, first-out (LIFO) or the retail inventory method. Net realizable value is the estimated selling prices in the ordinary course of business, less reasonably predictable costs of completion, disposal, and transportation. This ASU is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016, and interim periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017 and requires prospective application, with early adoption permitted as of the beginning of an interim or annual reporting period. The Company has not yet assessed the potential impact of implementing this ASU on our consolidated financial statements.
In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, which requires an entity to recognize the amount of revenue to which it expects to be entitled for the transfer of promised goods or services to customers. The ASU will replace most existing revenue recognition guidance in GAAP when it becomes effective. The new standard is effective for the Company on October 1, 2018, and it does not plan to early adopt this ASU. The standard outlines a five-step model whereby revenue is recognized as performance obligations within a contract are satisfied. The standard also requires new, expanded disclosures regarding revenue recognition. We are utilizing a bottom-up approach to analyze the standard's impact on our contract portfolio, comparing our historical accounting policies and practices, and identifying potential differences from applying the requirements of the new standard to our contracts. While this assessment continues, we have not yet completed our determination of the impacts of the standard or the effect of these impacts on our consolidated financial statements. The Company has selected the modified retrospective approach as its transition method. Because the new standard will impact our business processes, systems and controls, we are developing a comprehensive change management project plan to guide the implementation.
Finished goods includes inventory that has been shipped, but for which all revenue recognition criteria has not been met, of approximately $0.1 million and $0.4 million as of December 31, 2017 and September 30, 2017, respectively.
Total inventory balances in the table above are shown net of reserves for obsolescence of approximately $3.2 million and $3.1 million as of December 31, 2017 and September 30, 2017, respectively.
In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-08 (Topic 606), Principal versus Agent Considerations (Reporting Revenue Gross versus Net) to clarify the implementation guidance on principal versus agent considerations. The amendments in this update provides additional guidance on indicators to assist an entity in determining whether it controls a specified good or service before it is transferred to the customer and does not change the core principle of previously issued guidance. The amendments in this Topic are effective for financial statements issued for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2017, and interim periods within those annual periods. The Company does not expect the implementation of this ASU to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.
The Company has also recorded a provisional estimate for a one-time tax expense of $490 thousand which consists primarily of the remeasurement of deferred tax assets and liabilities from 34% to 21%. This expense has also been recorded discretely in the quarter ending December 31, 2017. 
During the first quarter ended December 31, 2017, the Company recognized a provision for income taxes of $1.1 million that includes a provisional estimate in the amount of $649 thousand related to the one-time deemed repatriation transition tax on unrepatriated foreign earnings. The provisional amount is based on information currently available, including estimated tax earnings and profits from foreign investments. The Company continues to gather and analyze information, including historical adjustments to earnings and profits of foreign subsidiaries, in order to complete the accounting for the effects of the estimated transition tax. This expense has been recorded discretely in the quarter ending December 31, 2017. The increase in TS segment product revenues of $0.9 million during the period was primarily the result of an increase in product revenues of $1.8 million in our U.K. division, partially offset by decreases of $0.8 million and $0.1 million in our U.S and German divisions, respectively. The $1.8 million increase in the U.K. segment product revenues was primarily the result of increased product shipments to a major customer. The increase in TS segment service revenues of $1.4 million during the period was primarily the result of increases of $1.0 million, $0.3 million and $0.1 million of our U.S., German and U.K. 
The $2.1 million increase in revenues is primarily attributed to increased revenues by our TS segment. The $1.8 million increase in revenue to Europe is primarily the result of increased sales by our TS segment U.K. division to U.S. division multi-national customer.
 Our revenues increased by approximately $2.1 million to $22.0 million for the three months ended December 31, 2017 as compared to $19.9 million of revenues for the three months ended December 31, 2016. The TS segment revenues increase of $2.4 million was partially offset by a $0.3 million decrease in our HPP segment. 
 The overall TS segment gross margin as a percentage of sales increased to 19% for the three month period ended December 31, 2017 from 16% for the three month period ended December 31, 2016. The overall TS segment gross margin as a percentage of sales increase was primarily due to an 8% increase in service margins as a percentage of TS segment revenues, which is substantially due to having improved margins in our U.K. and Germany divisions. 
The engineering and development expenses incurred by our HPP segment were $0.7 million and $0.6 million for the three months ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. The current period expenses were primarily for Myricom product engineering expenses incurred in connection with the development of the new Myricom ARIA security products. The increased engineering and development expenses for the three month period ended December 31, 2017 as compared to the three month period ended December 31, 2016 is primarily attributed to an increase in engineering headcount related expenses.
 Our revenues increased by approximately $2.1 million, or 10%, to $22.0 million for the three months ended December 31, 2017 as compared to $19.9 million for the three months ended December 31, 2016. The increase in revenue is the result of an increase of $2.4 million in our TS segment, partially offset by a $0.3 million decrease in our HPP segment. Our gross margin percentage increased overall, from 22% of revenues for the three months ended December 31, 2016, to 23% for the three months ended December 31, 2017 due in part to an increase in higher margin TS segment service revenues. Operating income increased by $0.1 million from an operating loss of $102 thousand for the three month period ended December 31, 2016 to operating income of $7 thousand for the three month period ended December 31, 2017, primarily as a result of a $681 thousand increase in gross profit partially offset by an increase of $572 thousand in higher operating expenses. The increase in operating expenses was primarily the result of higher variable compensation costs, combined with increased costs for sales and engineering hires in our U.S and Germany divisions of the TS segment. Our income tax expense increased by approximately $1.1 million to $1.1 million for the three months ended December 31, 2017 as compared to an income tax benefit of $15 thousand for the three months ended December 31, 2016. The increase to the income tax expense was primarily due to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act which was enacted on December 22, 2017.
 The increase in HPP product revenues is primarily attributed to increased Myricom product shipments partially offset by lower Multicomputer product shipments and parts sales for the period. The decrease in HPP services revenues is primarily attributed to a $329 thousand decrease in royalties on high-speed processing boards related to the E2D program shipped for the three months ended December 31, 2017 as compared to the three months ended December 31, 2016. During the periods following our initial identification of the material weakness referred to above, management assessed various alternatives to remediate this material weakness and we implemented changes to our system of internal controls, which included the implementation of enhanced internal auditing procedures, whereby revenue transactions are subjected to an additional review process at the corporate level to ensure the correct accounting methodology is applied to all revenue transactions. During the three months ended December 31, 2017, management continued to take additional actions to upgrade our international accounting staff and improved accounting operations in our European divisions. Although we have implemented such changes to our internal controls over financial reporting as described above, at this time, we cannot conclude that the material weakness has been remediated and we will continue to make personnel changes and upgrade systems and processes throughout fiscal year 2018.
