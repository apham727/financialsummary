12. Discontinued Operations of TS Segment
HPP segment revenue is derived from the sale of integrated hardware and software, maintenance, and other services through the Multicomputer and Myricom product lines.
We derive revenue from the sale of integrated hardware and software, third-party service contracts, professional services, managed services, financing of hardware and software, and other services. 
We recognize revenue from third-party service contracts as either gross sales or net sales depending on whether the Company is acting as a principal party to the transaction or simply acting as an agent or broker based on control and timing. The Company is a principal if it controls the good or service before that good or service is transferred to the customer. We record revenue as gross when the Company is a principal party to the arrangement and net of cost when we are acting as a broker or agent. Under gross sales recognition, the entire selling price is recorded in revenue and our cost to the third-party service provider or vendor is recorded in cost of goods sold. Under net sales recognition, the cost to the third-party service provider or vendor is recorded as a reduction to revenue resulting in net sales equal to the gross profit on the transaction. Third-party service contracts are sold in different combinations with hardware, software, and services. We have determined the third-party services contracts 
Other services generally include revenue generated through our royalty, extended warranty, multicomputer repair, and maintenance contracts. Royalty revenue is sales-based and recognized on date of subsequent sale of the product, which occurs on the date of customer shipment. Revenue from extended warranty contracts is recognized evenly over the period of the warranty. Multicomputer repair services revenue is recognized upon control transfer when the customer takes possession of the computer at time of shipping. Revenue generated from maintenance services is recognized evenly over the term of the contract.
TS Segment revenue is derived from the sale of hardware, software, professional services, third-party service contracts, maintenance contracts, managed services, and financing of hardware and software. Financing revenue is recognized in accordance with ASC 840, Leases. Financing revenue is recorded in revenue as equipment leasing and is part of the Company's operations.
Contract liabilities arise when payment is received before the Company transfers a good or service to the customer. Current contract liabilities were $3.1 million and $0.9 million as of March 31, 2019 and October 1, 2018, respectively. The primary reason for the increase is due to one large non-cancelable contract that was effective as of March 31, 2019. The current portion of contract liabilities is recorded in deferred revenue on the consolidated balance sheets. There were no non-current contract liabilities as of March 31, 2019 and October 1, 2018, respectively. Revenue recognized for the six months ended March 31, 2019 that was included in contract liabilities as of the beginning of the period was $0.5 million.
Myricom revenue is derived from the sale of products, which are comprised of both hardware and embedded software which is essential to the products functionality, and post contract maintenance and support. Post contract maintenance and support is considered immaterial in the context of the contract and therefore is not a separate performance obligation.
When product and services are sold together, the allocation of the transaction price to each performance obligation is calculated using a budgeted cost-plus margin approach. Due to the complex nature of these contracts, there is significant judgment in allocating the transaction price. These estimates are periodically reviewed by project managers, engineers, and other staff involved to ensure estimates are appropriate. For items sold separately, including hardware, software, professional services, maintenance contracts, other services, and third-party service contracts, there is no allocation performed as there is one performance obligation. Our gross margin ("GM") decreased by $0.2 million to $3.7 million for the three months ended March 31, 2019 as compared to a gross margin of approximately $4.0 million for the three months ended March 31, 2018. The GM as a percentage of revenue decreased to 23% for the three months ended March 31, 2019, from 24% for the three months ended March 31, 2018.
The $2.1 million increase in total revenues is primarily attributed to a $2.7 million increase by our TS segment partially offset by a $0.6 million decrease by our HPP segment. The $3.4 million increase in the Americas revenues for the six months ended March 31, 2019 as compared to the six months ended March 31, 2018 is primarily due to increased revenues by our TS segment of approximately $4.3 million, partially offset by decreased sales by our HPP segment of approximately $0.9 million. The $1.9 million decrease in Europe revenue is primarily due to decreased sales by our TS segment of $1.6 million for the six month period ended March 31, 2019 as compared to the prior fiscal year period. The $0.6 million increase in Asia is primarily the result of increased product sales by our HPP segment of approximately $0.6 million. 
 Our revenues decreased by approximately $0.3 million to $16.3 million for the three months ended March 31, 2019 as compared to $16.6 million of revenues for the three months ended March 31, 2018. TS segment revenues decreased by $0.1 million, and HPP segment revenues decreased by $0.2 million. 
The $0.8 million decrease in revenue to the Americas is primarily the result of decreased sales by our HPP segment of $0.6 million combined with decreased sales by our TS segment of $0.2 million. The $0.1 million decrease in revenue to Europe is primarily the result of decreased sales by our HPP segment of $0.2 million, partially offset by increased sales by our TS segment of $0.1 million. The $0.6 million increase in revenue to Asia is primarily the result of increased sales by our HPP segment of Myricom product to a major customer. 
Engineering and development expenses increased by $0.1 million to $1.53 million for the six months ended March 31, 2019 as compared to $1.46 million for the six months ended March 31, 2018. The current period expenses were primarily for product engineering expenses incurred in connection with the development of the new ARIA SDS cyber security products. The increased engineering and development expenses for the six month period ended March 31, 2019 as compared to the six month period ended March 31, 2018 is primarily attributed to an increase in engineering headcount related expenses.
 Our revenues decreased by approximately $0.3 million, or 2%, to $16.3 million for the three months ended March 31, 2019 as compared to $16.6 million for the three months ended March 31, 2018. The decrease in revenue is the result of a decrease of $0.1 million in our TS segment, combined with a $0.2 million decrease in our HPP segment. Our gross margin percentage decreased to 23% of revenues for the three months ended March 31, 2019 from 24% for the three months ended March 31, 2018. Operating loss decreased by approximately $0.1 million from an operating loss of $0.9 million for the three months ended March 31, 2018 to an operating loss of $0.8 million for the three months ended March 31, 2019, primarily as a result of a decrease of $0.3 million in operating expenses partially offset by a $0.2 million decrease in gross profit. The decrease in operating expenses was primarily the result of $0.3 million decrease in our TS segment. Our provision for income tax was a tax benefit of $142 thousand for the three months ended March 31, 2019 as compared to a tax benefit of $160 thousand for the three months ended March 31, 2018. The effective tax rate for the current quarter is 18.7%.
The decrease in TS segment product revenues of $0.3 million during the period was primarily the result of a decrease in product revenues of $1.5 million in our U.S. division, partially offset by an increase of product revenue of $1.1 million in our U.K. division. The $1.5 million decrease in the U.S. division was primarily the result of product sales to a major customer in the 
 The HPP product revenues for the three months ended March 31, 2019 of $1.4 million, decreased by $0.1 million from $1.5 million for the three months ended March 31, 2018, primarily as a result of a decrease in Myricom product sales. The decrease in HPP services revenues of $0.1 million is primarily attributed to a $0.1 million decrease in royalties on high-speed processing boards related to the E2D program shipped for the three months ended March 31, 2019 as compared to the three months ended March 31, 2018.
