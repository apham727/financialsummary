The following table lists customers from which the Company derived revenues in excess of 10% of total revenues from continuing operations for the three and nine months ended June 30, 2018, and 2017.
The following tables present certain operating segment information for the three and nine months ended June 30, 2018 and June 30, 2017.
Customer C, accounted for accounts receivable of 10% or more as of June 30, 2018, but did not account for revenue of 10% or more for the three and nine months ended June 30, 2018 and June 30, 2017. Accounts receivable from Customer C totaled approximately $1.6 million, or 13%, of consolidated accounts receivable as of June 30, 2018. We believe that the Company is not exposed to any significant credit risk with respect to the accounts receivable with these customers as of June 30, 2018. No other customers accounted for 10% or more of total consolidated accounts receivable as of June 30, 2018. 
During the third quarter ended June 30, 2018, CSPi's Board of Directors approved the sale of the Germany subsidiary of its TS segment. Accordingly, the Company's Germany division of the TS segment met the criteria for "Assets Held-for-Sale" in accordance with Accounting Standard Codification Topic 360 ("ASC 360") as of June 30, 2018. The Germany assets and liabilities are reflected as "held-for-sale" on the consolidated balance sheets in accordance with ASC 360, at June 30, 2018 and September 30, 2017. In addition, the results of operations for the Germany business have been presented as discontinued operations in accordance with ASC 205-20, Results of Operations-Discontinued Operations for all periods presented. The Company closed on the sale of the German subsidiary of its TS segment on July 31, 2018.

In July 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-11, Inventory (Topic 330) Simplifying the Measurement of Inventory, which requires entities to measure inventory at the lower of cost and net realizable value, except for inventory measured using last-in, first-out (LIFO) or the retail inventory method. Net realizable value is the estimated selling prices in the ordinary course of business, less reasonably predictable costs of completion, disposal, and transportation. This ASU is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016, and interim periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017 and requires prospective application, with early adoption permitted as of the beginning of an interim or annual reporting period. The Company has not yet assessed the potential impact of implementing this ASU on our consolidated financial statements.
In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, which requires an entity to recognize the amount of revenue to which it expects to be entitled for the transfer of promised goods or services to customers. The ASU will replace most existing revenue recognition guidance in GAAP when it becomes effective. The new standard is effective for the Company on October 1, 2018, and it does not plan to early adopt this ASU. The standard outlines a five-step model whereby revenue is recognized as performance obligations within a contract are satisfied. The standard also requires new, expanded disclosures regarding revenue recognition. We are utilizing a bottom-up approach to analyze the standard's impact on our contract portfolio, comparing our historical accounting policies and practices, and identifying potential differences from applying the requirements of the new standard to our contracts. While this assessment continues, we have not yet completed our determination of the impacts of the standard or the effect of these impacts on our consolidated financial statements. The Company has selected the modified retrospective approach as its transition method. Because the new standard will impact our business processes, systems and controls, we are developing a comprehensive change management project plan to guide the implementation. Our gross margin ("GM") decreased by $0.9 million to $5.2 million for the three months ended June 30, 2018 as compared to a gross margin of approximately $6.1 million for the three months ended June 30, 2017. The GM as a percentage of revenue increased to 26% for the three months ended June 30, 2018, from 23% for the three months ended June 30, 2017.
 Our revenues decreased by approximately $6.4 million to $20.0 million for the three months ended June 30, 2018 as compared to $26.4 million of revenues for the three months ended June 30, 2017. TS segment revenues decreased by $6.2 million, and HPP segment revenues decreased by $0.2 million. 
The $6.9 million decrease in total revenues is primarily attributed to a $4.8 million decrease by our TS segment combined with a $2.1 million decrease by our HPP segment. The $5.4 million decrease in the Americas revenues for the nine months ended June 30, 2018 as compared to the nine months ended June 30, 2017 is primarily due to decreased revenues by our TS segment of approximately $4.1 million, combined with decreased sales by our HPP segment of approximately $1.3 million. The $1.3 million decrease in Asia is primarily the result of decreased product sales by our HPP segment to a major customer of approximately $1.0 million, combined with decreased sales by our TS segment of $0.3 million. The $0.2 million decrease in Europe revenue is primarily due to decreased sales by our TS segment.
 Our total revenues decreased by $6.9 million to $53.3 million for the nine months ended June 30, 2018 as compared $60.1 million of revenues for the nine months ended June 30, 2017. 
The decrease in TS segment product revenues of $7.0 million during the period was primarily the result of a decrease in product revenues of $7.2 million in our U.S. division, partially offset by an increase of $0.2 million in our U.K. division. The $7.2 million decrease in the U.S. division was primarily the result of product sales to a major customer in the prior year 
 The overall TS segment gross margin as a percentage of sales increased to 18% for the three month period ended June 30, 2018 from 16% for the three month period ended June 30, 2017. The overall TS segment gross margin as a percentage of sales increase was primarily due to increased higher margin service revenues combined with decreased lower margin product revenues by our TS segment U.S. division.
Engineering and development expenses increased by $0.6 million to $2.4 million for the nine months ended June 30, 2018 as compared to $1.7 million for the nine months ended June 30, 2017. The current period expenses were primarily for  product engineering expenses incurred in connection with the development of the new ARIA security products. The increased engineering and development expenses for the nine month period ended June 30, 2018 as compared to the nine month period ended June 30, 2017 is primarily attributed to an increase in engineering headcount and consulting related expenses.
The overall HPP segment gross margin as a percentage of sales decreased to 69% for the three months ended June 30, 2018 from 73% for the three months ended June 30, 2017. The 4% decrease in gross margin as a percentage of sales in the HPP segment was primarily attributed to a decrease in high margin royalty revenues and a reduction in higher margin multicomputer products within the overall product mix.
The decrease in HPP product revenues for the period of $0.4 million was primarily the result of a decrease of approximately $1.0 million in Multicomputer product line shipments, partially due to a large shipment in the prior fiscal year period, partially offset by an increase in Myricom product line shipments of $0.6 million for the nine months ended June 30, 2018 as compared to the nine months ended June 30, 2017. The decrease in HPP services revenues of $1.7 million for the period was primarily the result of a decrease of approximately $1.8 million in royalty revenues on high-speed processing boards related to the E2D program during the nine months ended June 30, 2018 as compared to the nine months ended June 30, 2017. During the periods following our initial identification of the material weakness referred to above, management assessed various alternatives to remediate this material weakness and we implemented changes to our system of internal controls, which included the implementation of enhanced internal auditing procedures, whereby revenue transactions are subjected to an additional review process at the corporate level to ensure the correct accounting methodology is applied to all revenue transactions. During the three months ended June 30, 2018, management continued to take actions to improve accounting operations in our European divisions and also announced a transaction to sell our Germany subsidiary. Although we have implemented such changes to our internal controls over financial reporting as described above, at this time, we cannot conclude that the material weakness has been remediated and we will continue to evaluate personnel changes and upgrade systems and processes throughout fiscal year 2018 as necessary.
