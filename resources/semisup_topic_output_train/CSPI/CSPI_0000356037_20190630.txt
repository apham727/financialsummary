 12. Discontinued Operations of TS Segment  
 The following table lists customers from which the Company derived revenues in excess of 10% of total revenues from continuing operations for three and nine months ended June 30, 2019.  
 HPP segment revenue is derived from the sale of integrated hardware and software, maintenance, and other services through the Multicomputer and Myricom product lines.  
 We derive revenue from the sale of integrated hardware and software, third-party service contracts, professional services, managed services, financing of hardware and software, and other services.  
 Other services generally include revenue generated through our royalty, extended warranty, multicomputer repair, and maintenance contracts. Royalty revenue is sales-based and recognized on date of subsequent sale of the product, which occurs on the date of customer shipment. Revenue from extended warranty contracts is recognized evenly over the period of the warranty. Multicomputer repair services revenue is recognized upon control transfer when the customer takes possession of the computer at time of shipping. Revenue generated from maintenance services is recognized evenly over the term of the contract.  
 TS Segment revenue is derived from the sale of hardware, software, professional services, third-party service contracts, maintenance contracts, managed services, and financing of hardware and software. Financing revenue is recognized in accordance with ASC 840, Leases. Financing revenue is recorded in revenue as equipment leasing and is part of the Companyâ€™s operations.  
timing. The Company is a principal if it controls the good or service before that good or service is transferred to the customer. We record revenue as gross when the Company is a principal party to the arrangement and net of cost when we are acting as a broker or agent. Under gross sales recognition, the entire selling price is recorded in revenue and our cost to the third-party service provider or vendor is recorded in cost of goods sold. Under net sales recognition, the cost to the third-party service provider or vendor is recorded as a reduction to revenue resulting in net sales equal to the gross profit on the transaction. Third-party service contracts are sold in different combinations with hardware, software, and services. We have determined the third-party services contracts are a single performance obligation in each sale. When the Company is an agent, revenue is typically recorded at a point in time. When the Company is the principal, revenue is recognized over the contract term.  
 Myricom revenue is derived from the sale of products, which are comprised of both hardware and embedded software which is essential to the products functionality, and post contract maintenance and support. Post contract maintenance and support is considered immaterial in the context of the contract and therefore is not a separate performance obligation.  
 When product and services are sold together, the allocation of the transaction price to each performance obligation is calculated using a budgeted cost-plus margin approach. Due to the complex nature of these contracts, there is significant judgment in allocating the transaction price. These estimates are periodically reviewed by project managers, engineers, and other staff involved to ensure estimates are appropriate. For items sold separately, including hardware, software, professional services, maintenance contracts, other services, and third-party service contracts, there is no allocation performed as there is one performance obligation.  
 Revenue generated from managed services is recognized over the term of the contract. Certain managed services contracts include financing of hardware and software. Revenues from arrangements which include financing are allocated considering relative standalone selling prices of lease and non-lease components within the agreement. The lease components include the hardware and software, which are subject to ASC 840. The non-lease component includes the managed services and is subject to ASC 606.  
 Contract liabilities arise when payment is received before the Company transfers a good or service to the customer. Current contract liabilities were $0.8 million and $0.9 million as of June 30, 2019 and October 1, 2018, respectively. The current portion of contract liabilities is recorded in deferred revenue on the consolidated balance sheets. There were no non-current contract liabilities as of June 30, 2019 and October 1, 2018. Revenue recognized for the nine months ended June 30, 2019 that was included in contract liabilities as of the beginning of the period was $0.7 million.   Our gross margin ("GM") decreased by $0.4 million to $4.8 million for the three months ended June 30, 2019 as compared to a gross margin of approximately $5.2 million for the three months ended June 30, 2018. The GM as a percentage of revenue decreased to 22% for the three months ended June 30, 2019, from 26% for the three months ended June 30, 2018.  
 Our revenues increased by approximately $1.6 million to $21.6 million for the three months ended June 30, 2019 as compared to $20.0 million of revenues for the three months ended June 30, 2018. TS segment revenues increased by $2.5 million, and HPP segment revenues decreased by $0.9 million.  
 The $6.4 million increase in the Americas revenues for the nine months ended June 30, 2019 as compared to the nine months ended June 30, 2018 is primarily due to increased revenues by our TS segment of approximately $8.9 million, partially offset by decreased sales by our HPP segment of approximately $2.5 million. The $4.2 million decrease in Europe revenue is primarily due to decreased sales by our TS segment of $3.8 million for the nine month period ended June 30, 2019 as compared to the prior fiscal year period. The $1.4 million increase in Asia is primarily the result of increased product sales by our HPP segment of approximately $1.2 million.  
 Our total revenues increased by approximately $3.6 million to $56.9 million for the nine months ended June 30, 2019 as compared to $53.3 million of revenues for the nine months ended June 30, 2018.  
 The $3.0 million increase in revenue to the Americas is primarily the result of increased sales by our TS segment of $4.5 million partially offset by decreased sales by our HPP segment of $1.5 million. The $2.3 million decrease in revenue to Europe is primarily the result of decreased sales by our TS segment of $2.2 million. The $0.8 million increase in revenue to Asia is primarily the result of increased sales by our HPP segment of Myricom product to a major customer.  
 Our revenues increased by approximately $3.6 million, or 7%, to $56.9 million for the nine months ended June 30, 2019 as compared to $53.3 million for the nine months ended June 30, 2018. The increase in overall revenue for the nine month period ended June 30, 2019 as compared to the prior fiscal year nine month period was substantially the result of an approximately $5.2 million increase in our TS segment revenue, partially offset by an approximately $1.6 million decrease in our HPP segment revenue. The TS segment revenue for the nine month period ended June 30, 2019 was primarily impacted by the fulfillment of several large product orders in the U.S. division and increased volume in services revenue. The HPP segment revenue for the nine month period ended June 30, 2019 was primarily impacted by lower royalties recognized of approximately $1.4 million on high-speed processing boards during the nine months ended June 30, 2019 as compared to the nine month period ended June 30, 2018. Our overall gross margin percentage decreased to 23% of revenue for the nine month period ended June 30, 2019 from 25% of revenues for the nine months ended June 30, 2018. Our operating loss increased by approximately $0.1 million resulting in an operating loss of $0.6 million for the nine month period ended June 30, 2019 as compared to operating loss of $0.5 million for the nine months ended June 30, 2018, primarily as a result of decreased gross margin partially offset by a decrease in engineering expenses of approximately $0.3 million and a decrease in selling and marketing expenses of $0.2 million for the nine month period ended June 30, 2019 as compared to the prior year period. Our income tax expense decreased by approximately $1.7 million to an income tax benefit of $0.5 million for the nine months ended June 30, 2019. The income tax provision for the nine month period is not comparable to the same period of the prior year due to the impact of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act in the prior year.  
 The overall TS segment gross margin as a percentage of sales increased to 19% for the three month period ended June 30, 2019 from 18% for the three month period ended June 30, 2018. The overall TS segment gross margin as a percentage of sales increase was primarily due to an increased margin as a percentage of sales in services for both the U.S. and U.K division partially offset by a decreased margin as a percentage of sales in products in the U.S. and U.K. division.  
 The overall HPP segment gross margin as a percentage of sales decreased to 56% for the three months ended June 30, 2019 from 69% for the three months ended June 30, 2018. The 13% decrease in gross margin as a percentage of sales in the HPP segment was primarily attributed to a $0.8 million decrease in high margin royalty revenues within the overall product mix.
