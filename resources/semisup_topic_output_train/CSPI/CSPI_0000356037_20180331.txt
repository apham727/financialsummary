The following tables present certain operating segment information for the three months ended March 31, 2018 and March 31, 2017.
The following table lists customers from which the Company derived revenues in excess of 10% of total revenues for the three and six months ended March 31, 2018, and 2017.
Non-vested restricted stock awards of 168,000 and 169,000 shares were excluded from the diluted loss per share calculation for the three and six months ended March 31, 2018, respectively, as there was a net loss and their inclusion would have been anti-dilutive. 
Finished goods includes inventory that has been shipped, but for which all revenue recognition criteria has not been met, of approximately $0.2 million and $0.4 million as of March 31, 2018 and September 30, 2017, respectively.
In July 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-11, Inventory (Topic 330) Simplifying the Measurement of Inventory, which requires entities to measure inventory at the lower of cost and net realizable value, except for inventory measured using last-in, first-out (LIFO) or the retail inventory method. Net realizable value is the estimated selling prices in the ordinary course of business, less reasonably predictable costs of completion, disposal, and transportation. This ASU is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016, and interim periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017 and requires prospective application, with early adoption permitted as of the beginning of an interim or annual reporting period. The Company has not yet assessed the potential impact of implementing this ASU on our consolidated financial statements.
In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, which requires an entity to recognize the amount of revenue to which it expects to be entitled for the transfer of promised goods or services to customers. The ASU will replace most existing revenue recognition guidance in GAAP when it becomes effective. The new standard is effective for the Company on October 1, 2018, and it does not plan to early adopt this ASU. The standard outlines a five-step model whereby revenue is recognized as performance obligations within a contract are satisfied. The standard also requires new, expanded disclosures regarding revenue recognition. We are utilizing a bottom-up approach to analyze the standard's impact on our contract portfolio, comparing our historical accounting policies and practices, and identifying potential differences from applying the requirements of the new standard to our contracts. While this assessment continues, we have not yet completed our determination of the impacts of the standard or the effect of these impacts on our consolidated financial statements. The Company has selected the modified retrospective approach as its transition method. Because the new standard will impact our business processes, systems and controls, we are developing a comprehensive change management project plan to guide the implementation.
Total inventory balances in the table above are shown net of reserves for obsolescence of approximately $3.4 million and $3.1 million as of March 31, 2018 and September 30, 2017, respectively.
accounts receivable with these customers as of March 31, 2018. No other customers accounted for 10% or more of total consolidated accounts receivable as of March 31, 2018. 
In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-08 (Topic 606), Principal versus Agent Considerations (Reporting Revenue Gross versus Net) to clarify the implementation guidance on principal versus agent considerations. The amendments in this update provides additional guidance on indicators to assist an entity in determining whether it controls a specified good or service before it is transferred to the customer and does not change the core principle of previously issued guidance. The amendments in this Topic are effective for financial statements issued for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2017, and interim periods within those annual periods. The Company does not expect the implementation of this ASU to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. Our gross margin ("GM") decreased by $0.8 million to $4.9 million for the three months ended March 31, 2018 as compared to a gross margin of $5.7 million for the three months ended March 31, 2017. The GM as a percentage of revenue was 22% for the three months ended March 31, 2018, unchanged from the three months ended March 31, 2017.
 Our revenues decreased by approximately $3.3 million to $22.0 million for the three months ended March 31, 2018 as compared to $25.3 million of revenues for the three months ended March 31, 2017. TS segment revenues decreased by $1.7 million, and HPP segment revenues decreased by $1.6 million. 
The $1.3 million decrease in total revenues is primarily attributed to our HPP segment. The $0.4 million decrease in Asia is primarily the result of decreased product sales by our HPP segment to a major customer of approximately $0.7 million, partially offset by increased sales by our TS segment of $0.4 million. The $0.3 million decrease in Americas is primarily due to decreased revenues by our HPP segment of approximately $1.2 million, partially offset by increased sales by our TS segment U.S. division of approximately $0.9 million. The $0.5 million decrease in Europe revenue is primarily due to decreased sales by our German division of our TS segment.
 Our total revenues decreased by $1.3 million to $44.0 million for the six months ended March 31, 2018 as compared $45.2 million of revenues for the six months ended March 31, 2017. 
The $2.3 million decrease in revenue to Europe is primarily the result of decreased sales by our TS segment U.K. division of $1.3 million to a U.S. division multi-national customer, combined with decreased sales by our TS segment German division of $1.0 million. The 0.6 million decrease in revenue to Asia is primarily the result of decreased multicomputer product sales by our HPP segment to a major customer as the result of a large one time order in the three months ended March 31, 2017. 
Our revenues decreased by approximately $1.3 million, or 3%, to $44.0 million for the six months ended March 31, 2018 as compared to $45.2 million for the six months ended March 31, 2017. The decrease in overall revenue for the six month period ended March 31, 2018 as compared to prior fiscal year six month period was the result of an approximately $1.9 million decrease in our HPP segment revenue, partially offset by an increase of approximately $0.6 million in our TS segment. The HPP segment revenue was primarily impacted by lower royalties recognized of approximately $0.8 million on high-speed processing boards during the six months ended March 31, 2018 as compared $2.2 million of royalty revenues for the six month period ended March 31, 2017. Our gross margin percentage increased overall, from 22% of revenues for the six months ended March 31, 2017, to 23% for the six months ended March 31, 2018. Our operating income decreased by approximately $1.2 million to to an operating loss of $0.7 million for the six month period ended March 31, 2018 as compared to operating income of $0.5 million for the six months ended March 31, 2017, primarily as a result of increased selling and marketing expenses and increased engineering expenses. Our income tax expense increased by approximately $778 thousand to an income tax expense of $974 thousand for the six months ended March 31, 2018 as compared to an income tax expense of $196 thousand for the six months ended March 31, 2017. The increase to the income tax expense was primarily due to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act which was enacted on December 22, 2017.
Engineering and development expenses increased by $0.3 million to $1.5 million for the six months ended March 31, 2018 as compared to $1.2 million for the six months ended March 31, 2017. The current period expenses were primarily for Myricom product engineering expenses incurred in connection with the development of the new Myricom ARIA security products. The increased engineering and development expenses for the six month period ended March 31, 2018 as compared to the six month period ended March 31, 2017 is primarily attributed to an increase in engineering headcount related expenses.
 The overall TS segment gross margin as a percentage of sales increased to 20% for the three month period ended March 31, 2018 from 16% for the three month period ended March 31, 2017. The overall TS segment gross margin as a percentage of sales increase was primarily due to increased product margins and increased higher margin service revenue in our U.S. division.
The decrease in HPP product revenues for the period of $0.4 million was primarily the result of a decrease of approximately $0.8 million in Multicomputer product line shipments, partially due to a large shipment in the prior fiscal year period, partially offset by an increase in Myricom product line shipments of $0.4 million for the six months ended March 31, 2018 as compared to the six months ended March 31, 2017. The decrease in HPP services revenues of $1.5 million for the During the periods following our initial identification of the material weakness referred to above, management assessed various alternatives to remediate this material weakness and we implemented changes to our system of internal controls, which included the implementation of enhanced internal auditing procedures, whereby revenue transactions are subjected to an additional review process at the corporate level to ensure the correct accounting methodology is applied to all revenue transactions. During the three months ended March 31, 2018, management continued to take actions to improve accounting operations in our European divisions. Although we have implemented such changes to our internal controls over financial reporting as described above, at this time, we cannot conclude that the material weakness has been remediated and we will continue to evaluate personnel changes and upgrade systems and processes throughout fiscal year 2018 as necessary.
