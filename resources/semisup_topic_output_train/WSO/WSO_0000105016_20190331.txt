Effective April 22, 2019, our first joint venture with Carrier, Carrier Enterprise I acquired an additional 1.8% ownership interest in Russell Sigler, Inc. (RSI) for cash consideration of $4,940, of which we contributed $3,952 and Carrier contributed $988. This acquisition increased Carrier Enterprise Is ownership interest in RSI to 38.1%.  
Purchases from Carrier and its affiliates comprised 61% and 62% of all inventory purchases made during the quarters ended March 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. At March 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018, approximately $101,000 and $71,000, respectively, was payable to Carrier and its affiliates, net of receivables. Our joint ventures with Carrier also sell HVAC products to Carrier and its affiliates. Revenues in our condensed consolidated unaudited statements of income for the quarters ended March 31, 2019 and 2018 included approximately $21,000 and $16,000, respectively, of sales to Carrier and its affiliates. We believe these transactions are conducted on terms equivalent to an arms-length basis in the ordinary course of business.  
We paid cash dividends of $1.60 and $1.25 per share of Common stock and Class B common stock during the quarters ended March 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively.  
We recognized losses of $113 and $371 from foreign currency forward and option contracts not designated as hedging instruments in our condensed consolidated unaudited statements of income for the quarters ended March 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively.  
The condensed consolidated unaudited financial statements contained in this report include the accounts of Watsco, all of its wholly owned subsidiaries and the accounts of three joint ventures with Carrier Corporation (Carrier), in each of which Watsco maintains a controlling interest. All significant intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.  
A member of our Board of Directors is the Senior Chairman of Greenberg Traurig, P.A., which serves as our principal outside counsel and receives customary fees for legal services. During the quarters ended March 31, 2019 and 2018, we paid this firm $0 and $4, respectively, for services performed, and no amount was payable at both March 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018.  
At March 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018, $137,500 and $135,200, respectively, were outstanding under the revolving credit agreement. The revolving credit agreement contains customary affirmative and negative covenants, including financial covenants with respect to consolidated leverage and interest coverage ratios, and other customary restrictions. We believe we were in compliance with all covenants at March 31, 2019.  
During the quarter ended March 31, 2019, 2,985 shares of Common and Class B common stock with an aggregate fair market value of $428 were withheld as payment in lieu of cash to satisfy tax withholding obligations in connection with the vesting of restricted stock. These shares were retired upon delivery.  
The following table summarizes the fair value of derivative instruments, which consist solely of foreign exchange contracts, included in other current assets and accrued expenses and other current liabilities in our condensed consolidated unaudited balance sheets. See Note 8.  Net income attributable to Watsco for the quarter ended March 31, 2019 increased $0.8 million, or 2%, compared to the same period in 2018. The increase was primarily driven by higher revenues, expanded profit margins, and lower income taxes, as discussed above.  
Selling, general and administrative expenses for the first quarter of 2019 increased $1.5 million, or 1%, primarily due to increased revenues. Selling, general and administrative expenses as a percent of revenues for the quarter ended March 31, 2019 remained consistent at 19.3% as compared to the same period in 2018. On a same-store basis, selling, general and administrative expenses were flat as compared to the same period in 2018 and declined 10 basis-points to 19.2% as a percent of revenues.  
Other income of $1.4 million and $1.6 million for the first quarters of 2019 and 2018, respectively, represents our share of the net income of RSI.  
Revenues for the first quarter of 2019 increased $4.7 million, or 1%, including $4.1 million from locations opened and acquired during the preceding 12 months, offset by $2.7 million from locations closed. On a same-store basis, revenues increased $3.3 million, as compared to the same period in 2018, reflecting a 2% increase in sales of HVAC equipment (67% of sales), a 2% decrease in sales of other HVAC products (29% of sales) and a 4% decrease in sales of commercial refrigeration products (4% of sales). For HVAC equipment, the increase in revenues was primarily due to realization of price increases and a higher mix of high-efficiency air conditioning and heating systems, which sell at higher unit prices, resulting in a 2% increase in the average selling price, partially offset by a 1% decrease in volume.  
Net Income Attributable to Watsco, Inc.  
the continued viability of our business strategy.  
The increase in net cash provided by operating activities was primarily due to the comparative timing of payments for accrued expenses and other current liabilities in 2019 versus 2018.  
The following narratives reflect our acquisition of Alert Labs, Inc. in August 2018, our acquisition of an HVAC distributor in November 2018 and the purchase of an additional 1.4% ownership interest in Russell Sigler, Inc. (RSI) in June 2018. We did not acquire any businesses during the quarter ended March 31, 2019.  
Interest expense, net, for the first quarter of 2019 increased $0.2 million, or 37%, primarily as a result of an increase in average outstanding borrowings, partially offset by a lower effective interest rate for the 2019 period, in each case under our revolving credit facility, as compared to the same period in 2018.  
Income taxes decreased to $10.6 million for the first quarter of 2019, as compared to $11.0 million for the first quarter of 2018 and represent a composite of the income taxes attributable to our wholly owned operations and income taxes attributable to the Carrier joint ventures, which are primarily taxed as partnerships for income tax purposes; therefore, Carrier is responsible for its proportionate share of income taxes attributable to its share of earnings. The effective income tax rates attributable to us were 22.7% and 23.8% for the quarters ended March 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. The decrease was primarily due to higher share-based payment deductions in the first quarter of 2019 as compared to the same period in 2018.
