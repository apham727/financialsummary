The Company completed the Fiscal 2017 Plan in the third quarter of fiscal 2018.For the third quarter of fiscal 2018, as compared with the third quarter of fiscal 2017, operating income decreased by 1% and as a percentage of revenue operating income decreased by 1.4 percentage points.
For the first nine months of fiscal 2018, as compared with the first nine months of fiscal 2017, operating income was flat and as a percentage of revenue operating income decreased by 0.3 percentage points.
The decrease in routing revenue was driven by continued weakness in the service provider market and a slowdown in enterprise routing sales.

Total revenue increased 2%, with product revenue increasing 1% and service revenue increasing 2%.We expect this trend to continue as companies attempt to strengthen or hold their market positions in an evolving industry and as companies are acquired or are unable to continue operations.
Product orders from the service provider market decreased in the first nine months of fiscal 2018 and in fiscal 2017, and at various times in the past we have experienced significant weakness in product orders from service providers.
