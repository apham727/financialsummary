 During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018, one of our manufacturing sites in China was found to have failed to complete the environmental impact assessment inspection for certain of its production lines and assets within the mandatory timeframe as defined within applicable environmental regulation.
At the request of the Shanghai Xuhui Environmental Protection Bureau, we are taking remedial actions to cure the deficiencies, and we paid an administrative penalty in the amount of 700,000 Chinese renminbi (approximately $0.1 million using an exchange rate of $0.15 per renminbi).
