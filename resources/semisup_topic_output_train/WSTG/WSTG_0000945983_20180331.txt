 The increase in cash from changes in operating assets and liabilities for the three months ended March 31, 2018 was primarily due to a decrease in net working capital (accounts receivable, inventory, and vendor prepayments less accounts payable) resulting from the utilization of vendor prepayments made in the prior year.
