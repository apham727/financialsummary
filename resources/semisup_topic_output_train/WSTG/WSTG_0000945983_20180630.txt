TechXtend segment gross profit margin for the quarter ended June 30, 2018 was 21.9%, compared to 26.1% in 2017. The decrease in gross profit margin was primarily caused by the change in the percentage mix of our products which are recorded net of the related cost of sales. During the three months ended June 30, 2018 approximately 8.7 percent of our net sales was attributable to security, maintenance and third-party service products which are recorded on a net basis, or an effective 100% gross profit margin, compared to 10.5% in 2017. This shift in product mix had the effect of reducing gross profit as a percent of net sales by 170 basis points. The remainder of the decline was caused by lower gross profit margin on Software and hardware products recorded on a gross basis, as growth in these products was primarily from high volume lines which are sold at lower gross profit margin than our average gross profit. We operate in a competitive environment where the trend has been and may continue to be for gross profit margins as a percentage of adjusted gross billings to decline.
