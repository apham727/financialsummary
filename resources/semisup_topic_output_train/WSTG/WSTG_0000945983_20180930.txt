 Gross profit margin (gross profit as a percentage of net sales) for the quarter ended September 30, 2018 was 13.2% compared to 16.0% in 2017. Lifeboat Distribution segment gross profit margin was 12.8% for the quarter ended September 30, 2018, compared to 15.6% in 2017. TechXtend segment gross profit margin for the quarter ended September 30, 2018 was 17.6%, compared to 19.2% in 2017. The decrease in gross profit margin was primarily caused by lower gross profit margins as a percent of net sales for hardware and software product sales which are reported on a gross basis and a change in the percentage mix of our products which are recorded net of the related cost of sales. During the three months ended September 30, 2018 approximately 8.0% of our net sales was attributable to security, maintenance and third-party service products which are recorded on a net basis, or an effective 100% gross profit margin, compared to 8.9% in 2017. This shift in product mix had the effect of reducing gross profit as a percent of net sales by 100 basis points. The remainder of the decline was caused by lower gross profit margin on software and hardware products recorded on a gross basis, as growth in these products was primarily from high volume lines which are sold at lower gross profit margin than our average gross profit. We operate in a competitive environment where the trend has been and may continue to be for gross profit margins as a percentage of adjusted gross billings to decline.
