In the fourth quarter, Optical Communications sales are expected to decrease approximately 25 percent year-over-year. We expect full-year sales to decline 3 to 5 percent.
This strong performance is expected to continue in the fourth quarter, with sales growth up by a low-teen percentage year over year, leading to full-year sales growth expectations of a mid-teen percentage.
Net sales of this segment decreased by $2 million, or 4%, and increased by $4 million, or 3% for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2019 when compared to the same periods in 2018, driven primarily by sales changes in our emerging businesses. Net loss decreased by $2 million, or 3%, and $14 million, or 6%, primarily driven by lower spending on development projects when compared to the same periods in 2018.
Net income increased by $19 million, or 32%, and $33 million, or 20%, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2019, respectively, primarily driven by increases in sales outlined above. 
For the nine months ended September 30, 2019, net sales increased $135 million, or 4%, primarily due to increased sales of enterprise network products of $152 million offset by lower sales of $17 million for carrier products. The acquisition of CMD, which took place during June of 2018, contributed to year-over-year sales growth.
The decreases in net income outlined above were slightly offset by higher net income for the Environmental Technologies and Life Sciences segments of $19 million and $11 million, respectively.
Net sales in the Environmental Technologies segment increased $66 million, or 20%, and $155 million, or 16%, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2019, respectively. Automotive product sales increased $70 million and $125 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2019, due to continued sales growth of gasoline particulate filters. Diesel product sales decreased $4 million and increased $30 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2019, respectively. 
For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2019, research, development and engineering expenses increased by $11 million, or 5%, and $25 million, or 3%, respectively, when compared to the same periods last year, driven by higher costs associated with new product launches and our emerging businesses. As a percentage of sales, these expenses were similar when compared to the same periods last year. 
Net income increased by $11 million, or 37%, and $24 million, or 27%, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2019, respectively. The increase was driven by the sales increase outlined above and improved manufacturing efficiencies. 
Net cash used in investing activities decreased by $732 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2019 when compared to the same period last year, primarily driven by last year’s acquisition of substantially all of CMD for approximately $800 million.
Net income in the Display Technologies segment decreased by $33 million and increased by $11 million in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2019, respectively, driven by the changes in sales outlined above. 
Net income decreased by $24 million, or 21%, and $18 million, or 8% for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2019, impacted by the sales drivers outlined above.
Net income decreased by $41 million, or 24%, and remained flat, respectively, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2019, primarily driven by the changes in sales, outlined above.
The company expects full-year sales growth, despite a maturing smartphone market. For the fourth-quarter, sales are expected to be consistent year over year.
Lower segment net income of $33 million, $41 million and $24 million for the Display Technologies, Optical Communications and Specialty Materials segments, respectively.
For the three months ended September 30, 2019, we generated core net income of $397 million, or $0.44 per share, compared to core net income generated in the three months ended September 30, 2018 of $476 million, or $0.51 per share. The decrease of $79 million was due to lower net income across the Display Technologies, Optical Communications and Specialty Materials segments, partially offset by higher net income for the Environmental Technologies and Life Sciences segments.
Net sales in the Specialty Materials segment increased by $4 million, or 1%, and $61 million, or 6%, respectively, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2019. Increased sales of Gorilla Glass and Advanced Optics products drove the increase for the first half of 2019. However, third quarter shipments of Gorilla Glass in China were lower due to the current trade environment and sales of Advanced Optics products were down due to semiconductor market weakness. 
Net sales in the Life Sciences segment increased by $25 million, or 11%, and $51 million, or 7%, respectively, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2019, as volume grew faster than the underlying market.© 2019 Corning Incorporated. All Rights Reserved.
