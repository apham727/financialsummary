The increase was led by the Optical Communications segment, which increased $178 million, due to higher sales of carrier network products in North America, an increase in sales of enterprise network products from growth in hyper-scale data centers and sales from our acquisition of 3M’s Communication Markets Division (“CMD”). Net sales in the Display Technologies segment increased by $73 million for the three months ended March 31, 2019, with volumes exceeding the display glass market’s growth and more than offsetting price declines.  The Specialty Materials segment net sales increased by $31 million resulting from strong demand for Gorilla Glass and Advanced Optics products. Net sales for Environmental Technologies increased $40 million driven primarily by sales growth of gas particulate filters. Life Sciences sales increased by $11 million.   
 Net income in the Display Technologies segment increased by $23 million, or 12%, in the three months ended March 31, 2019, for the reasons outlined in the above paragraph.  
   ·    An increase of $11 million in the Life Sciences segment, driven by higher sales in all product categories. 
 We believe 2019 will be another year of strong growth and investment, consistent with our Strategy and Capital Allocation Framework. In our Display Technologies segment, we expect full year 2019 price declines to improve further to a mid-single digit percentage. We anticipate Corning’s display glass volume will grow faster than the expected display glass market growth of mid-single digits, driven by television screen size growth and the ramp of our Gen 10.5 facility in China. In the Optical Communications segment, we expect sales to increase approximately ten percent, including the impact of a full year of sales from the acquisition of CMD. We expect growth in the Specialty Materials segment, the rate of which will depend on the adoption of our innovations. We expect approximately ten percent or slightly higher sales growth in our Environmental Technologies segment.  We anticipate low to mid-single digit percentage growth in sales for the Life Sciences segment.    © 2019 Corning Incorporated. All Rights Reserved.
