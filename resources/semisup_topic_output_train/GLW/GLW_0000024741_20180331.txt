 For the three months ended March 31, 2018, research, development and engineering expenses increased by $39 million, or 19%, when compared to the same period last year, driven by higher costs associated with new product launches and our emerging businesses. As a percentage of sales, these expenses increased slightly in the first quarter, when compared to the same period last year.   
 Net sales in the three months ended March 31, 2018 were $2,500 million, compared to $2,375 million in the same period in 2017.  The increase was driven by higher sales in the Optical Communications, Environmental Technologies and Life Sciences segments, up $68 million, $47 million and $22 million, respectively.   
 Net sales of this segment increased by $14 million, or 39%, in the three months ended March 31, 2018, when compared to the same period in 2017, driven by an increase in sales in our emerging businesses. The increase in the net loss in the first quarter of $14 million, or 23%, reflects higher losses in our development projects.   
 In the second quarter, Optical Communications sales are expected to increase by a low-teens percentage on a year-over-year basis.  
 Net sales in the Optical Communications segment increased by $68 million, or 8%, in the first quarter of 2018, due to higher sales of carrier and enterprise network products, up $49 million and $19 million, respectively. Strong growth in the North American and European fiber-to-the-home market drove the increase in carrier network products, and an increase in hyper-scale data centers drove the increase in enterprise network.  
 In the three months ended March 31, 2018, we generated core earnings of $299 million or $0.31 per share, compared to core earnings generated in the three months ended March 31, 2017 of $376 million, or $0.36 per share. The decrease of $77 million was primarily due to lower net income in the Display Technologies and Specialty Materials segments, down $60 million and $11 million, respectively, as well as lower earnings in emerging businesses, down $14 million. An increase in net income of $8 million in the Environmental Technologies segment partially offset the decrease.   
 Net cash used in investing activities increased by $318 million in the three months ended March 31, 2018 when compared to the same period last year, driven by an increase of $291 million in capital expenditures largely due to capacity expansion projects in our Display Technologies and Optical Communications segments.  
 Net income in the first quarter of 2018 decreased by $1 million, or 1%, driven by costs associated with our planned capacity expansions, plus investments in new customers and technology, offset by the increase in sales described above.   
 Net sales in the Life Sciences segment increased by $22 million, or 10%, in the first quarter of 2018 when compared to the same period in 2017, driven by higher sales in North America and China. Movements in foreign exchange rates impacted net sales in the amount of $9 million in the three months ended March 31, 2018 when compared to the same period in 2017.  
   ·    An increase of $18 million in corporate spending primarily related to new information technology platforms and outside legal fees. 
   -    other risks detailed in Corning’s SEC filings. 
 Capital spending totaled $655 million and $364 million in the three months ended March 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. We expect our 2018 capital expenditures to be slightly more than $2.0 billion, driven by expansions related to the Gen 10.5 glass manufacturing facility, the addition of capacity to support the new gas-particulate filters business in the Environmental Technologies segment and investment to support growth in customer demand in the Optical Communications and Specialty Materials segments.  
 Net income in the first quarter of 2018 increased by $3 million, or 13%, driven by the increase in sales described above. Movements in foreign exchange rates did not materially impact net income in the three months ended March 31, 2018 when compared to the same period in 2017.  
 We believe 2018 will be another year of strong growth and investment, consistent with our Strategy and Capital Allocation Framework, and anticipate that segment net sales will grow to approximately $11 billion. In our Display Technologies segment, we expect pricing to continue to improve, with year-over-year declines reaching mid-single digits, an important milestone toward our goal of stabilizing returns. We anticipate Corning’s LCD glass volume will grow faster than the expected LCD glass market growth of mid-single digits, driven by the ramp of our Gen 10.5 facility in China. In the Optical Communications segment, we expect sales to increase by about 10%, excluding any contribution from the pending acquisition of 3M’s Communications Market Division, driven by strong demand from carrier and enterprise network customers, supported by our planned capacity additions. We expect growth in the Specialty Materials segment, the rate of which will depend on new model launches and the adoption of our innovations. We expect sales growth of approximately 10% in our Environmental Technologies segment, driven by continued strength in automotive product sales, on-going improvements in the heavy-duty diesel market and from the commercial launch of gas-particulate filters. We anticipate mid-single digit growth in the Life Sciences segment.  
   ·    An increase of $22 million in the Life Sciences segment, driven by higher sales in North America and China. 
 Net sales in the Environmental Technologies segment increased $47 million, or 17%, in the first quarter of 2018 when compared to the same period in 2017. Automotive product sales increased by $22 million, due to market strength in Europe, China and North America, and continued sales growth of gas particulate filters. Diesel product sales increased $25 million, driven by higher demand for heavy-duty diesel products in North America and Europe. Movements in foreign exchange rates impacted net sales in the amount of $20 million when compared to the same period in 2017.  
 Our probability of success increases as we invest in our world-class capabilities. Corning is concentrating approximately 80% of its research, development and engineering investment and capital spending on a cohesive set of three core technologies, four manufacturing and engineering platforms, and five market-access platforms. This strategy allows us to quickly apply our talents and repurpose our assets as needed.    © 2018 Corning Incorporated. All Rights Reserved.
