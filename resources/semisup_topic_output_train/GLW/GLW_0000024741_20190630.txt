Net sales of this segment increased by $2 million, or 4%, and $6 million, or 6% for the three and six months ended June 30, 2019 when compared to the same periods in 2018, driven primarily by an increase in sales in our emerging businesses. Net loss decreased by $10 million, or 13%, and $12 million, or 8%, primarily driven by the increase in sales.
Net income increased by $8 million, or 5%, and $41 million, or 16%, respectively, for the three and six months ended June 30, 2019. The increase was driven by the increase in sales, outlined above.
Net income increased by $11 million, or 20%, and $14 million, or 13%, for the three and six months ended June 30, 2019, respectively. The increase was driven by the sales increase outlined above. 
Net income increased by $3 million, or 5%, and $6 million, or 5% for the three and six months ended June 30, 2019, primarily driven by the increase in sales outlined above. 
Net cash used in investing activities decreased by $721 million in the six months ended June 30, 2019 when compared to the same period last year, primarily resulting from the absence of acquisition costs in the current period. We acquired CMD in the second quarter of 2018 for a cash cost of $794 million.
For the three and six months ended June 30, 2019, research, development and engineering expenses increased by $6 million, or 2%, and $14 million, or 3%, respectively, when compared to the same periods last year, driven by higher costs associated with new product launches and our emerging businesses. As a percentage of sales, these expenses decreased by 1% and remained constant, respectively, when compared to the same periods last year. 
Net sales in the Life Sciences segment increased by $15 million, or 6%, and $26 million, or 5%, respectively, for the three and six months ended June 30, 2019. 
Net sales in the Optical Communications segment increased by $67 million, or 7%, and $245 million, or 13%, respectively, for the three and six months ended June 30, 2019. Sales of enterprise network products increased by $83 million and $157 million, respectively, largely due to growth from multi-year hyperscale data center projects. Sales in carrier networks decreased by $16 million and increased by $88 million, respectively. Sales of fiber were more than offset by a decrease in sales of North American fiber-to-the-home during the current quarter. The acquisition of CMD, which took place during the second quarter of 2018, also contributed to sales growth for both periods.
Net sales for the three and six months ended June 30, 2019 were $2,940 million and $5,752 million, compared to $2,747 million and $5,247 million, respectively, during the same periods in 2018. Net sales in the Optical Communications segment increased $67 million and $245 million, respectively. Growth from multi-year hyperscale data center projects drove the increase in enterprise sales in both periods. Sales in carrier networks were down in the three months and up in the six months ended June 30, 2019. Increased sales of fiber were more than offset by a decrease in sales of North American fiber-to-the-home during the current quarter. The acquisition of 3M’s Communication Markets Division (“CMD”), which took place during the second quarter of 2018, also contributed to sales growth. Net sales in the Display Technologies segment increased by $68 million and $141 million, respectively, for the three and six months ended June 30, 2019, with volume increases in the mid-teens in percentage terms more than offsetting moderate price declines.  The Specialty Materials segment net sales increased by $26 million and $57 million, respectively, resulting from higher sales of Gorilla Glass products in both periods and higher sales of Advanced Optics products contributing to year-to-date results. Net sales for Environmental Technologies increased $49 million and $89 million, respectively, driven by sales growth of gas particulate filters and heavy-duty diesel products. Life Sciences sales increased by $15 million and $26 million, respectively. 
In the third quarter, Optical Communications sales are expected to decrease by low-single digits on a year-over-year basis.
Net income increased by $9 million, or 29%, and $13 million, or 22%, for the three and six months ended June 30, 2019, respectively. The increase was driven by the sales increase outlined above and improved manufacturing efficiencies. 
Net sales in the Environmental Technologies segment increased $49 million, or 15%, and $89 million, or 14%, for the three and six months ended June 30, 2019, respectively. Automotive product sales increased $31 million and $55 million for the three and six months ended June 30, 2019, due to continued sales growth of gas particulate filters. Diesel product sales increased $18 million and $34 million for the three and six months ended June 30, 2019, respectively, driven by heavy-duty sales growth in North America and China.  
Net sales in the Specialty Materials segment increased by $26 million, or 8%, and $57 million, or 9%, respectively, for the three and six months ended June 30, 2019. Higher sales of Gorilla Glass products were the primary driver of the sales increase in the current quarter, while increased sales of Gorilla Glass and Advanced Optics products drove the increase for the six months ended June 30, 2019. 
Net income in the Display Technologies segment increased by $21 million and $44 million in the three and six months ended June 30, 2019, respectively, driven by the increase in sales outlined above.
For the three months ended June 30, 2019, we generated core earnings of $410 million, or $0.45 per share, compared to core earnings generated in the three months ended June 30, 2018 of $359 million, or $0.38 per share.
