 For the three months ended June 30, 2018, research, development and engineering expenses increased by $37 million, or 18%, when compared to the same period last year, driven by higher costs associated with new product launches and our emerging businesses. As a percentage of sales, these expenses increased slightly when compared to the same period last year.   
 In the third quarter, Optical Communications sales are expected to increase by approximately 25% on a year-over-year basis, including the impact of the acquisition of 3M’s Communications Market Division.  
 Net sales of this segment increased by $4 million, or 9%, and $18 million, 22%, for the three and six months ended June 30, 2018, when compared to the same period in 2017, driven by an increase in sales in our emerging businesses. The increase in the net loss of $16 million, or 26%, and $30 million, or 25%, reflects higher spending in our development projects when compared to the corresponding three and six month periods ending June 30, 2017.  
 Net sales in the Specialty Materials segment increased by $6 million, or 2%, during the second quarter of 2018 when compared to the same period in 2017. Net sales for the six months ended June 30, 2018, decreased by $16 million, or 3%. Net income decreased by $6 million, or 9%, and $17 million, or 13% for the three and six months ended June 30, 2018, primarily driven by development costs for new technology. Improvements in manufacturing efficiency partially offset the decline.  
 Net sales in the three and six months ended June 30, 2018 were $2,747 million and $5,247 million, compared to $2,497 million and $4,872 million, respectively, in the same periods in 2017, driven by an increase in net sales in all segments. The increase in both periods was led by the Optical Communications segment, which increased $141 million and $209 million, respectively, due to higher sales of carrier network products in North American and Europe, and an increase in sales of enterprise network products from growth in data centers. Environmental Technologies segment sales increased $54 million and $101 million, respectively, driven by higher sales of all products. Life Sciences sales increased by $24 million and $46 million, respectively, driven by higher sales across all product lines. Net sales in the Display Technologies and Specialty Materials segments increased by $3 million and $6 million, respectively, for the three months ended June 30, 2018.  
 Net sales in the Optical Communications segment increased by $141 million, or 16%, and $209 million, or 12%, for the three and six months ended June 30, 2018, respectively. Higher sales of carrier products, up $96 million and $145 million, and enterprise network products, up $45 million and $64 million, respectively, drove the increase. Strong growth in the North American and European fiber-to-the-home and access markets drove the increase in carrier network products, and an increase in data centers drove the increase in enterprise network sales.  
 Net income in the Display Technologies segment decreased by $34 million and $94 million in the three and six months ended June 30, 2018, respectively. Increased manufacturing costs of $33 million and $45 million, respectively, driven by the impact of the start-up of our facility in Hefei, China were the primary driver of the decrease for the three and six months ended June 30, 2018. Additionally, for the six months ended June 30, 2018, the glass price declines described above contributed to the decrease and were partially offset by increases in volume.   
Net sales in the Environmental Technologies segment increased $54 million, or 21%, and $101 million, or 19%, for the three and six months ended June 30, 2018, respectively. Automotive product sales increased $30 million and $52 million for the three and six months ended June 30, 2018, due to global market strength and continued sales growth of gas particulate filters. Diesel product sales increased $24 million and $49 million for the three and six months ended June 30, 2018, respectively. The increases were driven by higher demand for heavy-duty diesel products in North America and Europe.  Movements in foreign exchange rates impacted net sales in the amounts of $12 million and $32 million when compared to the corresponding three and six-month periods in 2017.  
 Net sales in the Display Technologies segment increased by $3 million, and decreased by $34 million in the three and six months ended June 30, 2018, respectively. LCD glass price declines essentially offset increased sales volume for the second quarter of 2018. Net sales decreased by $34 million for the six months ended June 30, 2018, or 2%, primarily due to LCD glass price declines in the high single digits in percentage terms, partially offset by an increase in volume during the first quarter of 2018. The second quarter pricing environment was the most favorable in more than a decade.  
 We believe 2018 will be another year of strong growth and investment, consistent with our Strategy and Capital Allocation Framework, and anticipate that segment net sales will reach approximately $11.3 billion, an increase from prior expectations of $11.0 billion. In our Display Technologies segment, we expect pricing to continue to improve, with year-over-year declines reaching mid-single digits in the third quarter, an important milestone toward our goal of stabilizing returns. We anticipate Corning’s LCD glass volume will grow faster than the expected LCD glass market growth of mid-single digits, driven by the ramp of our Gen 10.5 facility in China. In the Optical Communications segment, we expect sales to increase in the high-teen percentage range with organic growth improving by a low-teen percentage range with an additional $200 million from the acquisition of 3M’s Communications Market Division, driven by strong demand from carrier and enterprise network customers. We expect growth in the Specialty Materials segment, the rate of which will depend on new model launches and the adoption of our innovations. We are increasing our expectation of sales growth to the mid-teen percentage range in our Environmental Technologies segment, driven by continued strength in automotive product sales, on-going improvements in the heavy-duty diesel market and from the commercial launch of gas-particulate filters. We are increasing our expectations to mid-to-high single digit percentage growth in the Life Sciences segment.  
 Net income increased by $22 million, or 17%, and $21 million, or 9%, for the three and six months ended June 30, 2018. The increase was driven by the change in sales outlined above. For the six months ended June 30, 2018, volume gains were partially offset by costs associated with our planned capacity expansions.  
 Net sales in the Life Sciences segment increased by $24 million, or 11%, and $46 million, or 11%, for the three and six months ended June 30, 2018, respectively, driven by higher sales in North America, Europe and China.
