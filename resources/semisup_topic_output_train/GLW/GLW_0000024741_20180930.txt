   ·    Increased acquisition related costs, up $21 million. 
 Net sales in the Specialty Materials segment increased by $86 million, or 23%, and $70 million, or 7%, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2018, driven primarily by increased Gorilla Glass sales. Net income increased by $30 million, or 35%, and $13 million, or 6% for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2018, primarily driven by the increase in sales and lower manufacturing costs.  
 In the three and nine months ended September 30, 2018, gross margin increased by $182 million, or 17%, and $271 million, or 9%, respectively, primarily driven by an increase in sales across all operating segments. Gross margin as a percentage of net sales increased by 1% for the three months ended September 30, 2018. Gross margin as a percentage of sales declined by 1% for the year to date period driven by glass price declines in the high-single digits in percentage terms, combined with spending for capacity expansions in the Display Technologies and Optical Communications segments.   
   ·    Lower segment net income in the All Other segment, down $8 million, resulting from continued investment in product development. 
 Net sales in the Optical Communications segment increased by $200 million, or 22%, and $409 million, or 16%, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2018, respectively. Higher sales of carrier products, up $107 million and $251 million, and enterprise network products, up $93 million and $158 million, respectively, drove the increase. Strong growth in the North American and European fiber-to-the-home and access markets drove the sales increase in carrier network products and growth in data centers drove the increase in enterprise sales. The acquisition of 3M’s Communications Market Division also contributed to sales growth.  
 Net sales of this segment increased by $5 million, or 10%, and $23 million, 17%, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2018, when compared to the same period in 2017, driven primarily by an increase in sales in our emerging businesses. The increase in the net loss of $8 million, or 13%, and $38 million, or 20%, reflects increased spending in our development projects when compared to the corresponding three and nine months ended September 30, 2017.  
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2018, research, development and engineering expenses increased by $105 million, or 17%, when compared to the same period last year, driven by higher costs associated with new product launches and our emerging businesses. As a percentage of sales, these expenses increased slightly when compared to the same period last year.   
   ·    A decrease of $8 million in the All Other segment resulting from increased investment in development projects. 
 Net sales for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2018 were $3.0 billion and $8.3 billion, compared to $2.6 billion and $7.5 billion, respectively, for the same periods in 2017, driven by an increase in net sales in all segments. The increase in both periods was led by the Optical Communications segment, which increased $200 million and $409 million, respectively, due to higher sales of carrier network products in North America and Europe, an increase in sales of enterprise network products from growth in data centers and sales from 3M’s Communications Market Division which we acquired in June. Net sales in the Display Technologies segment increased by $57 million and $23 million, respectively, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2018, with volumes exceeding the display glass market’s strong growth and more than offsetting price declines. The Specialty Materials segment net sales increased by $86 million and $70 million, respectively, resulting from strong demand for Gorilla Glass products in support of new product releases.  Net sales for Environmental Technologies increased $54 million and $155 million, respectively, driven by growth in all product categories. Life Sciences sales increased by $8 million and $54 million, respectively, driven by higher sales across all product lines.   
 Net sales in the Environmental Technologies segment increased $54 million, or 19%, and $155 million, or 19%, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2018, respectively. Automotive product sales increased $20 million and $72 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2018, due to global market strength and continued sales growth of gas particulate filters. Diesel product sales increased $34 million and $83 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2018, respectively. The increases were driven by higher demand for heavy-duty diesel products in North America and Europe. Movements in foreign exchange rates were not material when compared to the corresponding three-month period in 2017. The year to date impact is $29 million when compared to the corresponding nine-month period in 2017.  
 We believe 2018 will be another year of strong growth and investment, consistent with our Strategy and Capital Allocation Framework, and anticipate that segment net sales will exceed $11.3 billion. In our Display Technologies segment, we expect pricing to continue to improve, with moderate year-over-year declines during the fourth quarter, an important milestone toward our goal of stabilizing returns. For the full year, we anticipate Corning’s glass volume will grow faster than the expected display glass market growth of mid-single digits, driven by the ramp of our Gen 10.5 facility in China. In the Optical Communications segment, we expect sales to increase in the high-teen percentage range, including approximately $200 million from the acquisition of 3M’s Communications Market Division. We expect organic growth will improve by a low-teen percentage range driven by strong demand from carrier and enterprise network customers. We expect mid-single digit percentage growth in the Specialty Materials segment, driven by new model launches and the adoption of our innovations. We expect sales growth in the mid-teen percentage range in our Environmental Technologies segment, driven by continued strength in automotive product sales, on-going improvements in the heavy-duty diesel market and the commercial launch of gas-particulate filters. We expect mid-to-high single digit percentage growth in the Life Sciences segment.   
 Net sales in the Life Sciences segment increased by $8 million, or 4%, and $54 million, or 8%, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2018, respectively, driven by higher sales across all product categories. Movements in foreign exchange rates reduced net sales $2 million and increased net sales $12 million in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2018 when compared to the same period in 2017.  
   -    other risks detailed in Corning’s SEC filings. 
 Net income increased by $36 million, or 27%, and $57 million, or 15%, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2018. The increase was driven by the increase in sales. For the nine months ended September 30, 2018, volume gains were partially offset by costs associated with our planned capacity expansions and lower sales prices.  
 Net income in the Display Technologies segment increased by $7 million in the three months ended September 30, 2018, for the reasons outlined in the above paragraph. Net income decreased by $87 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2018 driven by expansion costs and price declines more than offsetting increases in glass volume.  
 In the first three quarters of 2018, equity in earnings of affiliated companies decreased by $46 million, driven by the absence of a $46 million gain recorded in the first quarter of 2017 resulting from the modification of long-term sales agreements with a customer of HSG.  
 Our probability of success increases as we invest in our world-class capabilities. Corning is concentrating approximately 80% of its research, development and engineering investment and capital spending on a cohesive set of three core technologies, four manufacturing and engineering platforms, and five market-access platforms. This strategy allows us to quickly apply our talents and repurpose our assets as needed.   
 Net sales in the Display Technologies segment increased by $57 and $23 million, respectively, in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2018, driven by glass volume growth in the low-teens and high-single digits in percentage terms. Volume growth more than offset price declines in the mid-single digits and high-single digits in percentage terms, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2018, respectively. Capacity expansion in China is supporting the increase in volume.   © 2018 Corning Incorporated. All Rights Reserved.
