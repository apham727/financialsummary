We completed two significant divestitures during fiscal 2017, the divestiture of our government IT services business (“IT Services”) and the divestiture of our Harris CapRock Communications commercial business (“CapRock”). These divestitures individually and collectively represented a strategic shift away from non-core markets (for example, energy, maritime and government IT services). The decision to divest these businesses was part of our strategy to simplify our operating model to focus on technology-differentiated, high-margin businesses and had a major effect on our operations and financial results.
Depreciation and amortization expense related to property, plant and equipment was $35 million and $37 million for the quarters ended September 28, 2018 and September 29, 2017, respectively. 
Net EAC adjustments resulting from changes in estimates unfavorably impacted our operating income by $3 million ($2 million after-tax or $.02 per diluted share) and favorably by $5 million ($3 million after-tax or $.02 per diluted share) for the quarters ended September 28, 2018 and September 29, 2017, respectively. Revenue recognized from performance obligations satisfied in prior periods was $7 million and $14 million for the quarters ended September 28, 2018 and September 29, 2017, respectively. 
The classification of certain prior-period amounts has been adjusted in our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited) to conform with current-period classifications. Reclassifications include certain direct selling and bid and proposal costs from the “Cost of product sales and services” line item to the “Engineering, selling and administrative expenses” line item in our Condensed Consolidated Statement of Income (Unaudited) and in these Notes. 
In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018, we recorded a $5 million charge for consolidation of certain Exelis Inc. (collectively with its subsidiaries, “Exelis”) facilities initiated in fiscal 2017. This charge is included as a component of the “Engineering, selling and administrative expenses” line item in our Consolidated Statement of Income in our Fiscal 2018 Form 10-K. We had liabilities of $22 million and $27 million at September 28, 2018 and June 29, 2018, respectively, associated with this integration activity and with previous restructuring actions. We expect that the majority of the remaining liabilities as of September 28, 2018 will be paid within the next twelve months. 
Adopting this standard resulted in the recognition of a cumulative-effect adjustment of $15 million to reduce the opening balance of retained earnings at July 2, 2016. Our full year fiscal 2017 revenue from product sales and services decreased by $3 million and our income from continuing operations decreased by $10 million ($.08 per share). Our full year fiscal 2018 revenue from product sales and services decreased by $14 million and our income from continuing operations decreased by $19 million ($.15 per share). This standard also resulted in the establishment of “Contract assets” and “Contract liabilities” line items and the reclassification to these line items of amounts previously presented in the “Receivables,” “Inventories” and “Advanced payments and unearned income” line items in our Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet (Unaudited). Total net cash provided by operating activities and total net cash provided by or used in investing activities and financing activities in our Condensed Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows (Unaudited) were not impacted by the adoption of ASC 606. These 
Impairment losses related to our contract assets were not material during the quarters ended September 28, 2018 and September 29, 2017. For the quarter ended September 28, 2018, we recognized revenue of $158 million related to contract liabilities that were outstanding at June 29, 2018. For the quarter ended September 29, 2017, we recognized revenue of $110 million related to contract liabilities that were outstanding at June 30, 2017.
As noted above, a significant amount of our revenue is derived from contracts to provide multiple distinct goods to a customer that are commercial in nature and can readily be sold to other customers. These arrangements are most prevalent in our Communication Systems segment and primarily involve the sale of secure tactical radios and accessories and other standard products. These performance obligations do not meet any of the three criteria listed above to recognize revenue over time; therefore, we recognize revenue at a point in time, generally when the goods are received and accepted by the customer. The decrease in ESA as a percentage of total revenue (“ESA percentage”) in the first quarter of fiscal 2019 compared with the first quarter of fiscal 2018 was primarily due to cost containment. The increase in engineering, selling and administrative (“ESA”) expenses in the first quarter of fiscal 2019 compared with the first quarter of fiscal 2018 was primarily due to higher bid and proposal and employment costs.
The increase in revenue in the first quarter of fiscal 2019 compared with the first quarter of fiscal 2018 was due to higher revenue in all three of our segments. 
The increase in segment gross margin and the decrease in segment gross margin as a percentage of revenue (“gross margin percentage”) in the first quarter of fiscal 2019 compared with the first quarter of fiscal 2018 primarily reflected higher volume and productivity savings, partially offset by program and business revenue mix. The slight increase in segment ESA expenses in the first quarter of fiscal 2019 compared with the first quarter of fiscal 2018 reflected cost containment despite higher revenue, resulting in a lower segment ESA percentage in the first quarter of fiscal 2019 compared with the first quarter of fiscal 2018.
The increase in gross margin in the first quarter of fiscal 2019 compared with the first quarter of fiscal 2018 was primarily due to higher revenue in all three of our segments and productivity savings, partially offset by program and business revenue mix in our Communication Systems segment.
The increase in segment revenue in the first quarter of fiscal 2019 compared with the first quarter of fiscal 2018 was due to growth in all three businesses that comprise our Communication Systems segment, including $38 million of higher revenue from Tactical Communications, primarily due to strong readiness demand for U.S. Department of Defense tactical radios, and higher revenue in Public Safety and Professional Communications and Night Vision.
The increases in segment operating income and segment operating income as a percentage of revenue (“operating margin percentage”) in the first quarter of fiscal 2019 compared with the first quarter of fiscal 2018 reflected the combined effects of the items discussed above regarding this segment. 
The increase in segment operating income and increase in segment operating margin percentage in the first quarter of fiscal 2019 compared with the first quarter of fiscal 2018 reflected the combined effects of the items discussed above regarding this segment. 
The decreases in segment operating income and segment operating margin percentage in the first quarter of fiscal 2019 compared with the first quarter of fiscal 2018 reflected the combined effects of the items discussed above regarding this segment.Item 1. Legal Proceedings.
During the first quarter of fiscal 2019, we did not issue or sell any unregistered equity securities.
