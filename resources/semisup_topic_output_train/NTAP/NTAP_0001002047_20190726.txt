Seasonality, such as our historical seasonal decline in revenues in the first quarter of our fiscal year and seasonal increase in revenues in the second quarter of our fiscal year, with the latter due in part to the impact of the U.S. federal government’s September 30 fiscal year end on the timing of its orders; and

Americas revenues consist of sales to Americas commercial and U.S. public sector markets. Sales to customers inside the U.S. were $574 million and $761 million during the three months ended July 26, 2019 and July 27, 2018, respectively.  
Our business may be harmed by technological trends in our market or if we are unable to keep pace with rapid industry, technological and market changes. 
Our growth strategy includes developing and maintaining strategic partnerships with major third-party software and hardware vendors to integrate our products into their products and also co-market our products with them. A number of our strategic partners are industry leaders that offer us expanded access to segments of the storage and data management markets. In particular, strategic partnerships with hyperscalers and cloud service vendors are critical to the success of our cloud-based business. However, there is intense competition for attractive strategic partners, and these relationships may not be exclusive, may not generate significant revenues and may be terminated on short notice. For instance, some of our partners are also partnering with our competitors, which may increase the availability of competing solutions and harm our ability to grow our relationships with those partners. Moreover, some of our partners, particularly large, more diversified technology companies, are also competitors, thereby complicating our relationships. If we are unable to establish new partnerships or maintain existing partnerships, if our strategic partners favor their relationships with other vendors in the storage industry or if our strategic partners increasingly compete with us, we could experience lower than expected revenues, suffer delays in product development, or experience other harm to our business, operating results and financial condition. 
Our clients, including data centers, SaaS, cloud computing and internet infrastructure and bandwidth providers, rely on our products for their data storage needs. Our clients may authorize third-party technology providers to access their data on our systems. Because we do not control the transmissions between our clients, their customers, and third-party technology providers, or the processing of such data by third-party technology providers, we cannot ensure the complete integrity or security of such transmissions or processing. Errors or wrongdoing by clients, their customers, or third-party technology providers resulting in security breaches may be attributed to us. 
NetApp, Inc. (we, us, or the Company) provides global organizations the ability to manage and share their data across on-premises, private and public clouds. Together with our partners, we provide a full range of enterprise-class software, systems and services solutions that customers use to modernize their infrastructures, build next generation data centers and harness the power of hybrid clouds. 
If we are unable to maintain and develop relationships with strategic partners, our revenues may be harmed. 
Our future growth depends upon the successful development and introduction of new hardware and software products and services. Due to the complexity of storage software, subsystems and appliances and the difficulty in gauging the engineering effort required to produce new products and services, such products and services are subject to significant technical and quality control risks. Sales and marketing, research and development, and general and administrative expenses for the first quarter of fiscal 2020 totaled $691 million, or 56% of net revenues, representing an increase of nine percentage points when compared to the first quarter of fiscal 2019, primarily due to lower net revenues in the current fiscal period. 
The decrease in net revenues for the first quarter of fiscal 2020 compared to the corresponding period of fiscal 2019 was primarily due to a decrease in product revenues of $231 million. Product revenues as a percentage of net revenues decreased by seven percentage points in the first quarter of fiscal 2020 compared to the first quarter of fiscal 2019.  
Margins on revenue recognized for strategic solutions increased slightly during the first quarter of fiscal 2020 compared to the first quarter of fiscal 2019, while margins for mature solutions decreased slightly.  
Total product revenue from mature solutions totaled $307 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2020 reflecting a 23% decrease from $400 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2019, primarily due to decreased sales of FAS Hybrid and OEM products in the current year period.
