Our growth strategy includes developing and maintaining strategic partnerships with major third-party software and hardware vendors to integrate our products into their products and also co-market our products with them. A number of these strategic partners are industry leaders that offer us expanded access to segments of the storage and data management markets. However, there is intense competition for attractive strategic partners, and these relationships may not be exclusive, may not generate significant revenues and may be terminated on short notice. For instance, some of our partners are also partnering with our competitors, which may increase the availability of competing solutions and harm our ability to grow our relationships with those partners. Moreover, some of our partners,  
Americas revenues consist of sales to Americas commercial and U.S. public sector markets. Sales to customers inside the U.S. were $739 million and $684 million during the three months ended January 26, 2018 and January 27, 2017, respectively, and were $2,115 million and $2,047 million during the nine months ended January 26, 2018 and January 27, 2017, respectively. 
Our future growth depends upon the successful development and introduction of new hardware and software products and related services. Due to the complexity of storage software, subsystems and appliances and the difficulty in gauging the engineering effort required to produce new products, such products are subject to significant technical and quality control risks. 
Our clients, including data centers, SaaS, cloud computing and Internet infrastructure and bandwidth providers, rely on our products for their data storage needs. Our clients may authorize third-party technology providers to access their data on our systems. Because we do not control the transmissions between our clients, their customers, and third-party technology providers, or the processing of such data by third-party technology providers, we cannot ensure the complete integrity or security of such transmissions or processing. Errors or wrongdoing by clients, their customers, or third-party technology providers resulting in security breaches may be attributed to us. 
NetApp, Inc. (we, us, or the Company) provides global organizations the ability to manage and share their data across on-premises, private and public clouds. Together with our partners, we provide a full range of enterprise-class software, systems and services solutions that customers use to modernize their infrastructures, build next generation data centers and harness the power of hybrid clouds. 
If we are unable to maintain and develop relationships with strategic partners, our revenues may be harmed. Cost of product revenues represented 51% of product revenues for the third quarter and first nine months of fiscal 2018, compared to 55% and 54% for the third quarter and first nine months of fiscal 2017, respectively. Materials costs represented 91% and 90% of product costs for the third quarter and first nine months of fiscal 2018, respectively, compared to 90% and 91% in the third quarter and first nine months of fiscal 2017, respectively. 
Total product revenues from strategic solutions totaled $1,704 million in the first nine months of fiscal 2018 reflecting a 24% increase from $1,375 million in the first nine months of fiscal 2017. This increase was primarily due to a 7% increase in unit volume of Clustered ONTAP systems and an increase in ASP driven by sales of our All-Flash FAS products. Total product revenue from  
The increase in net revenues for the third quarter and first nine months of fiscal 2018 compared to the corresponding periods of fiscal 2017 was primarily due to an increase in product revenues of $136 million and $296 million, respectively, partially offset by a decrease in hardware maintenance and other services revenues of $14 million and $52 million, respectively. Product revenues as a percentage of net revenues increased four and a half percentage points in the third quarter of fiscal 2018 and four percentage points in the first nine months of fiscal 2018 compared to the corresponding periods of fiscal 2017. 
mature solutions totaled $746 million in the first nine months of fiscal 2018 reflecting a 4% decrease from $779 million in the first nine months of fiscal 2017. This decrease was primarily due to a 69% decrease in unit volume of 7-mode systems, and a 10% decrease in OEM revenues, partially offset by an 11% increase in add-on hardware, storage and related OS revenues.
