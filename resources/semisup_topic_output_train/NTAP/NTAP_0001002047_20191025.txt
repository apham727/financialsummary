Our gross margins vary. 
Our business may be harmed by technological trends in our market or if we are unable to keep pace with rapid industry, technological and market changes. 
Our growth strategy includes developing and maintaining strategic partnerships with major third-party software and hardware vendors to integrate our products into their products and also co-market our products with them. A number of our strategic partners are industry leaders that offer us expanded access to segments of the storage and data management markets. In particular, strategic partnerships with hyperscalers and cloud service vendors are critical to the success of our cloud-based business. However, there is intense competition for attractive strategic partners, and these relationships may not be exclusive, may not generate significant revenues and may be terminated on short notice. For instance, some of our partners are also partnering with our competitors, which may increase the availability of competing solutions and harm our ability to grow our relationships with those partners. Moreover, some of our partners, particularly large, more diversified technology companies, are also competitors, thereby complicating our relationships. If we are unable to establish new partnerships or maintain existing partnerships, if our strategic partners favor their relationships with other vendors in the storage industry or if our strategic partners increasingly compete with us, we could experience lower than expected revenues, suffer delays in product development, or experience other harm to our business, operating results and financial condition. 
Our clients, including data centers, SaaS, cloud computing and internet infrastructure and bandwidth providers, rely on our products for their data storage needs. Our clients may authorize third-party technology providers to access their data on our systems. Because we do not control the transmissions between our clients, their customers, and third-party technology providers, or the processing of such data by third-party technology providers, we cannot ensure the complete integrity or security of such transmissions or processing. Errors or wrongdoing by clients, their customers, or third-party technology providers resulting in security breaches may be attributed to us. 
Americas revenues consist of sales to Americas commercial and U.S. public sector markets. Sales to customers inside the U.S. were $703 million and $789 million during the three months ended October 25, 2019 and October 26, 2018, respectively, and were $1,277 million and $1,550 million during the six months ended October 25, 2019 and October 26, 2018, respectively.  
NetApp, Inc. (we, us, or the Company) provides global organizations the ability to manage and share their data across on-premises, private and public clouds. Together with our partners, we provide a full range of enterprise-class software, systems and services solutions that customers use to modernize their infrastructures, build next generation data centers and harness the power of hybrid clouds. 
If we are unable to maintain and develop relationships with strategic partners, our revenues may be harmed. 
Our future growth depends upon the successful development and introduction of new hardware and software products and services. Due to the complexity of storage software, subsystems and appliances and the difficulty in gauging the engineering effort required to produce new products and services, such products and services are subject to significant technical and quality control risks. Sales and marketing, research and development, and general and administrative expenses for the second quarter and the first six months of fiscal 2020 totaled $667 million, or 49% of net revenues and $1,358 million, or 52% of revenues, respectively, representing an increase of three and a half percentage points and six percentage points, respectively, when compared to the corresponding periods of fiscal 2019, primarily due to lower net revenues in the current year periods. 
Total product revenues from strategic solutions totaled $442 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2020 reflecting a 9% decrease from $485 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2019. Total product revenues from strategic solutions totaled $779 million in the first six months of fiscal 2020 reflecting a 19% decrease from $960 million in the first six months of fiscal 2019. These decreases were primarily due to a substantial amount of revenue recognized in the prior year periods related to the software license components of several ELAs which did not repeat, a decrease in add-on optional software sales in the current year periods and, for the six month period, decreased sales of AFF products. These decreases were partially offset by an increase in revenues from private cloud solutions in both fiscal 2020 periods and, for the second quarter, increased sales of AFF products.  
Cost of product revenues represented 44% and 46% of product revenues for the second quarter and first six months of fiscal 2020, respectively, compared to 47% and 46% for the corresponding periods of fiscal 2019. Materials costs represented 86% and 84% of product costs for the second quarter and first six months of fiscal 2020, respectively, compared to 91% and 89% in the corresponding periods of fiscal 2019. 
During the first six months of fiscal 2020, we generated cash from operating activities of $257 million, reflecting net income of $346 million, adjusted by non-cash depreciation and amortization of $99 million, stock-based compensation of $82 million, and a gain on sale of properties of $38 million, compared to $491 million of cash generated from operating activities during the first six months of fiscal 2019.
