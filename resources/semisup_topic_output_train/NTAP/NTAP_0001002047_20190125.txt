Our growth strategy includes developing and maintaining strategic partnerships with major third-party software and hardware vendors to integrate our products into their products and also co-market our products with them. A number of our strategic partners are industry leaders that offer us expanded access to segments of the storage and data management markets. In particular, strategic  
Americas revenues consist of sales to Americas commercial and U.S. public sector markets. Sales to customers inside the U.S. were $744 million and $731 million during the three months ended January 25, 2019 and January 26, 2018, respectively, and were $2,294 million and 2,092 million during the nine months ended January 25, 2019 and January 26, 2018, respectively. 
Our clients, including data centers, SaaS, cloud computing and internet infrastructure and bandwidth providers, rely on our products for their data storage needs. Our clients may authorize third-party technology providers to access their data on our systems. Because we do not control the transmissions between our clients, their customers, and third-party technology providers, or the processing of such data by third-party technology providers, we cannot ensure the complete integrity or security of such transmissions or processing. Errors or wrongdoing by clients, their customers, or third-party technology providers resulting in security breaches may be attributed to us. 
NetApp, Inc. (we, us, or the Company) provides global organizations the ability to manage and share their data across on-premises, private and public clouds. Together with our partners, we provide a full range of enterprise-class software, systems and services solutions that customers use to modernize their infrastructures, build next generation data centers and harness the power of hybrid clouds. 
If we are unable to maintain and develop relationships with strategic partners, our revenues may be harmed. 
Our future growth depends upon the successful development and introduction of new hardware and software products and related services. Due to the complexity of storage software, subsystems and appliances and the difficulty in gauging the engineering effort required to produce new products and services, such products and services are subject to significant technical and quality control risks. The increase in net revenues for the third quarter and first nine months of fiscal 2019 compared to the corresponding periods of fiscal 2018 was primarily due to an increase in product revenues of $15 million and $257 million, respectively. Product revenues as a percentage of net revenues were flat in the third quarter of fiscal 2019 compared to the third quarter of fiscal 2018, and increased two percentage points in the first nine months of fiscal 2019 compared to the corresponding period of fiscal 2018.  
During the first nine months of fiscal 2019, we generated cash from operating activities of $942 million, reflecting net income of $773 million, adjusted by non-cash depreciation and amortization of $149 million, and stock-based compensation of $121 million, compared to $984 million of cash generated from operating activities during the first nine months of fiscal 2018.  
Total product revenues from strategic solutions totaled $674 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2019 reflecting a 3% increase from $657 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2018, primarily due to increased sales of All-Flash FAS products and hyper-converged infrastructure solutions, partially offset by the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange rate fluctuations. Total product revenues from strategic solutions totaled $1,935 million in the first nine months of fiscal 2019 reflecting a 12% increase from $1,721 million in the first nine months of fiscal 2018. Contributing to this increase was over $110 million of revenues from the software license component of several ELAs in the first nine months of fiscal 2019 which, under ASC 606, were recognized up-front. Comparable ELA revenues were immaterial in the first nine months of fiscal 2018. Revenues generated from the sale of optional add-on software unrelated to ELAs, All-Flash FAS products and hyperconverged infrastructure solutions also increased in the first nine months of fiscal 2019, compared to the corresponding period of the prior year.  
Cost of product revenues represented 49% and 47% of product revenues for the third quarter and first nine months of fiscal 2019, respectively, compared to 49% and 50% for the corresponding periods of fiscal 2018. Materials costs represented 90% of product costs for the third quarter and first nine months of fiscal 2019, compared to 91% and 90% in the corresponding periods of fiscal 2018.
