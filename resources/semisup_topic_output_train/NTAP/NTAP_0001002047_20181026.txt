Our growth strategy includes developing and maintaining strategic partnerships with major third-party software and hardware vendors to integrate our products into their products and also co-market our products with them. A number of our strategic partners are industry leaders that offer us expanded access to segments of the storage and data management markets. In particular, strategic  
Our clients, including data centers, SaaS, cloud computing and internet infrastructure and bandwidth providers, rely on our products for their data storage needs. Our clients may authorize third-party technology providers to access their data on our systems. Because we do not control the transmissions between our clients, their customers, and third-party technology providers, or the processing of such data by third-party technology providers, we cannot ensure the complete integrity or security of such transmissions or processing. Errors or wrongdoing by clients, their customers, or third-party technology providers resulting in security breaches may be attributed to us. 
Americas revenues consist of sales to Americas commercial and U.S. public sector markets. Sales to customers inside the U.S. were $789 million and $722 million during the three months ended October 26, 2018 and October 27, 2017, respectively, and were $1,550 million and 1,361 million during the six months ended October 26, 2018 and October 27, 2017, respectively. 
NetApp, Inc. (we, us, or the Company) provides global organizations the ability to manage and share their data across on-premises, private and public clouds. Together with our partners, we provide a full range of enterprise-class software, systems and services solutions that customers use to modernize their infrastructures, build next generation data centers and harness the power of hybrid clouds. 
If we are unable to maintain and develop relationships with strategic partners, our revenues may be harmed. 
Our future growth depends upon the successful development and introduction of new hardware and software products and related services. Due to the complexity of storage software, subsystems and appliances and the difficulty in gauging the engineering effort required to produce new products and services, such products and services are subject to significant technical and quality control risks. Sales and marketing, research and development, and general and administrative expenses for the second quarter and the first six months of fiscal 2019 totaled $688 million, or 45% of net revenues and $1,378 million, or 46% of net revenues, respectively, representing a decrease of three percentage points and four percentage points when compared to the second quarter and the first six months of fiscal 2019, respectively, primarily due to higher net revenues in the current year periods. 
The increase in net revenues for the second quarter and first six months of fiscal 2019 compared to the corresponding periods of fiscal 2018 was primarily due to an increase in product revenues of $94 million and $242 million, respectively. Product revenues as a percentage of net revenues increased two percentage points and three percentage points in the second quarter and first six months of fiscal 2019, respectively, compared to the corresponding periods of fiscal 2018. 
Net revenues for the second quarter and first six months of fiscal 2019 were $1,517 million and $2,991 million, respectively, reflecting an increase of $102 million, or 7%, and $255 million, or 9%, respectively, compared to the corresponding periods of the prior year, reflecting higher product revenues. 
Total product revenue from mature solutions totaled $264 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2019 reflecting a 4% increase from $253 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2018. Total product revenue from mature solutions totaled $527 million in the first six months of fiscal 2019 reflecting a 9% increase from $482 million in the first six months of fiscal 2018. These increases are primarily due to an increase in add-on hardware, storage and related OS revenues of 11% and 14% in the second quarter and first six months of fiscal 2019, respectively, compared to the corresponding periods of prior year. Additionally, OEM revenues increased by 6% and 25% in the second quarter and first six months of fiscal 2019, respectively, compared to the corresponding periods of the prior year. These increases were partially offset by our discontinuation of the 7-mode systems in the first quarter of fiscal 2019, reflecting the movement of customers to our newer products.
