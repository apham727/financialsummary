 Item 1.Legal Proceedings Net income for the six month period ended June 30, 2019 decreased approximately $226,000.

Net income for the three month period ended June 30, 2019 increased approximately $7,000, when compared to the same periods in 2018. This increase is primarily the result of increases in revenue at both the ATG and CPG business segments partially offset by increases in selling, general and administrative expenses at both business segments.
