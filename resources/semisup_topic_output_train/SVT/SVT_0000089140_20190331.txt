 Item 1.Legal Proceedings See also Note 10, Business Segments, for information concerning business segment operating results. 
The Company’s consolidated gross margin increased approximately $24,000 or 1.2% for the three month period ended March 31, 2019 when compared to the same period in 2018. 
The Company’s consolidated revenues from operations increased approximately $1,444,000 or 13.7% for the three month period ended March 31, 2019 when compared to the same period in 2018. The increase in revenue is attributable to an increase in commercial and government shipments at the ATG in addition to an increase in government shipments at the CPG. This is partially offset by a decrease in commercial shipments at the CPG. Commercial and government shipments increased approximately $1,278,000 or 15.4% and $202,000 or 25.1% at the ATG for the three month period ended March 31, 2019 when compared to the same period in 2018. This is offset by a net decrease in CPG shipments. CPG government shipments increased approximately $23,000 of 17.6% and commercial shipments decreased approximately $59,000 or (4.5%) for the three month period ended March 31, 2019 compared to the same period in 2018. 
The Company generated approximately $505,000 in cash from operations during the three month period ended March 31, 2019 as compared to a usage of cash of approximately $113,000 during the same period in 2018. Cash was generated primarily through net income of approximately $98,000, adjustments to reconcile net income to net cash of approximately $303,000 and timing of accounts payable. The primary use of cash for the Company’s operating activities for the three month period ended March 31, 2019 include working capital requirements, mainly an increase in accounts receivables and inventories of approximately $298,000 and $437,000, respectively. Cash generated and used in operations is consistent with sales volume, customer expectations and competitive pressures. 
The CPG consumer products are marketed throughout the United States and in select foreign markets. Consumer sales are moderately seasonal. Sales are direct to consumer, through national and international distributors, and through retailers such as big box, hardware, supermarket, variety, department, discount, gift, drug, outdoors and sporting stores. The CPG also sells knives and tools, principally machetes, bayonets, survival knives and kitchen knives, to various branches of the United States Government which accounted for less than 2% of the Company’s consolidate revenues in the three months ended March 31, 2019 and 2018. The Company is a smaller reporting company as defined by Rule 12b-2 of the Exchange Act and is not required to provide the information required under this item.  Item 6.Exhibits
