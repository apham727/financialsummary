See also Note 10, Business Segments, for information concerning business segment operating results. 
Gross margin improved in the three month period ended September 30, 2018 primarily due to the increased number of units shipped of approximately $228,000 and increased average prices of approximately $726,000 at the ATG as compared to the same period in 2017. This is partially offset by a decrease in average prices of approximately $108,000 offset slightly by an increase in units shipped of approximately $3,000 at the CPG as compared to the same period in 2017.

This is partially offset by an overall decrease in revenue at the CPG.
