During fiscal year 2016, we initiated plans to reduce costs in Sensors by closing our Machida, Japan manufacturing facility in the third quarter of fiscal year 2017. We recorded no restructuring expenses in the three and nine months ended June 30, 2018 and $92 and $1,036 in the three and nine months ended July 1, 2017, respectively. As of June 30, 2018, we have incurred a total of $1,964 of pre-tax expense, including $1,444 and $520 related to severance and facility closure costs, respectively. The remaining severance and facility closing costs are expected to be paid during the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2018. 
Sales of our products and systems are subject to limited warranty obligations that are included in customer contracts. For sales that include installation services, warranty obligations generally extend for a period of 12 to 24 months from the date of either shipment or acceptance based on the contract terms. Product obligations generally extend for a period of 12 to 24 months from the date of purchase. Certain products offered in our Sensors segment include a lifetime warranty. 
During fiscal year 2014, we initiated workforce and other cost reduction actions at certain of our Test locations in the U.S. and Europe. No restructuring expenses were recognized during the three or nine months ended June 30, 2018 or July 1, 2017 related to these restructuring actions.
The acquisition of PCB in fiscal year 2016 generated new opportunities to sell between our operating segments. Intersegment revenue is based on standard costs with reasonable mark-ups established between the reportable segments. All significant intersegment amounts are eliminated to arrive at consolidated financial results. 
During the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2017, in an effort to reduce costs and create economic efficiencies in Sensors, we initiated plans to close our Machida, Japan sales office in the second quarter of fiscal year 2018. In the three months ended June 30, 2018, we recorded an immaterial adjustment to the severance and related expense reported in previous periods. In the nine months ended June 30, 2018, we recorded $3 of pre-tax severance and related expense. As of June 30, 2018, we have incurred a total of $133 of pre-tax severance and related expense. We expect to incur additional pre-tax severance and related expense of approximately $40. The majority of the expenses are expected to be paid in fiscal year 2018 and the first half of fiscal year 2019. 
There were 245 and 288 stock options granted during the nine months ended June 30, 2018 and July 1, 2017. The weighted average fair value of the stock options granted during the nine months ended June 30, 2018 and July 1, 2017 was $11.10 and $8.91, respectively.
The amount recognized in earnings as a result of the ineffectiveness of cash flow hedges was $5 and $10 in the three and nine months ended June 30, 2018, respectively, and $0 and $7 in the three and nine months ended July 1, 2017, respectively. As of June 30, 2018, the amount projected to be reclassified from AOCI into earnings in the next 12 months was a net gain of $552. The maximum remaining maturity of any forward or optional contract as of June 30, 2018 was 1.6 years.
The full-year estimated annual effective tax rate, which excludes the impact of discrete items, was 17.3% as of June 30, 2018, as compared to 11.6% as of July 1, 2017. This increase is primarily due to higher earnings before taxes, partially offset by the reduction of the U.S. federal statutory rate from 35.0% to 24.5%, a blended rate based upon our fiscal year.
Our Chief Executive Officer (the Chief Operating Decision Maker) regularly reviews financial information for our two operating segments, Test and Sensors. Test provides testing equipment, systems and services to the ground vehicles, materials and structures sectors. Sensors provides high performance sensors for acceleration, position, vibration, motion, pressure and force measurement. Gross profit for the three months ended June 30, 2018 increased 1.0% primarily driven by higher Sensors revenue volume, partially offset by lower Test revenue volume. Gross margin rate increased 0.2 percentage points primarily due to leverage on 
General and administrative expense for the nine months ended June 30, 2018 decreased 5.8% primarily driven by prior year PCB acquisition integration expenses of $2,402, partially offset by an increase in professional fees. Excluding the impact of currency translation, prior year PCB acquisition integration expenses, and prior year restructuring costs, general and administrative expense increased 2.8%.
General and administrative expense for the three months ended June 30, 2018 declined 4.2% primarily driven by prior year PCB acquisition integration expenses. Excluding the impact of currency translation, prior year PCB acquisition integration expenses, and prior year restructuring costs, general and administrative expense was flat.
We believe that our business model supports our growth objectives, provided that we continue to move aggressively to build our infrastructure, expand our offerings and execute on opportunities with our key customers around the world. In order to accelerate our revenue growth over the next five years, investments in infrastructure, sales support and field service capacity and capability are essential. 
Gross profit for the nine months ended June 30, 2018 increased 25.1% primarily due to increased revenue volume, the prior year PCB acquisition inventory adjustment of $7,975, and the favorable impact of currency translation, partially offset by an increase in compensation expense. Gross margin rate increased 4.4 percentage points primarily driven by the prior year PCB acquisition inventory adjustment and favorable leverage on increased revenue volume, partially offset by the lower gross margin contribution from product mix. Excluding the impact of currency translation, the prior year PCB acquisition inventory adjustment, prior year non-recurring PCB acquisition integration expenses, and prior year restructuring costs, gross profit increased 10.9% and the gross margin rate increased 0.3 percentage points.
Gross profit for the three months ended June 30, 2018 increased 15.3% primarily due to increased revenue volume and the favorable impact of currency translation. Gross margin rate increased 0.7 percentage points primarily driven by favorable leverage on increased revenue volume, partially offset by the lower gross margin contribution from product mix. Excluding the impact of currency translation, the prior year PCB acquisition inventory adjustment, prior year non-recurring PCB acquisition integration expenses, and prior year restructuring costs, gross profit increased 11.2% and the gross margin rate increased 0.2 percentage points.
â€¢Adapt our industry-leading ground vehicle testing applications to align with emerging trends in vehicle electrification, autonomous vehicles and simulation. A hypothetical 10% appreciation or depreciation in foreign currencies against the U.S. dollar, assuming all other variables are held constant, would result in an increase or decrease in revenue of approximately $22,719 for the nine months ended June 30, 2018. The transfer of certain Test production operations in China to our new contract manufacturing partner may be subject to delays, increased costs or other unanticipated consequences.
