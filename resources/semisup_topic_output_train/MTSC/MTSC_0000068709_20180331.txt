During fiscal year 2016, we initiated plans to reduce costs in Sensors by closing our Machida, Japan manufacturing facility in the third quarter of fiscal year 2017. We recorded no restructuring expenses in the three and six months ended March 31, 2018 and $381 and $944 in the three and six months ended April 1, 2017, respectively. As of March 31, 2018, we have incurred a total of $1,964 of pre-tax expense, including $1,444 and $520 related to severance and facility closure costs, respectively. The remaining severance and facility closing costs are expected to be paid during the third quarter of fiscal year 2018. 
During fiscal year 2014, we initiated workforce and other cost reduction actions at certain of our Test locations in the U.S. and Europe. No restructuring expenses were recognized during the three or six months ended March 31, 2018 or April 1, 2017 related to these restructuring actions.
Sales of our products and systems are subject to limited warranty obligations that are included in customer contracts. For sales that include installation services, warranty obligations generally extend for a period of 12 to 24 months from the date of either shipment or acceptance based on the contract terms. Product obligations generally extend for a period of 12 to 24 months from the date of purchase. Certain products offered in our Sensors segment include a lifetime warranty. 
On January 5, 2017, we announced the division of our Test segment into two separate business units, "Materials Test Systems" and "Vehicles and Structures Test Systems." The division of our Test segment will result in us having three operating segments once discrete financial information is made available to our Chief Operating Decision Maker. We will continue to report only the Test and Sensors segments until such time. We continue to evaluate the timing of such implementation.
During the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2017, in an effort to reduce costs and create economic efficiencies in Sensors, we initiated plans to close our Machida, Japan sales office in the second quarter of fiscal year 2018. In the three and six months ended March 31, 2018, we recorded $16 and $7 of pre-tax severance and related expense. As of March 31, 2018, we have incurred a total of $137 of pre-tax severance and related expense. We expect to incur additional pre-tax severance and related expense of approximately $60. The majority of the expenses are expected to be paid in fiscal year 2018. 
Item 1. Legal Proceedings
The acquisition of PCB in fiscal year 2016 generated new opportunities to sell between our operating segments. Intersegment revenue is based on standard costs with reasonable mark-ups established between the reportable segments. All significant intersegment amounts are eliminated to arrive at consolidated financial results. 
The full-year estimated annual effective tax rate, which excludes the impact of discrete items, was 17.3% as of March 31, 2018, as compared to 20.4% as of April 1, 2017. This decrease is primarily due to the reduction of the U.S. federal statutory rate from 35.0% to 24.5%, a blended rate based upon our fiscal year, partially offset by higher income before taxes.
There were no stock options granted during the six months ended March 31, 2018 and April 1, 2017. 
The amount recognized in earnings as a result of the ineffectiveness of cash flow hedges was $4 and $5 in the three and six months ended March 31, 2018, respectively, and $6 and $7 in the three and six months ended April 1, 2017, respectively. As of March 31, 2018, the amount projected to be reclassified from AOCI into earnings in the next 12 months was a net loss of $1,001. The maximum remaining maturity of any forward or optional contract as of March 31, 2018 was 1.9 years.Net income and diluted earnings per share for the three months ended March 31, 2018 increased due to lower operating expenses, partially offset by a decrease in gross profit.
Gross profit for the six months ended March 31, 2018 increased 0.3% primarily driven by to the prior year impact of the PCB acquisition inventory adjustment of $7,724 and increased Sensors revenue volume, partially offset by reduced Test revenue volume. Gross margin rate increased 0.8 percentage points primarily due to the prior year impact from the PCB acquisition inventory adjustment and leverage on increased Sensors revenue volume, partially offset by the lower contribution from 
General and administrative expense for the six months ended March 31, 2018 decreased 6.5% primarily driven by prior year PCB acquisition integration expenses of $2,009 and prior year restructuring costs, partially offset by an increase in professional fees. Excluding the impact of currency translation, prior year PCB acquisition integration expenses and prior year restructuring costs, general and administrative expense increased 4.4%.
We believe that our business model supports our growth objectives, provided that we continue to move aggressively to build our infrastructure, expand our offerings and execute on opportunities with our key customers around the world. In order to accelerate our revenue growth over the next five years, investments in infrastructure, sales support and field service capacity and capability are essential. 
Selling and marketing expense for the three and six months ended March 31, 2018 declined 8.0% and 2.0%, respectively, primarily due to a decrease in commission expense and prior year China investigation expenses, partially offset by the unfavorable impact of currency translation. Excluding the impact of currency translation and prior year China investigation expenses, selling and marketing expense decreased 9.3% and 3.8%, respectively.
General and administrative expense for the three months ended March 31, 2018 increased 4.8% primarily driven by an increase in professional fees and the unfavorable impact of currency translation. The increase was partially offset by prior year PCB acquisition integration expenses of $506. Excluding the impact of currency translation, prior year PCB acquisition integration expenses and prior year restructuring costs, general and administrative expense increased 10.8%.
General and administrative expense for the three and six months ended March 31, 2018 declined 19.4% and 16.9%, respectively, primarily due to prior year China investigation expenses of $6,169 and $8,145, respectively, and prior year PCB acquisition integration expenses of $506 and $2,009, respectively, partially offset by an increase in professional fees, the unfavorable impact of currency translation, and higher bad debt expense in Test. Excluding the impact of currency translation, prior year PCB acquisition integration expenses, prior year China investigation expenses, and restructuring costs incurred in both fiscal years, general and administrative expense increased 9.6% and 3.8%, respectively.A hypothetical 10% appreciation or depreciation in foreign currencies against the U.S. dollar, assuming all other variables are held constant, would result in an increase or decrease in revenue of approximately $15,023 for the six months ended March 31, 2018. The transfer of certain Test production operations in China to our new contract manufacturing partner may be subject to delays, increased costs or other unanticipated consequences.
