Goodwill Impairment - As discussed in Note 4, Fair Value Measurements, the Company recorded an $8.9 million non-cash impairment charge related to its North America goodwill in the third quarter of 2019. This charge impacted income from operations for the North America segment in the three- and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2019.  
During the second quarter of 2019, the Company transitioned its manufacturing and warehousing operations from its Inwood, New York facility to Bel’s existing facilities in Glen Rock, Pennsylvania and the Dominican Republic. In connection with this transition, the Company sold its Inwood, New York property during the second quarter of 2019, which resulted in net proceeds of $5.8 million. The accompanying condensed consolidated statements of operations for the nine months ended September 30, 2019 includes a related gain on sale of $4.3 million (pre-tax).  
The change in warranty accrual during the nine months ended September 30, 2019 primarily related to repair costs incurred and adjustments to pre-existing warranties. There were no new material warranty charges incurred during the nine months ended September 30, 2019. 
The July 31, 2019 interim impairment test related to the Company's goodwill was performed by reporting unit (North America and Europe). The valuation test, which heavily weights future discounted cash flow projections, indicated impairment of the goodwill associated with the Company’s North America reporting unit. As a result, the Company recorded a non-cash goodwill impairment charge of $8.9 million ($8.5 million after-tax) during the third quarter of 2019. The Company’s goodwill associated with its North America reporting unit originated from several of Bel’s prior acquisitions, primarily Power Solutions and Connectivity Solutions. The carrying value of the Company's goodwill was $19.8 million at December 31, 2018. The remaining goodwill as of September 30, 2019 has a carrying value of $10.8 million related solely to the Company's Europe reporting unit. See Note 5, Goodwill.  
The Company maintains the Bel Fuse Inc. Employees’ Savings Plan, a defined contribution plan that is intended to meet the applicable requirements for tax-qualification under sections 401(a) and (k) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”). The expense for the three months ended September 30, 2019 and 2018 amounted to $0.3 million in both periods. The expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2019 and 2018 amounted to $0.8 million in both periods. The Company’s matching contribution is made in the form of Bel Fuse Inc. Class A common stock. As of September 30, 2019, the plan owned 153,352 and 109,442 shares of Bel Fuse Inc. Class A and Class B common stock, respectively. 
In connection with the acquisition of Power Solutions, there is an ongoing claim by the Arezzo Revenue Agency in Italy concerning certain tax matters related to what was then Power-One Asia Pacific Electronics Shenzhen Co. Ltd. (now Bel Power Solutions Asia Pacific Electronics Shenzhen Co. Ltd, or “BPS China”) for the years 2004 to 2006. In September 2012, the Tax Court of Arezzo ruled in favor of BPS China and cancelled the claim. In February 2013, the Arezzo Revenue Agency filed an appeal of the Tax Court’s ruling. The hearing of the appeal was held on October 2, 2014. On October 13, 2014, BPS China was informed of the Regional Tax Commission of Florence ruling which was in favor of the Arezzo Revenue Agency and against BPS China. An appeal was filed on July 18, 2015 before the Regional Tax Commission of Florence and rejected. On December 5, 2016, the Arezzo Revenue Agency filed an appeal with the Supreme Court and BPS China filed a counter-appeal on January 4, 2017. The Supreme Court has yet to render its judgment. The estimated liability related to this matter is approximately $12.0 million and has been included as a liability for uncertain tax positions on the accompanying condensed consolidated balance sheets. As Bel is fully indemnified in this matter per the terms of the stock purchase agreement with ABB, a corresponding other asset for indemnification is also included in other assets on the accompanying condensed consolidated balance sheets at September 30, 2019 and December 31, 2018. 
Changes in accumulated other comprehensive loss by component during the nine months ended September 30, 2019 are as follows. All amounts are net of tax. 
The Company’s significant accounting policies are summarized in Note 1 of the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018. There were no significant changes to these accounting policies during the nine months ended September 30, 2019, except as discussed in “Recently Adopted Accounting Standards” below. 
Nonfinancial assets and liabilities, such as goodwill, indefinite-lived intangible assets and long-lived assets, are accounted for at fair value on a nonrecurring basis. These items are tested for impairment upon the occurrence of a triggering event. We review goodwill for impairment on a reporting unit basis annually during the fourth quarter of each year and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of goodwill may not be recoverable. As weakened market conditions from earlier in 2019 continued into the third quarter without a visible rebound in incoming orders, the Company’s actual revenue and margin levels in 2019 were significantly lower than the financial projections utilized in the annual goodwill impairment analysis (performed as of October 1, 2018), and were not projected to rebound to those levels in 2019. The Company determined that current business conditions, and the resulting decrease in the Company’s projected undiscounted and discounted cash flows, together with the accompanying stock price decline, constituted a triggering event, which required the Company to perform interim impairment tests related to its long-lived assets and goodwill during the third quarter of 2019. The Company’s interim test on its long-lived assets indicated that the carrying value of its long-lived assets was recoverable and that no impairment existed as of the July 31, 2019 testing date.  Sales of our Power Solutions and Protection products were $4.7 million lower in the third quarter of 2019 compared to the same quarter of 2018. Sales of our Bel Power Solutions products into datacenter applications decreased by $3.8 million and sales of our Circuit Protection products were $0.9 million lower as compared to last year’s third quarter. These decreases were partially offset by a $0.5 million increase in sales of our Custom Module products. Sales during the nine-month period ended September 30, 2019 decreased by $1.2 million from the same period of 2018, as stronger sales into datacenter applications during the first quarter of 2019 lessened the impact of sales declines during the second and third quarters of 2019. 
Sales declines in each of our segments during the third quarter of 2019 reflected lower sales into our distribution channel as our distribution partners continue to work down their level of inventory on hand. Sales of our connector products into military applications were also lower during the third quarter of 2019 compared to the same period of 2018, impacting our North America segment sales. Sales in our Asia segment in the third quarter of 2019 were down versus 2018 as a result of customers working down heightened inventory levels which had been built up during 2018 in response to new product launches and the tariffs that went into effect in 2018 and 2019. 
Sales of our Connectivity Solutions products during the third quarter of 2019 declined $4.0 million primarily due to lower demand from military customers as compared to last year's third quarter, and reduced volume of product flowing through our distribution channels as our distribution partners continue to work down inventory levels that had been built up in 2018 ahead of the tariffs. These factors also impacted the nine-month period ended September 30, 2019, which declined $8.9 million from the same period of 2018, partially offset by higher sales to commercial aerospace customers during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2019. 
Net sales and (loss) income from operations by operating segment for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2019 and 2018 were as follows. Segment net sales are attributed to individual segments based on the geographic source of the billing for customer sales. 
Sales of our Magnetic Solutions products during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2019 were down $13.3 million and $18.0 million, respectively, from the same periods of 2018 while inventory levels built up in advance of a customer's new program launch during 2018 are worked through. 
Material costs as a percentage of sales were higher during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2019 compared to the same periods of 2018 primarily due to the industry-wide supply constraints related to certain of our purchased components during 2018. The finished goods shipped during the third quarter of 2019 still contained some of the higher-cost raw material components. 
During the nine months ended September 30, 2019, accounts receivable decreased by $12.4 million primarily due to lower sales during the third quarter of 2019 as compared to the fourth quarter of 2018. Days sales outstanding (DSO) decreased slightly to 58 days at September 30, 2019 from 59 days at December 31, 2018. Inventory decreased by $8.4 million at September 30, 2019 compared to December 31, 2018. Inventory turns were 3.7 at each of September 30, 2019 and December 31, 2018. Item 1. Legal Proceedings
