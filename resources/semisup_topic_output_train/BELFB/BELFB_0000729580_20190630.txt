The change in warranty accrual during the six months ended June 30, 2019 primarily related to repair costs incurred and adjustments to pre-existing warranties. There were no new material warranty charges incurred during the six months ended June 30, 2019.  
During the first quarter of 2019, the Company finalized its plans to transition its manufacturing and warehousing operations from its Inwood, New York facility to Bel’s existing facilities in Glen Rock, Pennsylvania and the Dominican Republic.

The sale of the Inwood, New York property was completed during the second quarter of 2019, resulting in net proceeds of $5.8 million. The resulting gain on sale of $4.3 million (pre-tax) was recorded in the accompanying condensed consolidated statements of operations for the three and six months ended June 30, 2019.

In connection with the acquisition of Power Solutions, there is an ongoing claim by the Arezzo Revenue Agency in Italy concerning certain tax matters related to what was then Power-One Asia Pacific Electronics Shenzhen Co. Ltd. (now Bel Power Solutions Asia Pacific Electronics Shenzhen Co. Ltd, or “BPS China”) for the years 2004 to 2006. In September 2012, the Tax Court of Arezzo ruled in favor of BPS China and cancelled the claim. In February 2013, the Arezzo Revenue Agency filed an appeal of the Tax Court’s ruling. The hearing of the appeal was held on October 2, 2014. On October 13, 2014, BPS China was informed of the Regional Tax Commission of Florence ruling which was in favor of the Arezzo Revenue Agency and against BPS China. An appeal was filed on July 18, 2015 before the Regional Tax Commission of Florence and rejected. On December 5, 2016, the Arezzo Revenue Agency filed an appeal with the Supreme Court and BPS China filed a counter-appeal on January 4, 2017. The Supreme Court has yet to render its judgment. The estimated liability related to this matter is approximately $12.0 million and has been included as a liability for uncertain tax positions on the accompanying condensed consolidated balance sheets. As Bel is fully indemnified in this matter per the terms of the stock purchase agreement with ABB, a corresponding other asset for indemnification is also included in other assets on the accompanying condensed consolidated balance sheets at June 30, 2019 and December 31, 2018. 
The Company continues to monitor the impacts of the U.S. tax reform and supplementary guidance as it becomes available. At December 31, 2018, the remaining balance of the deemed repatriation tax was included in other current liabilities on the Company’s condensed consolidated balance sheet. At June 30, 2019, the majority of the deemed repatriation tax is included in other long-term liabilities on the Company's condensed consolidated balance sheet due to clarification of an Internal Revenue Service notice received in December 2018. 
The Company’s significant accounting policies are summarized in Note 1 of the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018. There were no significant changes to these accounting policies during the six months ended June 30, 2019, except as discussed in “Recently Adopted Accounting Standards” below. Net sales and income from operations by operating segment for the three and six months ended June 30, 2019 and 2018 were as follows. Segment net sales are attributed to individual segments based on the geographic source of the billing for customer sales. 
Sales of our connectivity solutions products during the second quarter of 2019 declined $6.4 million primarily due to lower demand from military customers during the quarter, and reduced volume of product flowing through our distribution channels as our distribution partners continue to work down inventory levels that had been built up in 2018 ahead of the tariffs. These factors also impacted the six-month period ended June 30, 2019, which declined $4.9 million from the same period of 2018, partially offset by higher sales to aerospace customers during the first quarter of 2019. 
During the six months ended June 30, 2019, accounts receivable decreased by $7.7 million primarily due to lower sales during the second quarter of 2019 as compared to the fourth quarter of 2018. Days sales outstanding (DSO) increased slightly to 60 days at June 30, 2019 from 59 days at December 31, 2018. Inventory decreased by $1.8 million at June 30, 2019 compared to December 31, 2018. Inventory turns were 3.6 at June 30, 2019 as compared to 3.7 at December 31, 2018. 
Sales declines in our North America segment during the second quarter of 2019 reflected lower sales into our distribution channel as our distribution partners continue to work down their level of inventory on hand. Sales of our connector products into military applications were also lower during the second quarter of 2019 compared to the same period of 2018, impacting our North America and European segment sales. Sales in our Asia segment in the second quarter of 2019 were down versus 2018 as a result of customers working down heighted inventory levels which had been built up during 2018 in response to new product launches and the tariffs that went into effect in 2018 and 2019. 
Sales of our magnetic products during the second quarter and first half of 2019 were down $4.7 million from the same periods of 2018 while inventory levels built up in advance of a new program launch during 2018 are worked through. 
The other expenses noted in the table above include fixed cost items such as support labor and fringe, depreciation and amortization, and facility costs (rent, utilities, insurance). In total, these other expenses decreased during the three and six months ended June 30, 2019 by $0.2 million and $0.5 million, respectively, as compared to the same periods of 2018, primarily due to lower depreciation and amortization expense in the 2019 periods. 
The provision for income taxes for the three months ended June 30, 2019 and 2018 was $0.4 million and $2.4 million, respectively. The Company’s earnings before income taxes for the three months ended June 30, 2019, were approximately $5.6 million lower than the same period in 2018, primarily attributable to lower earnings in the Asia and Europe segments. The Company’s effective tax rate was 12.4% and 26.6% for the three months ended June 30, 2019 and 2018, respectively. The change in the effective tax rate during the three months ended June 30, 2019 as compared to the same period in 2018, is primarily attributable to a decrease in U.S. taxes relating to income from foreign subsidiaries taxed in the U.S. as part of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. See Note 9, “Income Taxes.” 
We design, manufacture and market a broad array of products that power, protect and connect electronic circuits.

Bel’s portfolio of products also finds application in the automotive, medical and consumer electronics markets. 
After record bookings throughout 2018, the Company has experienced slower bookings during the first half of 2019 as customers work through their inventory on hand. The Company experienced margin pressure during the second quarter of 2019 due to lower sales volumes and high material costs from 2018 which continue to run through the Company’s statement of operations. As a result of these ongoing factors, the Company expects the balance of 2019 to remain challenging from both a sales and margin perspective.
