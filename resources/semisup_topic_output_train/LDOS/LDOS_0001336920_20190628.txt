Prior year amounts have been recast for the contracts that were reassigned between the Defense Solutions and Civil reportable segments (see "Note 18â€“Business Segments"). 
Revenue recognized from performance obligations satisfied in previous periods was $15 million and $19 million for the quarter and six months ended June 28, 2019, respectively and $32 million and $66 million for the quarter and six months ended June 29, 2018, respectively. The changes primarily relate to revisions of variable consideration, including award and incentive fees, and revisions to estimates at completion resulting from changes in contract scope, mitigation of contract risks or due to true-ups of contract estimates at the end of contract performance.
Effective the beginning of fiscal 2019, the Company changed the composition of its Defense Solutions reportable segment to better align the operations within the reportable segment to the customers it serves. This resulted in the identification of new operating segments within Defense Solutions. In addition, certain contracts were reassigned between the Civil and Defense Solutions reportable segments. While this activity did not have a material impact on the Company's reportable segments prior year segments results have been recast to reflect this change. 
The decrease in unbilled receivables was primarily due to the timing of revenue recognized on certain contracts. The increase in deferred revenue was primarily due to the timing of advance payments from customers offset by revenue recognized during the period.

Non-operating income, net for the six months ended June 28, 2019 was $23 million as compared to non-operating expense, net of $68 million for the six months ended June 29, 2018. The $91 million increase was primarily due to the gain recognized on the sale of our commercial cybersecurity business.
The decrease in backlog within the Civil segment was primarily due to $154 million related to the sale of our commercial cybersecurity business in the first quarter of 2019.
Net cash provided by investing activities increased $330 million for the six months ended June 28, 2019, when compared to the prior year, primarily due to proceeds of $267 million received for the disposition of our commercial cybersecurity business and sale of real estate properties and $81 million of cash paid in the prior year related to our 2016 acquisition, partially offset by higher purchases of equipment and software. 
Net cash used in financing activities decreased $128 million for the three months ended June 28, 2019, when compared to the prior year quarter, primarily due to $90 million of stock repurchases in the prior year quarter and $23 million of cash paid related to a tax indemnification in the prior year quarter.Item 5.
