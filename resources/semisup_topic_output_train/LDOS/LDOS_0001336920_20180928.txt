Most of the Company's contracts are comprised of multiple promises including the design and build of software-based systems, integration of hardware and software solutions, running and maintaining of IT infrastructure and procurement services.

The Company generally separates multiple promises in a contract as separate performance obligations if those promises are distinct, both individually and in the context of the contract. If multiple promises in a contract are highly interrelated or require significant integration or customization within a group, they are combined and accounted for as a single performance obligation.The decrease in operating loss for the three months ended September 28, 2018, as compared to the three months ended September 29, 2017, was primarily attributable to lower integration and restructuring costs of $20 million, partially offset by higher general and administrative expenses.
