Effective the beginning of fiscal 2019, the Company changed the composition of its Defense Solutions reportable segment to better align the operations within the reportable segment to the customers it serves. This resulted in the identification of new operating segments within Defense Solutions. In addition, certain contracts were reassigned between the Civil and Defense Solutions reportable segments. While this activity did not have a material impact on the Company's reportable segments, prior year segments results have been recast to reflect this change. 
Amortization of the debt discount and deferred debt issuance costs related to the senior secured term loans and notes, unsecured notes and revolving credit facility was $2 million and $7 million for the quarter and nine months ended September 27, 2019, respectively, and $2 million and $8 million for the quarter and nine months ended September 28, 2018, respectively.
The decrease in unbilled receivables was primarily due to the timing of revenue recognized on certain contracts. The increase in deferred revenue was primarily due to the timing of advance payments from customers offset by revenue recognized during the period. 
Revenue recognized from performance obligations satisfied in previous periods was $17 million and $36 million for the quarter and nine months ended September 27, 2019, respectively and $18 million and $84 million for the quarter and nine months ended September 28, 2018, respectively.

There were no principal payments on the Company's senior secured term loans for the quarter ended September 27, 2019. In April 2018, the Company made a required debt prepayment of $10 million on its senior secured term loans. The prepayment was a result of the annual excess cash flow calculation clause in the Company's credit agreements. The decrease in backlog within the Civil segment was primarily due to $154 million related to the sale of our commercial cybersecurity business in the first quarter of 2019.
Non-operating expense, net for the nine months ended September 27, 2019 was $12 million as compared to $101 million for the nine months ended September 28, 2018. The $89 million decrease was primarily due to the gain recognized on the sale of our commercial cybersecurity business.
Non-operating expense, net of $35 million for the three months ended September 27, 2019 was consistent with the non-operating expense, net of $33 million for the three months ended September 28, 2018.
Net cash used in financing activities increased $70 million for the three months ended September 27, 2019, when compared to the prior year quarter, primarily due to a $137 million increase in stock repurchases, partially offset by the timing of dividend and debt payments.
The increase in operating income for the three months ended September 27, 2019, as compared to the three months ended September 28, 2018, was primarily attributable to the receipt of the Greek arbitration award and lower integration and restructuring costs.Item 5.
