Seagate Technology plc (the Company) is a leading provider of data storage technology and solutions.
The acquisition of Dot Hill further expands the Companys OEM-focused cloud storage systems business and advances the Companys strategic efforts.
The Company is involved in a number of other judicial, regulatory or administrative proceedings and investigations incidental to its business, and the Company may be involved in such proceedings and investigations arising in the normal course of its business in the future.
Disk drives continue to be the primary medium of mass data storage due to their performance attributes, high quality and cost effectiveness.
The Companys cloud systems and solutions extend innovation from the device into the information infrastructure, onsite and in the cloud.
The Company has been identified as a potentially responsible party at several sites.
The Company recorded income tax provisions of $212 million and $219 million in the three and six months ended December 29, 2017, respectively.
The March 2017 Plan was largely completed by the end of fiscal year 2017.
The anti-dilutive shares related to employee equity award plans that were excluded from the computation of diluted net income per share were 1 million and 2 million for the three and six months ended December 29, 2017, respectively, and 1 million and 2 million for the three and six months ended December 30, 2016, respectively.
The Company has fulfilled its responsibilities at some of these sites and remains involved in only a few at this time.
This provisional tax expense increased the Companys effective tax rate for the three months ended December 29, 2017 to approximately 56%.Compared to corresponding six months ended December 2016 quarter, product development expense decreased by $107 million primarily due to a $47 million decrease in salaries and employee benefits as a result of the restructuring of our workforce in prior periods, a $36 million decrease due to related operational efficiencies and a $24 million decrease in variable compensation and share-based compensation expenses.
Other expense, net for the six months ended December 2017 quarter increased by $20 million from the corresponding period in the prior year, primarily due to a $22 million increase in interest expense on the issuance of $750 million of 4.25% Senior Notes due 2022 and $500 million of 4.875% Senior Notes due 2024, a $26 million unfavorable change in foreign currency exchange rates, offset by the absence of a $25 million charge related to the impairment of a strategic investment in the December 2016 quarter.
Compared to the December 2016 quarter, revenue in the December 2017 quarter increased modestly primarily due to increase in exabytes shipped, offset by price erosion.
During the December 2017 quarter, we shipped 88 exabytes of HDD storage capacity, generating revenue of approximately $2.9 billion and gross margin of 30%.
Gross margin as a percentage of revenue for the December 2017 quarter increased by 200 basis points from the September 2017 quarter primarily driven by favorable product mix and improved absorption of factories due to higher demand for the Companys high capacity HDD product portfolio, partially offset by price erosion.Other Market Risks.
