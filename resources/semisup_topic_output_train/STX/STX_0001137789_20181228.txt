The Companys enterprise data solutions (formerly referred to as the cloud systems and solutions) portfolio includes modular original equipment manufacturers (OEM) storage systems and scale-out storage servers.  
The Companys HDD products are designed for mission critical and nearline applications in enterprise servers and storage systems; edge compute applications, where its products are designed primarily for desktop and mobile computing; and edge non-compute applications, where its products are designed for a wide variety of end user devices such as portable external storage systems, surveillance systems, digital video recorders (DVRs), network-attached storage (NAS), and gaming consoles. The Companys SSD products mainly include serial attached SCSI (SAS) and Non-Volatile Memory Express (NVMe) SSDs.  
Seagate Technology plc (the Company) is a leading provider of data storage technology and solutions. Its principal products are hard disk drives, commonly referred to as disk drives, hard drives or HDDs. In addition to HDDs, the Company produces a broad range of data storage products including solid state drives (SSDs) and storage subsystems.  
Hard disk drives are devices that store digitally encoded data on rapidly rotating disks with magnetic surfaces. Disk drives continue to be the primary medium of mass data storage due to their performance attributes, high quality and cost effectiveness. Complementing existing data center storage architecture, solid-state storage devices use integrated circuit assemblies as memory to store data, and most SSDs use NAND flash memory.  
The results of operations for the three and six months ended December 28, 2018 are not necessarily indicative of the results of operations to be expected for any subsequent interim period or for the Companys fiscal year ending June 28, 2019.

March 2017 Plan  On March 9, 2017, the Company committed to a restructuring plan (the March 2017 Plan) in connection with the continued consolidation of its global footprint. The Company closed its design center in Korea, resulting in the reduction of the Companys headcount by approximately 300 employees. The March 2017 Plan was substantially completed by the end of fiscal year 2017.  Revenue for the six months ended December 28, 2018 increased by $160 million from the six months ended December 29, 2017 as a result of an increase in exabytes shipped due to higher demand for our high capacity HDD product portfolio, partially offset by price erosion.  
Our Company. Overview of our business.  
Compared to the December 2017 quarter, gross margin as a percentage of revenue for the December 2018 quarter decreased primarily driven by price erosion, partially offset by favorable product mix.  
Compared to the six months ended December 29, 2017, gross margin as a percentage of revenue for the six months ended December 28, 2018 increased primarily driven by favorable product mix and improved factory utilization as a result of increased revenue from our high capacity HDD product portfolio, partially offset by a decline in prices for NAND flash memory and general price erosion.
