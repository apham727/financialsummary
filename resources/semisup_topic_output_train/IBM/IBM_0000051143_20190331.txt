The net carrying amount of intangible assets decreased $131 million during the first quarter of 2019, primarily due to intangible asset amortization, partially offset by additions resulting from capitalized software. The aggregate intangible amortization expense was $303 million and $340 million for the quarters ended March 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. In addition, in the first three months of 2019, the company retired $273 million of fully amortized intangible assets, impacting both the gross carrying amount and accumulated amortization by this amount. 
The following tables provide a quantitative summary of the derivative and non-derivative instrument-related risk management activity at March 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018, as well as for the three months ended March 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. 
Write-offs of lease receivables and loan receivables were $15 million and $20 million, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2018.

Pre-tax stock-based compensation cost for the three months ended March 31, 2019 decreased $3 million compared to the corresponding period in the prior year. This was due to decreases related to performance share units, the conversion of stock-based compensation previously issued by acquired entities and stock options, partially offset by an increase in restricted stock units. All changes were immaterial. 
Other  In the fourth quarter of 2018, the Global Financing segment entered into a definitive agreement to sell certain commercial financing capabilities and assign a number of its commercial financing contracts, excluding related receivables which will be collected as they become due in the normal course of business. These commercial financing capabilities and contracts have been reported within IBMs Global Financing segment. The transaction closed in the first quarter of 2019. The financial terms related to this transaction were not material. The company continues to expect GAAP diluted earnings per share from continuing operations of at least $12.45 and operating (non-GAAP) earnings of at least $13.90 per diluted share for 2019. The company continues to expect free cash flow to be approximately $12 billion in 2019, with free cash flow realization expected to be approximately 100 percent of GAAP net income. Refer to page 72 in the Liquidity and Capital Resources section for additional information on this non-GAAP measure.

The percentage of Global Financing receivables reserved increased from 0.9 percent at December 31, 2018, to 1.0 percent at March 31, 2019. The increase was primarily driven by the overall decline in gross receivables. Specific reserves were flat at March 31, 2019 compared to year-end 2018. Unallocated reserves decreased 7.7 percent from $72 million at December 31, 2018, to $66 million at March 31, 2019. 
Total pre-tax retirement-related plan cost decreased by $297 million compared to the first quarter of 2018, primarily driven by a decrease in recognized actuarial losses ($289 million), primarily due to the change in the amortization period in the U.S. Qualified Personal Pension Plan, higher expected return on plan assets ($26 million) and a decrease in defined contribution plans cost ($20 million), partially offset by higher interest costs ($36 million). 
The Systems gross profit margin increased 2.5 points to 46.2 percent in the first quarter of 2019 compared to the prior year. The year-to-year increase was driven by actions taken in the prior year to better position the systems cost structure over the longer term, and a current year benefit from mix to operating systems software.

Global Financing is a reportable segment that is measured as a stand-alone entity. Global Financing facilitates IBM clients acquisition of information technology systems, software and services by providing financing solutions in the areas where the company has the expertise, while generating strong returns on equity. Global Financing also optimizes the recovery of residual values by selling assets sourced from end of lease, leasing used equipment to new clients, or extending lease arrangements with current clients. Sales of equipment include equipment returned at the end of a lease, surplus internal equipment and used equipment purchased externally. Residual value is a risk unique to the financing business and management of this risk is dependent upon the ability to accurately project future equipment values at lease inception. Global Financing has insight into product plans and cycles for the IBM products under lease. Based upon this product information, Global Financing continually monitors projections of future equipment values and compares them with the residual values reflected in the portfolio.
