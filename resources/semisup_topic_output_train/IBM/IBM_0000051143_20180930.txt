The companys software offerings include solutions software, which contains many of the companys strategic areas including analytics, data and security; transaction processing software, which primarily runs mission-critical systems for clients; integration software, which helps clients to create, connect and optimize their applications data and infrastructure; and, operating systems software, which provides operating systems for IBM Z and Power Systems hardware. Many of these offerings can be delivered entirely or partially through as-a-Service or cloud delivery models, while others are delivered as on-premise software licenses. 
The net carrying amount of intangible assets decreased $608 million during the first nine months of 2018, primarily due to intangible asset amortization, partially offset by additions resulting from capitalized software. The aggregate intangible amortization expense was $348 million and $1,031 million for the third quarter and first nine months of 2018, respectively, versus $383 million and $1,161 million for the third quarter and first nine months of 2017, respectively. In addition, in the first nine months of 2018, the company retired $612 million of fully amortized intangible assets, impacting both the gross carrying amount and accumulated amortization by this amount.

The average recorded investment of impaired leases and loans for Americas, EMEA and Asia Pacific was $143 million, $56 million and $76 million, respectively, for the three months ended September 30, 2018 and $156 million, $31 million and $101 million, respectively, for the three months ended September 30, 2017. Both interest income recognized and interest income recognized on a cash basis on impaired leases and loans were immaterial for the three months ended September 30, 2018 and 2017. 
Noncontrolling interest amounts of $6.2 million and $4.4 million, net of tax, for the three months ended September 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively, and $17.9 million and $11.5 million, net of tax, for the nine months ended September 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively, are included as a reduction within other (income) and expense in the Consolidated Statement of Earnings. 
On October 29, 2013, Bridgestone Americas, Inc. (Bridgestone) sued IBM regarding a 2009 contract for the implementation of an SAP-based, enterprise-wide order management system. IBM counterclaimed against Bridgestone and its parent, Bridgestone Corp. IBM and Bridgestone have resolved the case and all claims have been dismissed. 
Write-offs of lease receivables and loan receivables were $55 million and $82 million, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2017. Provisions for credit losses recorded for lease receivables and loan receivables were $9 million and $7 million, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2017. As discussed in the Operating (non-GAAP) Earnings section on page 58, the company characterizes certain retirement-related costs as operating and others as non-operating. Utilizing this characterization, operating retirement-related costs in the third quarter of 2018 were $365 million, a decrease of $15 million compared to the third quarter of 2017 and non-operating costs were $389 million increasing $116 million year to year. For the first nine months of 2018, operating retirement-related costs were $1,115 million, a decrease of $13 million compared to the prior year and non-operating costs were $1,185 million increasing $216 million in the first nine months of 2018 compared to the prior year driven primarily by the same factors as above. 
In the third-quarter 2018, Integration Software revenue of $990 million was flat as reported and grew 1 percent adjusted for currency driven by offerings that assist clients with the modernization, automation and integration of their applications within a hybrid cloud environment, including strong adoption of IBM Cloud Private. 
The year-to-year increases in internal financing revenue in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2018 were due to higher asset yields and higher average asset balances. The increases in external financing revenue in the third quarter and first nine months of 2018, compared to the same periods in 2017, respectively, were due to higher average asset balances, partially offset by lower asset yields. 
Third-quarter Systems strategic imperatives revenue of $0.9 billion grew 5 percent year to year both as reported and adjusted for currency. Cloud revenue of $0.6 billion declined 9 percent as reported (8 percent adjusted for currency). For the first nine months of the year, Systems strategic imperatives revenue of $2.9 billion increased 29 percent as reported (28 percent adjusted for currency), primarily due to the strong acceptance of the z14. Cloud revenue of $1.9 billion increased 12 percent as reported and 10 percent adjusted for currency. 
Pre-tax income from continuing operations of $6.9 billion decreased 0.3 percent and the pre-tax margin was 11.9 percent, a decrease of 0.3 points versus the first nine months of 2017. The continuing operations effective tax rate for the first nine months of 2018 was 2.0 percent compared to 1.7 percent in the prior year. The tax rate in the first nine months of 2018 was primarily driven by the first-quarter resolution of certain U.S. tax audit matters and a net discrete tax benefit in the third quarter. The prior year tax rate was primarily driven by discrete tax items in the first half of the year. Income from continuing operations of $6.8 billion decreased 0.6 percent and the net income margin was 11.7 percent, a decrease of 0.3 points compared to the first nine months of 2017. Income from discontinued operations, net of tax, was $7 million in the first nine months of 2018 versus a loss of $3 million in the prior-year period. Net income of $6.8 billion decreased 0.5 percent year to year. 
Pre-tax income from continuing operations of $3.0 billion decreased 2.2 percent and the pre-tax margin was 16.0 percent, flat year to year. The continuing operations effective tax rate was 10.2 percent compared to 11.0 percent in the third quarter of 2017. Income from continuing operations of $2.7 billion decreased 1.3 percent and the net income margin was 14.4 percent, an increase from 14.2 percent in the third quarter of 2017. Net income of $2.7 billion decreased 1.2 percent year to year.

Total expense and other (income) increased $0.4 billion or 2.0 percent in the first nine months of 2018 compared to the prior year. The year-to-year increase included a higher level of workforce rebalancing charges (2 points), an impact from currency (2 points) and a lower level of IP income (1 points), partially offset by lower spending (3 points) driven by operating efficiencies, including acquisition synergies. Total operating (non-GAAP) expense and other (income) increased 1.3 percent year to year, driven primarily by the same factors. 
From a geographic perspective, Americas revenue declined 0.3 percent year to year as reported and was flat adjusted for currency with a modest decline in the U.S. There was growth in Canada as reported and adjusted for currency, while Latin America declined as reported but grew year to year adjusted for currency.
