Net revenues of the Capacitors segment decreased significantly versus the prior fiscal quarter, decreased slightly versus the prior year quarter, but increased significantly versus the prior year-to-date period. The decrease in net revenues versus the prior fiscal quarter is primarily due to decreases in the Americas and Europe regions, distribution customers, and the industrial and automotive end markets. The decrease versus the prior year quarter is primarily due to decreases in the Asia and Europe regions and the automotive end market. The increase versus the prior year-to-date period is primarily due to increases in the Americas and Europe regions and distribution customers. 
Net revenues of our Diodes segment declined significantly versus the prior fiscal quarter and prior year periods. Net revenues decreased significantly in all regions and sales channels, except Asia end customers that decreased moderately, versus the prior fiscal quarter. Net revenues decreased significantly in all regions and sales channels versus the prior year periods. 
Net revenues of the MOSFETs segment decreased significantly versus the prior fiscal quarter and prior year quarter, but increased slightly versus the prior year-to-date period. The slight increase versus the prior year-to-date period is due to the significant increase in the first fiscal quarter versus the prior year. The increase in net revenues versus the prior year periods from European and American end customers were offset by the significant decrease from distributors in the Americas. Significant increases in our biggest market, Asian distributors, versus the prior fiscal quarter were offset by decreases in the Americas and Europe regions and Asian end customers.  
Average selling prices decreased versus the prior fiscal quarter and prior year quarter, but increased versus the prior year-to-date period. The decrease versus the prior fiscal quarter and prior year quarter is primarily due to increased pricing pressure resulting from decreased demand. The slight increase versus the prior year-to-date period is primarily due to a more favorable customer mix and the impact of U.S. tariffs passed through to customers. 
We experienced a substantial, broad-based increase in demand for our products beginning in the first fiscal quarter of 2017 that continued through the third fiscal quarter of 2018. Demand started to decrease in the fourth fiscal quarter of 2018 and the decrease has accelerated through the second fiscal quarter of 2019 as distributors have significantly reduced orders as they decrease their inventory. The decrease in demand resulted in decreased net revenues compared to the prior fiscal quarter and prior year periods. 
The gross profit margin increased slightly versus the prior fiscal quarter, but decreased versus the prior year periods. The decreases versus the prior year periods are primarily due to decreased volume, lower average selling prices, and a less profitable product mix. 
Due to the strong business environment throughout 2018, average selling prices increased through the first nine fiscal months of 2018 before starting to decrease consistent with our historical experience in the fourth fiscal quarter of 2018. This resulted in average selling prices that were slightly lower versus the prior fiscal quarter and unchanged or slightly higher versus the prior year periods. 
Net revenues for the fiscal quarter ended June 29, 2019 were $685.2 million, compared to $745.2 million and $761.0 million for the fiscal quarters ended March 30, 2019 and June 30, 2018, respectively. The net earnings attributable to Vishay stockholders for the fiscal quarter ended June 29, 2019 were $44.5 million, or $0.31 per diluted share, compared to $75.5 million, or $0.52 per diluted share for the fiscal quarter ended March 30, 2019, and $103.1 million, or $0.65 per diluted share for the fiscal quarter ended June 30, 2018. 
Net revenues for the six fiscal months ended June 29, 2019 were $1,430.4 million, compared to $1,477.8 million for the six fiscal months ended June 30, 2018. The net earnings attributable to Vishay stockholders for the six fiscal months ended June 29, 2019 were $119.9 million, or $0.83 per diluted share, compared to $165.5 million, or $1.04 per diluted share for the six fiscal months ended June 30, 2018. 
For the third fiscal quarter of 2019, we anticipate revenues between $600 million and $640 million and gross margins of 24% to 25% at the exchange rates of the second fiscal quarter of 2019. We anticipate that inventory reductions, particularly by distributors, will have some negative impact on our revenues in the short-term.  Item 5. Other Information      Item 1. Legal Proceedings
