Normally, the Company warrantees its instruments for a period of twelve months for parts and labor which normally consists of replacement of small components or software support.
Due to the size and nature of the instruments, the Company subjects the instruments to an extensive factory acceptance testing process prior to shipment to ensure that they are fully operational once they reach the customer’s site.
