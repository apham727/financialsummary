Selling expenses for the three months ended December 31, 2017 decreased $9,600 (4.3%) to $214,600 from $224,200 for the three months ended December 31, 2016, due to lower sales related expenses for the Catalyst Research Instruments Operations. 
 Selling expenses for the six months ended December 31, 2017 decreased $25,300 (5.7%) to $415,600 from $440,900 for the six months ended December 31, 2016, due to lower sales related expenses for the Catalyst Research Instruments Operations. 
 Research and development expenses increased by $27,900 (26.6%) to $132,900 for the three months ended December 31, 2017 compared to $105,000 for the three months ended December 31, 2016, primarily due to increased new product development costs incurred by the Benchtop Laboratory Equipment Operations related to the Torbal Scales Division. 
 Overview. The Company reflected income before income tax expense of $16,400 for the three months ended December 31, 2017 compared to $64,800 for the three months ended December 31, 2016, primarily due to lack of sales of catalyst research instruments during the period and product development expenses for a new automated pill counter for the Laboratory Equipment Operations. The Company reflected a loss before income tax benefit of $290,100 for the six months ended December 31, 2017 compared to $4,700 for the six months ended December 31, 2016 mainly due to decreased catalyst research instrument sales and product development costs as previously discussed. The results reflected total non-cash amounts for depreciation and amortization of $77,000 and $154,100 for the three and six month periods ended December 31, 2017 compared to $93,800 and $189,500 for the corresponding three and six month periods in 2016. 
 The overall gross profit percentage for the six months ended December 31, 2017 was 38.4% compared to 34.5% for the six months ended December 31, 2016 as a result of the Benchtop Laboratory Equipment Operations (which is sold at higher margins) consisting of a higher percentage of total sales for the year. 
 Net revenues for the three months ended December 31, 2017 decreased $791,400 (29.5%) to $1,892,400 from $2,683,800 for the three months ended December 31, 2016, reflecting a decrease of $1,038,600 in net sales of catalyst research instruments due to decreased orders from Original Equipment Manufacturer OEM customers and lack of large orders, partially offset by increased sales of benchtop laboratory equipment of $219,400 and bioprocessing royalties of $27,800. The benchtop laboratory equipment sales reflected $359,900 of Torbal brand product sales for the three months ended December 31, 2017, compared to $303,500 in the three months ended December 31, 2016. As of December 31, 2017, the order backlog for catalyst research instruments was $752,500, all of which is expected to be shipped during fiscal year ending June 30, 2018, compared to $397,300 as of December 31, 2016. 
 Net revenues for the six months ended December 31, 2017 decreased $1,069,600 (25.2%) to $3,173,300 from $4,242,900 for the six months ended December 31, 2016, reflecting a decrease of $1,087,300 in net sales of catalyst research instruments due to decreased orders from Original Equipment Manufacturer OEM customers and lack of large orders, and a decrease of $38,000 in sales of benchtop laboratory equipment derived from the Torbal Division, partially offset by a $55,700 increase in bioprocessing royalties. The benchtop laboratory equipment sales reflected $664,200 of Torbal brand product sales for the six months ended December 31, 2017, compared to $685,500 in the six months ended December 31, 2016. 
 General and administrative expenses for the six months ended December 31, 2017 increased slightly by $14,700 (1.8%) to $836,300 compared to $821,600 for the six months ended December 31, 2016.
