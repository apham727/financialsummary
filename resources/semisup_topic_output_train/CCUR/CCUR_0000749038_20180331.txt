 1.Overview of Business and Basis of Presentation 
All remaining share-based compensation expense for the three and nine-month periods ended March 31, 2018 and 2017 resulted from vesting of shares over their respective vesting periods.

Our loss from continuing operations for the three months ended March 31, 2018 was $0.8 million, or $0.09 loss per basic and diluted share, compared to a net loss from continuing operations for the three months ended March 31, 2017 of $2.2 million, or $0.24 loss per basic and diluted share.

We used $7.6 million and generated $2.2 million of cash from operating activities during the nine months ended March 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. Operating cash flows during the nine months ending March 31, 2018 were primarily attributable to the timing of payments made against our accounts payable to settle the previous year’s transaction costs related to the sale of our Real-Time business, inventory purchases and accrued compensation, coupled with losses from continuing operations. Operating cash flows during the nine months ended March 31, 2017 were primarily attributable to the collection of accounts receivable for sales shipped late in the prior year, offset by the current period net loss. 
Loss from Continuing Operations. Our loss from continuing operations for the nine months ended March 31, 2018 was $5.1 million, or $0.53 loss per basic and diluted share, compared to a net loss for the nine months ended March 31, 2017 of $5.2 million, or $0.56 loss per basic and diluted share. The period-over-period decrease in basic and diluted loss per share resulted from a period-over period increase in weighted average shares outstanding. None. We are not presently involved in any material litigation. However, we are, from time to time, party to various routine legal proceedings arising out of our business.

If we are unable to relist our common stock, or even if our common stock is relisted, no assurance can be provided that an active trading market will develop or, if one develops, will continue.
