In fiscal year 2016, the Company introduced Aquariâ„¢ Storage, a unified scale-out storage solutions product that is ideally suited for a wide range of enterprise IT and video applications that require advanced performance, very large storage capacities, and a high degree of reliability.
During the year ended June 30, 2017, we applied for both a U.S. federal and state of Georgia research and development tax credit in the amounts of (1) $719 and $675 for our fiscal year ending June 30, 2016, respectively, and (2) $575 and $540 for our fiscal year ending June 30, 2017, respectively.
These real-time products were sold to a wide variety of companies seeking high performance, real-time computer solutions in the defense, aerospace, financial and automotive markets around the world.
In May 2017, we sold our Real-Time business consisting of real-time Linux operating system versions, development and performance optimization tools, simulation software and other system software combined, in many cases, with computer platforms and services.
This expense is reflected in general and administrative expenses of continuing operations in our condensed consolidated statement of operations for the three and six months ended December 31, 2017.
The Content Delivery business provided advanced applications focused on storing, protecting, transforming, and delivering high value media assets and served industries and customers that demand uncompromising performance, reliability and flexibility to gain a competitive edge, drive meaningful growth and confidently deliver best-in-class solutions that enrich the lives of millions of people around the world every day.
Content delivery solutions consisted of software, hardware and services for intelligently streaming video content to a variety of consumer devices and storing and managing content in the network.
We made matching contributions of $5 and $3 during the three months ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively, and $13 and $12 during the six months ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively.
For both the three and six months ended December 31, 2017, the domestic tax expense is lower than the prior year primarily due to the favorable impact of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (enacted on December 22, 2017) on the realizability of our alternative minimum tax credits and lower domestic income as compared to the same periods from the prior year.
All of the above expenses are included in general and administrative expenses of continuing operations in our condensed consolidated statement of operations for the three and six months ended December 31, 2017.
The results of operations for the three and six months ended December 31, 2017 are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for the entire year.General and administrative expenses were $3.9 million for the three months ended December 31, 2017, an increase of $2.4 million, or 160.7%, from $1.5 million for the prior year period.
General and administrative expenses were $5.3 million for the six months ended December 31, 2017, an increase of $2.4 million, or 79.6%, from $3.0 million for the prior year period.
Following the close of the Content Delivery business during the three months ended December 31, 2017, which generated the aforementioned one-time transaction costs, we anticipate our operating expenses to be significantly lower in remaining quarters of our fiscal year 2018.
