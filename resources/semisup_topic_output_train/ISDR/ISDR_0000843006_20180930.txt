The increase is primarily the result of the additional transfer agent revenue resulting from the addition of Interwest customers and an increase in corporate actions and directives.
These increases were offset by a decline in revenue from our shareholder outreach offering due to continued client attrition as revenue of this offering is typically tied-in with contracts of our annual report distribution services.

The increase is primarily due to an increase in stock compensation as well as the inclusion of general and administrative expenses for Interwest and FSCwire during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2018, which were not included in general and administrative expenses for the same period of the prior year.
We recently completed the integration of FSCwire and rebranded it as ACCESSWIRE Canada, and will now begin to focus on offering those customers the full suite of products included in Platform id. ITEM 4.
