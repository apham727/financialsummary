 We will continue to brand our press release offerings under the name ACCESSWIRE, which we believe will solidify our market position in the newswire business. Our ACCESSWIRE news editing offering is available within our core Platform id. subscription or as a stand-alone module. 
 As a percentage of revenue, sales and marketing expenses were 22% during the three months ended September 30, 2018, compared to 21% for the same period of the prior year and 21% for both the nine-month periods ended September 30, 2018 and 2017. 
 Gross margin percentage from Platform and Technology was 77% and 79% for the three and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2018, respectively, as compared to 83% and 84% for the same periods of 2017. The decrease in gross margin percentage is primarily due to an increase in amortization of capitalized software costs of $117,000 and $373,000, during the three and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2018, respectively, related to our platforms licensed to customers, as well as, increased costs as the Company continues to invest in expanding its distribution network for press releases. The increases in amortization expense represents 6% of Platform and Technology revenue for each respective period. 
 Our investor outreach and engagement offering, formerly known as the ARS, was acquired from PIR. The ARS business has existed for over 20 years primarily as a physical hard copy delivery service of annual reports and prospectuses. We continue to operate a portion of this legacy system for those who opt to take advantage of physical delivery of material. Additionally, we continue to attempt to migrate the install base over to subscriptions of our digital outreach engagement module within Platform id. We believe we will continue to see further attrition of both customers and revenues in this category as we focus our efforts on our Platform and Technology business. 
 Platform and Technology revenue increased $309,000, or 17%, and $1,077,000, or 20%, during the three and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2018, respectively, as compared to the same periods of 2017. A significant portion of the increase is due to our ACCESSWIRE news distribution platform, which increased $105,000 and $570,000 during the three and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2018, respectively, as compared to the same periods of the prior year. A majority of the increase in news distribution revenue for the three months ended September 30, 2018 is due to the acquisition of FSCwire. For the nine-month period ended September 30, 2018, the increase is attributable to our investment in increased sales staff and distribution over the past twelve months. During the quarter, we continued to focus our selling efforts on bundled subscriptions of our cloud-based offerings included in Platform id., which also lead to higher overall revenue during both the three and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2018. Lastly, additional transfer agent module revenue, primarily due to the addition of Interwest customers, as well as additional webcasting revenue as a result of offering our webcasting product to investor relations conferences contributed to the overall increase in our Platform and Technology revenue. These increases were offset by a decline in revenue from our shareholder outreach offering due to continued client attrition as revenue of this offering is typically tied-in with contracts of our annual report distribution services. 
 One of our competitive strengths is that we have embraced cloud computing early on in our strategy. The transition to a subscription model has been and will continue to be key for the long-term sustainable growth management expects from our new platforms. 
 Total revenue increased by $324,000, or 11%, to $3,255,000 during the three-month period ended September 30, 2018, as compared to $2,931,000 during the same period of 2017. Total revenue increased by $1,355,000, or 15%, to $10,584,000 during the nine-month period ended September 30, 2018, as compared to $9,229,000 during the same period of 2017. Revenue from customers obtained from acquisitions of Interwest and FSCwire totaled $526,000 and $1,325,000 during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2018, respectively, of which $46,000 and $142,000 came from additional subscriptions to our platform or services cross sold to those customers. 
 Platform id. also includes our targeting and outreach database and intelligence analytics module. This module is centered around both our shareholder communications and news distribution offerings. We anticipate the analytics and peer review components will become a focal point for Platform id. in the future, as customers become increasingly interested in peer performance and real-time alerts to vital data points throughout the day. 
 Cost of revenues consists primarily of direct labor costs, third party licensing and amortization of capitalized software costs related to platform subscriptions in our Platform and Technology stream and direct labor costs, warehousing, logistics, print production materials, postage, and outside services directly related to the delivery of services to customers in our Services stream. Cost of revenues increased by $160,000, or 19%, and $556,000, or 22%, during the three and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2018, respectively, as compared to the same periods of 2017. Overall gross margin increased $164,000, or 8%, and $799,000, or 12%, during the three and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2018, respectively, as compared to the same periods of 2017. However, during this period, gross margin percentage decreased to 70% and 71% for the three and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2018, respectively, from 72% and 73% during the same periods of the prior year. The largest single component of the increase in cost of sales and resulting decrease in gross margin percentage was due to an increase in amortization of capitalized software costs of $117,000 and $373,000, during the three and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2018, respectively, related to our platforms licensed to customers. Both amounts represent 4% of total revenue for their respective periods. 
 The earnings event industry is a highly competitive space with the majority of the business being driven from practitioners in the investor relations and communications firms. We have invested time and financial resources developing and integrating systems and processes within Platform id. by creating an application programming interface (“API”). Initially, this has been broadly distributed via our Investor Network platform, with expectations that partners and publishers will license this dataset for their platforms in the future. We believe this offering will further increase our brand awareness. This API license will allow publishers to query an industry or a single companies' current and past earnings calls and present those webcasts on their platforms, under a subscription to Platform id. Additionally, as a commitment to broadening the reach of our webcast platform, all events will be broadcast live within our shareholder outreach module, which will drive new audiences and give companies the ability to view their analytics and engagement of each event. We believe these analytics will increase the demand for our webcasting platform among the corporate issuer community. 
 While the complete platform is available for a single subscription fee, companies also have the flexibility to choose one or more of the specific modules that fit their needs. 
 Depreciation and amortization expenses increased $53,000, or 52%, and $129,000, or 42%, during the three and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2018, respectively, as compared to the same periods of 2017. The increase is due to amortization of intangible assets acquired in the Interwest and FSCwire acquisitions. 
 Gross margins from our Services revenue increased to 57% and 60% during the three and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2018, respectively, as compared to 55% and 58% during the same periods of 2017. The increase is primarily the result of the additional transfer agent revenue resulting from the addition of Interwest customers and an increase in corporate actions and directives. 
 Platform id. is our primary cloud-based subscription platform that efficiently and effectively helps manage the events of our customers seeking to distribute their messaging to key constituents, investors, markets and regulatory systems around the globe. Currently, Platform id. consists of several related but distinct shareholder communications and compliance modules. Certain of these capabilities were historically part of our disclosure management and shareholder communications offerings, but are now included into our fully integrated platform. 
 Platform id.’s disclosure reporting module is a document conversion, editing and filing offering, which is designed for reporting companies and professionals seeking to insource the document drafting, editing and filing processes to the SEC’s EDGAR system and SEDAR, which is the Canadian equivalent of EDGAR. This module is available in both a secure public cloud within our Platform id. subscription, as well as in a private cloud option for corporations, mutual funds and the legal community looking to further enhance their internal document process. We believe that once this module is fully marketed and adopted by our customers, we will see a negative impact on our legacy disclosure conversion services business in the future. However, the margins associated with our Platform and Technology business compared to our Services business are higher and align with our long-term strategy, and as such, we believe this module will have a positive impact on our compliance business. 
 On July 3, 2018, we completed the acquisition of Filing Services Canada Inc. (“FSCwire”), which not only increased our customer base, but more importantly increased our global footprint, distribution capabilities and editorial team. We recently completed the integration of FSCwire and rebranded it as ACCESSWIRE Canada, and will now begin to focus on offering those customers the full suite of products included in Platform id. 
 No customers accounted for more than 10% of revenue during the three and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2018 or 2017.  (a) Exhibits.
