 As a percentage of revenue, sales and marketing expense were 20% during the three-month period ended March 31, 2019, compared to 21% for the same period of the prior year. 
 Net income for the three-month period ended March 31, 2019, was $205,000, compared to $320,000 for the same period of 2018. 
 As a percentage of revenue, general and administrative expenses were 33% for the three-month period ended March 31, 2019, an increase from 28% for the same period of 2018. 
 As a percentage of revenue, product development expenses were 8% for both the three-month periods ended March 31, 2019 and 2018. 
 Depreciation and amortization expenses increased $70,000, or 49%, during the three-month period ended March 31, 2019, as compared to the same period of 2018. The increase is due to amortization of intangible assets acquired in both the VWP and FSCwire acquisitions. 
 Platform and Technology revenue increased $633,000, or 31%, to $2,665,000 during the three-month period ended March 31, 2019, as compared to $2,032,000 during the same period of 2018. A majority of the increase is due to the acquisitions of VWP and FSCwire, which accounted for a combined $509,000 of Platform and Technology revenue during the three months ended March 31, 2019. Additionally, we generated increased revenue from additional subscriptions of Platform id. These increases were offset by a decline in revenue from our shareholder outreach offering due to customer attrition as revenue of this offering is typically tied-in with contracts of our annual report distribution services. Platform and Technology revenue increased to 64% of total revenue during the three months ended March 31, 2019, as compared to 58% during the same period of the prior year. 
 Total revenue increased by $649,000, or 18%, to $4,179,000 during the three-month period ended March 31, 2019, as compared to $3,530,000 during the same period of 2018. Revenue from customers obtained from our acquisitions of VWP and FSCwire totaled $627,000 during the three months ended March 31, 2019. A portion of this revenue is included in both the Platform and Technology and Services revenue streams. 
 Our investor outreach and engagement offering, formerly known as ARS, was acquired from PIR in 2013. The ARS business has existed for over 20 years primarily as a physical hard copy delivery service of annual reports and prospectuses. We continue to operate a portion of this legacy system for those who opt to take advantage of physical delivery of material. Additionally, we continue to attempt to migrate the install base over to subscriptions of our digital outreach engagement module within Platform id. We believe we will continue to see further attrition of both customers and revenues in this category as we focus our efforts on our Platform and Technology business. 
 No customers accounted for more than 10% of the operating revenues during the three-month periods ended March 31, 2019 or 2018. 
 One of our competitive strengths is that we have embraced cloud computing early on in our strategy. The transition to a subscription model has been and will continue to be key for the long-term sustainable growth management expects from our new platforms. 
 As we continue our transition to a cloud-based subscription business, we expect the Platform and Technology portion of our business to continue to increase over the next several years, both in terms of overall revenue and as compared to the Services portion of our business. Platform and Technology revenue grew to 64% of total revenue during the first quarter of 2019, compared to 60 %, 56% and approximately 44% of our revenue for the years ending December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. Our ACCESSWIRE® news distribution offering represented a majority of the year over year growth in our Platform and Technology revenue and continues to lead our transition to a full platform solution. Also contributing to the growth in the percentage of Platform and Technology revenue is our focus on our platform first engagement strategy and converting customers which historically relied on us for services work to utilizing Platform id. 
 No customers accounted for more than 10% of the revenues during the three-month periods ended March 31, 2019 or 2018. 
 We have also attempted to differentiate our offering by investing time and financial resources developing and integrating systems and processes within Platform id. and creating an application programming interface (“API”). This API allows customers, such as financial content sites and investment banks to query an industry or a single company’s current and past earnings calls and present those webcasts on their platforms, under a subscription to Platform id. Initially, this has been broadly distributed via our Investor Network platform, with expectations that customers will license this dataset for their platforms in the future. We believe this offering will further increase our brand awareness. Additionally, as a commitment to broadening the reach of our webcast platform, all events are broadcast live within our shareholder outreach module, which helps drive new audiences and give companies the ability to view their analytics and engagement of each event. We believe these analytics, which feeds into our Insight and Analytics module, will increase the demand for our webcasting platform among the corporate issuer community. 
 On January 3, 2019, we acquired the VisualWebcaster Platform (“VWP”) from Onstream Media Corporation. VWP is a leading cloud-based webcast, webinar and training platform that delivers live and on-demand streaming of events to audiences of all sizes. VWP allows customers to create, produce and deliver events, which we believe will integrate well into Platform id. We believe by acquiring VWP, we have significantly strengthened our webcasting product and Platform id. offering as well as acquired over 120 customers, ranging from small private companies to Fortune 500 companies. The VWP technology enables us the ability to host thousands of additional webcasts each year, expanding our webcast business from our historical earnings based events to now be able to host corporate meetings, trainings and town hall types of events. As we expand our platform it is vital for us to have solutions that can be consumed both to our core public companies but also a growing segment of private customers. 
 Entering this business expands our current Platform and Technology revenue base, and as an adjacency, should assist in making Platform id. the core ecosystem of choice for investment banks, issuers and investors. 
 On July 3, 2018, we completed the acquisition of Filing Services Canada Inc. (“FSCwire”), which not only increased our customer base, but more importantly increased our global footprint, distribution capabilities and editorial team of our press release business. During the latter part of 2018, we completed the integration of FSCwire and rebranded it as ACCESSWIRE Canada, and have now begun to focus on offering those customers the full suite of products included in Platform id.
