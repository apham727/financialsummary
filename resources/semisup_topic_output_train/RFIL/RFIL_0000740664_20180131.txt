Item 1. Legal Proceedings 
The Company paid dividends of $0.02 per share during the three months ended January 31, 2018 and 2017 for a total of $176,000 per period. 
One customer accounted for approximately 36% of the Company’s net sales for the three-month period ended January 31, 2018. At January 31, 2018, this customer’s accounts receivable balance accounted for approximately 32% of the Company’s total net accounts receivable balance. Two customers accounted for approximately 15% and 10% of the Company’s net sales for the three-month period ended January 31, 2017. At January 31, 2017, these customers’ accounts receivable balances accounted for approximately 15% and 13% of the Company’s total net accounts receivable balance. Although these customers have been on-going major customers of the Company, the written agreements with these customers do not have any minimum purchase obligations and they could stop buying the Company’s products at any time and for any reason. A reduction, delay or cancellation of orders from these customers or the loss of these customers could significantly reduce the Company’s future revenues and profits. 
During the three months ended January 31, 2018 and 2017, stock-based compensation expense totaled $75,000 and $51,000, respectively. For the three months ended January 31, 2018 and 2017, stock-based compensation classified in cost of sales amounted to none and $3,000, respectively, and stock-based compensation classified in selling and general expense amounted to $75,000 and $48,000, respectively. 
The RF Connector and Cable Assembly segment consisted of one division and the Custom Cabling Manufacturing and Assembly segment was composed of three divisions. The four divisions that met the quantitative thresholds for segment reporting are Connector and Cable Assembly, Cables Unlimited, Comnet and Rel-Tech. The specific customers are different for each division; however, there is some overlapping of product sales to them. The methods used to distribute products are similar within each division aggregated. 
During March 2016, the Company announced the shutdown of its Bioconnect division, which comprised the entire operations of the Medical Cabling and Interconnect segment. The closure is part of the Company’s ongoing plan to close or dispose of underperforming divisions that are not part of the Company’s core operations. For the three months ended January 31, 2017, the Company recognized approximately $10,000 of income from sale of equipment for the Bioconnect division, which has been included within discontinued operations. 
For the three months ended January 31, 2018 and January 31, 2017, the Company recognized approximately $0 and $62,000 of royalty income, respectively, for RadioMobile, which amount has been included within discontinued operations. 
The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements include the accounts of RF Industries, Ltd., Cables Unlimited, Inc. (“Cables Unlimited”), Comnet Telecom Supply, Inc. (“Comnet”), and Rel-Tech Electronics, Inc. (“Rel-Tech”), wholly-owned subsidiaries of RF Industries, Ltd. All intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. The Company’s gross profit as a percentage of sales in the fiscal 2018 quarter increased by 2% to 30% compared to 28% in the fiscal 2017 quarter due primarily to the increased revenues at the Custom Cabling division. 
Engineering expenses increased $0.1 million during the fiscal 2018 quarter to $0.3 million compared to $0.2 million for the fiscal 2017 quarter due to increased salary expense related to engineering activities. Engineering expenses represent costs incurred relating to the ongoing development of new products. 
Selling and general expenses increased by $0.2 million during the fiscal 2018 quarter to $2.2 million from $2.0 million in the prior year. Selling and general as a percentage of sales declined to 21% for the fiscal 2018 quarter as compared to 30% for the fiscal 2017 quarter. The increase in selling and general expenses was primarily due to increased compensation in the form of commissions and accrued bonuses. 
As part of its announced business plan, the Company may from time to time acquire other companies or product lines in the future in order to diversify its product and customer base. Any future acquisitions may require the Company to make cash payments, which may reduce the Company’s future liquidity and capital resources. 
The Company used cash of $0.2 million during the three months ended January 31, 2018 due largely to the impact of increased sales. As a result of the increased sales, accounts receivables ($1.5 million) and inventories ($0.7 million) increased, which was partially offset by increased accounts payable ($0.7 million) and accrued expenses ($0.5 million). This net decrease in cash was partially offset by an increase in cash from net income of $0.5 million, noncash credits of $0.2 million primarily from depreciation and amortization related to the acquisitions of Comnet, Rel-Tech and CompPro, and $0.1 million of stock-based compensation expense. In addition, during the quarter the Company received $0.2 million from the exercise of stock options and paid out $0.2 million in dividends. 
For the fiscal 2018 quarter, net income was $0.5 million and fully diluted EPS was $0.05 per share as compared to a net loss of $0.2 million and fully diluted of net loss of $0.02 per share for the fiscal 2017 quarter. Item 5. Other Information
