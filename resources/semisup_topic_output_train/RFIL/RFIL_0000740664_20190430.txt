On March 15, 2019, through C Enterprises, Inc., its newly formed subsidiary, the Company purchased the business and assets of C Enterprises L.P., a California based designer and manufacturer of quality connectivity solutions to telecommunications and data communications distributors. In consideration for the C Enterprises business and assets, the Company paid $600,000 in cash and assumed certain liabilities. The acquisition was determined not to be material and was accounted for in accordance with the acquisition method of accounting, and the acquired assets and assumed liabilities were recorded by the Company at their estimated fair values in accordance with ASC 805, Business Combinations. There were no intangible assets identified as part of the acquisition. For the fiscal 2019 quarter, income (loss) from continuing operations for the Custom Cabling segment and the RF Connector segment was $1.1 million and $0.3 million, respectively, as compared to $4.4 million and ($0.5) million for the comparable second quarter last year. The decrease in income from continuing operations at the Custom Cabling segment was primarily due to the higher sales in the fiscal 2018 quarter, while the RF Connector segment had an increase in income (loss) from continuing operations due in part to the increase in sales and an increase in gross margins. 
For the fiscal 2019 six month period, income (loss) from continuing operations for the Custom Cabling segment and the RF Connector segment was $1.6 million and $0.5 million, respectively, as compared to $5.0 million and $(0.6) million for the comparable six months last year. The decrease in income from continuing operations at the Custom Cabling segment was primarily due to the higher sales in the fiscal 2018 six month period, while the increase at RF Connector was primarily due in part to the increase in sales and an increase in gross margins. 
Net sales of $24.3 million decreased by 15%, or $4.2 million, for the six months ended April 30, 2019 (the “fiscal 2019 six month period”) when compared to the six months ended April 30, 2018 (the “fiscal 2018 six month period”). The decrease in net sales is attributable to a decrease in net sales at the Company’s Custom Cabling segment. Net sales for the fiscal 2019 six month period at the Company’s Custom Cabling segment decreased $5.4 million, or 24%, to $17.7 million when compared to the fiscal 2018 six month period net sales of $23.1 million. The year-over-year decline in sales was a result of the largest series of orders that the Company has ever received, which orders it received in the year ago six month period ended April 30, 2018. Net sales for the fiscal 2019 six month period at the RF Connector segment increased by $1.2 million, or 23%, to $6.6 million as compared to $5.4 million for the fiscal 2018 six month period. 
Three Months Ended April 30, 2019 vs. Three Months Ended April 30, 2018 
Selling and general expenses decreased by $0.4 million during the fiscal 2019 six month period to $4.4 million from $4.8 million in the fiscal 2018 six month period. The decrease in selling and general expenses was primarily due to the higher compensation resulting from the higher net sales in the fiscal 2018 six month period. Selling and general expenses as a percentage of sales increased to 18% for the fiscal 2019 six month period as compared to 17% for the fiscal 2018 six month period partially due to one-time costs of $100,000 related to the acquisition of C Enterprises in the fiscal 2019 quarter, and partially due to the absorption of the selling and general expenses of the newly acquired C Enterprises. 
Net sales of $13.6 million decreased by 34%, or $6.9 million, for the three months ended April 30, 2019 (the “fiscal 2019 quarter”) when compared to the three months ended April 30, 2018 (the “fiscal 2018 quarter”). Net sales for the fiscal 2019 quarter at the Company’s Custom Cabling segment decreased by $7.5 million, or 42%, when compared to the fiscal 2018 quarter. The year-over-year decline in sales was primarily due to the largest series of orders the Company has ever received in the 2018 fiscal quarter, which orders significantly enhanced net sales in the second quarter of fiscal 2018. The net sales at the Company’s Custom Cabling segment in the fiscal 2019 second quarter were supplemented by $1.7 million of net sales that the Company generated from its newly acquired C Enterprises subsidiary. The Company did not own C Enterprises in the 2018 fiscal year. However, net sales at the Company’s Custom Cabling segment for the second quarter ended April 30, 2019 increased over the first quarter ended January 31, 2019. Even excluding the additional net sales generated by C Enterprises in the second quarter of fiscal 2019, net sales in the Company’s Custom Cabling segment increased by $0.7 million over the first quarter of fiscal 2019. Net sales for the fiscal 2019 quarter at the RF Connector segment increased by $0.6 million, or 22%, to $3.3 million as compared to $2.7 million for the fiscal 2018 quarter. 
Engineering expenses decreased $0.3 million during the fiscal 2019 quarter to $0.3 million compared to $0.6 million for the fiscal 2018 quarter due to higher compensation expense related to engineering activities in the fiscal 2018 quarter to support the higher net sales in the fiscal 2018 quarter. Engineering expenses represent costs incurred relating to the ongoing development of new products. 
The Company’s gross profit as a percentage of sales in the fiscal 2019 six month period decreased by 6% to 30% compared to 36% in the fiscal 2018 six month period due primarily to the substantially higher revenues at the Custom Cabling division in the fiscal 2018 six month period.
