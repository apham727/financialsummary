The RF Connector segment consisted of one division and the Custom Cabling segment was composed of two divisions. The three divisions that met the quantitative thresholds for segment reporting are the RF Connector and Cable Assembly division (“RF Connector division”), Cables Unlimited, and Rel-Tech. While each segment had similar products and services, with one major exception, there was little overlapping of these services to their customer base. In addition, sales or product and services for the RF Connector segment were primarily through the distribution channel while the Custom Cabling segment sales were through a combination of distribution and direct to the end customer. 
Amortization expense for the three months ended January 31, 2019 and the year ended October 31, 2018 was $69,000 and $275,000, respectively. As of January 31, 2019, the weighted-average amortization period for the amortizable intangible assets is 10.98 years. 
The Company paid dividends of $0.02 per share during the three months ended January 31, 2019 and 2018 for a total of $186,000 and $176,000, respectively.  
During the three months ended January 31, 2019 and 2018, stock-based compensation expense totaled $114,000 and $75,000, respectively, and was classified in selling and general expense. 
On March 11, 2019, the Company announced that it has entered into a binding agreement to purchase all of the assets of C Enterprises, L.P., a California based designer, manufacturer, and distributor of fiber and copper custom cables and cable assembles, and other related products used in the data center, networking, and wireless markets. The total cash outlay related to the purchase of C Enterprises is currently not expected to have a material impact on the Company’s liquidity and capital resources. 
Two customers, a distributor and an equipment manufacturer, accounted for approximately 38% and 14%, respectively, of the Company’s net sales for the three-month period ended January 31, 2019. At January 31, 2019, these two customers’ accounts receivable balances accounted for approximately 30% and 22%, respectively, of the total net accounts receivable balance. For the three-month period ended January 31, 2018, one customer, a distributor, accounted for approximately 47% of the Company’s net sales. At January 31, 2018, this customer’s accounts receivable balance accounted for approximately 44% of the Company’s total net accounts receivable balance. Although these customers have been on-going major customers of the Company, the written agreements with these customers do not have any minimum purchase obligations and they could stop buying the Company’s products at any time and for any reason. A reduction, delay or cancellation of orders from these customers or the loss of these customers could significantly reduce the Company’s future revenues and profits. 
On February 1, 2019, Cables Unlimited amended its lease with 100 Bellport Avenue, LLC to expand the leased space by an additional 5,000 square feet, resulting in a total rent expense of $9,375 per month. 
As reviewed by the Company’s chief operating decision maker, the Company evaluates the performance of each segment based on income or loss before income taxes. The Company charges depreciation and amortization directly to each division within the segment. Accounts receivable, inventory, property and equipment, goodwill and intangible assets are the only assets identified by segment. Except as discussed above, the accounting policies for segment reporting are the same for the Company as a whole. For the fiscal 2019 quarter, income (loss) from continuing operations for the Custom Cabling segment and the RF Connector segment was $0.5 million and $0.3 million, respectively, as compared to $0.5 million and ($0.2) million for the comparable first quarter last year. The income from continuing operations at the Custom Cabling segment remained consistent with the first quarter last year, while the RF Connector segment had an increase in income (loss) from continuing operations primarily due to the increase in sales. 
Net sales of $10.6 million increased by 34%, or $2.7 million, for the three months ended January 31, 2019 (the “fiscal 2019 quarter”) when compared to the three months ended January 31, 2018 (the “fiscal 2018 quarter”). Net sales for the fiscal 2019 quarter at the Company’s Custom Cabling segment increased by $2.1 million, or 38%, when compared to the fiscal 2018 quarter as a result of increased sales of fiber optics cable, copper cabling, custom patch cord assemblies and wiring harnesses. The Custom Cabling segment saw an increase in new sales due, in large part, to project work in the OEM and wireless carrier markets in addition to an increase in traditional run rate business. Net sales for the fiscal 2019 quarter at the RF Connector segment increased by $0.6 million, or 24%, to $3.3 million as compared to $2.6 million for the fiscal 2018 quarter. 
Selling and general expenses increased $0.2 million to $2.0 million compared to $1.8 million in the first quarter last year due to higher compensation expenses as a result of increased sales at the Custom Cabling segment. Despite this increase in expenses, selling and general expenses as a percentage of sales declined to 19% of sales compared to 22% of sales in the first quarter last year, reflecting the Company’s focus on increased operational efficiencies. 
Engineering expenses of $0.3 million remained unchanged from the fiscal 2019 to the fiscal 2018 quarter. Engineering expenses represent costs incurred relating to the ongoing development of new products. 
For the three months ended January 31, 2019, most of the Company’s revenues were generated from the Custom Cabling segment from the sale of fiber optics cable, copper cabling, custom patch cord assemblies, and wiring harnesses (which accounted for 69% of the Company’s total sales for the three months ended January 31, 2019). Revenues from the RF Connector segment were generated from the sales of RF connector products and connector cable assemblies and accounted for 31% of the Company’s total sales for the three months ended January 31, 2019. 
The Company used cash of $2.3 million during the three months ended January 31, 2019 due largely to an increase in sales, which resulted in increased inventory purchases and an increase in outstanding accounts receivables as of quarter-end. Net income of $0.6 million, with an added increase in cash from noncash credits of $0.1 million from depreciation and amortization and $0.1 million from stock-based compensation expense, was offset by an increase in accounts receivable ($1.4 million) and inventories ($1.1 million) as well as a decrease in accrued expenses primarily due to the payout of prior year bonuses ($1.3 million) and an increase in accounts payable ($0.4 million). In addition, during the three months ended January 31, 2019, the Company received $0.3 million from the exercise of stock options and paid out $0.2 million in dividends.  Item 5.Other Information
