One customer who is a distributor, accounted for approximately 56% of the Company’s net sales for the nine-month period ended July 31, 2018. This same customer accounted for approximately 51% of the Company’s net sales for the three-month period ended July 31, 2018. At July 31, 2018, this customer’s accounts receivable balance accounted for approximately 53% of the total net accounts receivable balance. For the nine-month period ended July 31, 2017, two customers, a distributor and data center solutions provider accounted for approximately 18% and 13% of the Company’s net sales, respectively. These same two customers accounted for approximately 22% and 11% of the Company’s net sales, respectively, for the three months ended July 31, 2017. At July 31, 2017, these customers’ accounts receivable balances accounted for approximately 26% and 10% of the Company’s total net accounts receivable balance, respectively. Although these customers have been on-going major customers of the Company, the written agreements with these customers do not have any minimum purchase obligations and they could stop buying the Company’s products at any time and for any reason. A reduction, delay or cancellation of orders from these customers or the loss of these customers could significantly reduce the Company’s future revenues and profits.

Three Months Ended July 31, 2018 vs. Three Months Ended July 31, 2017 
Net sales of $13.9 million increased by 77%, or $6.0 million, for the three months ended July 31, 2018 (the “fiscal 2018 quarter”) when compared to the three months ended July 31, 2017 (the “fiscal 2017 quarter”). Net sales for the fiscal 2018 quarter at the Company’s Custom Cabling Manufacturing and Assembly segment (Custom Cabling) increased by $5.9 million, or 121%, when compared to the fiscal 2017 quarter as a result of increased sales of fiber optics cable, copper cabling, custom patch cord assemblies and wiring harnesses. The Custom Cabling Manufacturing and Assembly segment saw an increase in new sales due, in large part, to project work in the OEM and wireless carrier markets in addition to an increase in traditional run rate business. Net sales for the fiscal 2018 quarter at the RF Connector and Cable Assembly segment (RF Connector) increased by $0.1 million, or 3%, to $3.1 million as compared to $3.0 million for the fiscal 2017 quarter. 
The Company’s gross profit as a percentage of sales in the fiscal 2018 nine month period increased by 7% to 34% compared to 27% in the fiscal 2017 nine month period due primarily to the increased revenues at the Custom Cabling division. The improvement in gross margins was primarily due to the revenue increase at the Custom Cabling segment which had the effect of spreading certain fixed manufacturing costs over a larger revenue base. 
Engineering expenses increased $0.1 million during the fiscal 2018 quarter to $0.3 million compared to $0.2 million for the fiscal 2017 quarter due to increased compensation expense related to engineering activities. Engineering expenses represent costs incurred relating to the ongoing development of new products. 
Engineering expenses increased $0.7 million during the fiscal 2018 nine month period to $1.3 million compared to $0.6 million for the fiscal 2017 nine month period due to increased compensation expense related to engineering activities. Engineering expenses represent costs incurred relating to the ongoing development of new products. 
Selling and general expenses increased by $2.2 million during the fiscal 2018 nine month period to $7.7 million from $5.5 million in the fiscal 2017 nine month period. The increase in selling and general expenses was primarily due to increased compensation resulting from the increase in net sales. Selling and general as a percentage of sales declined to 17% for the fiscal 2018 nine month period as compared to 25% for the fiscal 2017 nine month period indicating the Company’s increased operational efficiencies.
