For the fiscal 2019 nine month period, income (loss) from continuing operations for the Custom Cabling segment and the RF Connector segment was $2.7 million and $0.7 million, respectively, as compared to $6.8 million and $(0.4) million for the comparable nine months last year. The decrease in income from continuing operations at the Custom Cabling segment in 2019 was primarily due to lower gross margins during the fiscal 2019 nine month period, while the increase at RF Connector was primarily due in part to the increase in sales and gross margins. 
For the fiscal 2019 quarter, income from continuing operations for the Custom Cabling segment and the RF Connector segment was $1.1 million and $0.2 million, respectively, as compared to $1.8 million and $0.2 million for the comparable third quarter last year. The decrease in income from continuing operations at the Custom Cabling and RF Connector segments was primarily due to the decrease in gross margins during the fiscal 2019 quarter. 
Net sales of $39.8 million decreased by 1%, or $0.5 million, for the nine months ended July 31, 2019 (the “fiscal 2019 nine month period”) when compared to the nine months ended July 31, 2018 (the “fiscal 2018 nine month period”) despite the additional sales derived in 2019 from the newly acquired C Enterprises subsidiary. The decrease in net sales is attributable to a decrease in net sales at the Company’s Custom Cabling segment, which decreased by $2.1 million, or 7%, to $29.7 million when compared to the fiscal 2018 nine month period net sales of $31.8 million. The year-over-year decline in sales was a result of the largest series of orders that the Company has ever received in the year ago nine month period ended July 31, 2018. Net sales for the fiscal 2019 nine month period at the RF Connector segment increased by $1.6 million, or 18%, to $10.0 million as compared to $8.5 million for the fiscal 2018 nine month period. 
Net sales of $15.5 million increased by 31%, or $3.7 million, for the three months ended July 31, 2019 (the “fiscal 2019 quarter”) when compared to the three months ended July 31, 2018 (the “fiscal 2018 quarter”). Net sales for the fiscal 2019 quarter at the Company’s Custom Cabling segment increased by $3.4 million, or 39%, when compared to the fiscal 2018 quarter as a result of increased sales of fiber optics cable, copper cabling, custom patch cord assemblies and wiring harnesses. Net sales for the fiscal 2019 quarter at the RF Connector segment increased by $0.3 million, or 10%, to $3.5 million as compared to $3.1 million for the fiscal 2018 quarter. The increase in net sales reflects a full quarter of sales contribution from the Company’s acquisition of C Enterprises, as well as growth in both the Company’s traditional run rate business and its project work in the OEM and wireless carrier markets. 
Selling and general expenses increased by $0.4 million during the fiscal 2019 nine month period to $7.0 million from $6.6 million in the fiscal 2018 nine month period. Selling and general expenses as a percentage of sales increased to 18% for the fiscal 2019 nine month period as compared to 16% for the fiscal 2018 nine month period. The increase in selling and general expenses was primarily due to the absorption of the selling and general expenses of the newly acquired C Enterprises and one-time costs of $100,000 related to the acquisition of C Enterprises in the second quarter of fiscal 2019 partially offset by a decrease in commissions. 
Engineering expenses decreased by $0.2 million in the fiscal 2019 nine month period to $1.0 million compared to $1.2 million for the fiscal 2018 nine month period due to higher engineering activities to support the higher net sales in the fiscal 2018 nine month period. Engineering expenses represent costs incurred relating to the ongoing development of new products. 
Three Months Ended July 31, 2019 vs. Three Months Ended July 31, 2018 
Selling and general expenses increased $0.8 million to $2.6 million (17% of sales) compared to $1.8 million (15% of sales) in the third quarter last year due to the absorption of the selling and general expenses of the newly acquired C Enterprises, increased compensation primarily due to timing of bonus accruals, increased marketing costs with the Company’s distributors, and costs related to the evaluation of possible strategic acquisition transactions.
