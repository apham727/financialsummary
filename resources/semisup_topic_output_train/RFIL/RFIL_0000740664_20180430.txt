Net sales for the fiscal 2018 quarter at the Company’s Custom Cabling Manufacturing and Assembly segment (Custom Cabling) increased by $14.6 million, or 292%, when compared to the fiscal 2017 quarter as a result of increased sales of fiber optics cable, copper cabling, custom patch cord assemblies and wiring harnesses. The Custom Cabling Manufacturing and Assembly segment saw an increase in new sales due, in large part, to project work in the OEM and wireless carrier markets in addition to an increase in traditional run rate business. Net sales for the fiscal 2018 quarter at the RF Connector and Cable Assembly segment (RF Connector) increased by $0.1 million, or 4%, to $2.7 million as compared to $2.6 million for the fiscal 2017 quarter. 
For the fiscal 2018 quarter, income (loss) from continuing operations for the Custom Cabling segment and the RF Connector segment was $4.3 million and $(0.3) million, respectively, as compared to none and $0.1 million for the comparable second quarter last year. The increase in income from continuing operations at the Custom Cabling segment was primarily due to the increase in sales while the decrease at the RF Connector segment was primarily due to corporate overhead allocations related to accrued bonuses as a result of the increased profitability of the Company overall. 
For the fiscal 2018 six month, income (loss) from continuing operations for the Custom Cabling segment and the RF Connector segment was $4.9 million and $(0.3) million, respectively, as compared to $(0.4) million and $0.1 million for the comparable six months last year. The increase in income from continuing operations at the Custom Cabling segment was primarily due to the increase in sales while the decrease at the RF Connector segment was primarily due to corporate overhead allocations related to accrued bonuses as a result of the increased profitability of the Company overall. 
The Company’s gross profit as a percentage of sales in the fiscal 2018 six month period increased by 7% to 34% compared to 27% in the fiscal 2017 six month period due primarily to the increased revenues at the Custom Cabling division. The improvement in gross margins was primarily due to the revenue increase at the Custom Cabling segment which had the effect of spreading certain fixed manufacturing costs over a larger revenue base. 
Engineering expenses increased $0.4 million during the fiscal 2018 quarter to $0.6 million compared to $0.2 million for the fiscal 2017 quarter due to increased compensation expense related to engineering activities. Engineering expenses represent costs incurred relating to the ongoing development of new products. 
Selling and general expenses increased $1.7 million to $3.4 million compared to $1.7 million in the second quarter last year due to higher compensation related to the sales gains at Custom Cabling. Despite this increase in expenses, selling and general expenses as a percentage of sales declined to 15% of sales compared to 22% of sales in the second quarter last year indicating the Company’s increased operational efficiencies.
