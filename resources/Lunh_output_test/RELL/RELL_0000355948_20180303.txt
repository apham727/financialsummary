The accompanying unaudited consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with United States Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (“GAAP”) for interim financial information and the instructions to Form 10-Q and Article 10 of Regulation S-X.
The financial information contained in this report should be read in conjunction with our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended May 27, 2017, that we filed on July 31, 2017.
The core principle of the guidance is that entities should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods and services.
During the fourth quarter of each fiscal year, our goodwill balances are reviewed for impairment using the first day of our fourth quarter as the measurement date.
If after reviewing the totality of events or circumstances, we determine that it is not likely that the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount, then we test for impairment through the application of a fair value based test.
Intangible assets that have finite useful lives are amortized over their useful lives either on a straight-line basis or over their projected future cash flows and are tested for impairment when events or changes in circumstances occur that indicate possible impairment.
Prior to the liquidation of our investment in equity securities, our investments in equity securities were classified as available-for-sale and were carried at their fair value based on quoted market prices.
Prior to liquidating the equity securities, we reinvested proceeds from the sale of securities, and the cost of the equity securities sold was based on a specific identification method.
We recorded an income tax provision from continuing operations of $1.1 million and $0.8 million for the first nine months of fiscal 2018 and the first nine months of fiscal 2017, respectively.
The effective income tax rate from continuing operations during the first nine months of fiscal 2018 was a tax provision of 65.0%, as compared to a tax provision of (13.7%) during the first nine months of fiscal 2017.
The difference in rate during the first nine months of fiscal 2018, as compared to the first nine months of fiscal 2017, reflects the change in the overall loss realized through the third quarter in each respective period, changes in our geographical distribution of income (loss), the recording of provision to return true-ups of various foreign jurisdictions, the accrual of an uncertain tax position with respect to a German audit and our positions with respect to permanent reinvestment of foreign earnings under ASC 740-30, Income Taxes - Other Considerations or Special Areas (“ASC 740-30”).
Primarily as a result of those provisions of the Act, the Company recorded a deferred remeasurement impact of approximately $1.6 million, which was fully offset by the valuation allowance movement.
Additionally, the estimated deemed earnings repatriation tax, net of available foreign tax credits brought back as part of the deemed repatriation, was $3.5 million.
The Company does not anticipate any cash tax payments due to the foreign tax credit carryforwards available to fully offset the provisional deemed repatriation tax.
The Company completed a preliminary assessment of earnings that could be repatriated based on reinvestment needs of non-U.S. operations and earnings available for repatriation.
Based on the effective date of certain provisions, the Company will be subject to additional requirements of the Act beginning in fiscal 2019.
The Company also has not determined its accounting policy to treat the taxes due on GILTI as a period cost or include in the determination of deferred taxes.
