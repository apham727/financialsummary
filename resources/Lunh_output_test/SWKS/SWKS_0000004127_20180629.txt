In March 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) 2016-09, Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting, which is intended to simplify several aspects of the accounting for share-based payment transactions, including the income tax consequences, classification of awards as either equity or liabilities, and classification on the statement of cash flows.
The change in accounting for forfeitures was applied using a modified retrospective transition method and resulted in a cumulative-effect adjustment to retained earnings as of the beginning of the first quarter of fiscal year 2018 in the amount of $1.9 million.
The Company will adopt this guidance during the first quarter of fiscal year 2019 and currently expects to apply the modified retrospective approach, with the cumulative effect of applying the new guidance recognized as an adjustment to the opening retained earnings balance.
The assessment process consists of reviewing the Company's current accounting policies and practices to identify potential differences that would result from applying the requirements of the new standard to its revenue contracts and identifying appropriate changes to the business processes, systems and controls to support revenue recognition and disclosure requirements under the new standard.
As the Company continues to assess the impact of the new guidance on its revenue contracts with its customers and finalizes its evaluation of any changes to its accounting policies, internal controls and footnote disclosures, the Company may identify additional areas of impact and may revise the results of its preliminary assessment.
In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-13, Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments (Topic 320) (“ASU 2016-13”), which requires a financial asset (or a group of financial assets) measured on the basis of amortized cost to be presented at the net amount expected to be collected.
In January 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-01, Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities (Topic 320) (“ASU 2016-01”), which provides guidance for the recognition, measurement, presentation, and disclosure of financial assets and liabilities.
•Level 2 - Observable inputs other than Level 1 prices, such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities, quoted prices in markets with insufficient volume or infrequent transactions (less active markets), or model-driven valuations in which all significant inputs are observable or can be derived principally from, or corroborated with, observable market data.
The Company’s non-financial assets and liabilities, such as goodwill, intangible assets, and other long-lived assets resulting from business combinations, are measured at fair value using income approach valuation methodologies at the date of acquisition and are subsequently re-measured if there are indicators of impairment.
The difference between the Company’s effective tax rate and the 24.6% United States federal statutory rate for the three months ended June 29, 2018, resulted primarily from a decrease to tax expense of $12.0 million related to the release of tax reserves due to the lapse of the statute of limitations, an adjustment to the mandatory deemed repatriation tax on foreign earnings, foreign earnings taxed at rates lower than the federal statutory rate, the domestic production activities deduction, research and experimentation tax credits earned, and a benefit of $1.1 million related to windfall stock deductions, partially offset by an increase in tax expense related to a change in the reserve for uncertain tax positions.
The difference between the Company’s effective tax rate and the 24.6% United States federal statutory rate for the nine months ended June 29, 2018, resulted primarily from a one-time charge of $238.0 million related to the mandatory deemed repatriation tax on foreign earnings, a one-time charge of $18.5 million related to the revaluation of the deferred tax assets and liabilities related to tax reform, and an increase in tax expense related to a change in the reserve for uncertain tax positions, partially offset by foreign earnings taxed at rates lower than the federal statutory rate, the domestic production activities deduction, research and experimentation tax credits earned, a decrease to tax expense of $12.0 million related to the release of tax reserves due to the lapse of the statute of limitations, and a benefit of $23.6 million related to windfall stock deductions.
On December 22, 2017, the President of the United States signed into law new tax legislation, which includes, among other things, a reduction of the United States corporate tax rate from 35% to 21%, a mandatory deemed repatriation tax on foreign earnings, repeal of the corporate alternative minimum tax and the domestic production activities deduction, and expensing of certain capital investments.
Therefore, the Company is subject to a blended fiscal year 2018 tax rate of approximately 24.6%, which is computed by using the number of days of the fiscal year during which the Company is subject to the old tax rate of 35% and the number of days the Company is subject to the newly enacted tax rate of 21%.
On January 31, 2018, the Board of Directors approved a stock repurchase program, pursuant to which the Company is authorized to repurchase up to $1.0 billion of its common stock from time to time prior to January 31, 2020, on the open market or in privately negotiated transactions, as permitted by securities laws and other legal requirements.
During the three months ended June 29, 2018, the Company paid $240.3 million (including commissions) in connection with the repurchase of 2.5 million shares of its common stock (paying an average price of $97.43 per share).

This increase in net revenue for the nine months ended June 29, 2018, is primarily related to an increase in demand for our components from smartphone customers and an increase in demand from customers within the Internet of Things, automotive, industrial, medical and military industries, as compared with the corresponding period in fiscal year 2017, offset by decreases in average selling prices.
The $104.2 million increase in gross profit for the nine months ended June 29, 2018, as compared with the corresponding period in fiscal year 2017, was primarily the result of favorable product mix, lower per-unit materials and manufacturing costs and higher unit volumes that positively impacted gross profit by $227.0 million.
The increase in research and development expenses for the three and nine months ended June 29, 2018, as compared with the corresponding periods in fiscal year 2017, was primarily related to an increase in employee-related compensation expense and product development–related expenses.
The decrease in amortization expense for the three and nine months ended June 29, 2018, as compared with the corresponding periods in fiscal year 2017, was primarily due to the end of the useful lives of certain intangible assets that were acquired in prior fiscal years.

The difference between our effective tax rate for the nine months ended June 29, 2018, of 36.0% and the federal statutory rate of 24.6% resulted primarily from a one-time charge of $238.0 million related to the mandatory deemed repatriation tax on foreign earnings, a one-time charge of $18.5 million related to the revaluation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities related to tax reform, and an increase in tax expense related to a change in the reserve for uncertain tax positions, partially offset by foreign earnings taxed at rates lower than the federal statutory rate, the domestic production activities deduction, research and experimentation tax credits earned, a decrease to tax expense of $12.0 million related to the release of tax reserves due to the lapse of statute of limitations and a benefit of $23.6 million related to windfall stock deductions.
•$524.5 million related to our repurchase of 5.1 million shares of our common stock pursuant to the stock repurchase programs approved by our Board of Directors on January 31, 2018, and January 19, 2017; •$175.2 million related to the payment of cash dividends on our common stock; and •$47.5 million related to the minimum statutory payroll tax withholdings payments on the vesting of employee performance and restricted stock awards.
The decrease resulted from $524.5 million used to repurchase 5.1 million shares of stock, $175.2 million in cash dividend payments, $47.5 million used to repurchase shares related to payroll tax withholdings on equity awards, $490.6 million in net purchases of marketable securities and $310.0 million in capital expenditures which was partially offset by $1,053.0 million in cash generated from operations.
Based on our historical results of operations, we expect that our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities on hand and the cash we expect to generate from operations will be sufficient to fund our research and development, capital expenditures, potential acquisitions, working capital, quarterly cash dividend payments (if such dividends are declared by the Board of Directors), outstanding commitments and other liquidity requirements associated with existing operations for at least the next 12 months.
Our contractual obligations disclosure in the 2017 10-K has not materially changed since we filed that report, except for the $238.0 million deemed repatriation tax on foreign earnings, which is payable over the next eight years, $19.0 million per year for each of the next five years, followed by payments of $35.8 million, $47.7 million, and $59.5 million in years six through eight, respectively.
