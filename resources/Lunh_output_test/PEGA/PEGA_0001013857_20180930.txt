Subscription revenue reflects client arrangements (term license, cloud, and maintenance) which may be subject to a renewal.
The change in ACV measures the growth and predictability of future cash flows from committed term, cloud, and maintenance arrangements as of the end of the particular reporting period.
the sum of the annual value of each term and cloud contract in effect on such date, with the annual value of a term or cloud contract being equal to the total value of the contract divided by the total number of years of the contract.
Thus, we estimate stand-alone selling price for software licenses and cloud performance obligations using the residual approach, determined based on total transaction price minus the stand-alone selling price of other performance obligations promised in the contract.
In applying our revenue recognition policy, we must determine which portions of our revenue are recognized in the current period and which portions must be deferred and recognized in future periods.
Subscription revenue reflects client arrangements (term license, cloud, and maintenance) which may be subject to a renewal.
Our license revenue is primarily derived from sales of our applications and Pega Platform.
Revenue from cloud arrangements is generally recognized over time throughout the service period, while revenue from license arrangements is generally recognized upfront when the license rights become effective.
The decrease in term license revenue in the three months ended September 30, 2018 was primarily due to $17 million of revenue recognized in the three months ended September 30, 2017 from a large term license renewal.
