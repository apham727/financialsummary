Unbilled receivables in the Companys unaudited condensed consolidated balance sheets increased significantly upon adoption due to the revenue from term licenses being recognized prior to amounts billed, or prepaid by, clients and perpetual licenses with extended payment terms.
This change primarily impacts the Companys contracts related to multi-year cloud offerings, maintenance on term and perpetual licenses, and those long-term term and perpetual licenses with client usage rights that increase over time.
Includes cash, cash equivalents, marketable securities, income taxes receivable, other current assets, property and equipment, intangible assets, goodwill, and other long-term assets (as reflected in the consolidated balance sheets in the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2017).
Adoption of ASC 606 and ASC 340-40 had no impact on total cash from or used in operating, financing, or investing activities in the Companys unaudited condensed consolidated statements of cash flows for the six months ended June 30, 2017.
Unbilled receivables is the amount due from clients where the only condition on the right of payment is the passage of time.

We develop, market, license, and support software applications for customer engagement and digital process automation, in addition to licensing our Pega Platform application development product for clients that wish to build and extend their own applications.
Our strategy is to sell a client a series of licenses, each focused on a specific purpose or area of operations in support of longer term enterprise-wide digital transformation initiatives.
Our license revenue is primarily derived from sales of our applications and Pega Platform.
The change in ACV measures the growth and predictability of future cash flows from committed term, cloud, and maintenance arrangements as of the end of the particular reporting period.
The sum of the annual value of each term and cloud contract in effect on such date, with the annual value of a term or cloud contract being equal to the total value of the contract divided by the total number of years of the contract.
Judgment is required to determine whether each product and service is considered to be a distinct performance obligation that should be accounted for separately under the contract.
Thus, we estimate stand-alone selling price for software licenses and cloud performance obligations using the residual approach, determined based on total transaction price minus the stand-alone selling price of other performance obligations promised in the contract.
In applying our revenue recognition policy, we must determine which portions of our revenue are recognized currently and which portions must be deferred and recognized in future periods.
We analyze various factors including, but not limited to, the selling price of undelivered services when sold on a stand-alone basis, our pricing policies, and contractual terms and conditions to help us make such judgments about revenue recognition.
The decrease in term license revenue in the six months ended June 30, 2018 was primarily due to $35.3 million in revenue recognized in the three months ended March 31, 2017 from a large term license renewal.
