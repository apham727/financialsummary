The accompanying unaudited consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto for the year ended December 31, 2017, included in our annual report on Form 10-K, filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
In our opinion, the accompanying consolidated financial statements reflect all adjustments (consisting only of normal recurring items) considered necessary to present fairly our financial position at September 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017, the results of our operations and comprehensive income for three and nine months ended September 30, 2018 and 2017, and the cash flows for the nine months ended September 30, 2018 and 2017.
Our operating results for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2018 are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for the year ending December 31, 2018.
During the three months ended September 30, 2018, we recorded a non-cash out of period adjustment of $2.3 million related to the deferral of gross profit associated with intercompany purchases from our equity-method investee that should have been recognized when realized, through transactions with third-parties, beginning in January 2011.
We evaluated the adjustment from a qualitative and quantitative perspective and concluded that the amount of income was not material to any individual prior quarter or year and that the cumulative out of period adjustment was not expected to be material to our full year 2018 results.
Stock awards to acquire 36,600 shares and 40,700 shares for the three months ended September 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively, and 537,000 shares and 22,300 shares for the nine months ended September 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively, were excluded in the computations of diluted EPS because the effect of including the stock awards would have been anti-dilutive.
There were no other significant changes in our accounting policies during the nine months ended September 30, 2018 compared to the significant accounting policies described in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2017.
The current portion of unbilled receivables is included in "accounts receivable, net" on the consolidated balance sheet and is not material.
Shipping and handling costs associated with outbound freight after control over a product has transferred to a customer are accounted for as a fulfillment cost and are in included in cost of sales.
Under this method, we evaluated all contracts that were in effect at the beginning of 2018 as if those contracts had been accounted for under the new revenue standard.
We did not evaluate individual modifications for those periods prior to the adoption date, but the aggregate effect of all modifications as of the adoption date and such effects are provided below.
A cumulative catch-up adjustment was recorded to beginning retained earnings to reflect the impact of all existing arrangements under the new revenue standard.
We do not expect the impact of the adoption of the new revenue standard to be material to our annual net income on an ongoing basis.
Historically, we have had to defer revenue for certain types of licenses arrangements and recognize revenue for such licenses ratably over the license term.
Under the new revenue standard, we are no longer required to establish vendor-specific objective evidence ("VSOE") to recognize software license revenue separately from the other elements, and we are able to recognize all software license revenue once the customer obtains control of the license, which will generally occur at the start of each license term.
Revenue is recognized upon transfer of control of the promised products or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration we expect to receive in exchange for those products or services.

However, in the ordinary course of our business, we have in the past, are currently and will likely become involved in various legal proceedings, claims, and regulatory, tax or government inquiries and investigations, and could incur uninsured liability in any one or more of them.
Uncertainty about global and regional economic conditions poses a risk to us as businesses may postpone spending in response to tighter credit, higher unemployment, financial market volatility, tariffs and other trade restrictions government austerity programs, negative financial news, geopolitical instability, declines in income or asset values, or other factors.
We plan to continue to make significant investments in research, development, and marketing for new and existing products and technologies.
We have made and expect to make significant investments in software development related to the new and enhanced features of this product.
These investments involve a number of risks as the commercial success of such efforts depend on many factors, including our ability to anticipate and respond to innovation, achieve the desired technological fit, and be effective with our marketing and distribution efforts.
Even if our new products are profitable, our operating margins for new products may not be as high as the margins we have experienced historically.
Our success is dependent on our ability to successfully develop and introduce new and enhanced products on a timely basis to replace declining revenues from older products, and on increasing penetration in domestic and international markets.
