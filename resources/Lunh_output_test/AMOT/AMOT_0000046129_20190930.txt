Refer to information included in Non - GAAP Measures below for a reconciliation of revenue to revenue excluding foreign currency exchange impacts.
Sales to U.S. customers were 59% of total sales for the quarter compared with 55% for the same period last year, with the balance of sales to customers primarily in Europe, Canada and Asia.
The overall increase in revenue was due to an 22.7% volume increase offset by a 2.0% unfavorable currency impact.
Sales to U.S. customers were 57% of total sales for 2019 compared with 53% for the same period last year, with the balance of sales to customers primarily in Europe, Canada and Asia.

Revenue excluding foreign currency exchange impacts, EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are provided for information purposes only and are not measures of financial performance under GAAP.
The Company believes that revenue excluding foreign currency exchange impacts is a useful measure in analyzing organic sales results.
The Company excludes the effect of currency translation from revenue for this measure because currency translation is not under managements control, is subject to volatility and can obscure underlying business trends.
The portion of revenue attributable to currency translation is calculated as the difference between the current period revenue and the current period revenue after applying foreign exchange rates from the prior period.
EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA do not represent and should not be considered as an alternative to net income, operating income, net cash provided by operating activities or any other measure for determining operating performance or liquidity that is calculated in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.
During the third quarter of 2019, the increase in cash provided by operating activities is primarily due to a decrease in working capital needs primarily for inventories despite increased revenues along with higher levels of orders, particularly in the second quarter of 2019.
The significant cash used in investing activities in 2018 reflects the acquisition the Maval OE Steering business.
