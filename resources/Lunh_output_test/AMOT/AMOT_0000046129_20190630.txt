Excluding the unfavorable effects of foreign currency exchange (FX) of $2,010, second quarter revenue was $94,640, up 18.3%.
For the six months ended June 30, 2019, excluding the unfavorable effects of FX of $5,150, revenue was $191,676, up 22.4%.
Refer to information included in Non - GAAP Measures below for a reconciliation of revenue to revenue excluding foreign currency exchange impacts.
Sales to U.S. customers were 58% of total sales for the quarter compared with 52% for the same period last year, with the balance of sales to customers primarily in Europe, Canada and Asia.
The overall increase in revenue was due to an 18.3% volume increase offset by a 2.5% unfavorable currency impact.
Sales to U.S. customers were 56% of total sales for 2019 compared with 52% for the same period last year, with the balance of sales to customers primarily in Europe, Canada and Asia.
Sales volume increased by 22.4% for the six months ended June 30, 2019, offset by a 3.3% unfavorable currency impact.
Revenue excluding foreign currency exchange impacts, EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are provided for information purposes only and are not measures of financial performance under GAAP.
The Company believes that revenue excluding foreign currency exchange impacts is a useful measure in analyzing organic sales results.
The Company excludes the effect of currency translation from revenue for this measure because currency translation is not under managements control, is subject to volatility and can obscure underlying business trends.
The portion of revenue attributable to currency translation is calculated as the difference between the current period revenue and the current period revenue after applying foreign exchange rates from the prior period.
EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA do not represent and should not be considered as an alternative to net income, operating income, net cash provided by operating activities or any other measure for determining operating performance or liquidity that is calculated in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.
The Companys liquidity position as measured by cash and cash equivalents increased by $1,790 to a balance of $10,463 at June 30, 2019 from December 31, 2018.
During the second quarter of 2019, the increase in cash provided by operating activities is primarily due to a decrease in working capital needs primarily for inventories despite increased revenues along with higher levels of orders, particularly in the second quarter of 2019.
During the second quarter of 2019, the Company made payments on the revolver that offset all but $695 of the 2019 borrowings.
The cash used in financing activities in first quarter 2018 reflects the use of the revolver to partially finance the acquisition of the Maval OE Steering business.

For the six months ended June 30, 2019 we estimate that foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations decreased sales by approximately $5,200 compared to the six months ended June 30, 2018.
The translation adjustment was a gain of approximately $500 and a loss of approximately $3,500 for the second quarter of 2019 and 2018, respectively.
Net foreign currency transaction gains and losses included in other income, net amounted to a gain of $19 and $294 for the second quarter of 2019 and 2018, respectively.
For the six months ended June 30, 2019 and 2018, net foreign currency transaction gains and losses included in other income, net were a loss of $58 and a gain of $156, respectively.
A hypothetical 10% change in the value of the U.S. dollar in relation to our most significant foreign currency net assets would have had an impact of approximately $7,100 on our foreign net assets as of June 30, 2018.
Interest rates on our Revolving Facility are based on the LIBOR plus a margin of 1.00% to 2.25% (currently 2.0%) or the Prime Rate plus a margin of 0% to 1.25% (currently 1.0%), in each case depending on the Companys ratio of total funded indebtedness to Consolidated EBITDA.
