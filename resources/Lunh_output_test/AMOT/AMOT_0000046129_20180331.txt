The Company has no obligation or intent to release publicly any revisions to any forward looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events, or otherwise.
Sales to U.S. customers were 53% of total sales for the quarter compared with 54% for the same period last year, with the balance of sales to customers primarily in Europe, Canada and Asia.
The overall increase in revenue was due to an 18% volume increase and a 7% favorable currency impact.
EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are provided for information purposes only and are not measures of financial performance under GAAP.
The Company believes EBITDA is often a useful measure of a Companys operating performance and is a significant basis used by the Companys management to measure the operating performance of the Companys business because EBITDA excludes charges for depreciation, amortization and interest expense that have resulted from our debt financings, as well as our provision for income tax expense.
The Company also believes that Adjusted EBITDA provides helpful information about the operating performance of its business.
EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA do not represent and should not be considered as an alternative to net income, operating income, net cash provided by operating activities or any other measure for determining operating performance or liquidity that is calculated in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.
The decrease in operating cash flows during the first quarter of 2018 compared to 2017 is due to increased working capital needs, related to both the acquisition of the Mavel OE Steering business, and organic growth.
The significant cash used in investing activities in 2018 reflects the acquisition the Mavel OE Steering business during the quarter.
Also during the first quarter of 2018, purchases of property and equipment were $2,222 compared to $1,288 for the first quarter of 2017.
Also, during the first quarter of 2018, we made payments of $4,350 for our Revolving Facility, including $1,850 to completely pay off our foreign revolver.
As of March 31, 2018, the amount available to borrow under the Credit Agreement was approximately $61,538.

We estimate that foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations during the quarter ended March 31, 2018 increased sales in comparison to quarter ended March 31, 2017 by approximately $4,000.
Net foreign currency transaction gains and losses included in other income, net amounted to a loss of $138 and $70 for the first quarter of 2018 and 2017, respectively.
A hypothetical 10% change in the value of the U.S. dollar in relation to our most significant foreign currency net assets would have had an impact of approximately $6,300 on our foreign net assets as of March 31, 2018.
Interest rates on our Revolving Facility are based on the LIBOR plus a margin of 1.00% to 2.25% (currently 1.50%) or the Prime Rate plus a margin of 0% to 1.25% (currently 0.50%), in each case depending on the Companys ratio of total funded indebtedness to Consolidated EBITDA.
During October 2013, the Company entered into two interest rate swaps with a combined notional of $25,000 (representing 50% of the Term Loan balance at that time) that amortize quarterly to a notional of $6,673 at maturity.
In February 2017, we entered into three interest rate swaps with a combined notional of $40,000 that matures in February 2022.
