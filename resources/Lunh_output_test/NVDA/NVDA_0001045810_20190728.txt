Except for the accounting policy for leases, which was updated as a result of adopting a new accounting standard related to leases, there have been no material changes to our significant accounting policies in Note 1 - Organization and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended January 27, 2019.

Note 2 - Merger Agreement with Mellanox Technologies, Ltd. On March 10, 2019, we entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger, or the Merger Agreement, with Mellanox Technologies Ltd., or Mellanox, pursuant to which we will acquire all of the issued and outstanding common shares of Mellanox for $125 per share in cash, representing a total enterprise value of approximately $6.9 billion as of the date of the Merger Agreement.
On January 28, 2019, we adopted the new lease accounting standard using the optional transition method by recognizing a cumulative-effect adjustment to the consolidated balance sheet and not adjusting comparative information for prior periods.
In addition, we elected the package of practical expedients permitted under the transition guidance, which allowed us not to reassess (1) whether any expired or existing contracts are or contain leases, (2) lease classification for any expired or existing leases, and (3) initial direct costs for any existing leases.
The cumulative-effect adjustment upon adoption of the new lease accounting standard resulted in the recognition of $470 million of operating lease assets and $500 million of operating lease liabilities on our Consolidated Balance Sheet.

The effective tax rate for the second quarter and first half of fiscal year 2020 was 8.8% and 4.9%, respectively, and 6.7% and 5.9% for the second quarter and first half of fiscal year 2019, respectively.
The increase in our effective tax rate for the second quarter of fiscal year 2020 as compared to the second quarter of fiscal year 2019 was primarily due to an increase in the amount of earnings subject to United States tax, and a decrease of tax benefits from stock-based compensation, partially offset by an increase in the impact of tax benefits from the U.S. federal research tax credit.
The decrease in our effective tax rate for the first half of fiscal year 2020 as compared to the first half of fiscal year 2019 was primarily due to an increase in the impact of tax benefits from the U.S. federal research tax credit and stock-based compensation.
Gains or losses on the contracts are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income or loss and reclassified to operating expense when the related operating expenses are recognized in earnings or ineffectiveness should occur.

We previously communicated our intent to return $3.00 billion to shareholders by the end of fiscal year 2020, including $700 million in share repurchases made during the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2019.
