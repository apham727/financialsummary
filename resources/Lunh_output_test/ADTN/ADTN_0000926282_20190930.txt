The interim financial statements should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in ADTRAN’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018, filed with the SEC on February 28, 2019 (as amended on September 20, 2019, the “2018 Form 10-K”).
Our more significant estimates include the excess and obsolete inventory reserves, warranty reserves, customer rebates, determination of the deferred and accrued revenue components of multiple performance obligations sales agreements, estimated costs to complete obligations associated with deferred and accrued revenue, estimated income tax provision and income tax contingencies, the fair value of stock-based compensation, impairment of goodwill, valuation and estimated lives of intangible assets, estimated pension liability, fair value of investments and the evaluation of other-than-temporary declines in the value of investments.
During the three months ended June 30, 2019, the Company determined that there was an immaterial misstatement of its excess and obsolete inventory reserves in its previously issued annual and interim financial statements.
The Company corrected this misstatement by recognizing a $0.8 million out-of-period adjustment during the three months ended June 30, 2019, which increased its excess and obsolete inventory reserves and cost of goods sold for the period.
For the six months ended June 30, 2019, the out-of-period adjustment was a cumulative $0.2 million reduction in the Company’s excess and obsolete inventory reserves and cost of goods sold.
In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842), which requires an entity to recognize right-of-use assets and lease liabilities on the balance sheet and to disclose key information about the entity’s leasing arrangements.
In July 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-10, Codification Improvements to Topic 842, Leases, which clarified certain aspects of ASU 2016-02, as well as ASU 2018-11, Leases (Topic 842), Targeted Improvements, which provided for an optional transition method allowing for the application of the legacy lease guidance, Leases (Topic 840), including its disclosure requirements, for the comparative periods presented in the year of adoption, with the cumulative effect of initially applying the new lease standard recognized as an adjustment to retained earnings as of the date of adoption.
In March 2019, the FASB issued ASU 2019-01, Leases (Topic 842) Codification Improvements, which removed the requirement for an entity to disclose in the interim periods after adoption, the effect of the change on income from continuing operations, net income, any other affected financial statement line item, and any affected per share amount.
At that time, the Company elected to carry forward the legacy ASC 840 disclosures for comparative periods and, therefore, did not adjust the comparative period financial information prior to January 1, 2019.
In addition, the Company elected the package of practical expedients which allows for companies to not reassess whether any expired or existing contracts are or contain leases, not reassess historical lease classifications for expired or existing contracts and not reassess initial direct costs for existing leases.
Additionally, the Company elected the practical expedients which allow the use of hindsight when determining the lease term, the short-term lease recognition exemption and the option to not separate lease and non-lease components.
As a lessee, the adoption of this standard did not have a material impact on our Condensed Consolidated Statement of Income or Statement of Cash Flows.
As a lessor, the adoption of this standard did not have a material impact on the Company’s Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet, Condensed Consolidated Statement of Income or Condensed Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows.
Contingent liabilities with a fair value totaling $1.2 million were recognized at the acquisition date, the payments of which were dependent upon SmartRG achieving future revenue, EBIT or customer purchase order milestones during the first half of 2019.
The required milestones were not achieved and, therefore, we recognized a gain of $1.2 million upon the reversal of these liabilities during the second quarter of 2019.
We recorded goodwill of $3.5 million as a result of this acquisition, which represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of net assets acquired.

As a percentage of sales, cost of sales increased from 58.4% for the three months ended September 30, 2018 to 59.4% for the three months ended September 30, 2019 and decreased from 61.9% for the nine months ended September 30, 2018 to 58.5% for the nine months ended September 30, 2019.
Network Solutions segment cost of sales, as a percentage of that segment’s sales, increased from 57.8% for the three months ended September 30, 2018 to 60.0% for the three months ended September 30, 2019 and decreased from 61.0% for the nine months ended September 30, 2018 to 57.8% for the nine months ended September 30, 2019.
The decrease in cost of sales as a percentage of sales for the nine months ended September 30, 2019 was primarily attributable to an increase in volume, a regional revenue shift, changes in customer and product mix and a decrease in labor expense due to a restructuring program initiated in the first quarter of 2018.
Selling, general and administrative expenses increased 0.5% from $30.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2018 to $30.9 million for the three months ended September 30, 2019, and increased 3.4% from $96.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2018 to $99.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2019.
As a percentage of sales, selling, general and administrative expenses increased from 21.9% for the three months ended September 30, 2018 to 27.1% for the three months ended September 30, 2019, and decreased from 24.8% for the nine months ended September 30, 2018 to 24.1% for the nine months ended September 30, 2019.
