The acquisition of copper cathode by copper ETFs may materially decrease or interrupt the availability of copper for immediate delivery in the United States, which could materially increase the Company’s cost of copper.
The following discussion and analysis relate to factors that have affected the operating results of the Company for the quarters and six months ended June 30, 2019 and 2018.
Reference should also be made to the audited financial statements and notes thereto included in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018.
Net sales were $336.9 million in the second quarter of 2019 compared to $336.8 million in the second quarter of 2018.
The virtually identical net sales dollars are primarily the result of a 5.6% increase in copper wire unit volume shipped, offset by a 6.1% decrease in the average selling price of copper wire.
The average cost per pound of raw copper purchased decreased 8.7% in the second quarter of 2019 compared to the second quarter of 2018 and was the principal driver of the decreased average sales price of copper wire.
Cost of goods sold was $291.0 million, or 86.4% of net sales, in the second quarter of 2019, compared to $292.3 million, or 86.8% of net sales, in the second quarter of 2018.
Gross profit increased to $45.9 million, or 13.6% of net sales, in the second quarter of 2019 from $44.5 million, or 13.2% of net sales, in the second quarter of 2018.
Unit volumes increased 5.6%, while the spread between the average price paid for a pound of raw copper and the average sales price for a pound of copper contained in finished wire decreased 0.4% in the second quarter of 2019 versus the second quarter of 2018.
The spread decreased as a result of the average sales price per pound of copper sold decreasing 6.1% while the per pound cost of raw copper purchased decreased 8.7%.
The percentage change on sales is on a higher nominal dollar amount than on purchases and, therefore, spreads change on a nominal dollar basis.
Total raw materials cost, including the LIFO adjustment, decreased to 74.6% of net sales in the second quarter of 2019, from 76.4% of net sales in the second quarter of 2018.
As permitted by U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, the Company maintains its inventory costs and cost of goods sold on a first-in, first-out (FIFO) basis and makes a monthly adjustment to adjust total inventory and cost of goods sold from FIFO to LIFO.
Net sales for the first six months of 2019 were $651.6 million compared to net sales of $628.2 million for the first six months of 2018.
This 3.7% increase in net sales is primarily the result of a 2.8% increase in copper wire sales, driven by a 9.3% increase in copper wire unit volume shipped, partially offset by a 5.9% decrease in the average selling price of copper wire.
Cost of goods sold increased to $564.3 million in the first six months of 2019, compared to $546.2 million in the first six months of 2018.
Gross profit increased to $87.2 million, or 13.4% of net sales, in the first six months of 2019 versus $82.0 million, or 13.1% of net sales, in the first six months of 2018.
