The accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared by CTS Corporation (“CTS” "we", "our", "us" or the "Company”), without audit, pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission.
Certain information and footnote disclosures normally included in financial statements prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles have been omitted pursuant to such rules and regulations.
Beginning in January 2018, CTS adopted the provisions of Accounting Standards Update ("ASU") 2014-09, "Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606)" under the modified retrospective method, which requires a cumulative effect adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings on the date of adoption.
At date of adoption, there was no significant change to our past revenue recognition practices and therefore no adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings was required.
Our contracts normally contain a single performance obligation that is fulfilled on the date of delivery based on shipping terms stipulated in the contract.
During the three and six months ended June 30, 2018, we recognized a decrease of revenues of $46 and an increase in revenues of $86, respectively, that were included in contract liabilities at the beginning of the period.
The increase in contract liabilities as of June 30, 2018 is primarily due to net increases in estimated future discounts and price concessions, offset by net settlements of products sold with rights of return.
The amendment added an additional $1,100 in planned costs related to the relocation of our corporate headquarters in Lisle, IL and our plant in Bolingbrook, IL, both of which will be consolidated into a single facility.
The total restructuring liability related to severance and other one-time benefit arrangements under the June 2016 Plan was $1,223 at June 30, 2018, and $1,460 at December 31, 2017.
On May 23, 2016, we requested and received a $100,000 increase in the aggregate revolving credit commitments under the existing credit agreement, which increased the credit line from $200,000 to $300,000.
Amortization expense was approximately $46 for both the three months ended June 30, 2018 and June 30, 2017, respectively, and approximately $93 for both the six months ended June 30, 2018 and June 30, 2017, respectively.
We selectively use derivative financial instruments including foreign currency forward contracts and interest rate swaps to manage our exposure to these risks.
The use of derivative financial instruments exposes the Company to credit risk, which relates to the risk of nonperformance by a counterparty to the derivative contracts.
In January of 2016, we began using forward contracts to mitigate currency risk related to a portion of our forecasted foreign currency revenues and costs.
The currency forward contracts are designed as cash flow hedges and are recorded in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets at fair value.
We continue to monitor the Company’s overall currency exposure and may elect to add cash flow hedges in the future.
