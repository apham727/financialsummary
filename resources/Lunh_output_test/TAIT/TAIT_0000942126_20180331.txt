We have evaluated the impact of adopting this guidance and we are preparing for the changes to be made to our consolidated financial statements.
We expect the adoption of these accounting changes will not impact our assets and liabilities nor our net income or equity, as we currently do not lease any assets.
In March 2016, the FASB issued new accounting standard which simplified certain aspects of the accounting for stock-based payment transactions, including income taxes, classification of awards and classification in the statement of cash flows.
In May 2017, the FASB issued a new accounting standard which provides guidance about which changes to the terms or conditions of a share-based payment award require an entity to apply modification accounting in ASC Topic 718.
Under the new guidance, modification accounting is required only if the fair value, the vesting conditions, or the classification of the award (as equity or liability) changes as a result of the change in terms or conditions.
The primary impact of adoption relates to additional disclosures and presentation of revenue by primary geographical market, major product line and the timing of revenue recognition.
Our $110,000 investment in joint venture as of March 31, 2018, relates to our 49% ownership of Grand Shine Management Limited (Dong Guan, China), an electronic device contract manufacturer, and joint venture with its 51% owner, Teamforce Company Limited.
Best International Co. Ltd., a company controlled by the brother of our Chief Executive Officer of approximately $6,000 for both of the quarters ended March 31, 2018 and 2017.
In addition, we also made payments of approximately $6,000 and $14,000 for the quarters ended March 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively, for interest expense on our credit facility from K.S.

We had inventory balances in the amount of $4,409,000 and $4,990,000 at March 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017, respectively, which is presented net of valuation allowances of $7,910,000 and $7,848,000, respectively.
Based on our assumptions about future demand and market conditions, inventories are carried at the lower of cost or net realizable value.
However, if all or a substantial portion of the inventory was required to be immediately liquidated, the inventory would not be as readily marketable or liquid as other items included or classified as a current asset, such as cash.
Net sales in the first quarter of 2018 totaled $1,655,000 versus $2,167,000 in the comparable period for 2017, a decrease of $512,000 or 23.6% over the same period last year.
Gross profit for the first quarter of 2018 was $654,000 versus $873,000 in the comparable period for 2018, and gross margin percentage of net sales was 39.2% in the first quarter of 2018 versus 40.3% in the comparable period for 2017.
Net income was $59,000 for the first quarter of 2018 versus $299,000 in the comparable period for 2017, a decrease of $240,000 resulting from the decrease in net sales.
The increase of $859,000 in cash flows provided by operations compared with the prior period resulted from changes in operating assets and liabilities, primarily from inventory, accounts payables and accounts receivables compared to the prior period.
Hence, inventory would not be as readily marketable or liquid as other items included in current assets, such as cash.
We believe that funds generated from, or used in operations, in addition to existing cash balances are likely to be sufficient to finance our working capital and capital expenditure requirements for the foreseeable future.
