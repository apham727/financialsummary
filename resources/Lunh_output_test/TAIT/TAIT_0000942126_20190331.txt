We have evaluated the impact of adopting this guidance and the adoption of these accounting changes have not impacted our assets and liabilities nor our net income or equity, as we currently do not lease any assets.
In January 2017, the FASB issued a new accounting standard which clarifies the definition of a business with the objective of adding guidance to assist entities with evaluating whether transactions should be accounted for as acquisitions or disposals of assets or businesses.
The adoption of this guidance has not had a material effect on our consolidated financial statements.
In May 2017, the FASB issued a new accounting standard which provides guidance about which changes to the terms or conditions of a share-based payment award require an entity to apply modification accounting in ASC Topic 718.
Under the new guidance, modification accounting is required only if the fair value, the vesting conditions, or the classification of the award (as equity or liability) changes as a result of the change in terms or conditions.
The adoption of this guidance has not had a material effect on our consolidated financial statements.
In addition, we also made interest expense payments on our credit facility of approximately $0 and $6,000 for the three months ended March 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively.

The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the condensed consolidated financial statements, including the related notes, appearing in Item 1 of Part 1 of this quarterly report on Form 10-Q, as well as our most recent annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018.
In accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, we have classified inventory as a current asset in our March 31, 2019, condensed consolidated financial statements representing approximately 47% of current assets and 34% of total assets.
However, if all or a substantial portion of the inventory was required to be immediately liquidated, the inventory would not be as readily marketable or liquid as other items included or classified as a current asset, such as cash.
Net sales in the first quarter of 2019 totaled $1,384,000 versus $1,655,000 in the comparable period for 2018, a decrease of $271,000 or 16.4% over the same period last year.
Gross profit for the first quarter of 2019 was $683,000 versus $654,000 in the comparable period for 2018, and gross margin percentage of net sales was 49.4% in the first quarter of 2019 versus 39.5% in the comparable period for 2018.
The approximately 10% gross profit increase was driven by an increase of ODM project sales unit pricing contributing approximately 5% and shipments of new higher gross margin ODM products which contributed approximately 4% of the increase.
The increase to our cash dividends was based upon our November 2, 2018 announcement that our quarterly cash dividends increased by 20% from $0.025 per share to $0.03 per share.
We believe that funds generated from operations, existing cash balances and, if necessary, related party short-term loans, are likely to be sufficient to finance our working capital and capital expenditure requirements for the foreseeable future.
