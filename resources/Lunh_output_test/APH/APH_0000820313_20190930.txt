For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2019 and 2018, less than 5% of our net sales were recognized over time, where the associated contracts relate to the sale of goods with no alternative use as they are only sold to a single customer and whose underlying contract terms provide the Company with an enforceable right to payment, including a reasonable profit margin, for performance completed to date, in the event of customer termination.
While the Company typically offers standard product warranty coverage which provides assurance that our products will conform to the contractually agreed-upon specifications for a limited period from the date of shipment, the Company’s warranty liabilities as of September 30, 2019 and December 31, 2018, and related warranty expense for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2019 and 2018 have not been and were not material in the accompanying Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements.
On April 24, 2018, the Company’s Board of Directors authorized a stock repurchase program under which the Company may purchase up to $2,000.0 of the Company’s Common Stock during the three-year period ending April 24, 2021 (the “2018 Stock Repurchase Program”) in accordance with the requirements of Rule 10b-18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”).
The price and timing of any future purchases under the 2018 Stock Repurchase Program will depend on factors such as levels of cash generation from operations, the volume of stock option exercises by employees, cash requirements for acquisitions, dividends, economic and market conditions and stock price.
These repurchases in the first quarter of 2018, coupled with the Company’s repurchase of 3.5 million shares of its Common Stock for $298.2 under the 2018 Stock Repurchase Program during the six months ended September 30, 2018, resulted in total repurchases of 7.7 million shares for $680.2 during the nine months ended September 30, 2018.
The Company believes that its operations are currently in substantial compliance with applicable environmental laws and regulations and that the costs of continuing compliance will not have a material adverse effect on the Company’s financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.

The decline in sales for the third quarter of 2019 relative to the same period of 2018 was driven by moderations in mobile devices, information technology and data communications, broadband communications, and mobile networks markets, offset in part by growth in the military, commercial aerospace, industrial and automotive markets, including contributions from the Company’s acquisition program.
The sales growth in the first nine months of 2019 relative to the same period of 2018 was driven by growth in the military, commercial aerospace, mobile networks, industrial and automotive markets, including contributions from the Company’s acquisition program, offset in part by moderations in the mobile devices, broadband communications, and information technology and data communications markets.
