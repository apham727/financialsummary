Net sales in the first quarter of 2018 in the Cable Products and Solutions segment (approximately 5% of net sales), which primarily serves the broadband market, were flat in U.S. dollars while decreasing 1% in constant currencies and 1% organically, compared to the first quarter of 2017.
(4)    Acquisition impact, a non-GAAP measure, represents the impact on net sales resulting from acquisitions closed since the beginning of the prior calendar year, which were not included in the Company’s results as of the comparable prior year periods and which do not reflect the underlying growth of the Company on a comparative basis.
Geographically, sales in the United States in the first quarter of 2018 increased approximately 15% in U.S. dollars ($527.0 in 2018 versus $457.9 in 2017) and 9% organically, compared to the first quarter of 2017. International sales in the first quarter of 2018 increased approximately 22% in U.S. dollars ($1,339.9 in 2018 versus $1,102.2 in 2017), 16% in constant currencies and 13% organically, compared to the first quarter of 2017.
The increase is primarily due to higher average interest rates associated with the Company’s commercial paper borrowings as well as the senior note issuances in April 2017, along with higher average debt levels used to fund the Company’s dividend and stock buyback programs.

(1)    While the terms “operating margin” and “effective tax rate” are not considered U.S. GAAP financial measures, for purposes of this table, we derive the reported (GAAP) measures based on GAAP results, which serve as the basis for the reconciliation to their comparable non-GAAP financial measure.
In the first three months of 2018, the components of working capital as presented on the accompanying Condensed Consolidated Statements of Cash Flow increased $133.3, excluding the impact of acquisitions and foreign currency translation, primarily due to a decrease in accounts payable and accrued liabilities of $99.3 and $65.5, respectively, and an increase in inventories of $55.8, partially offset by a decrease in accounts receivable of $118.3.
