The unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared by Cabot Microelectronics pursuant to the rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (U.S. GAAP).
In the opinion of management, these unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements include all adjustments, consisting of normal recurring adjustments, necessary for the fair statement of Cabot Microelectronics’ financial position as of March 31, 2019, cash flows for the six months ended March 31, 2019 and March 31, 2018, and results of operations for the three and six months ended March 31, 2019 and March 31, 2018.
This Report on Form 10-Q does not contain all of the footnote disclosures from the annual financial statements and should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements and related notes thereto included in Cabot Microelectronics’ Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2018.
The accounting estimates that require management's most difficult and subjective judgments include, but are not limited to, those estimates related to bad debt expense, inventory valuation, impairment of long-lived assets and investments, business combinations, goodwill, other intangible assets, share-based compensation, income taxes and contingencies.
Except for the discussion on revenue recognition below, no material changes have been made to the Company’s significant accounting policies disclosed in Note 2 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2018.
Upon adoption of ASC 606 we recognized a $933 decrease to the opening balance of retained earnings, net of tax, due to the cumulative impact of adopting the new revenue standards.
For free products, the new revenue standards require that a portion of the transaction price be allocated to the free product and deferred until the product has been delivered.
We have determined that the effect of applying the new revenue standards during the three and six months ended March 31, 2019 was immaterial to our financial statements compared to revenue guidance in effect before the adoption of the new revenue standards.
As a result, for the three and six months ended March 31, 2019, we are not disclosing the quantitative amount by which each financial statement line item is affected by the application of the new revenue standards.
For the Company’s contracts that have an original duration of one year or less as of the adoption date, the Company uses the practical expedient applicable to such contracts and does not consider the time value of money.
Further, because of the short duration of these contracts, the Company has not disclosed the transaction price for the future performance obligations as of the end of each reporting period for contracts having an expected duration of one year or less.
See Note 3 of this Report on Form 10-Q for disaggregated revenue, the reconciliation of contract balances and transaction price allocation to remaining performance obligations for contracts expected to remain effective beyond one year.
At contract inception, the Company assesses the goods and services promised in its contracts with customers and identifies a performance obligation for each material promise to the customer.
A performance obligation is a promise in a contract to transfer a distinct good or service, or a bundle of goods or services, to the customer, and is the unit of accounting under ASC 606.
A contract’s transaction price is allocated to each distinct performance obligation and recognized as revenue when, or as, the performance obligation is satisfied.
A majority of the Company’s contracts have a single performance obligation which represents, in most cases, the products, equipment or services being sold to the customer.

Revenue for our second quarter of fiscal 2019 was $265.4 million, which benefited from the acquisition of KMG and represented an increase of 85.6% from the same quarter of fiscal 2018.
Results benefited from the acquisition of KMG, but were more than offset by acquisition-related expenses, a charge for the fair value write-up of acquired inventory sold, increased amortization and depreciation associated with re-valuing KMG assets to fair value, and higher interest expenses resulting from the debt borrowing to finance the Acquisition.
Adjusted EBITDA margin, which represents adjusted EBITDA as a percentage of revenue, was 32.2% for the second quarter of fiscal 2019, compared to 30.5% for the same quarter of fiscal 2018.
Except for the discussion on revenue recognition in Note 2 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements of this Report on Form 10-Q, no material changes have been made to the Company’s significant accounting policies during the first six months of fiscal 2019.
See Note 2 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements of this Report on Form 10-Q for a discussion of new accounting pronouncements.
Revenue was $265.4 million for the three months ended March 31, 2019, which represented an 85.6%, or $122.4 million, increase from the three months ended March 31, 2018, primarily due to the Acquisition.
Total cost of sales was $150.6 million for the three months ended March 31, 2019, which represented an increase of 121.6%, or $82.6 million, from the three months ended March 31, 2018, primarily due to the Acquisition.

For instance, we could experience negative impacts on cash flows due to the inability of our customers to pay their obligations to us, or our production process could be harmed if our suppliers cannot fulfill their obligations to us.
Although our product offerings have expanded with the acquisition of KMG, our business remains substantially dependent on products in our Electronic Materials segment, such as CMP slurries, pads and electronic chemicals, which account for the majority of our revenue.
We have identified our Performance Materials segment as another area of potential continued growth and the product offerings in our Performance Materials segment are similarly concentrated.
Our success depends on our ability to keep pace with technological changes and advances in the industries in which we operate, particularly the semiconductor industry, and to adapt, improve and customize our products in response to evolving customer needs and industry trends.
Since its inception, the semiconductor industry, which is the largest industry in which we operate, has experienced technological changes and advances in the design, manufacture, performance and application of IC devices.
