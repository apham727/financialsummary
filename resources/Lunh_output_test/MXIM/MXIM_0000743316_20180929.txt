Under the new standard, revenue is recognized when a customer obtains control of promised goods or services in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services.
On July 1, 2018, the Company adopted Topic 606 and related amendments (ASU 2015-14, Deferral of the Effective Date; ASU 2016-08, Principal versus Agent Considerations; ASU 2016-10, Identifying Performance Obligations and Licensing, ASU 2016-12, Narrow-Scope Improvements and Practical Expedients and ASU 2016-20, Technical Corrections and Improvements to Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers) using the modified retrospective method applied to all contracts that are not completed at the date of initial application (i.e., July 1, 2018).
Results for reporting periods beginning after July 1, 2018 are presented under Topic 606, while prior period amounts are not adjusted and continue to be reported in accordance with historic accounting standards under Topic 605.
Under Topic 605, the gross amount of accrued revenue reserves for price adjustments and other revenue reserves of $141.7 million was included within accounts receivable, net as of June 30, 2018.
The adoption of Topic 606 has no impact on the total cash flows from operating, investing, or financing activities on the Condensed Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows.
•The Company does not disclose the value of unsatisfied performance obligations for (i) contracts with an original expected length of one year or less and (ii) contracts for which the Company recognizes revenue at the amount to which we have the right to invoice for services performed.
In determining the transaction price, the Company evaluates whether the price is subject to refund or adjustment to determine the net consideration that is expected to be entitled.
The Company elected the practical expedient to not disclose the value of unsatisfied performance obligations for (i) contracts with an original expected length of one year or less and (ii) contracts for which we recognize revenue at the amount to which we have the right to invoice for services performed.
Accounts receivable related to consigned inventory is recognized when the customer takes title to such inventory from its consigned location, at which point inventory is relieved, title transfers, and the Company has a legally enforceable right to collection under the terms of the agreement with the related customers.
Customers are generally required to pay for products and services within the Company’s standard terms, which is net 30 days from the date of invoice.
ASU 2016-02 requires a dual approach for lessee accounting under which a lessee would account for leases as finance leases or operating leases.
For finance leases, the lessee would recognize interest expense and amortization of the right-of-use asset, and for operating leases, the lessee would recognize a straight-line total lease expense.
Level 2 - Observable inputs other than quoted prices included in Level 1, such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active, or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the asset or liability.
The Company’s Level 2 assets and liabilities consist of U.S. Treasury securities, agency securities, corporate debt securities, certificates of deposit, commercial paper and foreign currency forward contracts that are valued using quoted market prices or are determined using a yield curve model based on current market rates.
Level 3 - Unobservable inputs to the valuation methodology that are significant to the measurement of the fair value of the assets or liabilities.
During the three months ended September 29, 2018 and the year ended June 30, 2018, there were no transfers in or out of Level 3 from other levels in the fair value hierarchy.
There were no assets or liabilities measured at fair value on a non-recurring basis as of September 29, 2018 and June 30, 2018 other than impairments of long-lived assets.
