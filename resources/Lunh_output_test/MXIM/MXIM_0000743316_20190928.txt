Topic 842 states that lessees will recognize a lease liability for the commitment to make lease payments and a right-of-use asset for the underlying asset, for the duration of the lease.
This transition method allows a Company to apply the new lease accounting standard on adoption date and recognize a cumulative-effect adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings.
The Company also elected an accounting policy in which it will not apply the recognition requirements to leases with an initial term of 12 months or less.
Effective June 30, 2019, the first day of adoption, the Company recognized $61.0 million of operating lease right-of-use assets and $65.2 million of operating lease liabilities on its Consolidated Balance Sheet.
When discount rates implicit in leases cannot be readily determined, the Company uses its incremental borrowing rate based on information available at commencement date in determining the present value of future payments.
Level 2 - Observable inputs other than quoted prices included in Level 1, such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active, or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the asset or liability.
