The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated interim financial statements as of March 31, 2018 and for the three months ended March 31, 2018 and 2017 include the accounts of the Company and its wholly-owned subsidiaries and have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (GAAP) for interim financial reporting and pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q and Article 10 of Regulation S-X.
In managements opinion, these unaudited condensed consolidated interim financial statements contain all adjustments of a normal recurring nature necessary for a fair presentation of the financial statements for the interim periods presented.
These unaudited condensed consolidated interim financial statements should be read in conjunction with the Companys audited consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2017, as reported in the Companys Annual Report on Form 10-K.
The Companys significant accounting policies and practices are as described in the Annual Report, except for the adoption of the accounting standards described in Note 3 below.
We classify cloud-based subscriptions and other services, such as font related services, custom font design and post contract support as service revenue on our condensed consolidated statements of operations.
In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board, or FASB, and the International Accounting Standards Board jointly issued ASU 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606) (ASC 606), which outlines a comprehensive five-step revenue recognition model based on principle that replaces virtually all existing revenue recognition rules under U.S. GAAP and which requires revenue to be recognized in a manner to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to a customer at an amount that reflects the consideration expected to be received in exchange for those goods or services.
The standard requires retrospective application; however, it allows entities to choose either full retrospective adoption, in which the standard is applied to all of the periods presented, or modified retrospective adoption, in which the cumulative catch-up adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings is recognized at the date of application, with additional disclosures required to describe these effects.
We adopted the standard on January 1, 2018, and applied the modified retrospective method of adoption and have elected to apply the new standard only to contracts not completed at January 1, 2018, which represents contracts for which all (or substantially all) of the revenues have not been recognized under existing guidance as of the date of adoption.
In addition, we recognized additional royalty expenses totaling approximately $2.2 million, or $0.05 per share, upon the adoption of ASC 606, as an indirect effect of a change in accounting principle.
These amounts are included in cost of revenue  license in the accompanying condensed consolidated statement of operations for the three months ended March 31, 2018.
   Under legacy GAAP, revenue related to our term licenses that were bundled with service-related performance obligations when vendor-specific objective evidence (VSOE) did not exist was required to be recognized ratably over the term of the agreement.
   We have a limited number of contracts in which we offered extended payment terms for term licenses to our customers, including cases in which the license is delivered in full at the beginning of the contract.

For the three months ended March 31, 2018 and 2017, our top ten licensees by revenue, most of which are OEM customers, accounted for approximately 23.0% and 31.3% of our total revenue, respectively.
No one customer accounted for more than 10% of our total revenue for the three months ended March 31, 2018 or 2017.
There is no reliable evidence to suggest that we should expect any other pattern of amortization than an even pattern, and we believe this best reflects the expected pattern of economic usage.
Our gross profit is subject to variability from period-to-period, depending on the product mix and the level of custom font design and SaaS based service revenue.
License revenue increased primarily due to the growth in sales of revenue from our enterprise customers, including the launch of our Mosaic product offering, partially offset by decreases due to certain one-time printer revenue recognized in the first quarter of 2017 as a result of conversion of customers to fixed fee contracts from royalty bearing contracts.
This change had the effect of shifting traditional holiday seasonality revenue for consumer electronics from the first quarter to the fourth quarter.
Service revenue has increased as a percentage of total revenue due primarily to the growth of our SaaS-based product offerings.
These decreases are primarily due to additional non-recurring royalty expense for which there was no corresponding revenue in the period in accordance with ASC 606.
While revenue from services has grown to a level of significance requiring separate disclosure, we continue to operate our business based on our two principal markets, Creative Professional and OEM, which is the basis for the following discussion of operating results.
Revenue was $56.7 million and $52.5 million for the three months ended March 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively, an increase of $4.2 million, or 8.0%.
Creative Professional revenue increased $7.9 million, or 29.3%, to $35.0 million for the three months ended March 31, 2018, as compared to $27.1 million for the three months ended March 31, 2017, mainly due to growth in sales of revenue from our enterprise customers, including the launch of our Mosaic solution and higher service revenue as SaaS offerings continue to become a larger part of our offering portfolio.
OEM revenue decreased $3.7 million, or 14.6%, to $21.7 million in the first quarter of 2018, as compared to $25.4 million in the first quarter of 2017.
