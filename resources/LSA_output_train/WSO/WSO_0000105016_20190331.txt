In February 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued guidance on accounting for leases, which requires lessees to recognize most leases on their balance sheets for the rights and obligations created by those leases.
The adoption of this standard and its related amendments (collectively, the New Lease Standard) on January 1, 2019, did not result in the recognition of a cumulative adjustment to opening retained earnings under the additional transition method, nor did it have a significant impact on our consolidated statements of income or cash flows.
The New Lease Standard had a material impact on our consolidated balance sheet due to the recognition of right-of-use (ROU) assets and lease liabilities for operating leases, while accounting for finance leases remained substantially unchanged.
Results for reporting periods beginning on and after January 1, 2019 are presented under the New Lease Standard, while prior period results have not been adjusted and continue to be reported under the accounting standards in effect for those periods.

We also elected the practical expedients related to short-term leases and separating lease components from non-lease components for all underlying asset classes.
