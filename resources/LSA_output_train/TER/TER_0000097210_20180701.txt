All significant intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated.
Teradyne adopted Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (ASC 606) on January 1, 2018 using the modified retrospective method for all contracts not completed as of the date of adoption.
In accordance with ASC 606, Teradyne recognizes revenues, when or as control is transferred to a customer.
Transaction price is allocated to each individual performance obligation based on the standalone selling price of that performance obligation.
Teradyne uses standalone transactions when available to value each performance obligation.
In order to determine the appropriate timing for revenue recognition, Teradyne first determines if the transaction meets any of three criteria for over time recognition.
Teradyne uses input variables such as hours or months utilized or costs incurred to determine the amount of revenue to recognize in a given period.
Input variables are used as they best align consumption with benefit to the customer.
For transactions that do not meet the criteria for over time recognition, Teradyne will recognize revenue at a point in time based on an assessment of the five criteria for transfer of control.
Teradyne has concluded that revenue should be recognized when shipped or delivered based on contractual terms.
Typically acceptance of Teradynes products and services is a formality as Teradyne delivers similar systems, instruments and robots to standard specifications.
For the three and six months ended July 1, 2018, Teradyne also recognized $3.6 million and $7.9 million, respectively, in revenue on leases of Teradyne systems, which are accounted for outside of ASC 606.See also Part II, Item 1A of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and Part I, Item 1A Risk Factors in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2017.
