The Company has a controlling interest in Mission Support Alliance, LLC ("MSA"), a joint venture with Centerra Group, LLC.
As a result, Leidos increased its controlling ownership in MSA from 47% to 88%.
The unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements also include the balances of all voting interest entities in which Leidos has a controlling voting interest (“subsidiaries”) and a variable interest entity ("VIE") in which Leidos is the primary beneficiary.
Intercompany accounts and transactions between consolidated companies have been eliminated in consolidation.
Certain disclosures normally included in financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP have been condensed or omitted pursuant to such rules.
Certain amounts in the prior year financial statements have been reclassified to conform to the current year presentation.
In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued ASU 2014-09 ("ASC 606") and related amendments, which superseded all prior revenue recognition methods and industry-specific guidance.
The core principle of ASC 606 is an entity should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of control for promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services.
Under ASC 606, revenues on certain units-of-delivery contracts are now recognized using an over-time model.
In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02, which supersedes the current lease guidance under Leases (Topic 840) and makes several changes, such as requiring an entity to recognize a right-of-use asset and corresponding lease obligation on the balance sheet, classified as financing or operating, as appropriate.
The update is effective for public companies for annual and interim reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2018, and should be adopted under the modified retrospective approach.
The Company plans to adopt the new lease accounting standard in fiscal 2019 and is currently in the process of reviewing lease contracts, implementing a new lease accounting and administration software solution, establishing new processes and internal controls and evaluating the impact of certain accounting policy elections.
If multiple promises in a contract are highly interrelated or comprise a series of distinct services performed over time, they are combined and accounted for as a single performance obligation.
The Company accounts for renewal options as separate contracts when they include distinct goods or services at standalone selling prices.
The FAR provides guidance on types of costs that are allowable in establishing prices for goods and services provided to the U.S. government and its agencies.
Each contract is competitively priced and bid separately.
Pricing for non-U.S. government agencies and commercial customers is based on specific negotiations with each customer.
Certain of the Company's cost-plus and fixed-price contracts contain award fees, incentive fees or other provisions that may either increase or decrease the transaction price.
Anticipated losses on service based contracts are recognized as incurred.

Unless indicated otherwise, references in this report to the "Company," "we," "us" and "our" refer collectively to Leidos and its consolidated subsidiaries.
U.S. Government Markets During the three and six months ended June 29, 2018, we generated approximately 85% of our total revenues from contracts with the U.S. government.
All 12 Appropriations bills were funded and no federal department or agency is now operating under a continuing resolution.
The appropriations legislation passed earlier in the year suspended budget caps and included a two-year budget agreement that provides $300 billion in sequestration relief for defense and non-defense spending.
Sales to customers in international markets represented approximately 9% of total revenues for both the three and six months ended June 29, 2018.
The primary financial performance measures we use to manage our business and monitor results of operations are revenue, operating income, cash flows from operations and diluted earnings per share.
The decrease in revenues for the six months ended June 29, 2018, as compared to the six months ended June 30, 2017, was primarily attributable to the completion of certain contracts, timing of revenue recognition on certain contracts and net volume decreases, partially offset by new awards and improved program performance.
