Note 3. Business Acquisitions On May 29, 2018, the Company completed its acquisition of Microsemi Corporation, a publicly traded company headquartered in Aliso Viejo, California.
The Company financed the purchase price using approximately $8.10 billion of borrowings consisting of $3.10 billion under its amended and restated revolving line of credit (the "Revolving Credit Facility"), $3.00 billion of term loans ("Term Loan Facility") provided under the Company's amended and restated credit agreement (the "Credit Agreement"), and $2.00 billion in newly issued senior secured notes.
The Company's primary reason for this acquisition was to expand the Company's range of solutions, products and capabilities by extending its served available market.

Amortization expense associated with acquired intangible assets is not deductible for tax purposes.
The Company's reportable segments are semiconductor products and technology licensing.

We have acquired, and expect in the future to acquire, additional businesses that we believe will complement or augment our existing businesses.
There may be increased risk due to integrating financial reporting and internal control systems.
We may suffer loss of key employees, customers and strategic partners of acquired companies and it may be difficult to implement our corporate culture at acquired companies.
See Note 16 to our condensed consolidated financial statements for information regarding such matters.
Even following a divestiture or other exit strategy, we may be contractually obligated with respect to certain continuing obligations to former employees, customers, vendors, landlords or other third parties.
We may also have continuing obligations for pre-existing liabilities related to the former employees, assets or businesses.
In connection with our acquisition of Microsemi, we incurred debt consisting of $3.10 billion under our revolving line of credit, $3.00 billion under our term loan facility, and $2.00 billion in senior secured notes.
As a result of such transactions, we have a substantially greater amount of debt than we had maintained in the past.
