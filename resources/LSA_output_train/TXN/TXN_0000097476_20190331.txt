Our customers need multiple chips for their systems.
Together, the attributes above result in diverse and long-lived positions that deliver high terminal value to our shareholders.

This business model is the foundation of our capital management strategy, which is based on our belief that free cash flow growth, especially on a per-share basis, is important for maximizing shareholder value over the long term.
