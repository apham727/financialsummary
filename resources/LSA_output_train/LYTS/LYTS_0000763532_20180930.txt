Control is generally transferred at time of shipment when title and risk of ownership passes to the customer.
For customer contracts with multiple performance obligations, the Company allocates the transaction price and any discounts to each performance obligation based on relative standalone selling prices.
Payment terms are typically within 30 to 90 days from the shipping date, depending on our terms with the customer.
Installation is a separate performance obligation, except for our digital signage products.
For digital signage products, installation is not a separate performance obligation as the product and installation is the combined item promised in digital signage contracts.
The Company is not always responsible for installation of products it sells and has no post-installation responsibilities other than standard warranties.
Installation revenue is recognized over time as our customer simultaneously receives and consumes the benefits provided through the installation process.
Legacy products include lighting fixtures utilizing light sources other than LED technology and printed two and three dimensional graphic products.Fiscal 2019 first quarter net sales of $84,957,000 decreased $2.5 million or 2.9% as compared to first quarter fiscal 2018.

We believe that these adjusted supplemental measures are useful in assessing the operating performance of our business.
