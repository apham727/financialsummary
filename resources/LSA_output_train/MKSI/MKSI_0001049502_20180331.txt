All intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.
The condensed consolidated balance sheet presented as of December 31, 2017 has been derived from the consolidated audited financial statements as of that date.
In March 2018, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2018-05, Income Taxes (Topic 740). This standard is an amendment that adopts the language of Securities and Exchange Commission Staff Accounting Bulletin No.
In May 2017, the FASB issued ASU 2017-09, Compensation-Stock Compensation (Topic 718)-Scope of Modification Accounting. This standard provides guidance about which changes to the terms or conditions of a share-based payment award require an entity to apply modification accounting in Topic 718.
In March 2017, the FASB issued ASU 2017-07, Compensation-Retirement Benefits (Topic 715)-Improving the Presentation of Net Periodic Pension Cost and Net Periodic Postretirement Benefit Cost. This standard requires that an employer disaggregate the service cost component from the other components of net benefit cost.
In January 2017, the FASB issued ASU 2017-01, Business Combinations (Topic 805)-Clarifying the Definition of a Business. This standard clarifies the definition of a business with the objective of adding guidance to assist entities with evaluating whether transactions should be accounted for as acquisitions (or disposals) of assets or businesses.
In October 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-16, Income Taxes (Topic 740)-Intra-Entity Transfer of Assets Other Than Inventory. This standard requires that an entity recognize the income tax consequences of an intra-entity transfer of an asset other than inventory when the transfer occurs as opposed to when the assets have been sold to an outside party.
In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842). This standard requires the recognition of lease assets and liabilities for all leases, with certain exceptions, on the balance sheet.
In transition, lessees and lessors are required to recognize and measure leases at the beginning of the earliest period presented using a modified retrospective approach.
The management team has communicated its approach to the Audit Committee and will provide regular updates as appropriate.
The Company is currently working at accumulating a complete population of leases from all of its locations.
The Company has selected a software repository to track all of its lease agreements and to assist in the reporting and disclosure requirements required by the standard.
The Company will continue to assess and disclose the impact that this ASU will have on its consolidated financial statements, disclosures and related controls, when known.
In January 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-01, Financial Instruments-Overall (Subtopic 825-10)-Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities. This ASU provides guidance for the recognition, measurement, presentation, and disclosure of financial instruments.
In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606) (ASC 606).
This ASU provides for a single comprehensive model to use in accounting for revenue arising from contracts with customers and has replaced most existing revenue recognition guidance in GAAP.
The adoption of this ASU did not have a material impact on the Companys consolidated financial statements as described further in Note 3.
The Company has recorded a net increase to opening retained earnings of $1,809 as of January 1, 2018 due to the cumulative impact of adopting ASC 606, with the impact primarily related to its service business and certain custom products.

Our primary served markets are manufacturers of capital equipment for semiconductor manufacturing, industrial technologies, life and health sciences, as well as research and defense.
Approximately 57% our net revenues for both the three months ended March 31, 2018 and 2017, were from sales to semiconductor capital equipment manufacturers and semiconductor device manufacturers.
Approximately 43% of our net revenues for both three months ended March 31, 2018 and 2017, were from other advanced manufacturing applications.
For both periods ended March 31, 2018 and 2017, international net revenues accounted for approximately 50% of our total net revenues.
