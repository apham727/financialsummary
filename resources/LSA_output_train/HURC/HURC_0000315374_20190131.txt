Prior to the adoption of ASC 606, our revenues have already been recognized in the same manner as those required by ASC 606.
We record revenues based on a five-step model in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board, or FASB, guidance codified in ASC 606 “Revenue from Contracts with Customers.” In accordance with ASC 606, we have defined contracts as agreements with our customers and distributors in the form of purchase orders, packing or shipping documents, invoices, and, periodically, verbal requests for components and accessories.
We deem the customer obtains control upon delivery of the product and that obtaining control is not contingent upon contractual customer acceptance.
Depending upon geographic location, after shipment, a machine may be installed at the customer’s facilities by a distributor, independent contractor or by one of our service technicians.
We consider the machine installation process for our three-axis machines to be inconsequential and perfunctory.
Service fees from maintenance contracts are deferred and recognized in earnings on a prorata basis over the term of the contract, and are generally sold on a stand-alone basis.
Currently, the only risk that we manage through the use of derivative instruments is foreign currency risk for which we enter into derivative instruments in the form of foreign currency forward exchange contracts with a few major financial institutions.
