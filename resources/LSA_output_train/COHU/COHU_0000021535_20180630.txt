On May 8, 2018, we announced that we entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the “Merger Agreement”), dated as of May 7, 2018, by and among Cohu, Xavier Acquisition Corporation, a Delaware corporation and a wholly-owned subsidiary of Cohu (“Merger Sub”) and Xcerra Corporation, a Massachusetts corporation (“Xcerra”).
However, litigation is inherently uncertain and there can be no assurance regarding the likelihood that Xcerra’s defense of the actions will be successful.
Additional complaints containing substantially similar allegations may be filed in the future.
Cohu could be required to pay a termination fee of $22.8 million to Xcerra under certain circumstances, and Cohu could be required to pay the Financing Termination Fee of $45.0 million if the failure to complete the Merger related to a failure by Cohu to obtain financing; The occurrence of any of these events, individually or in combination, could have a material adverse effect on Cohu’s results of operations or the trading price of Cohu Common Stock.
Whether or not we complete the Merger, we have incurred, and will continue to incur, significant transaction costs in connection with the Merger, including payment of certain fees and expenses incurred in connection with the Merger and related financing transactions.
Additional unanticipated costs may be incurred in the integration process.
Furthermore, we expect to incur material restructuring and integration charges in connection with the Merger, which may adversely affect our operating results following the closing of the Merger in which such expenses are recorded or our cash flow in the period in which any related costs are actually paid.The forward-looking statements in this report speak only as of the time they are made, and do not necessarily reflect management’s outlook at any other point in time.
We expect that the semiconductor equipment industry will continue to be seasonal in part because consumer electronics, automotive and mobility, the principal end markets for integrated circuits, are highly dynamic industries and demand has traditionally fluctuated with global consumer spending.
During the first six months of 2018, our net sales increased 11% from the corresponding period of 2017 driven by improved conditions in mobility, IoT (Internet of Things), automotive and industrial semiconductor markets and capturing new customers for semiconductor test handlers and test contactors, along with growth in sales of semiconductor inspection equipment.It should be noted that any system of controls, however well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, and not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the system are met.
In addition, the design of any control system is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events.

Xcerra is reviewing the complaint and has not yet formally responded to it, but believes that the plaintiffs’ allegations are without merit and intends to defend against them vigorously.
However, litigation is inherently uncertain and there can be no assurance regarding the likelihood that Xcerra’s defense of the actions will be successful.
