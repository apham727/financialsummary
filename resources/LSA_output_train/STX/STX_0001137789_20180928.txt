In addition to HDDs, the Company produces a broad range of data storage products including solid state drives (SSDs) and storage subsystems.

Disk drives continue to be the primary medium of mass data storage due to their performance attributes, high quality and cost effectiveness.
Complementing existing data center storage architecture, solid-state storage devices use integrated circuit assemblies as memory to store data, and most SSDs use NAND flash memory.
The Companys enterprise data solutions (formerly referred to as the cloud systems and solutions) portfolio includes modular original equipment manufacturers (OEM) storage systems and scale-out storage servers.
Such adjustments are of a normal and recurring nature.
