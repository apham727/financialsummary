These unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements should be read in conjunction with the audited Consolidated Financial Statements and accompanying Notes thereto included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended March 30, 2018.
There have been no material changes to our significant accounting policies as of and for the nine months ended December 28, 2018, except for those noted in Note 2 and Note 3, as compared to the significant accounting policies described in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended March 30, 2018.
The standard’s core principle is that a company recognizes revenue when it transfers promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration that the company expects to receive in exchange for those goods or services.
Our operating expenses increased $1 million during the three months ended December 28, 2018 and decreased $10 million during the nine months ended December 28, 2018.
We adopted this new guidance in the first quarter of fiscal 2019.
This cumulative-effect adjustment primarily consisted of additional deferred tax assets related to an intra-entity sale of intangible assets in periods prior to adoption, partially offset by the write-off of income tax consequences deferred from pre-adoption intra-entity transfers and other liabilities for amounts not recognized under legacy GAAP.
In February 2016, the FASB issued new guidance on lease accounting which will require lessees to recognize assets and liabilities on their balance sheet for the rights and obligations created by operating leases and will also require disclosures designed to give users of financial statements information on the amount, timing, and uncertainty of cash flows arising from leases.
The new guidance will be effective for us in our first quarter of fiscal 2020 and early adoption is permitted.
We expect to adopt the new guidance on a modified retrospective basis in our first quarter of fiscal 2020.
We are continuing to evaluate the impact of this new standard on our Consolidated Financial Statements and disclosures.We do not undertake any obligation to update these forward-looking statements to reflect events occurring or circumstances arising after the date of this report.
•Net revenues were relatively flat compared to the corresponding period in fiscal 2018, as increases in revenue from our identity and information protection solutions and from the impact of the adoption of the new revenue recognition standard were partially offset by a decrease as a result of the divestiture of our website security (“WSS”) and public key infrastructure (“PKI”) solutions in October 2017.A description of the risk factors associated with our business is set forth below.

In addition, we have received certain demands from purported stockholders to inspect corporate books and records under Delaware law.
