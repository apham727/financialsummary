Accordingly, they do not include all of the information and footnotes required by U.S. GAAP to be included in full year financial statements.
In the opinion of management, all adjustments considered necessary for a fair statement of the results for the periods presented have been included and are of a normal recurring nature.
These interim financial statements should be read in conjunction with the audited financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2017 included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K. Assets and liabilities of such subsidiary have been translated at the end of period exchange rates, and related revenues and expenses have been translated at the weighted average exchange rates with the resulting translation gain or loss recorded in “Accumulated other comprehensive loss, net of tax", in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets.
As of September 30, 2018, $197 thousand of the accrued product warranty liability is classified as current in "Accrued liabilities" in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets and the remaining $98 thousand is classified as non-current in "Other liabilities".
These outstanding stock awards are not included in the computation of diluted earnings per share because the effect would be anti-dilutive.
For the three months ended September 30, 2018 and 2017, there were 147 thousand and 382 thousand, respectively, of potentially dilutive shares consisting of stock awards that were excluded from the calculation of earnings per diluted share.
For the nine months ended September 30, 2018 and 2017, there were 149 thousand and 404 thousand, respectively, of potentially dilutive shares consisting of stock awards that were excluded from the calculation of earnings per diluted share.
For the three months ended September 30, 2017, dividends declared and paid totaled $661 thousand, or $0.09 per share.
For the nine months ended September 30, 2018, we recorded an income tax provision of $1.06 million at an effective tax rate of 19.2%, compared to an income tax provision during the nine months ended September 30, 2017 of $1.66 million at an effective tax rate of 31.4%.
We expect our annual effective tax rate for 2018 to be between 19% and 20%.

As used in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, unless the context otherwise requires, references to “we”, “us”, “our”, the “Company” and “TransAct” refer to the consolidated operations of TransAct Technologies Incorporated, and its consolidated subsidiaries.
TransAct also provides world-class service, spare parts, accessories and printing supplies to its growing worldwide installed base of products.
We have reviewed those policies and determined that they remain our critical accounting policies for the nine months ended September 30, 2018.
Printer and terminal sales volume increased 12% to approximately 42 thousand units for the third quarter of 2018, driven primarily by a 73% increase in unit volume from the casino and gaming market and, to a lesser extent, a 9% increase in unit volume from the POS automation and banking market.
These increases were partially offset by a 74% decline in unit volume from the lottery market and, to a lesser extent, a 41% decline in unit volume from the restaurant solutions market.
The average selling price of our printers and terminals increased 4% in the third quarter of 2018 compared to the third quarter of 2017 due primarily to lower lottery printer sales, which sell at a lower price than our other products.
The decrease in domestic restaurant solutions terminal sales in the third quarter of 2018 compared to the third quarter of 2017 was driven by lower sales of our AccuDate 9700 terminal due to lower sales to McDonald's.
The increase in domestic POS automation and banking product revenue from the third quarter of 2017 was driven by a 22% increase in sales of our Ithaca® 9000 printer, as sales to McDonald’s have returned to the near record levels experienced during 2017.
The increase in domestic sales of our casino and gaming products was due to an 79% increase in domestic sales of our thermal casino printer sales in the third quarter of 2018 compared to the third quarter of 2017, driven primarily by a large order of replacement printers from a domestic casino operator, as well as increased sales to our OEMs.
These increases were partially offset by lower sales of our EPICENTRAL™ software systems as no new installations were completed during the third quarter of 2018 compared to two installations completed during the third quarter of 2017.
These increases were due to the success of the transition away from using our previous exclusive worldwide distributor whose contract ended at the end of 2017 and included a large non-recurring order to an international OEM that we don’t expect to reoccur in the fourth quarter of 2018.
While we expect casino and gaming sales to increase in the fourth quarter of 2018 compared to the fourth quarter of 2017, we do not expect domestic and international sales of our thermal casino printers to continue at the level experienced during the third quarter of 2018 for the remainder of 2018, as the third quarter results included two large orders that we do not expect to reoccur in 2018.
We expect lottery printer sales to be lower for the full year 2018 compared to the full year 2017, as we have shifted our focus away from the lottery market to our higher-value, technology enabled restaurant solutions and casino and gaming products.
Internationally, TSG revenue increased due to a 370% increase in sales of replacement parts and accessories in the third quarter of 2018 compared to the third quarter of 2017, as sales of replacement parts and accessories to international casino and gaming customers have increased upon the transition away from using our previous exclusive worldwide distributor and using our new direct sales team to sell to end user casino and gaming customers.
In the third quarter of 2018, gross profit increased $485 thousand, or 7%, compared to the same period in 2017 and our gross margin improved by 210 basis points to 50.5% in the third quarter of 2018.
We expect our full year gross margin to be higher for 2018 compared to the full year 2017, as our sales mix shifts towards higher-value, technology driven solutions in the restaurant solutions and casino and gaming markets.
