Revenues for the first quarter of 2019 were $244.8 million, a 21% increase when compared to revenues of $201.7 million for the first quarter of 2018, with the increase mainly attributed to the additional revenues generated from the acquisitions of Forte on October 1, 2018 and Business Ink on February 28, 2018, and the continued growth in our cloud solutions and managed service arrangements.
Operating income for the first quarter of 2019 was $32.1 million, or a 13.1% operating margin percentage, compared to $25.8 million, or a 12.8% operating margin percentage for the first quarter of 2018.
The increase in operating income is primarily a result of the higher revenues generated in the first quarter of 2019, as reflected by our relatively consistent operating margin percentage.
Our cash flows from operating activities for the first quarter of 2019 were $12.8 million.
