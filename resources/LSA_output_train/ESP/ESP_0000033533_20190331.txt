There is competition in all classes of products manufactured by the Company, ranging from divisions of the largest electronic companies, to many small companies.
The Company's sales do not represent a significant share of the industry's market for any class of its products.
However, the concentration of our business in the rail industry, and in equipment for military applications and industrial applications, and our customer concentrations expose us to on-going associated risks.
As part of our strategy, we adjust our pricing in order to achieve a balance which enables us both to retain repeat programs while being more competitive in bidding on new programs.
Successful conversion of engineering program backlog into sales is largely dependent on the execution and completion of our engineering design efforts.
Management expects revenues in fiscal year 2019 to be higher than revenues during fiscal year 2018, but expects the gross profit margin to be lower in fiscal year 2019 as compared to the gross profit margin during fiscal year 2018.
New orders received in the first nine months of fiscal year 2019 were approximately $22.2 million as compared to $28.6 million of new orders received in the first nine months of fiscal 2018.
It is presently anticipated that a minimum of $12.2 million of orders comprising the March 31, 2019 backlog will be filled during the fiscal year ending June 30, 2019.
The minimum of $12.2 million does not include any shipments, which may be made against orders subsequently received during the fiscal year ending June 30, 2019.
A significant portion of the Company’s business is the production of military and industrial electronic equipment for use by the U.S. and foreign governments and certain industrial customers.
Net sales to two significant customers represented 47.2% and 50.6% of the Company’s total sales for the three-month period ended March 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively.
Net sales to three significant customers represented 58.1% of the Company’s total sales for the nine-month period ended March 31, 2019 and net sales to two significant customers represented 58.6% of the Company's total sales for the nine-month period ended March 31, 2018.
We assess each contract at its inception to determine whether it should be combined with other contracts.
When making this determination, we consider factors such as whether two or more contracts were negotiated and executed at or near the same time, or were negotiated with an overall profit objective.
We evaluate the products or services promised in each contract at inception to determine whether the contract should be accounted for as having one or more performance obligation.
Transaction prices on our contracts subject to the Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR) are typically based on estimated costs plus a reasonable profit margin.
We recognize revenue using the output method based on the appraisal of results achieved and milestones reached or units delivered based on contractual shipment terms, typically shipping point.
Work in process represents spare units and parts and other inventory items acquired or produced to service units previously sold or to meet anticipated future orders.
The provision for losses on contracts is included in other accrued expenses on the Company’s balance sheet.
The costs attributed to units delivered under contracts are based on the estimated average cost of all units expected to be produced.
Certain contracts are expected to extend beyond twelve months.
The estimation of total cost at completion of a contract is subject to numerous variables involving contract costs and estimates as to the length of time to complete the contract.
Gross profit as a percentage of sales was 18.7% and 23.5%, for the same periods, respectively.
The gross profits on mature products and build to print contracts are typically higher as compared to products which are still in the engineering development stage or in early stages of production.
