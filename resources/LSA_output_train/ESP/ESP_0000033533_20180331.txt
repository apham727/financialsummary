There is competition in all classes of products manufactured by the Company from divisions of the largest electronic companies, as well as many small companies.
The Company's sales do not represent a significant share of the industry's market for any class of its products.
However, the concentration of our business in the rail industry, and in equipment for military applications and industrial applications and our customer concentrations expose us to on-going associated risks.
Uncertainty in federal defense spending and future procurement needs supporting the rail industry continues to drive competition.
Accordingly, we adjust our pricing strategy in order to achieve a balance which enables us both to retain repeat programs while being more competitive in bidding on new programs.
Successful conversion of engineering program backlog into sales is largely dependent on the execution and completion of our engineering design efforts.
We are currently experiencing some technical and schedule delays with our major development programs which are being resolved as they arise.
New orders received in the nine months of fiscal year 2018 were approximately $28.6 million as compared to $16.8 million of new orders received in the first nine months of fiscal year 2017.
It is presently anticipated that a minimum of $7.0 million of orders comprising the March 31, 2018 backlog will be filled during the fiscal year ending June 30, 2018.
The minimum of $7.0 million does not include any shipments, which may be made against orders subsequently received during the fiscal year ending June 30, 2018.
In addition to the backlog, the Company currently has outstanding opportunities representing in excess of $68.4 million in the aggregate as of May 1, 2018 for both repeat and new programs.

Net sales to two significant customers represented 58.6% and 43.2% of the Company’s total sales for the nine-month periods ended March 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively.
This high concentration level with these customers presents significant risk.
Generally revenues on long-term fixed-price contracts are recorded on a percentage of completion basis using units of delivery as the measurement basis for progress toward completion.
