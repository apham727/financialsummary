The Company amortized $82,000 of direct costs for the nine months ended November 2, 2019 and the balance of deferred incremental direct costs net of accumulated amortization at November 2, 2019 was $942,000, of which $117,000 is reported in other current assets and $825,000 is reported in other assets in the accompanying condensed consolidated balance sheet.

Three Months Ended November 2, 2019 vs. Three Months Ended October 27, 2018 Supplies revenue in the current quarter was $17.7 million, a 2.5% decrease over prior years third quarter supplies revenue of $18.1 million.
Current quarter other expense primarily includes interest expense on the Companys debt and revolving line of credit of $0.2 million.
This compares to the prior years third quarter tax provision of $0.4 million, which reflected a benefit of $0.1 million related to windfall tax benefits related to the Companys stock and an effective tax rate of 22.3%.
On a comparable basis, net income for the prior years third quarter was $1.4 million or $0.20 per diluted share.
Return on revenue was 1.4% for the third quarter of fiscal 2020 compared to 4.1% for the third quarter of fiscal 2019.
Revenue for the first nine months of the current year was $103.0 million, representing a 3.5% increase compared to the previous years first nine months of revenue of $99.5 million.
The current years first nine months of international revenue reflected an unfavorable foreign exchange rate impact of $1.2 million.
Supplies revenue in the first nine months of the current year was $55.5 million, representing a 5.3% increase over the prior years first nine months revenue of $52.7 million.
The current year increase in supplies revenue is due primarily to the increase in inkjet printer supplies and label sales, tempered by lower thermal film and electrophotographic supplies revenue in the Product Identification segment.
