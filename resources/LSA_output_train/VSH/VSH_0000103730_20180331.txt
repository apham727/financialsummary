We expect to continue our strategy of acquisitions while also maintaining a prudent capital structure.
We are focused on enhancing stockholder value and improving earnings per share.
In December 2015, we amended our credit facility to increase our ability to repurchase shares of stock or pay cash dividends.
On August 2, 2017, our Board of Directors approved a stock repurchase plan, authorizing us to repurchase, in the aggregate, up to $150 million of our outstanding common stock.
The stock repurchase plan will expire on June 1, 2018.
The stock repurchase plan does not obligate us to acquire any particular amount of common stock, and it may be terminated or suspended at any time at the Company's direction in accordance with the plan.
No repurchases were made in the first fiscal quarter of 2018.
For several years, we implemented aggressive cost reduction programs.
