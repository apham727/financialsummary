The Company's total net sales from continuing operations in the 13 weeks and 39 weeks ended November 25, 2018 were $12.9 million and $34.5 million, respectively, compared to $10.2 million and $30.3 million in the 13 weeks and 39 weeks ended November 26, 2017, respectively.
The Company’s earnings from continuing operations and net earnings from continuing operations were 405% and 504% higher, respectively, in the 13 weeks ended November 25, 2018 compared to the 13 weeks ended November 26, 2017 and 219% and 270% higher, respectively, in the 39 weeks ended November 25, 2018 than in last fiscal year’s comparable period primarily as a result of higher sales, higher net interest income due to the elimination of interest expense as a result of the Company’s voluntary prepayment of long-term debt and a lower tax provision compared to last year’s comparable periods.
Long-term contracts with the Company’s customers are primarily requirements based and do not guarantee quantities.
An order forecast is generally agreed concurrently with pricing for any applicable long-term contract.
Selling, general and administrative expenses from continuing operations decreased by $526,000 during the 13 weeks ended November 25, 2018, or by 21%, and decreased by $989,000 during the 39 weeks ended November 25, 2018, or by 14%, compared to last fiscal year's comparable periods, and these expenses, measured as percentages of sales from continuing operations, were 15.4% and 18.0%, respectively, in the 13 weeks and 39 weeks ended November 25, 2018 compared to 24.5% and 23.7%, respectively, in the 13 weeks and 39 weeks ended November 26, 2017.
The decreases in such expenses during the 13 weeks and 39 weeks ended November 25, 2018 were primarily the result of lower payroll, travel and entertainment and stock option expenses.

Interest income decreased 46% and 51%, respectively, for the 13 weeks and 39 weeks ended November 25, 2018 primarily as a result of lower average balances of marketable securities held by the Company in the 13 weeks and 39 weeks ended November 25, 2018, compared to last fiscal year's comparable periods, partially offset by higher weighted average interest rates.
During the 39 weeks ended November 25, 2018, the Company earned interest income principally from its investments, which consisted primarily of short-term instruments and money market funds.

The Company’s net earnings from discontinued operations were higher in the 13 weeks ended November 25, 2018 compared to the 13 weeks ended November 26, 2017 primarily as a result of lower restructuring charges and a gain of $2,945 realized on the sale of its New England Laminates Co., Inc. facility located in Newburgh, New York.
