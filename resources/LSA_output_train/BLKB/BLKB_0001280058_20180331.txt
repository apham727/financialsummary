In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued Accounting Standards Update ("ASU") 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606) ("ASU 2014-09"), which outlines a single comprehensive model for entities to use in accounting for revenue arising from contracts with customers.
ASU 2014-09 replaces most previous revenue recognition guidance in GAAP and requires the recognition of revenue when promised goods or services are transferred to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled to in exchange for those goods or services.

We recently introduced Blackbaud Grantmaking™, our newest and most comprehensive grants management solution.
Donors funding scholarships, for example, will now have improved visibility given the integration with our digital marketing solutions.
This saves our customers time through automation, and provides them with a more robust set of tools to better enable their organizations for success.
We are making investments to increase the effectiveness of our sales organization, with a focus on enabling our expanded sales teams with the processes and tools to accelerate our revenue growth and improve productivity and effectiveness.
Our sales account executives now lead with a total-solution selling strategy, which we believe results in more products per customer, higher ASP's, and increased customer retention over the long-term.
We believe that attaching training, analytics, and payments to a deal improves the customer experience, improves outcomes, drives retention, and extends the customer lifetime value.
We have been executing this strategy for several years and have expanded our TAM by roughly $2 billion through acquired businesses over the last two years.
During the second quarter of 2017, we acquired AcademicWorks, adding scholarship management and stewardship software to our portfolio.
