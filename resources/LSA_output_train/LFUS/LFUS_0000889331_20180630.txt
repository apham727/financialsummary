The increase was primarily driven by the acquisition of IXYS, which added $100.2 million in sales along with higher volume across all three segments.
Net sales for Electronics increased $130.0 million, or 76.7%, primarily due to the acquisition of IXYS and strong growth across all the business units and favorable changes in foreign exchange rates of $8.0 million.
Net sales for the Automotive segment increased $10.7 million, or 9.2% due to volume growth across all the segment’s business units.
Net sales in the Industrial segment increased $5.1 million or 18.7% due to volume growth across all the segment’s business units.
Net cash provided by operating activities was $140.9 million for the six months ended June 30, 2018 as compared to $93.6 million for the six months ended July 1, 2017.
The increase in net cash provided by operating activities reflected higher earnings and favorable working capital management that more than offset higher payments related to acquisition and integration costs and higher cash taxes.
These were primarily attributable to acquisition-related costs primarily related to legal and integration costs associated with the Company’s acquisitions in 2016 of the ON Portfolio.
Net sales increased $145.8 million, or 46.5%, for the second quarter of 2018 compared to the second quarter of 2017 with increases of $100.2 million and $3.4 million resulting from incremental net sales related to the IXYS and U.S. Sensor acquisitions, respectively.
Net sales for the first six months of 2018 increased $278.2 million, or 46.5%, compared to the first six months of 2017 with increases of $186.5 million and $6.5 million resulting from incremental net sales related to the IXYS and U.S. Sensor acquisitions, respectively.
The increase in gross profit reflects the IXYS acquisition and volume growth across all segments and expense leverage across all segments.
Total operating expenses as a percent of net sales increased from 22.9% for the first six months of 2017 to 25.2% for the first six months of 2018 primarily due to the higher amortization expense and acquisition-related and integration charges noted above.
Increases in operating income across the Electronics segment were more than offset by purchase accounting inventory charges of $19.0 million, higher amortization charges of $7.2 million and higher restructuring and impairment charges of $4.3 million along with the costs associated with the acquisition and integration of the IXYS acquisition as described above.
Operating margins decreased from 19.2% in the second quarter of 2017 to 13.0% in the second quarter of 2018.
In addition to the factors impacting comparative results for operating income discussed above, income before income taxes was impacted by increased unfavorable foreign exchange losses of $3.8 million primarily due to fluctuations in the Euro and Mexican peso against the U.S. dollar and increased interest expense of $2.5 million associated with the increased borrowings for the IXYS acquisition.
Additionally, partially offsetting the previously mentioned expense increases was an increase in other income of $1.9 million during the three months ended June 30, 2018 as compared to the three months ended July 1, 2017 primarily as a result of unrealized investment gains associated with our equity investments.
The Electronics segment net sales increased $240.6 million, or 74.5%, in the first six months of 2018 compared to the first six months of 2017 due to incremental net sales related to the IXYS and U.S. Sensor acquisitions of $186.5 million and $6.5 million, respectively, higher volume across all businesses driven by the continued strong electronics cycle and favorable foreign exchange impacts of $8.5 million.
The Automotive segment net sales increased $29.0 million, or 12.9%, in the first six months of 2018 compared to the first six months of 2017 due to increased volume across all businesses with the commercial vehicle and sensor businesses having the most growth as well as favorable changes in foreign exchange rates of $11.9 million.The Company acquired IXYS Corporation on January 17, 2018.
