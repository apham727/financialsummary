As indicated in Note 4 to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements, the methodology used to allocate certain selling, general, and administrative expenses was refined in the first quarter of 2019.
The amounts presented below for the 13-weeks and 26-weeks ended June 30, 2018 are presented here as they were originally reported.
The outdoor, fitness, marine, and aviation segments collectively increased by 12%, contributing 83% of total revenue.
The outdoor segment revenue increase was primarily driven by strong sales in golf and inReach product lines.
The fitness segment revenue increase was primarily driven by strong sales in wearables and sales from Tacx, a newly acquired group of subsidiaries that designs and manufactures indoor bike trainers.
The current quarter marine segment revenue increase was primarily driven by sales growth in chartplotters and sonar products.
The marine segment gross margin increase of 200 basis points was primarily attributable to product mix.
Advertising expense as a percent of revenue was slightly lower when compared to the year-ago quarter and decreased 5% in absolute dollars.
The total absolute dollar decrease was primarily attributable to decreased cooperative advertising and point-of-sale display advertising expense in the auto segment and decreased media advertising in the fitness segment, slightly offset by increased media and cooperative advertising in the outdoor segment.
Selling, general and administrative expense increased 7% in absolute dollars and was relatively flat as a percent of revenue compared to the year-ago quarter.
The auto segment decrease as a percent of revenue was primarily due to less amortization expense associated with intangible assets.
