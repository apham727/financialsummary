Prior period information was not restated and continues to be presented under ASC 840, Leases.
We elected the package of practical expedients permitted under the transition guidance within the new standard, which among other things, allowed us to not reassess existing contracts to determine if they contain a lease and to carry forward their historical lease classification upon transition.
In addition, we will not apply the guidance of ASC 842 to leases with an initial term of 12 months or less as allowed by the standard.
In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-13, Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments.
ASU 2016-13 is effective for us in our first quarter of fiscal 2020.
We determine if our contractual agreements contain a lease at inception.
Our lease agreements consist primarily of operating leases for office space.
Operating lease assets are also recognized at the commencement date as the total operating lease liability plus prepaid rents and less any deferred rent liabilities that existed under ASC 840.
We have certain lease agreements with our unconsolidated real estate joint ventures.
Our total operating lease costs were $19.9 million during the three months ended March 31, 2019.
Cash paid for amounts included in the present value of operating lease liabilities was $19.1 million during the three months ended March 31, 2019 and is included in operating cash flows.
