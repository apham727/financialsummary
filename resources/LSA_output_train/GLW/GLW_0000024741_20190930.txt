Life Sciences net sales increased by $51 million, as volume grew faster than the underlying market.

When compared to the first nine months of 2018, selling, general and administrative expenses decreased by $168 million, or 12%, in the nine months ended September 30, 2019.
Selling, general and administrative expenses declined as a percentage of sales by 2% for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2019.
As a percentage of sales, these expenses were similar when compared to the same periods last year.
In the third quarter ending September 30, 2019, equity in earnings of affiliated companies declined by $9 million primarily driven by lower sales volumes for some of our affiliates.
Equity in earnings of affiliated companies for the nine months ended September 30, 2019 decreased by $21 million, primarily driven by the absence of a gain recorded in the first quarter of 2018 resulting from a legal settlement.
For the three months ended September 30, 2019 comprehensive income decreased by $444 million when compared to the same period in 2018, due to lower net income of $288 million and $110 million of negative impacts from the change in foreign currency translation losses, driven primarily by the Korean won.
For the nine months ended September 30, 2019 comprehensive income increased by $71 million when compared to the same period in 2018, primarily due to an increase in net income of $154 million offset by $53 million related to the adoption of the new standard for reclassification of stranded tax effects in AOCI.
Corning utilizes constant-currency reporting for our Display Technologies and Specialty Materials segments for the Japanese yen, South Korean won, Chinese yuan and new Taiwan dollar currencies.
Effective January 1, 2019, Corning also began using constant-currency reporting for our Environmental Technologies and Life Sciences segments for the euro, Japanese yen and Chinese yuan.
