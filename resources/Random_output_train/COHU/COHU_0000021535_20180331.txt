The semiconductor equipment industry is characterized by dramatic and sometimes rapid changes in demand for its products.
Continued uncertainties may reduce future sales of our products and services.
Future competition may include companies that do not currently supply test handlers.
We have experienced significant volatility in our stock price.
As a result, it cannot be assured that the Merger will result in the realization of the full or any anticipated benefits.

In addition, with the acquisition of Kita in 2017, we increased our investments in our test contactor business, and announced significant growth targets for the business over the next several years.
As a result of these changes and other factors, assessing the market potential and commercial viability of handling, MEMS, system-level and burn-in test equipment and test contactors is extremely difficult and subject to a great deal of risk.
We have in the past and may in the future experience difficulties, particularly in manufacturing, in training and recruiting the large number of additions to our workforce.
During the past five years, the percentage of our sales derived from these significant customers has varied greatly.
