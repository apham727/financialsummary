Pro forma net income (loss) was calculated by adjusting the results for the applicable period to reflect (i) the additional amortization that would have been charged assuming the fair value adjustments to intangible assets had been applied on January 1, 2018 and (ii) adjustments to amortized revenue during fiscal 2019 and 2018 as a result of the acquisition date valuation of assumed deferred revenue.Conversely, modest TruBridge revenue growth during the first six months 2019 coupled with collections on past financing receivables have greatly abated the related cash collection timing delays.
During the six months ended June 30, 2019, we generated revenues of $135.3 million from the sale of our products and services, compared to $138.8 million during the six months ended June 30, 2018, a decrease of 3% that is primarily attributed to fewer MU3 installations as the MU3 deadline approaches partially offset by continued TruBridge client growth.
As a result, the effect of this trend on the Company's financial statements is reduced system sales revenues during the period of installation in exchange for increased recurring periodic revenues (reflected in system sales and support revenues) over the term of the SaaS arrangement.
 Recurring system sales and support revenues decreased by $1.5 million, or 4%, compared to the second quarter of 2018.
We installed our Acute Care EHR solutions at six new hospital clients during the second quarter of 2019 (three of which were under a SaaS arrangement, resulting in revenue being recognized ratably over the contract term) compared to three new hospital clients during the second quarter of 2018 (one under a SaaS arrangement).
Get Real Health contributed $0.1 million in TruBridge cost of sales during the six months ended June 30, 2019.
Despite the similar experience in non-SaaS installation activity, a decrease in average contract value for the related installations resulted in non-recurring EHR revenues from new system implementations decreasing $2.5 million from the first six months of 2018.
General and administrative expenses decreased 8%, or $1.1 million, as the $2.1 million in cost savings achieved through recent changes in the health benefits offered to our employees through our self-insured health plans were partially offset by increases in other expense items.
Get Real Health contributed $0.2 million in general and administrative costs during the six months ended June 30, 2019.
