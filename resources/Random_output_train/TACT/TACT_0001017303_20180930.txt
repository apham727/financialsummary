The Company’s revenue recognition method prior to the adoption of ASC 606 can be found under Note 2.
The risks described in our Annual Report on Form 10-K are not the only risks facing our Company.
The adoption of the ASC 606 did not require the Company to record an adjustment to retained earnings at January 1, 2018 and did not have an impact on the consolidated income statement during the first nine months of 2018, basic or diluted earnings per share, consolidated statement of cash flows or consolidated balance sheet at September 30, 2018.
The Company maintains a valuation allowance against certain deferred tax assets where realization is not certain.
Entities have the option of using either a full retrospective approach or modified retrospective approach to adopt the amended guidance.
The Company has not recorded any impacts of GILTI or BEAT in its consolidated financial statements for the quarter ended September 30, 2018.The increase in domestic restaurant solutions terminal sales in the first nine months of 2018 compared to the first nine months of 2017 was driven by increased sales of our AccuDate XL2e to three large corporate customers in support of a large-scale, multi-quarter rollouts of the terminal.
Engineering, design and product development expenses increased $350 thousand, or 11%, in the first nine months of 2018 compared to the first nine months of 2017 due primarily to the hiring of additional engineering staff and increased expenses related to product development for the restaurant solutions and casino and gaming markets.
This increase was partially offset by 81% lower domestic sales of our legacy banking and other POS printers for the third quarter of 2018 compared to the third quarter of 2017.
We expect selling and marketing expenses in 2018 to be relatively consistent with 2017, as increased costs related to the build-out of our internal sales infrastructure in Europe during 2018 will be offset by savings from the retirement of our former EVP, Sales and Marketing and the elimination of sales commissions to our former gaming international distributor.
We recorded other expense of $50 thousand in the third quarter of 2018 compared to no other income or expense recorded in the third quarter of 2017 due to higher foreign exchange losses recorded by our U.K. entity in the third quarter of 2018.
  ●  We recorded depreciation and amortization of $866 thousand, and share-based compensation expense of $484 thousand.
General and administrative expenses increased $243 thousand, or 4%, in the first nine months of 2018 compared to the first nine months of 2017 due primarily to increased legal expenses and increased administrative expenses related to the expansion of our restaurant solutions sales staff and transitioning to a direct selling model for the casino and gaming market in Europe.
We sell our products to original equipment manufacturers ("OEMs"), value-added resellers ("VARs"), select distributors, as well as directly to end-users.
We expect to pay approximately $2.7 million in cash dividends to our common shareholders during the full year 2018.
The increase in domestic POS automation and banking product revenue from the third quarter of 2017 was driven by a 22% increase in sales of our Ithaca® 9000 printer, as sales to McDonald’s have returned to the near record levels experienced during 2017.
