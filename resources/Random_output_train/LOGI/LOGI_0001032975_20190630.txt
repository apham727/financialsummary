Based on our current business model and as we expand into new markets and product categories and acquire companies, businesses and assets, we must comply with a wide variety of laws, standards and other requirements governing, among other things, health and safety, hazardous materials usage, product-related energy consumption, packaging, recycling and environmental matters.
A significant portion of our business is conducted in currencies other than the U.S. Dollar.
For the Company's operating leases, the Company accounts for the lease and non-lease components as a single lease component.
We have also paid cash dividends and increased the size of our dividend, each year since fiscal year 2013.
To the extent that we are unable to improve our financial performance, further restructuring measures may be required in the future.
These reductions and turnover have resulted in reallocations of duties, which could result in employee uncertainty and discontent.
Our products may be required to obtain regulatory approvals and satisfy other regulatory concerns in the various jurisdictions where they are manufactured, sold or both.
Because the Company does not generally borrow in a collateralized basis, it uses its understanding of what its collateralized credit rating would be as an input to deriving an appropriate incremental borrowing rate.
Recently and in past years, we have initiated reductions in our workforce to align our employee base with our business strategy, our anticipated revenue base or with our areas of focus. During the first quarter of fiscal year 2019, we implemented a restructuring plan to streamline and realign our overall organizational structure and reallocate resources to support our long-term growth opportunities.

The majority of our other production is performed by third-party contract manufacturers, including original design manufacturers, in China and Malaysia.
In addition, some of these growth categories and opportunities are characterized by price competition, erosion of premium-priced segments and average selling prices, commoditization, and sensitivity to general economic conditions and cyclical downturns.
The development process also can be lengthy and costly.
Our brands and reputation are also dependent on third parties, such as suppliers, manufacturers, distributors, retailers, product reviewers and the media as well as online consumer product reviews, consumer recommendations and referrals.
In addition to the extra costs and regulatory burdens of our dual regulatory obligations, the two regulatory regimes may not always be compatible and may impose disclosure obligations, operating restrictions or tax effects on our business to which our competitors and other companies are not subject.
Our future success depends in part on our proprietary technology, technical know-how and other intellectual property.
