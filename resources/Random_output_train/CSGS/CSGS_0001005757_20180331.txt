 Operating Income.
The 2018 Credit Agreement also includes a $200 million revolving loan facility (2018 Revolver).
Total software and services cost as a percentage of our software and services revenues for the first quarters of 2018 and 2017 were 71.4% and 74.9%, respectively.
During the next twelve months, there are no scheduled conversion triggers on our 2016 Convertible Notes.
As a result of the adoption of ASC 606, $1.5 million of investments in client contracts have been reclassified to operating activities from investing activities for the first quarter ended March 31, 2018.
Accrued employee compensation decreased $17.0 million to $46.0 million as of March 31, 2018, from $63.0 million as of December 31, 2017, due primarily to the payment of the 2017 employee incentive compensation that was fully accrued at December 31, 2016, offset to a certain degree by the accrual for the 2018 employee incentive compensation.
A large percentage of our historical revenues have been generated from our largest clients, which are Comcast, Charter Corporation Inc. (“Charter”), and DISH Network Corporation (“DISH”).
Cost of Revenues.
The lower first quarter 2017 effective income tax rate reflects an approximately $5 million net benefit resulting from Comcast’s exercise of 1.4 million vested stock warrants in January 2017, as the stock warrants appreciated in value since their vesting, resulting in an income tax benefit to us when exercised.
The total number of shares purchased that are not part of the Stock Repurchase Program represents shares purchased and cancelled in connection with stock incentive plans.
The expected impact of the Business Ink acquisition includes estimates for certain integration-related expenses and estimates for the amortization of acquired intangible assets.
As of March 31, 2018, we had committed to purchase approximately $14 million of equipment.
See our 2017 10-K for additional discussion of our business relationships and contractual terms with Comcast, Charter, and DISH.
We generate approximately 70% of our revenues from the North American cable and satellite markets, approximately 20% of our revenues from wireline and wireless communication providers, and the remainder from a variety of other verticals, such as financial services, logistics, and transportation.
Cost of Software and Services (Exclusive of Depreciation).
Total cloud and related solutions cost as a percentage of cloud and related solutions revenues for the first quarters of 2018 and 2017 were 49.0% and 47.9%, respectively, with the increase attributed to the reclassifications resulting from the adoption of ASC 606.
Our financing activities typically consist of activities associated with our common stock and our long-term debt.
The total number of shares purchased that are not part of the Stock Repurchase Program represents shares purchased and cancelled in connection with stock incentive plans.
The decrease in software and services revenues can be attributed mainly to the shift in our focus towards more recurring revenue arrangements, which are included in our cloud and related solutions revenues, and the adoption of ASC 606, which resulted in $1.6 million of revenue previously classified as software and services now being classified as cloud and related solutions.
Operating income for the first quarter of 2018 was $25.8 million, or 12.8% of total revenues, compared to $27.0 million, or 14.0% of total revenues for the first quarter of 2017.
In conjunction with the adoption of this ASU, we recorded a cumulative adjustment increasing beginning retained earnings (net of tax) by approximately $7 million, primarily related to contracts that we were required to defer revenue as we did not have VSOE for certain undelivered elements.
