In July 2017, we entered into an interest rate swap agreement (the "July 2017 Swap Agreement"), which effectively converts portions of our variable rate debt under our credit facility to a fixed rate for the term of the July 2017 Swap Agreement.
Recurring revenue is comprised of fees for the use of our subscription-based software solutions, which includes providing access to cloud-based solutions, hosting services, online training programs, subscription-based analytic services, such as donor acquisitions and data enrichment, and payment services.
Total rent expense was $4.0 million for the three months ended March 31, 2018 and 2017.
The acquisition expands our fundraising performance management capabilities and is intended to drive more effective fundraising and greater social good outcomes for our customers.
There were no non-recurring fair value adjustments to intangible assets and goodwill during the three months ended March 31, 2018, except for an insignificant business combination accounting adjustment to the initial fair value estimates of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the acquisition date from updated information obtained during the measurement period.
Our payment services are offered with the assistance of third-party vendors.
As of March 31, 2018, the remaining aggregate minimum purchase commitment under these arrangements was approximately $68.7 million through 2023.We expect that the ongoing shift in our go-to-market strategy towards cloud-based subscription offerings, which generally include integrated analytics and require less implementation services, to negatively impact one-time services and other revenue.
Conversely, as the U.S. dollar strengthened, foreign currency translation resulted in a decrease in our revenue and expenses denominated in non-U.S. currencies.
While there is negative discretion inherent in our performance-based compensation plans, it is our position that the intent is for historic contracts to be written and binding.
The positive impact of growth in total revenue driven by recurring subscriptions outpaced the related costs and was partially offset primarily by investments we are making in our sales organization and customer success program and, to a lesser extent, increases in amortization of intangible assets from business combinations of $1.1 million and restructuring costs of $0.8 million.
The purchase price and related expenses were funded primarily through borrowings under the 2017 Credit Facility.
We quickly integrated their back office for consistency and scale and have expanded sales into Canada and the United Kingdom (the "UK") by integrating the solutions into our international sales channels.
We have different courses spanning different functions and levels within the company enabling all of our employees to take ownership of their roles and move the company forward.
We acquired the equity securities for an aggregate purchase price of $43.0 million, subject to certain adjustments set forth in the securities purchase agreement.
These costs are deferred and then amortized in a manner that aligns with the expected period of benefit, which we have determined to be five years.
Productivity gains also contributed to the decrease in cost of one-time services and other.
We continue to make investments to drive sales effectiveness, which is a component of our four-point growth strategy to accelerate revenue growth.
