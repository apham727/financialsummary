As of March 31, 2019, we had additional operating leases, primarily for office space, that have not yet commenced with future rent payments of $9.3 million.
On January 2, 2019, we acquired all of the outstanding equity securities, including all voting equity interests, of YourCause Holdings, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company ("YourCause"), pursuant to a purchase agreement and plan of merger.
Diluted loss per share for the three months ended March 31, 2019 is the same as basic loss per share as there is a net loss in the period and inclusion of potentially dilutive securities is anti-dilutive.
We have lease agreements with lease and non-lease components, which are generally accounted for separately.
Our Board of Directors has adopted a dividend policy, which provides for the distribution to stockholders of a portion of cash generated by us that is in excess of operational needs and capital expenditures.
Our Board of Directors has adopted a dividend policy, which provides for the distribution to stockholders of a portion of cash generated by us that is in excess of operational needs and capital expenditures.This has been a multi-year program for us, and we expect to be largely complete by the end of 2019.
During the three months ended March 31, 2019, foreign translation resulted in a decrease in our revenues and expenses denominated in non-U.S. currencies.
Increases in stock-based compensation of $2.6 million, employee severance of $2.5 million, rent expense of $1.6 million, restructuring costs of $1.1 million and amortization of intangible assets from business combinations of $1.1 million also negatively impacted income from operations during the three months ended March 31, 2019.
We intend to continue focusing on innovation, quality and integration of our cloud-based solutions, which we believe will drive future revenue growth.
Upon adoption of ASU 2016-02 at January 1, 2019, we reduced our operating lease ROU assets recognized at transition by the carrying amounts of the restructuring liabilities for certain leased office spaces that we ceased using prior to December 31, 2018.
In addition, deferred revenues can vary on a seasonal basis for the same reasons.
In addition, during the three months ended March 31, 2019, we paid dividends of $5.9 million, which was relatively consistent with the comparable period of 2018.
The increase in total revenue during the three months ended March 31, 2019, when compared to the same period in 2018, was primarily driven by growth in recurring revenue as we continue to see positive demand from customers across our portfolio of cloud-based solutions.
In general, our cloud-based solutions include integrated analytics, training and payments services, and require less implementation services and little to no customization services.
