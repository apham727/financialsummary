Historically, we have relied on our ability to respond quickly to customer orders as part of our competitive strategy, resulting in customers placing orders with relatively short delivery schedules.
We purchase a substantial portion of our raw materials and equipment from foreign suppliers.
In the event that these service providers do not properly safeguard the data that they hold, security breaches and loss of data could result.
If these third parties are unable or unwilling to timely deliver products or services conforming to our quality standards, we may not be able to qualify additional manufacturing sources for our products in a timely manner on terms favorable to us, or at all.
The U.S. administration has increased tariffs on products that have China as their country of origin and which are imported into the U.S.
If we are unable to generate such cash flow, we may be required to adopt one or more alternatives, such as selling assets, restructuring debt or obtaining additional equity capital on terms that may be onerous or highly dilutive.We believe that the capital expenditures anticipated to be incurred over the next twelve months will provide sufficient manufacturing capacity to support the growth of our production capabilities for our new products and technologies and to bring in-house more of the assembly and test operations that are currently outsourced.
Direct control over manufacturing resources allows us to shorten our design and production cycles.
We review these estimates and judgments on an ongoing basis.
Our microcontroller product line represents the largest component of our total net sales.
Substantially all of the revenue generated from contracts with direct customers is recognized at the time risk and title of the inventory transfers to the customer.
Our primary reason for this acquisition was to expand our range of solutions, products and capabilities by extending our served available market.As required by the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, in August 2012, the SEC released investigation, disclosure and reporting requirements regarding the use of "conflict" minerals mined from the Democratic Republic of Congo and adjoining countries and which are necessary to the functionality or production of products.
Ensuring that we have adequate internal financial and accounting controls and procedures so that we can produce accurate financial statements on a timely basis is a costly and time-consuming effort that needs to be re-evaluated frequently.
Likewise, the China administration has increased tariffs on products that have the U.S. as their country of origin and which are imported into China.
These transactions are subject to a number of risks similar to those we face with our acquisitions including our ability to realize the expected benefits of any such transaction, to successfully market and sell any products resulting from such transactions or to successfully integrate any technology developed through such transactions.
Our customers may also be adversely affected by these same issues.
