See Note D to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements.
Fiscal 2018 recast to adjust for corporate overhead and other common expenses, which were no longer allocated starting in fiscal 2019.
On August 19, 2002, our Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to an additional 2.0 million shares of our Class A common stock.
During the six months ended October 31, 2018 and 2017, we granted options for 1,189,000 and 884,000 shares of Class A common stock, respectively.
The fair value of cash equivalents approximates its carrying value due to the short-term nature of these instruments.
This allocation is based on managementÂ’s judgment after considering the dividend rights of the two classes of common stock, the control of the Class B shareholders and the convertibility rights of the Class B Common Shares into Class A Common Shares.
Sales Taxes.
Deferred revenue consists of amounts collected prior to having completed the performance of maintenance, SaaS, hosting, and managed services.For the three and six months ended October 31, 2018, gross product research and development costs increased 14% and 17%, respectively, when compared to the same periods in the previous year due partially to the recent Halo acquisition in the third quarter of fiscal 2018 and increased headcount in our SCM segment.
During the three and six months ended October 31, 2018, we recorded income tax expense of $93,000 and $68,000, respectively, primarily due to discrete stock compensation benefits of $12,000 and $286,000, respectively, net of normal income tax expense from operations.
We have no debt obligations or off-balance sheet financing arrangements, and therefore, we used no cash for debt service purposes.
