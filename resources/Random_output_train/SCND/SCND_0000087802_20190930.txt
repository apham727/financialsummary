Refer to Note 8, "Leases", for related disclosures.
Goodwill amounted to $705,300 at September 30, 2019 and June 30, 2019, all of which is expected to be deductible for tax purposes.
The Company has not changed its valuation techniques in measuring the fair value of any financial assets and liabilities during the period.
 See notes to unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements.
Sales to two customers during the three months ended September 30, 2019 accounted for approximately 90% of the Catalyst Research Instruments Operations revenues and 6% of the Company’s total revenues.
 The accompanying unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial statements are prepared pursuant to the Securities and Exchange Commission’s rules and regulations for reporting on Form 10-Q.
All of the Company’s leases are deemed operating leases.
The ROU asset is further adjusted to account for previously recorded lease expenses such as deferred rent and other lease liabilities.
The measurement is based on significant inputs that are not observable in the market, therefore, the Company classifies this liability as Level 3 in the following tables.
  As of September 30, 2019, the weighted-average remaining lease term for operating lease liabilities was approximately 4 years and the weighted-average discount rate was 5.0%.
 The FASB defines the fair value of financial instruments as the amount that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date.
As the Company’s leases do not provide an implicit rate, the Company used its incremental borrowing rate of 5.0% as the discount rate to calculate the present value of future lease payments, which was the interest rate that its bank would charge for a similar loan.

  The Company elected not to recognize a ROU asset and a lease liability for leases with an initial term of twelve months or less.
In addition, the Company had a lease for its Torbal Division of the Benchtop Laboratory Equipment Operations which was mutually terminated early effective as of October 31, 2019 and a new lease for a similar sales and administration office was entered into as of November 1, 2019 through October 2022.
Approximately 33% and 25% of total Benchtop Laboratory Equipment sales were derived from the Torbal Scales Division for the three months ended September 30, 2019 and 2018, respectively.
The Company utilized the transition method allowing entities to only apply the new lease standard in the year of adoption.
