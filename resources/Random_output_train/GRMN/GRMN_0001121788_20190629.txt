The differences could be caused by a number of factors or combination of factors including, but not limited to, those factors identified in the Companyâ€™s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 29, 2018.The outdoor segment revenue increase was primarily driven by strong sales in golf and inReach product lines.
As a result of the above, net income for the 26-week period ended June 29, 2019 was $363.8 million compared to $319.7 million for the 26-week period ended June 30, 2018, an increase of $44.1 million.
The outdoor, fitness, marine, and aviation segments collectively increased by 12%, contributing 84% of total revenue.
For comparative purposes, we estimate selling, general and administrative expenses for the first half of 2018 would have been approximately $9 million more for the aviation segment, approximately $8 million less for the marine segment, approximately $1 million less for the outdoor segment, and not significantly different for the fitness and auto segments.
The remaining net currency gain of $0.4 million was related to the timing of transactions and impacts of other currencies, each of which was individually immaterial.
The $3.5 million currency gain recognized in the first half of 2018 was primarily due to the strengthening of the U.S. Dollar against the Taiwan Dollar, partially offset by the U.S. Dollar strengthening against the Euro and British Pound Sterling within the 26-weeks ended June 30, 2018.
Our research and development spending is focused on product development, improving existing software capabilities, and exploring new categories.
Auto segment revenue decreased 12% from the year-ago period, primarily due to the ongoing PND market contraction.
Net sales increased 7% for the 13-week period ended June 29, 2019 when compared to the year-ago quarter.
The amounts presented below for the 13-weeks and 26-weeks ended June 30, 2018 are presented here as they were originally reported.
Considering the refined allocation methodology noted above, we estimate selling, general and administrative expenses for the 52-weeks ended December 29, 2018 would have been approximately $18 million more for the aviation segment, approximately $11 million less for the marine segment, approximately $7 million less for the outdoor segment, and not significantly different for the fitness and auto segments.
The total absolute dollar decrease was primarily attributable to decreased cooperative advertising and point-of-sale display advertising expense in the auto segment and decreased media advertising in the fitness segment, slightly offset by increased media and cooperative advertising in the outdoor segment.
The outdoor, fitness, marine, and aviation segments collectively increased by 12%, contributing 84% of total revenue.
A portion of license expense favorability in the auto segment is expected to continue for the remainder of the year.Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the Company has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned, thereunto duly authorized.
