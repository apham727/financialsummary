Readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on forward-looking statements, which reflect management’s analysis only as of the date hereof.The CPG also sells knives and tools, principally machetes, bayonets, survival knives and kitchen knives, to various branches of the United States Government which accounted for less than 5% and 7% of the Company’s consolidated revenues in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively.
The consolidated revenue increase for the nine month period ended September 30, 2018 when compared to the same period in 2017 is primarily attributed to ATG with increased number of units shipped of approximately $3,091,000 and average price increases of approximately $2,969,000.
During this period the ATG increased commercial shipments by approximately $2,142,000 offset by the CPG commercial shipments decrease of approximately $134,000.
The consolidated revenue increase for the three month period ended September 30, 2018 when compared to the same period in 2017 is primarily attributed to increased average prices of approximately $1,155,000 and increased number of units shipped of approximately $566,000 at the ATG.
The decrease in revenue at the CPG is primarily attributed to average price decreases of approximately $352,000 offset slightly by volume increases of approximately $74,000 as compared to the same three month period ended September 30, 2017.
The primary use of cash for the Company’s operating activities for the nine month period ended September 30, 2018 includes working capital requirements, increased receivables due to timing of shipments and payments by customers and increase in inventory raw materials for increased production offset by timing differences on payments to vendors.
Consumer sales are moderately seasonal.
Both ATG and CPG decreased government shipments by approximately $447,000 and $222,000, respectively, during the nine month period ended September 30, 2018 and 2017.
This is offset by a decrease in revenue at the CPG due to a decrease in the number of units shipped of approximately $456,000 and average price decreases of approximately $375,000 as compared to the same nine month period ended September 30, 2017. Item 6.Exhibits
