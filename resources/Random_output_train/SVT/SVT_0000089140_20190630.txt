During this period both the ATG and CPG increased commercial shipments by approximately $1,642,000 and $293,000, respectively.

The primary use of cash for the Company’s operating activities for the six month period ended June 30, 2019 include working capital requirements, mainly an increase in accounts receivables and inventories of approximately $356,000 and $1,780,000, respectively.
