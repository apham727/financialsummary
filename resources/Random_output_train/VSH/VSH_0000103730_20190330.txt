The Company determines compensation cost for restricted stock units (“RSUs”) and phantom stock units based on the grant-date fair value of the underlying common stock adjusted for expected dividends paid over the required vesting period for non-participating awards.
The amount of compensation cost related to stock-based payment transactions is measured based on the grant-date fair value of the equity instruments issued.
The Company recognizes compensation cost for RSUs that are expected to vest and records cumulative adjustments in the period that the expectation changes.
The phantom stock units are fully vested at all times.
Accordingly, the convertible instruments are included in the diluted earnings per share computation using the “treasury stock method” (similar to options and warrants) rather than the “if converted method” otherwise required for convertible debt.
If the average market price is less than $12.71, no shares are included in the diluted earnings per share computation for the convertible senior debentures due 2040, if the average market price is less than $17.41, no shares are included in the diluted earnings per share computation for the convertible senior debentures due 2041, and if the average market price is less than $31.49, no shares are included in the diluted earnings per share computation for the convertible senior notes due 2025.
The fair value of the long-term debt, excluding the derivative liabilities and deferred financing costs, at March 30, 2019 and December 31, 2018 is approximately $586,200 and $577,200, respectively, compared to its carrying value, excluding the derivative liabilities and deferred financing costs, of $506,834 and $509,407, respectively.
The four fiscal quarters in 2018 ended on March 31, 2018, June 30, 2018, September 29, 2018, and December 31, 2018, respectively.
The Company’s financial instruments also include accounts receivable, short-term notes payable, and accounts payable.
