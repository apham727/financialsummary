Revenues from the sale of hardware products represent amounts earned primarily from the sale of our Oracle Engineered Systems, computer servers, storage, and industry-specific hardware.
Revenues for fixed price services are generally recognized over time applying input methods to estimate progress to completion.
We recognize revenue ratably because the customer receives and consumes the benefits of the cloud services throughout the contract period.
We allocate the transaction price for each contract to each performance obligation based on the relative standalone selling price (SSP) for each performance obligation within each contract.
These seasonal impacts influence how our remaining performance obligations change over time.
For substantially all performance obligations except cloud licenses and on-premise licenses, we are able to establish SSP based on the observable prices of products or services sold separately in comparable circumstances to similar customers.

Initial sales commissions for the majority of these aforementioned contracts are generally deferred and amortized on a straight-line basis over a period of benefit that we estimate to be four to five years.
