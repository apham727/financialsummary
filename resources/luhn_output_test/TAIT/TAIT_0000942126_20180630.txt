We maintain a majority-owned subsidiary in Mexico (since 1998) and two divisions in each of Taiwan (since 1998) and China (since 2005).
The unaudited condensed consolidated interim financial statements include the accounts of the Company and all wholly owned divisions, including its 60% majority-owned subsidiary, Taitron Components Mexico, S.A. de C.V. All significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.
These unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“GAAP”) for interim financial information and the instructions to Form 10-Q and Article 8 of Regulation S-X.
These unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the audited condensed consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2017.
This guidance will be effective in the first quarter of 2019 with early adoption permitted.
We have evaluated the impact of adopting this guidance and we are preparing for the changes to be made to our consolidated financial statements.
In January 2017, the FASB issued a new accounting standard which clarifies the definition of a business with the objective of adding guidance to assist entities with evaluating whether transactions should be accounted for as acquisitions or disposals of assets or businesses.
This guidance will be effective for the Company for the year ending December 31, 2019 and interim reporting periods within that year.The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the condensed consolidated financial statements, including the related notes, appearing in Item 1 of Part 1 of this quarterly report on Form 10-Q, as well as our most recent annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2017.
These estimates have a significant impact on our valuation and reserve accounts relating to the allowance for sales returns, doubtful accounts, inventory reserves and deferred income taxes.
Sales returns for the three months ended June 30, 2018 and 2017 were $1,000 and $36,000, respectively and for the six months ended June 30, 2018 and 2017 were $3,000 and $148,000, respectively.
We had inventory balances in the amount of $4,546,000 and $4,990,000 at June 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017, respectively, which is presented net of valuation allowances of $7,946,000 and $7,848,000, respectively.
In accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, we have classified inventory as a current asset in our June 30, 2018, condensed consolidated financial statements representing approximately 49% of current assets and 34% of total assets.
However, if all or a substantial portion of the inventory was required to be immediately liquidated, the inventory would not be as readily marketable or liquid as other items included or classified as a current asset, such as cash.
Net sales in the second quarter of 2018 totaled $2,150,000 versus $1,773,000 in the comparable period for 2017, an increase of $377,000 or 21.3% over the same period last year.
Gross profit for the second quarter of 2018 was $979,000 versus $757,000 in the comparable period for 2018, and gross margin percentage of net sales was 45.5% in the second quarter of 2018 versus 42.7% in the comparable period for 2017.Controls and Procedures.Item 1.
