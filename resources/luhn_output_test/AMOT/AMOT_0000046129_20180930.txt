EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are provided for information purposes only and are not measures of financial performance under GAAP.
The Company believes EBITDA is often a useful measure of a Companys operating performance and is a significant basis used by the Companys management to measure the operating performance of the Companys business because EBITDA excludes charges for depreciation, amortization and interest expense that have resulted from our debt financings, as well as our provision for income tax expense.
EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA do not represent and should not be considered as an alternative to net income, operating income, net cash provided by operating activities or any other measure for determining operating performance or liquidity that is calculated in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.
The cash generated by the increase in net income in 2018 is offset by increases in working capital needs due to the Maval OE Steering business acquisition and significant organic growth.We estimate that foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations during the quarter ended September 30, 2018 decreased sales in comparison to quarter ended September 30, 2017 by approximately $700.
