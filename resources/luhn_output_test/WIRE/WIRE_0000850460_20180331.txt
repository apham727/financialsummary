Net sales were $291.4 million in the first quarter of 2018 compared to $279.4 million in the first quarter of 2017.
This 4.3% increase in net sales is primarily the result of a 6.4% increase in copper wire sales, driven by a 15.6% increase in the average selling price of copper wire offset by a 7.9% decrease in copper wire unit volume shipped.
The average cost per pound of raw copper purchased increased 18.3% in the first quarter of 2018 compared to the first quarter of 2017 and was the principal driver of the increased average sales price of copper wire.
Unit volume decreased in the first quarter of 2018 compared to the first quarter of 2017 primarily due to particularly rough winter weather that slowed construction and impacted our volumes, particularly in January.
Cost of goods sold was $253.9 million, or 87.1% of net sales, in the first quarter of 2018, compared to $240.2 million, or 86.0% of net sales, in the first quarter of 2017.
Gross profit decreased to $37.5 million, or 12.9% of net sales, in the first quarter of 2018 versus $39.2 million, or 14.0% of net sales, in the first quarter of 2017.
The decrease in gross profit margin percentage was driven by multiple factors, including a 7.9% decline in copper wire unit sales, which was more than offset by the increase of the copper wire spread.For information on the Company’s legal proceedings, see Note 8 to the Company’s consolidated financial statements included in Item 1 to this report and incorporated herein by reference.
