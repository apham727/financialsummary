Topic 606 supersedes previous revenue recognition guidance and requires the Company to recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the Company expects to be entitled in exchange for such goods or services.
The Company adopted Topic 606 on July 1, 2018 using the modified retrospective transition method applied to those contracts which were not completed as of July 1, 2018.
Under this transition method, the Company’s results in the consolidated statements of operations for the third quarter and nine months ended March 30, 2019 are presented under Topic 606, while the comparative results for the third quarter and nine months ended March 31, 2018 were not retrospectively adjusted, as such results were recognized in accordance with the revenue recognition policy discussed under Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in Note 1 of the Company’s Fiscal 2018 Annual Report on Form 10-K.
The adoption of Topic 606 did not have a material impact on the Company’s consolidated financial statements as of the adoption date and as of and for the nine months ended March 30, 2019.
For a nominal portion of the Company’s contracts where the accounting did change, the adoption of Topic 606 resulted in an increase to the opening balance of retained earnings of $2.0 million as of July 1, 2018.
For these contracts, the Company recognizes revenue over time as control of the goods transfers through the manufacturing process, rather than when the goods are delivered, title has transferred, and the risks and rewards of ownership are passed to the customer, as under previous revenue recognition guidance.
The Company adopted this standard effective the first quarter of fiscal year 2019, which required changes to the classification of net periodic pension costs in the consolidated statements of operations for all periods presented.
In August 2017, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update 2017-12, Derivatives and Hedging (Topic 815) - Targeted Improvements to Accounting for Hedging Activities (“ASU 2017-12”), which improves the financial reporting of hedging relationships to better portray the economic results of an entity’s risk management activities in its financial statements and makes certain targeted improvements to simplify the qualification and application of hedge accounting compared to current GAAP.
