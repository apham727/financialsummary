Included in the gain on sale recorded upon completion of the sale were estimates for certain income taxes due on the gain and additional cash consideration expected from the Buyer related to a closing date net working capital sales price adjustment (the “closing date adjustment”).
The Company is finalizing the closing date adjustment with the Buyer as provided for in the sales agreement and has included an estimate of this amount as primary component of the $305.1 million of prepaid and other current assets as of March 31, 2018.
The impact of any changes in estimated income taxes on the gain will be recorded as an adjustment to the gain on sale from discontinued operations in the period such change in estimate occurs.
The Company currently expects the closing date adjustment to be finalized by the first half of fiscal 2019 and the income tax on the gain to be finalized by the end of fiscal 2019.Sales for the third quarter of fiscal 2018 were $4.80 billion, an increase of 8.0% from sales for the third quarter of fiscal 2017 of $4.44 billion.

The following table presents reported and organic sales growth rates between fiscal 2018 and fiscal 2017 for the third quarters and first nine months of fiscal 2018.
Sales for the third quarter of fiscal 2018 were $4.80 billion, an increase of 8.0%, or $353.2 million, from the prior year third quarter sales of $4.44 billion.

PF sales for the third quarter of fiscal 2018 were $391.0 million, an increase of $40.0 million or 11.4% from the prior year third quarter sales of $351.0 million driven by growth in all three regions including the benefit from the weakening U.S. Dollar.As a result primarily of certain former manufacturing operations, Avnet has incurred and may have future liability under various federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations, including those governing pollution and exposure to, and the handling, storage and disposal of, hazardous substances.
