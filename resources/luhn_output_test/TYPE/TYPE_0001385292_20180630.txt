In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board, or FASB, and the International Accounting Standards Board jointly issued ASU 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606) (ASC 606), which outlines a comprehensive five-step revenue recognition model based on a principle that replaces virtually all existing revenue recognition rules under U.S. GAAP and which requires revenue to be recognized in a manner to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to a customer at an amount that reflects the consideration expected to be received in exchange for those goods or services.
ASU 2014-09 also provided the guidance in ASC Topic 340, Other Assets and Deferred CostsContracts with Customers (Subtopic 340-40), which includes criteria for the capitalization and amortization of certain contract acquisition and fulfillment costs.For the three months ended June 30, 2018 and 2017, revenue from customers outside the United States comprised 55.4% and 53.7%, respectively, of our total revenue.
For the six months ended June 30, 2018 and 2017, revenue from customers outside the United States comprised 55.7% and 57.7%, respectively, of our total revenue.
For the three months ended June 30, 2018 and 2017, our top ten licensees by revenue, most of which are OEM customers, accounted for approximately 23.8% and 29.3% of total revenue, respectively.
For the six months ended June 30, 2018 and 2017, our top ten licensees by revenue accounted for approximately 22.2% and 30.0% of total revenue, respectively.
License revenue increased primarily due to the growth in sales to enterprise customers, including the launch of our Mosaic product offering.
This growth was partially offset by decreases due to certain one-time printer revenue recognized in the second quarter of 2017, as a result of conversion of customers to fixed fee contracts from royalty bearing contracts.
In addition, our royalty based revenue is lower in the three months ended June 30, 2018, as a result of the adoption of ASC 606.
Creative Professional revenue increased $7.8 million, or 25.4%, to $38.4 million for the three months ended June 30, 2018, as compared to $30.6 million for the three months ended June 30, 2017, mainly due to growth in sales to enterprise customers, including our new Mosaic solution, and increased service revenue as SaaS offerings continue to become a larger part of our portfolio.
OEM revenue decreased $4.9 million, or 18.0%, to $22.3 million for the three months ended June 30, 2018, from $27.2 million for the three months ended June 30, 2017.Credit evaluations are performed on an ongoing basis to reduce credit risk, and no collateral is required from our customers.This future international revenue will depend on the continued use and expansion of our type and technologies, including the licensing of our solutions worldwide.
