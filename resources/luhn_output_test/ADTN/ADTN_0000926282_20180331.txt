ASU 2016-02 requires an entity to recognize lease assets and lease liabilities on the balance sheet and to disclose key information about the entity's leasing arrangements.
The two primary areas of impact of these ASUs were network implementation service revenue performance obligations and contract costs.
The primary impact will be accelerated revenue recognition for certain performance obligations related to service revenue arrangements that were previously deferred until customer acceptance and capitalization and amortization of incremental costs of obtaining a contract as described below.
In connection with the adoption of the new revenue standard, effective January 1, 2018, we adopted ASC 340-40, Other Assets and Deferred Costs - Contracts with Customers, with respect to capitalization and amortization of incremental costs of obtaining a contract.
The primary impact was capitalization of certain sales commissions for our extended maintenance and support contracts in excess of one year and amortization of those costs over the period that the related revenue is recognized.
We recorded a bargain purchase gain of $11.3 million during the first quarter of 2018, net of income taxes, which is subject to customary working capital adjustments between the parties.Our operating income margin decreased to (22.1)% for the three months ended March 31, 2018, from 4.1% for the three months ended March 31, 2017.
Net income (loss) was $(10.8) million for the three months ended March 31, 2018, compared to $6.7 million for the three months ended March 31, 2017.
Our effective tax rate, excluding the effect of the bargain purchase gain in 2018, decreased to 15.1% for the three months ended March 31, 2018, from 20.3% for the three months ended March 31, 2017.
We have recently announced receipt of a new nationwide award in the APAC region, as well as additional awards based on new ADTRAN technologies in the EMEA region that we believe will likely result in a positive impact to our revenues.
As a percentage of sales, cost of sales increased from 56.7% in the three months ended March 31, 2017 to 67.1% in the three months ended March 31, 2018.
The increase in cost of sales as a percentage of sales for the three months ended March 31, 2018 is primarily attributable to a regional revenue shift, customer and product mix, services and support mix, an increase in labor expense due to a restructuring program, an increase in warranty expense due to a settlement in Q1 2017 with a third party supplier for a defective component and purchase discounts received from a contract manufacturer in Q1 2017.Although these depository investments may exceed government insured depository limits, we have evaluated the credit worthiness of these financial institutions, and determined the risk of material financial loss due to exposure of such credit risk to be minimal.
