Leidos is a FORTUNE 500® science, engineering and information technology company that provides services and solutions in the defense, intelligence, civil and health markets. Leidos' international customers include foreign governments and their agencies, primarily located in Australia and the United Kingdom. Unless indicated otherwise, references to the "Company," "we," "us" and "our" refer collectively to Leidos Holdings, Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries. The Company operates in three reportable segments; Defense Solutions, Civil and Health. As a result, Leidos increased its controlling ownership in MSA from 47% to 88% effective January 26, 2018. The Company has consolidated the financial results for MSA into its unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements. The consolidated balances of the Company’s VIE are not material to the Company’s unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements for the periods presented. Intercompany accounts and transactions between consolidated companies have been eliminated in consolidation. Certain disclosures normally included in financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP have been condensed or omitted pursuant to such rules. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingencies at the date of the financial statements, as well as the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. Management evaluates these estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis, including those relating to estimated profitability of long-term contracts, indirect billing rates, allowances for doubtful accounts, inventories, fair value and impairment of intangible assets and goodwill, income taxes, stock-based compensation expense and contingencies. These estimates have been prepared by management on the basis of the most current and best available information; however, actual results could differ materially from those estimates.In the opinion of management, the accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements reflect all adjustments, which consist of normal recurring adjustments, necessary for a fair presentation thereof. The results reported in these unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for the entire year. These unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K filed on February 23, 2018.Certain amounts in the prior year financial statements have been reclassified to conform to the current year presentation. Effective beginning of fiscal 2018, the Company established a new CAS structure and revised its disclosure statements accordingly to reflect the related cost accounting practice changes. Consequently, $37 million was reclassified from "Cost of revenues" to "Selling, general and administrative expenses" on the condensed consolidated statement of income for the quarter ended March 31, 2017. The core principle of ASC 606 is that an entity should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of control for promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. ASC 606 further requires that companies disclose sufficient information to enable users of financial statements to understand the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from contracts with customers. ASC 606 provides companies an option of two transition methods, the full retrospective method, in which case the standard would be applied to each prior reporting period presented and the cumulative effect of applying the standard would be recognized at the earliest period shown, or the modified retrospective method, in which case the cumulative effect of applying the standard would be recognized at the date of initial application. The ASU is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017. The guidance was not applied to contracts that were complete at December 30, 2017, and the comparative information for the prior fiscal year has not been retrospectively adjusted. The adoption of ASC 606 did not have a material impact on the Company's condensed consolidated financial statements. The Company recorded a $1 million decrease to its beginning accumulated deficit as the cumulative impact of adoption of the new revenue standard. The primary impact of the new standard was on certain of the Company’s units-of-delivery contracts, on which the Company previously recognized revenue at a point in time and under ASC 606 are recognized using an over-time model. The adoption of ASC 606 did not have a significant impact on the Company’s revenue recognition policy as revenues on the substantial majority of the Company's contracts continue to be recognized over time. In adopting ASC 606, the Company elected to use certain practical expedients permitted by the standard including using the portfolio approach where contracts with similar characteristics were assessed collectively to evaluate risk over the impact of ASC 606. The ASU is effective for public companies for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2018, and should be applied on a modified retrospective basis. Early adoption is permitted. This ASU is effective for all entities for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2018, and should be applied either in the period of adoption or retrospectively to each period in which the effect of the change in the U.S. federal corporate income tax rate in the Tax Act is recognized. Early adoption is permitted. The update is effective for public companies for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2018, and should be adopted under the modified retrospective approach. Early adoption is permitted. The Company is in the process of evaluating the provisions of ASU 2016-02 and its impact on the Company's condensed consolidated financial position, results of operations and cash flows.Note 3–Significant Accounting PoliciesRevenue RecognitionThe Company's revenues from contracts with customers are from offerings including cybersecurity; data analytics; enterprise IT modernization; operations and logistics; sensors, collection and phenomenology; software development; and systems engineering, primarily with the U.S. government and its agencies. The Company also serves various state and local governments, foreign governments and U.S. commercial customers. In addition, the Company assesses contract modifications to determine whether the changes to existing contracts should be accounted for as part of the original contract or as a separate contract. Contract modifications for the Company generally relate to changes in contract specifications and requirements and do not add distinct services, and therefore are accounted for as part of the original contract. If contract modifications add distinct goods or services and increase the contract value by the standalone selling price, those modifications are accounted for as separate contracts.Most of the Company's contracts comprise multiple promises including the design and build of software-based systems, integration of hardware and software solutions, running and maintaining of IT infrastructure and procurement services. In all cases, the Company assesses if the multiple promises should be accounted for as separate performance obligations or combined into a single performance obligation. The Company generally separates multiple promises in a contract as separate performance obligations if those promises are distinct, both individually and in the context of the contract. The FAR provides guidance on types of costs that are allowable in establishing prices for goods and services provided to the U.S. government and its agencies. Each contract is competitively priced and bid separately. Pricing for non-U.S. government agencies and commercial customers is based on specific negotiations with each customer. The Company excludes any taxes collected or imposed when determining the transaction price.Certain of the Company's cost-plus and fixed-price contracts contain award fees, incentive fees or other provisions that may either increase or decrease the transaction price. These variable amounts generally are awarded upon achievement of certain performance metrics, program milestones or cost targets and can be based upon customer discretion. The Company estimates variable consideration at the most probable amount that it expects to be entitled to based on the assessment of the contractual variable fee criteria, complexity of work and related risks, extent of customer discretion, amount of variable consideration received historically and the potential of significant reversal of revenue.The Company allocates the transaction price of a contract to its performance obligations in the proportion of its respective standalone selling prices. The standalone selling price of the Company's performance obligations is generally based on an expected cost-plus margin approach, in accordance with the FAR. For certain product sales, the Company uses prices from other standalone sales. Substantially none of the Company's contracts contain a significant financing component, which would require an adjustment to the transaction price of the contract.The Company recognizes revenue on its services contracts primarily over time as there is continuous transfer of control to the customer over the duration of the contract as the Company performs the promised services. For U.S. government contracts, continuous transfer of control to the customer is evidenced by clauses in the contract that allow the customer to unilaterally terminate the contract for convenience, pay for costs incurred plus a reasonable profit and take control of any work-in-process. Similarly, for non-U.S. government contracts, the customer typically controls the work-in-process as evidenced by rights to payment for work performed to date plus a reasonable profit to deliver products or services that do not have an alternate use to the Company. A performance obligation's EAC includes all direct costs such as materials, labor, sub-contract costs, overhead, and a ratable portion of general and administrative costs. For certain performance obligations, the Company is not primarily responsible for fulfilling the promise to provide the goods or service to the customer, does not have inventory risk and does not have discretion in establishing the price for the good or service. In such cases, the Company recognizes revenue on a net basis.Contract costs generally include direct costs such as materials, labor, subcontract costs, and indirect costs identifiable with or allocable to a specific contract. Costs are expensed as incurred except for costs incurred during the transition phase of a new contract, which are capitalized and amortized on a straight-line basis over the expected life of that contract. The Company does not incur significant incremental costs to acquire contracts. The change in estimates primarily relate to revision of variable consideration including award fees and revisions to estimates at completion adjustments resulting from change in contract scope or due to true-up of contract estimates at the end of contract performance.Cash and Cash EquivalentsThe Company's cash equivalents are primarily comprised of investments in several large institutional money market funds and bank deposits, with original maturity of three months or less. The Company includes outstanding payments within "Cash and cash equivalents" and correspondingly increases "Accounts payable and accrued liabilities" on the condensed consolidated balance sheets. At March 30, 2018, and December 29, 2017, the Company included $124 million and $169 million, respectively, of outstanding payments within "Cash and cash equivalents. Amounts billable and unbilled amounts are recognized at estimated realizable value and consist of costs and fees, substantially all of which are expected to be billed and collected generally within one year. Unbilled amounts also include rate variances that are billable upon negotiation of final indirect rates with the DCAA. FFP contracts are billed either based on milestones, which are the achievement of specific events as defined in the contract, or based on progress payments, which are interim payments up to a designated amount of costs incurred as work progresses. These withheld amounts are included within the Company’s unbilled receivables and are billed upon contract completion or the occurrence of a specified event, and when negotiation of final indirect rates with the U.S. government is complete. Based on the Company's historical experience, the write-offs of retention balances have not been significant. When events or conditions indicate that amounts outstanding from customers may become uncollectible, an allowance is estimated and recorded. These categories represent how the nature, timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows are affected by the U.S. government procurement environment. Revenue from the U.S. government can be adversely impacted by spending caps or changes in budgetary priorities of the U.S. government, as well as delays in program start dates or the award of a contract. International transactions can also involve increased financial and legal risks arising from foreign exchange variability, imposition of tariffs or additional taxes and restrictive trade policies, and delays or failure to collect amounts due to differing legal systems.Note 5–Contract Assets and LiabilitiesContract assets include unbilled receivables, which is the amount of revenue recognized that exceeds the amount billed to the customer, and right to payment is not just subject to the passage of time. Contract assets also include transition costs and project assets where under certain services contracts, costs are incurred, usually at the beginning of the contract performance, to transition the services, employees and equipment from the customer or assets capitalized for specific contracts where delivery has not yet occurred. Contract liabilities consist of deferred revenue. The increase also relates to project assets on certain contracts. The increase in "Contract liabilities- current" was primarily due to advance payments received on a certain contract.During the quarter ended March 30, 2018, the Company recognized revenue of $55 million relating to amounts that were included as a contract liability at December 30, 2017.During the quarter ended March 30, 2018, the Company recognized $3 million of amortization related to its transition costs and project assets. The Note is payable semi-annually with a final lump sum due in July 2018. The Company collected $6 million of principal and interest during the quarter ended March 31, 2017. During the quarter ended June 30, 2017, Plainfield exercised the first of three one-year term extension options available under the original credit agreement, thereby extending the maturity date of the Note to July 24, 2018. Concurrent with this extension, the interest rate on the Note increased from 6% to 8%. Also, during the quarter ended June 30, 2017, Leidos and Plainfield entered into an amendment to the Note allowing Plainfield to defer up to $4 million of the interest and principal payments due in July 2017 and January 2018 until July 2018. The proposed Plan envisions raising new equity combined with reduction of Plainfield's debt. The net realizable value of the Note, at December 29, 2017, was estimated to be approximately $40 million, compared to its carrying value of $73 million, including accrued interest. As a result, the Company recorded a $33 million impairment of its Note during the quarter ended December 29, 2017, which was presented within "Other income, net" in the Company's condensed consolidated statements of income.On February 28, 2018, Leidos and Plainfield entered into an amendment to the Note, allowing Plainfield to defer the principal and accrued interest payments due until the earlier of April 28, 2018, or the date Plainfield successfully closes on a refinancing agreement with a third party. These restructuring expenses have been recorded within Corporate and presented separately on the condensed consolidated statements of income. The accounting guidance for fair value measurements requires that the Company maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs in determining fair value. The accounting guidance provides for the irrevocable option to elect, on a contract-by-contract basis, to measure certain financial assets and liabilities at fair value at inception of the contract and record any subsequent changes in fair value in earnings. The Company has not made fair value option elections on any of its financial assets and liabilities. The carrying amounts of the Company’s financial instruments, other than derivatives, which include cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable and accrued expenses, are reasonable estimates of their related fair values. Program and contract intangible assets are amortized over their respective estimated useful lives in proportion to the pattern of economic benefit based on expected future discounted cash flows. Customer relationships and backlog intangible assets are amortized on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives. Software and technology intangible assets, are amortized either on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives or over their respective estimated useful lives in proportion to the pattern of economic benefit based on expected future discounted cash flows, as deemed appropriate. During the quarter ended March 30, 2018, the Company determined that the carrying amount of a real estate property may not be recoverable and as a result recorded an impairment charge of $7 million, which was recorded within Corporate.Note 13–Derivative InstrumentsThe Company manages its risk to changes in interest rates through the use of derivative instruments. The Company does not hold derivative instruments for trading or speculative purposes. For fixed rate borrowings, the Company uses variable interest rate swaps, effectively converting fixed rate borrowings to variable rate borrowings. These swaps are designated as fair value hedges. For variable rate borrowings, the Company uses fixed interest rate swaps, effectively converting a portion of the variable interest rate payments to fixed interest rate payments. Under the terms of the interest rate swap agreements, the Company will receive semi-annual interest payments at the coupon rate of 4.45% and will pay variable interest based on the six-month LIBOR rate.The interest rate swaps were accounted for as a fair value hedge of the Notes and qualified for the shortcut method of hedge accounting, which allows for the assumption of no ineffectiveness reported in earnings. The fair value of the Notes is stated at an amount that reflects changes in the six-month LIBOR rate subsequent to the inception of the interest rate swaps through the reporting date. The objective of these instruments is to reduce variability in the forecasted interest payments of the Company's Variable Rate Loans, which are based on the LIBOR rate. Under the terms of the interest rate swap agreements, the Company will receive monthly variable interest payments based on the one-month LIBOR rate and will pay interest at a fixed rate. In February 2018, the Company entered into interest rate swap agreements to hedge the cash flows of an additional $250 million of its Variable Rate Loans. The interest rate swap agreements on $1.1 billion of the Company's Variable Rate Loans have a maturity date of December 2021 and a fixed interest rate of 1.08%. The interest rate swap agreements on $300 million and $250 million of the Company's Variable Rate Loans both have a maturity date of August 2022 and a fixed interest rate of 1.66% and 2.59%, respectively. The interest rate swap transactions were accounted for as cash flow hedges. As a result of the Company's adoption of ASU 2017-12 in the quarter ended March 30, 2018, a qualitative assessment of hedge effectiveness will be performed on a quarterly basis, unless facts and circumstances indicate the hedge may no longer be highly effective. As a result, the margin on Term Loan B was reduced by 25 basis points to 1.75%. The repricing of the term loan became effective March 15, 2018.The interest rate on the Company's senior secured term loans is determined based on the LIBOR rate plus a margin. The margin for the Term Loan A loans ranges from 1.50% to 2.00%, depending on the Company's senior secured leverage ratio, and is computed on a quarterly basis. The maturity date of this credit facility is August 2022. As of March 30, 2018, and December 29, 2017, there were no borrowings outstanding under the credit facility. The senior secured term loans and notes, unsecured notes and revolving credit facility are fully and unconditionally guaranteed and contain certain customary restrictive covenants, including among other things, restrictions on the Company's ability to create liens and enter into sale and leaseback transactions under certain circumstances. However, the Company was able to make reasonable estimates and has recorded provisional amounts. The Company expects to finalize its assessment of all provisional amounts within the allowed one-year measurement period. There are no material elements of the Tax Act for which the Company was unable to make a reasonable estimate. The Company made no changes to fiscal 2017 provisional amounts during the quarter ended March 30, 2018.For the quarter ended March 30, 2018, the effective tax rate was 18.4% compared to 31.5% for the quarter ended March 31, 2017. As a result, "Interest expense, net," "Other income, net" and "Income tax expense," as reported in the condensed consolidated financial statements are not allocated to the Company's segments. Under U.S. Government Cost Accounting Standards, indirect costs including depreciation expense are collected in numerous indirect cost pools, which are then collectively allocated out to the Company’s reportable segments based on a representative causal or beneficial relationship of the costs in the pool to the costs in the base. As such, the company does not separately disclose depreciation on the condensed consolidated statements of income.Asset information by segment is not a key measure of performance used by the CODM. Subsequent to the contracting officer's final decision, MSA, LMSI, and Lockheed Martin Corporation received notice from the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Eastern District of Washington that the U.S. government had initiated a False Claims Act investigation into the facts surrounding this dispute, and each of MSA, LMSI and Lockheed Martin Corporation have produced information in response to Civil Investigative Demands from the U.S. Attorney's Office. MSA filed an appeal of the contracting officer's decision with the Civilian Board of Contract Appeals and that appeal is pending, but has been stayed pending resolution of the False Claims Act investigation. Subsequent to the filing of MSA's appeal, the contracting officer demanded that MSA reimburse the DoE in the amount of $64 million, which was his estimate of the profits earned during the period from 2010 to 2014 by LMSI. The DoE has deferred that demand, pending resolution of the appeal, but to date the demand has not been rescinded. MSA and the other members of MSA have indicated that they believe if MSA incurs a liability in this matter, then Leidos Integrated Technology, LLC is responsible to MSA for the loss. Under the terms of the Separation Agreement, Lockheed Martin has agreed to indemnify the Company for 100% of any damages in excess of $38 million up to $64 million, and 50% of any damages in excess of $64 million, with respect to claims asserted against MSA related to this matter. The plaintiffs sought to recover from the Company and the individual defendants an unspecified amount of damages class members allegedly incurred by buying Leidos' stock at an inflated price. The District Court dismissed the plaintiffs' claims with prejudice and without leave to replead. The plaintiffs then appealed to the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, which issued an opinion affirming in part, and vacating in part, the District Court's ruling. The Company filed a petition for a writ of certiorari in the U.S. Supreme Court, which was granted on March 27, 2017. The District Court granted the Company's request to stay all proceedings, including discovery, pending the outcome at the Supreme Court. In September 2017, the parties engaged in mediation resulting in an agreement to settle all remaining claims for an immaterial amount to be paid by the Company. The amounts payable by the Company are covered by an insurance policy. The terms of the proposed settlement remain subject to court approval, which is expected to occur in the first half of 2018.Greek Government Contract In 2003, the Company entered into an FFP contract with the Hellenic Republic of Greece to provide a Command, Control, Communications, Coordination and Integration System. The Greek government disputed the contract balance owed to the Company and has not paid the Company's final invoice. In 2013, the Company received an arbitral award by the International Chamber of Commerce for €39 million or $48 million, which has not been satisfied. In January 2017, the U.S. District Court granted an order to enforce the arbitration award and entered judgment in the Company's favor, converting the award to U.S. dollars in the amount of $63 million. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit subsequently ruled that the district court judgment should instead reflect the currency in which it was originally awarded. Separately, the Greek government sought to annul the award through separate litigation in the Greek courts; however, on July 27, 2017, the Athens Court of Appeals issued a decision rejecting the government's position. Based on the complex nature of this contractual situation and the difficulties encountered to date, significant uncertainties exist and the Company is unable to reliably estimate the ultimate outcome. The court found that Apple willfully infringed the VirnetX patents at issue in the Apple I case and awarded enhanced damages, bringing the total award against Apple to over $343 million in pre-interest damages. Apple has filed an appeal of the judgment in the Apple I case with the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit. On April 10, 2018, a jury trial concluded in an additional patent infringement case brought by VirnetX against Apple, referred to as the Apple II case, in which the jury returned a verdict against Apple for infringement and awarded VirnetX damages in the amount of over $502 million. On April 11, 2018, in a second phase of the Apple II trial, the jury found Apple’s infringement to be willful. However, the verdicts in these cases remain subject to appeal. Thus, no assurances can be given when or if the Company will receive any proceeds in connection with these jury awards. In addition, if the Company receives any proceeds, the Company is required to pay a royalty to the customer who paid for the development of the technology. The Company does not have any assets or liabilities recorded in connection with this matter as of March 30, 2018.Government Investigations and ReviewsThe Company is routinely subject to investigations and reviews relating to compliance with various laws and regulations with respect to its role as a contractor to federal, state and local government customers and in connection with performing services in countries outside of the United States. Adverse findings could have a material effect on the Company's business, financial position, results of operations and cash flows due to its reliance on government contracts.Indirect cost audits by the DCAA remain open for fiscal 2012 and subsequent years for the Company. Although the Company has recorded contract revenues based upon an estimate of costs that the Company believes will be approved upon final audit or review, the Company cannot predict the outcome of any ongoing or future audits or reviews and adjustments, and if future adjustments exceed the Company's estimates, its profitability may be adversely affected. As of March 30, 2018, the Company believes it has adequately reserved for potential adjustments from audits or reviews of contract costs.Note 21–CommitmentsThe Company has outstanding letters of credit of $93 million as of March 30, 2018, principally related to performance guarantees on contracts. The Company also has outstanding surety bonds with net exposure of $137 million, principally related to performance and subcontractor payment bonds on the Company's contracts. The outstanding letters of credit and surety bonds have various terms with the majority expiring over the next four fiscal years.On January 24, 2018, the Company entered into a lease agreement with its current lessor for office space in a building to be constructed which will function as the Company's new corporate headquarters in Reston, Virginia. The Company will occupy the space for an initial term of 148 months and rent expense will be $11 million for the first lease year, with an annual rent expense increase of 2.5%. The prepayment was a result of the annual excess cash flow calculation clause in the Company's credit agreements. On April 27, 2018, Leidos and Plainfield entered into an amendment to the Note, allowing Plainfield to defer the principal and accrued interest payments due until the earlier of May 31, 2018, or the date Plainfield successfully closes on a refinancing agreement with a third party. 26Table of ContentsLEIDOS HOLDINGS, INC.Item 2. The following discussion contains forward-looking statements, including statements regarding our intent, belief, or current expectations with respect to, among other things, trends affecting our financial condition or results of operations, backlog, integration costs, restructuring expenses and activities, our industry and government budgets and spending. Such statements are not guarantees of future performance and involve risks and uncertainties, and actual results may differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements as a result of various factors. Some of these factors include, but are not limited to, the risk factors set forth in our Annual Report on Form 10-K, as updated periodically through our subsequent quarterly reports on Form 10-Q. Due to such uncertainties and risks, you are cautioned not to place undue reliance on such forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date hereof. We do not undertake any obligation to update these factors or to publicly announce the results of any changes to our forward-looking statements due to future events or developments.Unless indicated otherwise, references in this report to the "Company," "we," "us" and "our" refer collectively to Leidos and its consolidated subsidiaries. OverviewWe are a FORTUNE 500® science, engineering and information technology company that provides services and solutions in the defense, intelligence, civil and health markets. Government MarketsDuring the quarter ended March 30, 2018, we generated approximately 85% of our total revenues from contracts with the U.S. government. All 12 Appropriation bills were funded and no federal department or agency is now operating under a continuing resolution. The budget legislation passed earlier in the year suspended budget caps and included a two-year budget agreement that provides $300 billion in sequestration relief for defense and non-defense spending. Defense programs will see additional funding of $80 billion and $85 billion in GFY 2018 and GFY 2019, respectively, and non-defense spending will increase by $63 billion and $68 billion in GFY 2018 and GFY 2019, respectively, over the caps established in the Budget Control Act of 2011. The legislation also suspends the debt ceiling until March 2019. Congress is now addressing GFY 2019 spending and the passage of all 12 Appropriation bills for the year beginning October 1, 2018.International MarketsSales to customers in international markets represented approximately 10% of total revenues for the quarter ended March 30, 2018. Our international customers include foreign governments and their agencies, primarily located in the United Kingdom and Australia. We recognized restructuring expenses of $6 million and $13 million during the three months ended March 30, 2018, and March 31, 2017, respectively, related to this program. We anticipate this restructuring program to last through fiscal 2024 and expect to incur a total of approximately $85 million in connection with these restructuring activities.Key Performance MeasuresThe primary financial performance measures we use to manage our business and monitor results of operations are revenue, operating income, cash flows from operations and diluted EPS. We calculate revenues on a constant currency basis by translating current period revenue using the comparable period's foreign currency exchange rates. This calculation is performed for all subsidiaries where the functional currency is not the U.S. dollar.28Table of ContentsLEIDOS HOLDINGS, INC.The decrease in revenues for the three months ended March 30, 2018, as compared to the three months ended March 31, 2017, was primarily attributable to timing of revenue recognition on certain contracts, the completion of certain contracts and net volume decreases, partially offset by revenues from new awards.The increase in operating income for the three months ended March 30, 2018, as compared to the three months ended March 31, 2017, was due to net profit write-downs in the prior year quarter and stronger program performance in the current year quarter. This was partially offset by lower acquisition and integration costs of $8 million and restructuring expenses of $7 million.Non-Operating Expense, netNon-operating expense, net of $34 million for the three months ended March 30, 2018, was consistent as compared to $33 million for the three months ended March 31, 2017.29Table of ContentsLEIDOS HOLDINGS, INC.Provision for Income TaxesFor the three months ended March 30, 2018, our effective tax rate was 18.4% compared to 31.5% for the three months ended March 31, 2017. Backlog estimates are subject to change and may be affected by factors including modifications of contracts and foreign currency movements. In addition, we have a secured revolving credit facility which can provide up to $750 million in additional borrowing, if required. During the three months ended March 30, 2018, there were no borrowings outstanding under the credit facility and we were in compliance with related financial covenants.At March 30, 2018, and December 29, 2017, we had outstanding debt of $3.1 billion. During the three months ended March 30, 2018, and March 31, 2017, we made $15 million and $20 million, respectively, of required quarterly payments on our senior secured term loans. The notes outstanding as of March 30, 2018, contain financial covenants and customary restrictive covenants. We were in compliance with all covenants as of March 30, 2018. We paid dividends of $52 million and $50 million during the three months ended March 30, 2018, and March 31, 2017, respectively.For the next 12 months, we anticipate that we will be able to meet our liquidity needs, including servicing our debt, through cash generated from operations, available cash balances and, if needed, borrowings from our revolving credit facility. We also have letters of credit outstanding principally related to performance guarantees on contracts and surety bonds outstanding principally related to performance and payment bonds as described in "Note 21–Commitments" of the notes to the condensed consolidated financial statements contained within this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. These arrangements have not had, and management does not believe it is likely that they will in the future have, a material effect on our liquidity, capital resources, operations or financial condition. Commitments and ContingenciesWe are subject to a number of reviews, investigations, claims, lawsuits, other uncertainties and future obligations related to our business. For a discussion of these items, see "Note 20–Contingencies" and "Note 21–Commitments" of the notes to the condensed consolidated financial statements contained within this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.Critical Accounting PoliciesThere were no material changes to our critical accounting policies, estimates or judgments, other than our revenue recognition policy, that occurred in the quarterly period covered by this report from those discussed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 29, 2017.Revenue RecognitionOur revenues from contracts with customers are from offerings including cybersecurity; data analytics; enterprise IT modernization; operations and logistics; sensors, collection and phenomenology; software development; and systems engineering, primarily with the U.S. government and its agencies. We also serve various state and local governments, foreign governments and U.S. commercial customers. In addition, we assess contract modifications to determine whether the changes to existing contracts should be accounted for as part of the original contract or as a separate contract. Contract modifications for us generally relate to changes in contract specifications and requirements and do not add distinct services, and therefore are accounted for as part of the original contract. If contract modifications add distinct goods or services and increase the contract value by the standalone selling price, those modifications are accounted for as separate contracts.Most of our contracts comprise multiple promises including the design and build of software-based systems, integration of hardware and software solutions, running and maintaining of IT infrastructure and procurement services. In all cases, we assess if the multiple promises should be accounted for as separate performance obligations or combined into a single performance obligation. We generally separate multiple promises in a contract as separate performance obligations if those promises are distinct, both individually and in the context of the contract. The FAR provides guidance on types of costs that are allowable in establishing prices for goods and services provided to the U.S. government and its agencies. Each contract is competitively priced and bid separately. Pricing for non-U.S. government agencies and commercial customers is based on specific negotiations with each customer. We exclude any taxes collected or imposed when determining the transaction price.Certain of our cost-plus and fixed-price contracts contain award fees, incentive fees or other provisions that may either increase or decrease the transaction price. These variable amounts generally are awarded upon achievement of certain performance metrics, program milestones or cost targets and can be based upon customer discretion. We estimate variable consideration at the most probable amount that it expects to be entitled to based on the assessment of the contractual variable fee criteria, complexity of work and related risks, extent of customer discretion, amount of variable consideration received historically and the potential of significant reversal of revenue.We allocate the transaction price of a contract to our performance obligations in the proportion of its respective standalone selling prices. The standalone selling price of our performance obligations is generally based on an expected cost-plus margin approach, in accordance with the FAR. For certain product sales, we use prices from other standalone sales. Substantially none of our contracts contain a significant financing component, which would require an adjustment to the transaction price of the contract.We recognize revenue on our services contracts primarily over time as there is continuous transfer of control to the customer over the duration of the contract as we perform the promised services. For U.S. government contracts, continuous transfer of control to the customer is evidenced by clauses in the contract that allow the customer to unilaterally terminate the contract for convenience, pay for costs incurred plus a reasonable profit and take control of any work-in-process. Similarly, for non-U.S. government contracts, the customer typically controls the work-in-process as evidenced by rights to payment for work performed to date plus a reasonable profit to deliver products or services that do not have an alternate use to us. A performance obligation's EAC includes all direct costs such as materials, labor, sub-contract costs, overhead, and a ratable portion of general and administrative costs. For certain performance obligations, we are not primarily responsible for fulfilling the promise to provide the goods or service to the customer, does not have inventory risk and does not have discretion in establishing the price for the good or service. In such cases, we recognize revenue on a net basis.Contract costs generally include direct costs such as materials, labor, subcontract costs, and indirect costs identifiable with or allocable to a specific contract. Costs are expensed as incurred except for costs incurred during the transition phase of a new contract, which are capitalized and amortized on a straight-line basis over the expected life of that contract. We do not incur significant incremental costs to acquire contracts.
