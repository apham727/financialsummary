BASIS OF PRESENTATION AND SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIESBasis of Presentation — The accompanying unaudited consolidated financial statements have been prepared by IPG Photonics Corporation, or "IPG", "its" or the "Company". The consolidated financial statements include the Company's accounts and those of its subsidiaries. All intercompany balances have been eliminated in consolidation. These consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2017.In the opinion of the Company's management, the unaudited financial information for the interim periods presented reflects all adjustments necessary for a fair presentation of the Company's financial position, results of operations and cash flows. The results reported in these consolidated financial statements are not necessarily indicative of results that may be expected for the entire year.The Company has evaluated subsequent events through the time of filing this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q with the SEC. Revenue Recognition — Revenue is recognized when transfer of control to the customer occurs in an amount reflecting the consideration that the Company expects to be entitled. For each contract, the Company considers the promise to transfer products, each of which is distinct as the identified performance obligations. In determining the transaction price, the Company evaluates whether the price is subject to refund or adjustment to determine the net consideration to which the Company expects to be entitled. As the Company's standard payment terms are less than one year, the Company has elected the practical expedient under ASC 606-10-32-18 to not assess whether a contract has a significant financing component. The Company allocates the transaction price to each distinct product based on its relative standalone selling price. The Company allocates the transaction price of the contract to each delivery based on the product standalone selling price. The Company invoices for each scheduled delivery upon shipment and recognizes revenues for such delivery at that point, assuming transfer of control has occurred. As scheduled delivery dates are generally within 1 year, under the optional exemption provided by ASC 606-10-50-14 revenues allocated to future shipments of partially completed contracts are not disclosed.Rights of return generally are not included in customer contracts. Accordingly, upon application of steps one through five above, product revenue is recognized upon shipment and transfer of control. Returns are infrequent and are recorded as a reduction of revenue.In certain subsidiaries the Company provides sales commissions to sales representatives based on sales volume. The Company has determined that the incentive portion of its sales commissions qualify as contract costs. The Company has elected the practical expedient in ASC 340-40-25-4 to expense sales commissions when incurred as the amortization period of the asset that would otherwise have been recognized is one year or less.Revenue Recognition at a Point in Time — Revenues recognized at a point in time consist primarily of product, installation and service sales. The Company recognizes revenue for laser and spare part sales following the transfer of control of such products to the customer, which typically occurs upon shipment or delivery depending on the terms of the underlying contracts. Installation revenue is recognized upon completion of the installation service, which typically occurs within 90 days of delivery. For laser systems that carry customer specific processing requirements, revenue is recognized at the latter of customer acceptance date or shipment date if the customer acceptance is made prior to shipment. Warranties are limited and provide that the product meets specifications and is free from defects in materials and workmanship. Extended warranties are sold separately from products and represent a distinct performance obligation. Revenue related to the performance obligation for extended warranties is recognized over time as the customer simultaneously receives and consumes the benefits provided by the Company. The customer receives the assurance that the product will operate in accordance with agreed-upon specifications evenly during the extended warranty period regardless of whether they make a claim during that period, and therefore, revenue at time of sale is deferred and recognized over the time period of the extended warranty period.Customer Deposits and Deferred Revenue — When the Company receives consideration from a customer or such consideration is unconditionally due prior to transferring goods or services under the terms of a sales contract, the Company records customer deposits or deferred revenue, which represent contract liabilities. The Company recognizes deferred revenue as net sales after control of the goods or services has been transferred to the customer and all revenue recognition criteria are met.Reclassifications — Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform with current period presentation. These reclassifications had no effect on the reported results of operations. 2. RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTSAdopted Pronouncements — On January 1, 2018, the Company adopted ASC 606 and all related amendments using the modified retrospective method for contracts that were not completed as of the date of initial application. The Company recognized the cumulative effect of initially applying the new revenue standard as an adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings. The comparative information has not been restated and continues to be reported under the accounting standards in effect for those periods. The Company expects the impact of the adoption of the new standard to be immaterial to net income on an ongoing basis.A majority of revenue continues to be recognized at a point in time when control transfers based on the terms of underlying contact. Under the new revenue standard, the Company changed from deferring revenue for installation services in an amount equal to the greater of the cash received related to installation or the fair value to deferring the standalone selling price for these services.In February 2018, the FASB issued ASU No. The Company adopted this standard during the first quarter of 2018, which resulted in the reclassification of $10 related to the tax effect of unrealized gains on derivatives.In October 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. The amendments have been applied on a modified retrospective basis through a cumulative effect adjustment to retained earnings. ASU 2017-04 simplifies the accounting for goodwill impairments by eliminating step 2 from the goodwill impairment test. The amendments are applied prospectively upon adoption. The Company early adopted this standard during the first quarter of 2018. The Company performs its annual goodwill impairment assessment on October 1 of each year. The new impairment test will be used in the annual assessment or if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable and an impairment analysis is performed.Other Pronouncements Currently Under Evaluation — In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. ASU 2016-02 requires a lessee to recognize assets and liabilities on the balance sheet for leases with lease terms greater than twelve months. ASU 2016-02 is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2018. In July 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-11, which provides an additional transition method for implementing the new lease standard. The Company will adopt the provisions of ASU 2018-11 by applying the standard at the adoption date and recognizing a cumulative-effect adjustment. The Company is currently completing its review of the lease population and is in the process of implementing a software solution to assist with lease accounting and evaluating footnote disclosures. The Company does not expect that the standard will have a material effect on its consolidated financial statements upon adoption.In June 2018, the FASB issued ASU No. ASU 2018-07 aligns the accounting for share-based payments issued to employees and non-employees. ASU 2018-07 is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2018, and early adoption is permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the standard but does not expect that it will have a material effect on its consolidated financial statements upon adoption.3. The Company also provides installation services and extended warranties. The Company frequently receives consideration from a customer prior to transferring goods to the customer under the terms of a sales contract. The Company records customer deposits related to these prepayments, which represent a contract liability. The Company also records deferred revenue related to installation services when consideration is received before the services have been performed. The Company recognizes customer deposits and deferred revenue as net sales after control of the goods or services has been transferred to the customer and all revenue recognition criteria is met. The Company bills customers for extended warranties upon entering into the agreement with the customer, resulting in deferred revenue. Under the new revenue standard, the standalone selling price for installation services is deferred until control has transferred. The standalone selling price for installation services is determined based on the estimated number of days of service technician time required for installation at standard service rates. The impact of applying ASC 606 was a decrease in revenue recognized during the three months ended September 30, 2018 of $37 and a decrease for the nine months ended September 30, 2018 of $84 as compared to revenue accounted for under ASC 605. FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTSThe Company's financial instruments consist of cash equivalents, short-term and long-term investments, accounts receivable, accounts payable, drawings on revolving lines of credit, long-term debt, contingent purchase consideration, and an interest rate swap.The valuation techniques used to measure fair value are based upon observable and unobservable inputs. Observable inputs reflect market data obtained from independent sources, while unobservable inputs reflect internal market assumptions. The Company's bond securities are reported at fair value based upon quoted prices for instruments with identical terms in active markets. The Company's commercial paper securities reported at fair value are based upon model-driven valuations in which all significant inputs are observable or can be derived from or corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the asset or liability, and are therefore classified as Level 2. At September 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017, the Company's long-term debt consisted of a variable rate long-term note and a fixed rate long-term note. The fair value of the long-term investments considered held-to-maturity as of September 30, 2018 was $14,738, which represented an unrealized gain of $118, as compared to the book value of $14,620 recorded within Other Assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets for the same period. The fair value of contingent purchase consideration was determined using an income approach at the respective business combination date and at the reporting date. These provisions relate to the recoverability of the value of inventories due to technological changes and excess quantities. RC is located near Munich, Germany, and is an integrator of laser-based systems. The Company paid $4,453 to acquire RC, which represents the fair value on that date. Any excess of the acquisition consideration over the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed is allocated to goodwill, which amounted to $4,072. The goodwill arising from the acquisition will not be deductible for tax purposes. As a result of the acquisition, the Company recorded intangible assets of $104 related to trademark and trade name with a weighted-average useful life of 1 year and $557 related to customer relationships with a weighted-average life of 10 years. Amortization expense for the three months ended September 30, 2018 and 2017 was $1,982 and $1,725, respectively. Amortization for the nine months ended September 30, 2018 and 2017 was $5,821 and $3,958, respectively. Most of the Company's sales offices provide support to customers in their respective geographic areas. Warranty reserves have generally been sufficient to cover product warranty repair and replacement costs. The interest on this unsecured long-term note is variable at 1.2% above LIBOR and is fixed using an interest rate swap at 2.9% per annum. The unsecured long-term note matures in May 2023, at which time the outstanding principal balance will be $15,438. Also at September 30, 2018, the Company has another long-term note that is secured by its corporate aircraft with a outstanding principal balance of $25,207, of which, $2,466 is the current portion. The interest on this collateralized long-term note is fixed at 2.7% per annum. At September 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017, there were no amounts drawn on the U.S. line-of-credit, and there were $955 and $520, respectively, of guarantees issued against the facility which reduce the amount of the facility available to draw. At September 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017, there were no amounts drawn on the Euro line-of-credit, and there were $1,222 and $798, respectively, of guarantees issued against those facilities which reduce the amount available to draw. At September 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017, there were no amounts drawn on the Euro overdraft facility. After providing for the guarantees used, the total unused credit lines and overdraft facilities are $108,152 at September 30, 2018. 10. DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTSDerivative instruments – The Company's primary market exposures are to interest rates and foreign exchange rates. The Company from time to time may use certain derivative financial instruments to help manage these exposures. The Company executes these instruments with financial institutions it judges to be credit-worthy. The Company does not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes.The Company recognizes all derivative financial instruments as either assets or liabilities at fair value in the consolidated balance sheets. During the second quarter of 2018, the Company entered into foreign currency forward contracts to hedge the value of intercompany dividends declared in Euros by the Company's German subsidiary. The dividends were paid in the second and third quarters of 2018. These contracts were not designated as hedging instruments for accounting purposes. There are no foreign currency forward contracts outstanding at September 30, 2018. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIESFrom time to time, the Company may be involved in disputes and legal proceedings in the ordinary course of its business.These proceedings may include allegations of infringement of intellectual property, commercial disputes and employmentmatters. As of September 30, 2018 and through the filing date of these Consolidated Financial Statements, the Company has no legal proceedings ongoing that management estimates could have a material effect on the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements. 12. INCOME TAXESThe effective tax rates for the three months ended September 30, 2018 and 2017 were 21.4% and 28.0%, respectively. For the nine months ended September 30, 2018 and 2017, the effective tax rates were 24.2% and 27.0%, respectively. The reduction in the tax rate is partially due to the reduction in the U.S. statutory tax rate to 21%. There were discrete tax benefits of $660 and $5,714 for the three months ended September 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively, and $5,178 and $14,761 for the nine months ended September 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively. The discrete benefits for the three months ended September 30, 2018 include $1,026 related to excess equity based compensation and $4,247 for return to provision adjustments. These were offset by discrete detriments for a U.S. tax rate adjustment of $2,195 related to profit in inventory from 2017 that flowed through to consolidated earnings in 2018 and $3,046 related to a valuation allowance primarily related to state tax credits. The discrete benefits for the nine months ended September 30, 2018 include $10,920 related to excess equity based compensation and $4,001 related to provision to return adjustments. These were offset by discrete detriments for the U.S. tax rate adjustment of 6,584 related to profit in inventory from 2017 that flowed through to consolidated earnings in 2018 and 3,046 related to a valuation allowance reflected primarily for state tax credits that exceed state income taxes in specific states. The discrete benefits in the three months ended September 30, 2017 include $3,738 related to excess equity based compensation and $2,111 related to provision to return related adjustments. The discrete benefits for the nine months ended September 30, 2017 include $10,883 related to excess equity based compensation, $2,240 related to the reversal of a tax reserve and $2,111 related to provision to return adjustments. SAB 118 provides guidance on accounting for the tax effects of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act and allows a measurement period of up to one year from enactment to complete the accounting under ASC 740. The impact reduced the estimated tax expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2018 by $7,939, of which $4,747 had been reflected in tax expense as of June 30, 2018. The Company also finalized its calculation of the liability due to the deemed repatriation tax included in the Tax Act and recorded a $3,621 tax benefit which is included in the discrete benefit for provision to return adjustments detailed above. The Company accounts for its uncertain tax return reporting positions in accordance with the accounting standards for income taxes. The Company continues to classify interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as a component of the provision for income taxes. For the nine months ended September 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively, the computation of diluted weighted average common shares excludes 28,100 and 53,600 common stock equivalents because the effect of including them would be anti-dilutive.The shares excluded for the nine months ended September 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively, are comprised of 18,400 and 14,900 RSUs, 3,800 and 35,900 non-qualified stock options and 5,900 and 2,800 performance stock units.On July 31, 2018, the Company announced that its Board of Directors authorized a new $125 million anti-dilutive stock repurchase program following the completion of its previous $100 million repurchase program. The impact on the reduction of weighted average shares for the three months ended September 30, 2018 and 2017 was 119,911 shares and 9,964 shares, respectively. During the nine months ended September 30, 2018 and 2017, the Company repurchased a total of 585,806 shares and 215,860 shares of its common stock with an average price of $191.06 per share and $124.67 per share in the open market, respectively. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS You should read the following discussion in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. This discussion contains forward looking statements that are based on management's current expectations, estimates and projections about our business and operations. Our actual results may differ materially from those currently anticipated and expressed in such forward-looking statements. See "Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements. "OverviewWe develop and manufacture a broad line of high-performance fiber lasers, fiber amplifiers and diode lasers that are used in numerous applications, primarily in materials processing. In addition, we offer laser-based systems for certain markets and applications. We market our products internationally primarily through our direct sales force.We are vertically integrated such that we design and manufacture most of the key components used in our finished products, from semiconductor diodes to optical fiber preforms, finished fiber lasers and amplifiers. We also manufacture certain complementary products used with our lasers, including optical delivery cables, fiber couplers, beam switches, optical processing heads and chillers. Factors and Trends That Affect Our Operations and Financial Results In reading our financial statements, you should be aware of the following factors and trends that our management believes are important in understanding our financial performance.Net sales. We derive net sales primarily from the sale of fiber lasers and amplifiers. We also sell diode lasers, communications systems, laser systems and complementary products. We sell our products through our direct sales organization and our network of distributors and sales representatives, as well as system integrators. We sell our products to OEMs that supply materials processing laser systems, communications systems, medical laser systems and other laser systems for advanced applications to end users. We also sell our products to end users that build their own systems, which incorporate our products or use our products as an energy or light source. Our scientists and engineers work closely with OEMs, systems integrators and end users to analyze their system requirements and match appropriate fiber laser or amplifier specifications. Our sales cycle varies substantially, ranging from a period of a few weeks to as long as one year or more, but is typically several months. We consider customer purchase orders, which in some cases are governed by master sales agreements, to be the contracts with a customer. The majority of our revenue is recognized at a point in time following the transfer of control of products or services to the customer, which typically occurs upon shipment or delivery depending on the terms of the underlying contracts.We develop our products to standard specifications and use a common set of components within our product architectures. Our major products are based upon a common technology platform. We continually enhance these and other products by improving their components and developing new components and new product designs. The average selling prices of our products generally decrease as the products mature. These decreases result from factors such as decreased manufacturing costs and increases in unit volumes, increased competition, the introduction of new products and market share considerations. In the past, we have lowered our selling prices in order to penetrate new markets and applications. Furthermore, we negotiate discounted selling prices from time to time with certain customers that place high unit volume orders.Gross margin. Our total gross margin can be significantly affected by total net sales in any period, by product mix, that is, the percentage of our revenue in the period that is attributable to higher or lower power products and the mix of sales between laser and amplifier sources and complete systems, by sales mix between OEM customers who purchase devices from us in high unit volumes and other customers, by mix of sales in different geographies and by other factors, some of which are not under our control.Within each of our product categories, lasers with a higher average power generally have a higher gross margin; higher power lasers use a greater number of optical components, improving absorption of fixed overhead costs and enabling economies of scale in manufacturing. In addition, certain specialty products have a gross margin which is above our corporate average while the profit margins on some systems can be lower than margins for our laser and amplifier sources, depending on the configuration, volume and competitive forces, among other factors.18Table of ContentsThe mix of sales between OEM customers and other customers can affect gross margin because we provide sales price discounts on products based on the number of units ordered. As the number of OEM customers increase and the number of units ordered increases, the average sales price per unit will be reduced. We expect that the impact of reduced sales price per unit will be offset by the manufacturing efficiency provided by high unit volume orders, but the timing and extent of achieving these efficiencies may not always match the mix of sales in any given time period or be realized at all.Fluctuations in foreign exchange rates can affect gross margin. Generally, when the U.S. Dollar weakens as compared to the Euro, Chinese Yuan or other foreign currencies in which our product is sold, it will benefit gross margin. When the U.S. dollar strengthens as compared to foreign currencies in which our product is sold, it will be a detriment to gross margin.We also regularly review our inventory for items that are slow-moving, have been rendered obsolete or determined to be excess. Any provision for such slow-moving, obsolete or excess inventory affects our gross margins. For example, we recorded provisions for slow-moving, obsolete or excess inventory totaling $3.1 million and $4.0 million for the three months ended September 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively, and $16.9 million, $22.8 million and $15.4 million for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively.Sales and marketing expense. We expect to continue to expand our worldwide direct sales organization, build and expand applications centers, hire additional sales and marketing personnel at our existing and new geographic locations as well as to support sales of new product lines, increase the number of units for demonstration purposes and otherwise increase expenditures on sales and marketing activities in order to support the growth in our net sales. As such, we expect that our sales and marketing expenses will increase in the aggregate.Research and development expense. We plan to continue to invest in research and development to improve our existing components and products and develop new components, products, systems and applications technology. The amount of research and development expense we incur may vary from period to period. In general, if net sales continue to increase we expect research and development expense to increase in the aggregate.General and administrative expense. We expect our general and administrative expenses to increase as we continue to invest in systems and resources in management, finance, legal, information technology, human resources and administration to support our worldwide operations. Legal expenses vary from quarter to quarter based primarily upon the level of litigation and transaction activities.Foreign Exchange. Because we are a U.S. based company doing business globally, we have both translational and transactional exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. Changes in the relative exchange rate between the U.S. dollar and the foreign currencies in which our subsidiaries operate directly affects our sales, costs and earnings. Certain currencies experiencing significant exchange rate fluctuations like the Euro, the Russian Ruble, the Japanese Yen and Chinese Yuan have had and could have an additional significant impact on our sales, costs and earnings. Our ability to adjust the foreign currency selling prices of products in response to changes in exchange rates is limited and may not offset the impact of the changes in exchange rates on the translated value of sales or costs. In addition, if we increase the selling price of our products in local currencies, this could have a negative impact on the demand for our products.Major customers. While we have historically depended on a few customers for a large percentage of our annual net sales, the composition of this group can change from year to year. Net sales derived from our five largest customers as a percentage of our net sales was 28% for the nine months ended September 30, 2018 and 28%, 22% and 25% for the full years 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. One of our customers accounted for 13% and 14% of our net sales for the nine months ended September 30, 2018 and 2017. We seek to add new customers and to expand our relationships with existing customers. We anticipate that the composition of our significant customers will continue to change. If any of our significant customers substantially reduced their purchases from us, our results would be adversely affected.Results of Operations for the three months ended September 30, 2018 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2017Net sales. The decrease in sales of high power lasers used in metal welding applications was driven by reduced sales into traditional automotive and electric vehicle battery welding, as well as a decrease in average selling prices. In addition, reduced revenue in fine cutting applications was partially attributable to a move to kilowatt scale high power lasers for these applications. The increase in laser systems sales was driven by macro-systems and contributions from micro-systems and the seam stepper, which is mainly used for automotive applications. Other ApplicationsSales from other applications increased with strong growth in communications and government, partially offset by a decline in medical and scientific applications. Government sales increased largely from directed energy applications. Cost of sales and gross margin. Cost of sales decreased by $6.9 million, or 4.1%, to $161.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2018 from $168.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2017. Our gross margin decreased to 54.8% for the three months ended September 30, 2018 from 57.2% for the three months ended September 30, 2017. Gross margin decreased due to lower absorption of manufacturing expenses and lower average prices, partially offset by continued cost reduction initiatives that reduced the cost of certain components.20Table of ContentsSales and marketing expense. Sales and marketing expense remained consistent at $13.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2018 compared with $13.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2017. As a percentage of sales, sales and marketing expense increased to 3.8% of sales for the three months ended September 30, 2018 from 3.4% for the three months ended September 30, 2017 .Research and development expense. Research and development expense increased by $5.4 million, or 21.0%, to $30.9 million for the three months ended September 30, 2018, compared to $25.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2017. Research and development continues to focus on developing new products, enhancing performance of existing components, improving production processes, developing manufacturing of new components and refining production processes to improve manufacturing yields and productivity. New products include lasers that operate at different wavelengths such as UV, visible and mid-IR and lasers with ultrafast pulses. We also continue to develop laser based systems for material processing, projection, display and medical as well as accessories such as welding heads, cutting heads and weld monitoring systems. We are developing new transceiver module products for telecommunication applications. In addition to new products, research and development is focused on enhancing the performance of our existing products and components such as diodes and crystals in order to improve the performance of our lasers and reduce their manufacturing cost. As a percentage of sales, research and development expense increased to 8.7% for the three months ended September 30, 2018 from 6.5% for the three months ended September 30, 2017.General and administrative expense. General and administrative expense increased by $3.7 million, or 17.5%, to $25.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2018 from $21.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2017. This change was primarily a result of increases in outside services, bad debt and depreciation expense. As a percentage of sales, general and administrative expense increased to 7.1% for the three months ended September 30, 2018 from 5.5% for the three months ended September 30, 2017.Effect of exchange rates on net sales, gross profit and operating expenses. We estimate that, if exchange rates relative to the U.S. Dollar had been the same as one year ago, which were on average Euro 0.85, Russian Ruble 59, Japanese Yen 111 and Chinese Yuan 6.67, respectively, we would have expected net sales to be $8.4 million higher, gross profit to be $4.2 million higher and total operating expenses to be $1.6 million higher. We incurred a foreign exchange loss of $1.7 million for the three months ended September 30, 2018 as compared to a $3.9 million loss for the three months ended September 30, 2017. The foreign exchange loss for the three months ended September 30, 2018 was primarily attributable to depreciation of the Chinese Yuan offset by a gain attributable to depreciation of the Russian Ruble. The foreign exchange loss for the three months ended September 30, 2017 was primarily attributable to the appreciation of the Euro and the Russian Ruble, partially offset by a gain attributable to appreciation of the Chinese Yuan as compared to the U.S. Dollar.Provision for income taxes. Provision for income taxes was $27.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2018 compared to $45.0 million for the three months ended September 30, 2017. The effective tax rates were 21.4% and 28.0% for the three months ended September 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively. These benefits were partially offset by provisions for uncertain tax positions, a valuation allowance on state tax credits and other matters.Net income attributable to IPG Photonics Corporation. Net income attributable to IPG Photonics Corporation decreased by $15.1 million to $100.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2018 compared to $115.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2017. Net income attributable to IPG Photonics Corporation as a percentage of our net sales decreased by 1.2 percentage points to 28.2% for the three months ended September 30, 2018 from 29.4% for the three months ended September 30, 2017 due to the factors described above.Results of Operations for the nine months ended September 30, 2018 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2017 Net sales. Within the cutting applications, we continue to see a migration to lasers with higher output powers which improve processing speeds and enable processing of thicker materials. The shift towards lasers with higher output powers has also benefited sales due to their higher average selling prices. Within the pulsed laser category, the sales for green pulsed lasers increased significantly and sales for low pulsed laser increased slightly, which was partially offset by the decrease in sales of high power pulsed lasers. The increase in laser systems sales was driven by welding, cutting, cladding, and other micro-material applications as well as from the acquisition of ILT during the third quarter of 2017.Other ApplicationsSales from other applications increased with strong growth in government sales and slight growth in communications, instruments, and semiconductor sales which were partially offset by a decline in scientific sales. Within advanced applications, government sales increased primarily due to an increase in sales for directed energy applications.Cost of sales and gross margin. Cost of sales increased by $36.6 million, or 8.0%, to $496.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2018 from $459.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2017. Our gross margin remained consistent at 56.1% for the nine months ended September 30, 2018 and 2017. Reductions in the cost to manufacture components and lasers were offset by decreases in average selling prices.22Table of ContentsSales and marketing expense. Sales and marketing expense increased by $5.2 million, or 14.3%, to $41.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2018 from $36.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2017, primarily as a result of increased expenses for personnel, trade show and exhibitions, travel and depreciation. As a percentage of sales, sales and marketing expense increased to 3.7% of sales for the nine months ended September 30, 2018 from 3.5% for the nine months ended September 30, 2017.Research and development expense. Research and development expense increased by $17.0 million, or 22.9%, to $91.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2018, compared to $74.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2017, primarily as a result of an increase in expenses related to personnel, contractors, consultants, materials used for research and development projects, premise-related costs and depreciation. Research and development continues to focus on developing new products, enhancing performance of existing components, improving production processes, developing manufacturing of new components and refining production processes to improve manufacturing yields and productivity. New products include lasers that operate at different wavelengths such as UV, visible and mid-IR and lasers with ultrafast pulses. We also continue to develop laser based systems for material processing, projection, display and medical as well as accessories such as welding heads, cutting heads and weld monitoring systems. We are developing new transceiver module products for telecommunication applications. In addition to new products, research and development is focused on enhancing the performance of our existing products and components such as diodes and crystals in order to improve the performance of our lasers and reduce their manufacturing cost. As a percentage of sales, research and development expense increased to 8.1% for the nine months ended September 30, 2018 from 7.1% for the nine months ended September 30, 2017.General and administrative expense. General and administrative expense increased by $15.8 million, or 26.7%, to $74.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2018 from $59.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2017, primarily as a result of increased expenses for personnel, legal, accounting, information technology, and depreciation. As a percentage of sales, general and administrative expense increased to 6.6% for the nine months ended September 30, 2018 from 5.6% for the nine months ended September 30, 2017.Effect of exchange rates on net sales, gross profit and operating expenses. We estimate that, if exchange rates relative to the U.S. Dollar had been the same as one year ago, which were on average Euro 0.90, Russian Ruble 58, Japanese Yen 112 and Chinese Yuan 6.81, respectively, we would have expected net sales for the nine months ended September 30, 2018 to be $43.9 million lower, gross profit to be $29.1 million lower and total operating expenses would have been $0.5 million lower. The gain for the nine months ended September 30, 2018 was primarily attributable to the depreciation of the Euro and the Russian Ruble as compared to the U.S. Dollar, which was partially offset by a loss attributable to depreciation of the Chinese Yuan. The loss for the nine months ended September 30, 2017 was primarily attributable to appreciation of the Euro and Russian Ruble compared to the U.S. Dollar, which was partially offset by a gain from appreciation of the Chinese Yuan.Provision for income taxes. Provision for income taxes was $104.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2018 compared to $108.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2017, representing an effective tax rate of 24.2% and 27.0% for the nine months ended September 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively. Net income attributable to IPG Photonics Corporation. Net income attributable to IPG Photonics Corporation increased by $33.8 million to $328.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2018 compared to $294.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2017. The decrease in cash and cash equivalents of $262.3 million relates primarily to cash used in investing activities of $416.9 million and cash used in financing activities of $102.1 million. The cash used in investing activities includes $280.2 million of net investment purchases and $132.6 million of net property, plant and equipment purchases. The increase in net investment purchases is due to an increase in cash held in the United States as a result of the payment of an intercompany dividend from our German subsidiary to the U.S. parent. The dividend was declared in the second quarter of 2018 in order to repatriate cash so that it can be managed centrally and invested in higher yielding U.S. Dollar denominated investments which is the functional currency of our parent company. The dividend was paid in full by the end of the third quarter 2018. The cash used in financing activities primarily relates to $111.9 million of treasury stock purchases under our anti-dilutive share repurchase program. These outflows were partially offset by cash provided by operating activities in the nine months ended September 30, 2018 of $280.3 million. In addition, the effect of exchange rates decreased cash and cash equivalents by $23.5 million. Short-term investments at September 30, 2018, consist of liquid investments including U.S. government and government agency notes, corporate notes, commercial paper and certificates of deposit with original maturities of greater than three months but less than one year. We also hold long-term investments, included in other assets on the consolidated balance sheets, which consist of the corporate bonds detailed above with maturities of less than two years and auction rate securities totaling $14,620. Our long-term debt consists of two long-term notes with a combined total outstanding balance at September 30, 2018 of $46.3 million of which $3.7 million is the current portion. We have an unsecured long-term note with an outstanding principal balance at September 30, 2018 of $21.1 million of which $1.2 million is the current portion. The interest on this unsecured long-term note is variable at 1.20% above LIBOR and is fixed using an interest rate swap at 2.85% per annum. The unsecured long-term note matures in May 2023, at which time the outstanding principal balance will be $15.4 million. We have another long-term note that is secured by our corporate aircraft with an outstanding principal balance of $25.2 million of which $2.5 million is the current portion. The interest on this collateralized long-term note is fixed at 2.74% per annum. The collateralized long-term note matures in July 2022, at which time the outstanding principal balance will be $15.4 million.We believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments, our cash flows from operations and our existing lines of credit provide us with the financial flexibility to meet our liquidity and capital needs, as well as to complete certain acquisitions of businesses and technologies. We intend to continue to pursue acquisition opportunities based upon market conditions and the strategic importance and valuation of the target company. We may consider issuing debt or equity to finance acquisitions depending on the timing and size of the acquisition. At September 30, 2018, there were no amounts drawn on this line, however, there were $1.0 million of guarantees issued against the line which reduces total availability. At September 30, 2018, there were no drawings on this facility, however, there were $1.2 million of guarantees issued against the line which reduces total availability. This facility renews annually.Our largest committed credit lines are with Bank of America N.A. We are required to meet certain financial covenants associated with our U.S. revolving line of credit and long-term debt facility. Debt service is defined as required principal and interest payments during the period. Debt service in the calculation is decreased by our cash held in the U.S.A. in excess of $50 million up to a maximum of $250 million. Cash flow is defined as EBITDA less unfunded capital expenditures. The funded debt to EBITDA covenant requires that the sum of all indebtedness for borrowed money on a consolidated basis be less than three times our trailing twelve months EBITDA. We were in compliance with all such financial covenants as of and for the three months ended September 30, 2018. The financial covenants in our loan documents may cause us to not make or to delay investments and actions that we might otherwise undertake because of limits on capital expenditures and amounts that we can borrow or lease. In the event that we do not comply with any one of these covenants, we would be in default under the loan agreement or loan agreements, which may result in acceleration of the debt, cross-defaults on other debt or a reduction in available liquidity, any of which could harm our results of operations and financial condition.Operating activities. Net cash provided by operating activities decreased by $16.6 million to $280.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2018 from $296.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2017. Our largest working capital items are inventory and accounts receivable. Items such as accounts payable to third parties, prepaid expenses and other current assets and accrued expenses and other liabilities are not as significant as our working capital investment in accounts receivable and inventory because of the amount of value added within IPG due to our vertically integrated structure. Accruals and payables for personnel costs including bonuses and income and other taxes payable are largely dependent on the timing of payments for those items. Cash used for inventory was $122.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2018 as compared to $39.7 million for the same period in 2017.Given our vertical integration, rigorous and time-consuming testing procedures for both internally manufactured and externally purchased components and the lead time required to manufacture components used in our finished products, the rate at which we turn inventory has historically been comparatively low when compared to our cost of sales. Also, our historic growth rates required investment in inventories to support future sales and enable us to quote short delivery times to our customers, providing what we believe is a competitive advantage. Furthermore, if there was a disruption to the manufacturing capacity of any of our key technologies, our inventories of components should enable us to continue to build finished products for a period of time. We believe that we will continue to maintain a relatively high level of inventory compared to our cost of sales. As a result, we expect to have a significant amount of working capital invested in inventory. A reduction in our level of net sales or the rate of growth of our net sales from their current levels would mean that the rate at which we are able to convert our inventory into cash would decrease.Investing activities. Net cash used in investing activities was $416.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2018 as compared to cash used in investing activities of $93.3 million in 2017. The cash used in investing activities in 2018 related to $133.4 million of capital expenditures and $280.2 million of net purchases of short-term and long-term investments.25Table of Contents The cash used in investing activities in 2017 related to $99.2 million of capital expenditures, partially offset by $41.6 million of net proceeds from sales and maturities of short-term investments. We expect to incur between $170 million and $190 million in 2018 in capital expenditures. Capital expenditures include investments in facilities and equipment to add capacity worldwide to support anticipated revenue growth. In 2018, we expect capital expenditures to increase as a percentage of revenue to support the growth of our business. The timing and extent of any capital expenditures in and between periods can have a significant effect on our cash flow. If we obtain financing for certain projects, our cash expenditures would be reduced in the year of expenditure. Many of the capital expenditure projects that we undertake have long lead times and are difficult to cancel or defer to a later period. Financing activities. Net cash used in financing activities was $102.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2018 as compared to net cash provided of $5.2 million in 2017. The cash used in financing activities in 2018 was primarily related the purchase of treasury stock of $111.9 million, partially offset by proceeds of $12.1 million from the exercise of stock options and shares issued under our employee stock purchase plan. The cash provided by financing activities in 2017 was primarily related to the proceeds of $23.3 million from the exercise of stock options and shares issued under our employee stock purchase plan and net proceeds from long-term borrowings of $9.0 million, partially offset by the purchase of treasury stock of $26.9 million.Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking StatementsThis Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q contains certain forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, and we intend that such forward-looking statements be subject to the safe harbors created thereby.

QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK We are exposed to market risk in the ordinary course of business, which consists primarily of interest rate risk associated with our cash and cash equivalents and our debt and foreign exchange rate risk.Interest rate risk. Certain interest rates are variable and fluctuate with current market conditions. Our investments have limited exposure to market risk. We maintain a portfolio of cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments, consisting primarily of bank deposits, money market funds, certificates of deposit, corporate bonds and government and agency securities. None of these investments have a maturity date in excess of one year. Because of the short-term nature of these instruments, a sudden change in market interest rates would not be expected to have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations. We also have long-term investments in corporate notes with maturities between one and two years. Given the modest amount of our long-term investments totaling $14.6 million and the fact that we expect to hold these investments to26Table of Contents maturity, we do not believe that a 10% change in market interest rates would have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations.We are also exposed to market risk as a result of increases or decreases in the amount of interest expense we must pay on our bank debt and borrowings on our bank credit facilities. Our interest obligations on our long-term debt are fixed either by the underlying agreement or by means of an interest rate swap agreement. Although our U.S. revolving line of credit and our Euro credit facility have variable rates, we do not believe that a 10% change in market interest rates would have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations.Exchange rates. Due to our international operations, a significant portion of our net sales, cost of sales and operating expenses are denominated in currencies other than the U.S. Dollar, principally the Euro, the Russian Ruble, the Chinese Yuan and the Japanese Yen. As a result, our international operations give rise to transactional market risk associated with exchange rate movements of the U.S. Dollar, the Euro, the Russian Ruble, the Chinese Yuan and the Japanese Yen. The loss on foreign exchange transactions totaled $1.7 million for the three months ended September 30, 2018 compared to the loss of $3.9 million for the three months ended September 30, 2017. Management attempts to minimize these exposures by partially or fully off-setting foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities at our subsidiaries that operate in different functional currencies. The effectiveness of this strategy can be limited by the volume of underlying transactions at various subsidiaries and by our ability to accelerate or delay inter-company cash settlements. As a result, we are unable to create a perfect offset of the foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities. At September 30, 2018, our material foreign currency exposure is net U.S. Dollar denominated assets at subsidiaries where the Euro or the Russian Ruble is the functional currency and U.S. Dollar denominated liabilities where the Chinese Yuan is the functional currency. The U.S. Dollar denominated assets are comprised of cash, third party receivables and inter-company receivables. The U.S. Dollar denominated liabilities are comprised of inter-company payables. A 5% change in the relative exchange rate of the U.S. Dollar to the Euro as of September 30, 2018 applied to the net U.S. Dollar asset balances, would result in a foreign exchange gain of $4.5 million if the U.S. Dollar appreciated and a $4.5 million foreign exchange loss if the U.S. Dollar depreciated. A 5% change in the relative exchange rate of the U.S. Dollar to the Chinese Yuan as of September 30, 2018 applied to the net U.S. Dollar liabilities balances, would result in a foreign exchange loss of $5.6 million if the U.S. Dollar appreciated and a $5.6 million foreign exchange gain if the U.S. Dollar depreciated.In addition we are exposed to foreign currency translation risk for those subsidiaries whose functional currency is not the U.S. Dollar as changes in the value of their functional currency relative to the U.S. Dollar can adversely affect the translated amounts of our revenue, expenses, net income, assets and liabilities. This can, in turn, affect the reported value and relative growth of sales and net income from one period to the next. In addition changes in the translated value of assets and liabilities due to changes in functional currency exchange rates relative to the U.S. Dollar result in foreign currency translation adjustments that are a component of other comprehensive income or loss.Foreign currency derivative instruments can also be used to hedge exposures and reduce the risks of certain foreign currency transactions; however, these instruments provide only limited protection and can carry significant cost. We have no foreign currency derivative instruments as of September 30, 2018. We will continue to analyze our exposure to currency exchange rate fluctuations and may engage in financial hedging techniques in the future to attempt to minimize the effect of these potential fluctuations. Exchange rate fluctuations may adversely affect our financial results in the future.27Table of ContentsITEM 4.
