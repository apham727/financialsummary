Forward-looking statements are based on current expectations and assumptions that are subject to risks and uncertainties which may cause actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements. Risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results and events to differ materially from such forward-looking statements are identified at “Risk Factors” in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended June 30, 2017. We undertake no obligation to update or revise publicly any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events, or otherwise.3PART I. FINANCIAL INFORMATIONITEM I. JHA also provides continuing support and services to customers using in-house or outsourced systems. Amounts within the condensed consolidated statements of income for the three and six months ended December 31, 2016 have been reclassified to improve comparability with the three and six months ended December 31, 2017. Revenue was previously classified as license, support and service, and hardware, and has been reclassified into one "Revenue" caption. Cost of sales was previously presented under three captions to correspond with our three lines of revenue, and has now been condensed to one caption, "Cost of Revenue". We have elected to include all operating expenses, including cost of revenue, under one expenses heading. Previously, cost of revenue was presented separately from operating expenses in order to show gross profit. Gross profit has been removed from our current presentation due to management's focus on operating income. Additionally, within operating expenses, selling and marketing expense and general and administrative expense were previously presented under two captions, but are now condensed under one caption, labeled "Selling, General, and Administrative." Property and EquipmentProperty and equipment is stated at cost and depreciated using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets. Accumulated depreciation at December 31, 2017 totaled $368,599 and at June 30, 2017 totaled $345,014.Intangible AssetsIntangible assets consist of goodwill, customer relationships, computer software, and trade names acquired in business acquisitions in addition to internally developed computer software. Accumulated amortization of intangible assets totaled $552,340 and $503,653 at December 31, 2017 and June 30, 2017, respectively.Common StockThe Board of Directors has authorized the Company to repurchase shares of its common stock. Under this authorization, the Company may finance its share repurchases with available cash reserves or borrowings on its existing line-of-credit. The share repurchase program does not include specific price targets or timetables and may be suspended at any time. At December 31, 2017, there were 25,962 shares in treasury stock and the Company had the remaining authority to repurchase up to 4,029 additional shares. The total cost of treasury shares at December 31, 2017 is $1,036,292. During the first six months of fiscal 2018, the Company repurchased 302 treasury shares for $30,018. At June 30, 2017, there were 25,660 shares in treasury stock and the Company had authority to repurchase up to 4,330 additional shares.8Table of ContentsDividends declared per share were $0.31 and $0.28, for the three months ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively, and totaled $0.62 and $0.56 for the six months ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. Interim Financial StatementsThe accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the instructions to Form 10-Q of the Securities and Exchange Commission and in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America applicable to interim condensed consolidated financial statements, and do not include all of the information and footnotes required by accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America for complete consolidated financial statements. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers in May 2014. The new standard will supersede much of the existing authoritative literature for revenue recognition. The new model enacts a five-step process for achieving the core principle, which is that an entity should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. In August 2015, the FASB also issued ASU No. 2015-14 which deferred the effective date of the new standard by one year, but allows early application as of the original effective date. We do not intend to adopt the provisions of the new standard early, so the standard and related amendments will be effective for the Company for its annual reporting period beginning July 1, 2018, including interim periods within that reporting period. In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-08, which addresses principal versus agent considerations under the new revenue standard. Additional guidance, including ASU No. 2016-10, ASU No. 2016-12, and ASU No. 2016-20, also addresses specific aspects of the new standard and are being considered. One of the most significant expected impacts relates to the recognition of license and implementation revenue on our multi-element arrangements. Under ASC 606, revenue for license and implementation will no longer be deferred due solely to a lack of VSOE. •This new model will require more use of judgments and estimates than the current standard, including identifying performance obligations, estimating variable consideration, and allocating the transaction price to each performance obligation. We will be required to estimate the total expected value of variable consideration, arising from items such as maintenance and transaction or item processing, at contract inception and include those estimates in the total transaction price of the contract to be allocated to each performance obligation. While we plan to adopt the standard using the full retrospective method, our ability to achieve that depends on system readiness, including software procured from third-party providers, and the completion of our analysis of information necessary to restate prior period consolidated financial statements.•Determination of opening balances for deferred revenues and costs, and the quantitative effect of the new standard on prior and current year revenues and costs.•Development of required disclosures under the new standard.•Updates to our internal controls surrounding the new processes.The FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02, Leases, in February 2016. This ASU aims to increase transparency and comparability among organizations by recognizing lease assets and liabilities on the balance sheet and requiring disclosure of key information regarding leasing arrangements. Specifically, the standard requires operating lease commitments to be recorded on the balance sheet as operating lease liabilities and right-of-use assets, and the cost of those operating leases to be amortized on a straight-line basis. ASU No. 2016-02 will be effective for Jack Henry's annual reporting period beginning July 1, 2019 and early adoption is permitted. At transition, a modified retrospective approach must be utilized to measure leases as of the beginning of the earliest period presented, however, the FASB has provided certain practical expedients, which the Company is currently evaluating. The Company is currently assessing the impact this new standard will have on our consolidated financial statements and when we will adopt it. ASU 2016-15 issued by the FASB in August 2016 clarifies cash flow classification of eight specific cash flow issues and is effective for our annual reporting period beginning July 1, 2018. Early adoption is permitted. We do not expect any significant impact to our financial statements as a result of this standard.NOTE 3. FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTSFor cash equivalents, amounts receivable or payable and short-term borrowings, fair values approximate carrying value, based on the short-term nature of the assets and liabilities. The Company's estimates of the fair value for financial assets and financial liabilities are based on the framework established in the fair value accounting guidance. The framework is based on the inputs used in valuation, gives the highest priority to quoted prices in active markets, and requires that observable inputs be used in the valuations when available. These assets are expected to be disposed of by sale within twelve months of June 30, 2017.NOTE 4. DEBTRevolving credit facilityThe revolving credit facility allows for borrowings of up to $300,000, which may be increased by the Company at any time until maturity to $600,000. The credit facility is guaranteed by certain subsidiaries of the Company. The credit facility is subject to various financial covenants that require the Company to maintain certain financial ratios as defined in the agreement. As of December 31, 2017, the Company was in compliance with all such covenants. The revolving loan terminates February 20, 2020. There was a $50,000 outstanding balance at June 30, 2017. 11Table of ContentsOther lines of creditThe Company has an unsecured bank credit line which provides for funding of up to $5,000 and bears interest at the prime rate less 1%. The credit line was renewed in April 2017 and expires on April 30, 2019. At December 31, 2017, no amount was outstanding. There was also no balance outstanding at June 30, 2017. InterestThe Company paid interest of $355 and $188 during the six months ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively.NOTE 6. The TCJA reduces the U.S. federal statutory tax rate from 35% to 21%, effective January 1, 2018. The Company relied on SAB 118 in computing its accounting for income taxes during the period ended December 31, 2017. The computation of income taxes payable, deferred tax liability, and income tax expense for the period ended December 31, 2017 reflect provisional amounts for which the income tax effects of the TCJA have not been completed, but for which reasonable estimates are available. As a fiscal year taxpayer, the Company has utilized certain estimates and forecasts of future operations in estimating both the reversal of deferred tax assets and liabilities that existed on the enactment date, as well as the generation of additional deferred tax assets and liabilities for the remainder of the year ending June 30, 2018. These estimates may change as we receive additional information about the timing of deferred tax reversals. It is anticipated that any additional income tax effects from the TCJA will be recorded in the periods ending March 31, 2018 and June 30, 2018 as the deferred tax activity becomes known as a result of actual operations. The Company paid income taxes, net of refunds, of $38,163 and $44,539 in the six months ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively.At December 31, 2017, the Company had $9,607 of gross unrecognized tax benefits, $8,679 of which, if recognized, would affect our effective tax rate. This includes $3,391 of unrecognized tax benefits recorded in the period ending December 31, 2017 as a result of recent tax pronouncements. We had accrued interest and penalties of $1,318 and $1,284 related to uncertain tax positions at December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively.The U.S. federal and state income tax returns for fiscal year 2014 and all subsequent years remain subject to examination as of December 31, 2017 under statute of limitations rules. We anticipate potential changes due to lapsing statutes of limitations and examination closures could reduce the unrecognized tax benefits balance by $500 - $1,500 within twelve months of December 31, 2017.NOTE 7. STOCK-BASED COMPENSATIONOur operating income for the three months ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 included $3,096 and $3,032 of stock-based compensation costs, respectively. For the six months ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, stock-based compensation costs included in operating income totaled $4,609 and $4,230, respectively. The plan allows for grants of stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock shares or units, and performance shares or units. The maximum number of shares authorized for issuance under the plan is 3,000. For stock options, terms and vesting periods of the options are determined by the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors when granted. The option period must expire not more than ten years from the option grant date. The options granted under this plan are exercisable beginning three years after the grant date at an exercise price equal to 100% of the fair market value of the stock at the grant date. The weighted average remaining contractual term on options currently exercisable as of December 31, 2017 was 1.50 years.Restricted Stock AwardsThe Company issues both share awards and unit awards under the 2015 EIP, and previously issued these through the 2005 Restricted Stock Plan. At December 31, 2017, there was $14,788 of compensation expense that has yet to be recognized related to non-vested restricted stock unit awards, which will be recognized over a weighted average period of 1.58 years.NOTE 8. EARNINGS PER SHAREThe following table reflects the reconciliation between basic and diluted earnings per share. Stock options and restricted stock have been included in the calculation of earnings per share to the extent they are dilutive. There were no anti-dilutive stock options or restricted stock shares excluded for the quarter ended December 31, 2017, compared to 32 shares excluded for the quarter ended December 31, 2016. EST Holdings, Inc. and EST Interco, Inc. jointly own all of the outstanding equity of Ensenta Corporation, a California-based provider of real-time, cloud-based solutions for mobile and online payments and deposits. This acquisition was partially funded by a draw on the Company's revolving credit facility, with the remaining amount funded by existing operating cash. The addition of Ensenta Corporation to the JHA Payment Solutions Group expands the Company’s ability to conduct real-time transactions with third-party platforms, extending its presence in the credit union market through shared branching technology. Management has completed a preliminary purchase price allocation of Ensenta Corporation and its assessment of the fair value of acquired assets and liabilities assumed. The goodwill from this acquisition has been allocated to our Payments segment and is not expected to be deductible for income tax purposes.Identifiable intangible assets from this acquisition consist of customer relationships of $33,824, computer software of $16,639, and other intangible assets of $4,538. The weighted average amortization period for acquired customer relationships, computer software, and other intangible assets is 15 years, 10 years, and 10 years, respectively.Current assets were inclusive of cash acquired of $7,273. The fair value of current assets acquired included accounts receivable of $4,668, none of which were expected to be uncollectible.Costs incurred related to the acquisition of Ensenta Corporation in the second quarter of fiscal 2018 totaled $262 for legal, valuation, and other fees, and were expensed as incurred within selling, general, and administrative expenses.The Company's consolidated statements of income for the three and six months ended December 31, 2017 included revenue of $928 and after-tax net income of $6,366 resulting from Ensenta Corporation's operations. The after-tax net income included a large tax benefit recorded as a result of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. Excluding the effects of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, the Company's after-tax net income resulting from Ensenta Corporation's operations totaled $26.The accompanying consolidated statements of income for the three and six months ended December 31, 2017 do not include any revenues and expenses related to this acquisition prior to the acquisition date. The following unaudited pro forma consolidated financial information is presented as if this acquisition had occurred at the beginning of the earliest period presented. In addition, this unaudited pro forma financial information is provided for illustrative purposes only and should not be relied upon as necessarily being indicative of the historical results that would have been obtained if the acquisition had actually occurred during those periods, or the results that may be obtained in the future as a result of the acquisition.

Beginning in the first quarter of fiscal 2018, JHA changed its reportable segment structure from two customer-centric segments, Bank and Credit Union, to four product-centric segments. The change was made based on the view of our Chief Executive Officer, who is also our Chief Operating Decision Maker, that the Company could be more effectively managed using a product-centric approach and was driven by the first budgetary process under his administration. The Complementary segment provides additional software and services that can be integrated with our Core solutions or used independently. Only revenue and costs of revenue are considered in the evaluation for each segment. Its solutions are marketed and supported through three primary brands. Jack Henry Banking® is a top provider of information and transaction processing solutions to US banks ranging from community banks to multi-billion dollar institutions. Symitar® is a leading provider of information and transaction processing solutions for credit unions of all sizes. ProfitStars® provides specialized products and services that enable financial institutions of every asset size and charter, and diverse corporate entities outside the financial services industry, to mitigate and control risks, optimize revenue and growth opportunities, and contain costs. JHA's integrated solutions are available for in-house installation and outsourced delivery. Our two primary revenue streams are "Services and support" and "Processing". We continually seek opportunities to increase revenue while at the same time containing costs to expand margins. RESULTS OF OPERATIONSIn the second quarter of fiscal 2018, total revenue increased 8%, or $26,203, compared to the same quarter in the prior year. Excluding an increase of $2,809 in deconversion fees quarter-over-quarter, and revenue from fiscal 2018 acquisitions of $1,323, total revenue increased 6% for the quarter. Operating expenses increased 8% compared to the second quarter of fiscal 2017, mainly due to a 6% increase in headcount at December 31, 2017 compared to December 31, 2016, leading to increased salaries and benefits. Other reasons for the increase include higher direct cost of product, costs related to our new card payment processing platform and faster payments incentives, and increased amortization of capitalized software. The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act enacted December 22, 2017 had a large impact on our provision for income taxes, causing it to decrease 304% compared to the prior year quarter. As discussed in Note 6 of the condensed consolidated financial statements, the amounts recorded under provision for income taxes are reasonable estimates, but are subject to change as additional calculations are completed based on actual results during the third and fourth quarters of fiscal 2018.Excluding the effect of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act and other one-time tax adjustments, net income increased 6% for the second quarter of fiscal 2018 compared to the second quarter in fiscal 2017. In the six months ended December 31, 2017, total revenue increased 6%, or $41,109, over the six months ended December 31, 2016. Deconversion fees in the year-to-date period decreased $2,981 compared to the same six months in the prior fiscal year, and we had revenue from 2018 acquisitions totaling $1,421. Excluding these factors from each period, total revenue increased 6% Operating expenses for the six months ended December 31, 2017 increased 7% compared to the equivalent period in the prior year, primarily due to increased headcount, higher direct cost of product, costs related to our new card payment processing platform and faster payments incentives, and increased amortization of capitalized software. We move into the third quarter of fiscal 2018 following strong performance in the second quarter. Significant portions of our business continue to come from recurring revenues and our healthy sales pipeline is also encouraging. Our customers continue to face regulatory and operational challenges which our products and services address, and in these times we believe they have an even greater need for our solutions that directly address institutional profitability, efficiency, and security. Our strong balance sheet, access to extensive lines of credit, the strength of our existing 20Table of Contentsproduct line and an unwavering commitment to superior customer service should position us well to address current and future opportunities. A detailed discussion of the major components of the results of operations for the three and six months ending December 31, 2017 follows. Excluding deconversion fees from each period presented, and excluding revenue from fiscal 2018 acquisitions, services and support revenue grew 6%. The increase was primarily due to increased product delivery and services revenue and increased outsourcing and cloud revenue. The increased product delivery and services revenue resulted from completion of revised contractual obligations on several long-term contracts that permitted the Company to recognize previously deferred revenue related to our bundled arrangements.In the six months ended December 31, 2017, services and support revenue grew 5% over the equivalent six months in the prior fiscal year. Excluding deconversion fees from each period presented and revenue from fiscal 2018 acquisitions, services and support revenue grew 6%. The increase was due primarily to expanded headcount driving increased salaries and benefits. Other factors to the increase include higher direct costs of product, professional services, and amortization related to capitalized software. The Company continues to focus on cost management. For the year-to-date period, cost of revenue increased 6% due to the same factors discussed above, but remained a consistent percentage of revenue. The fiscal year-to-date increase was also driven by those factors, as well as increased professional service expenses due to contracting with outside experts in preparation for our adoption of the new ASC 606 revenue standard. Selling, general, and administrative expense remained a consistent percentage of revenue in both the quarter and fiscal year-to-date periods.Gain on Disposal of a BusinessIn the second quarter of fiscal 2018, we recognized a gain related to the sale of our ATM Manager product line of $189. For the six months ended December 31, 2017, gains on disposals of businesses totaled $1,894, due to the ATM Manager gain recognized in the second quarter and the first quarter sale of our jhaDirect product line. No businesses were disposed of in the six months ended December 31, 2016. Excluding the effect of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act and other one-time tax adjustments, net income increased 6% for the second quarter of fiscal 2018 compared to the second quarter of fiscal 2017, to $62,314, and diluted earnings per share increased 7% to $0.80 per diluted share. In the six months ended December 31, 2017, net income increased to $218,985 from $121,058 for the same period of fiscal 2017, for an increase of 81%. Diluted earnings per share increased 83% to $2.82, compared to $1.54 last year. Excluding the effect of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act and other one-time tax adjustments, net income for the first 22Table of Contentssix months of fiscal 2018 increased 4% over the first six months of fiscal 2017 to $125,725, and diluted earnings per share increased 5% to $1.62. REPORTABLE SEGMENT DISCUSSIONThe Company is a leading provider of technology solutions and payment processing services primarily for financial services organizations. Beginning in the first quarter of fiscal 2018, JHA changed its reportable segment structure from two customer-centric segments, Bank and Credit Union, to four product-centric segments. The change was made based on the view of our Chief Executive Officer, who is also our Chief Operating Decision Maker, that the Company could be more effectively managed using a product-centric approach and was driven by the first budgetary process under his administration. The Payments segment provides secure payment processing tools and services, including ATM, debit, and credit card processing services, online and mobile bill pay solutions, and risk management products and services. The Complementary segment provides additional software and services that can be integrated with our core solutions or used independently. Excluding deconversion fees from each period, revenue increased 11%. The revenue increase was partly due to increased product delivery and services revenue being recognized as a result of completion of revised contractual obligations on several long-term contracts that permitted the Company to recognize previously deferred revenue related to our bundled arrangements. The increased revenue in the Core segment was also driven by an 8% increase in In-House Support and a 6% increase in Outsourcing and Cloud revenue. Cost of revenue remained consistent as a percentage of revenue.Comparing the six months ended December 31, 2017 to the equivalent six months of fiscal 2017, revenue in the Core segment increased 11%, driven by 6% increases in both Outsourcing and Cloud revenue and In-House Support, as well as increased product delivery and services revenue recognized as a result of the completion of revised contractual obligations on several of our bundled arrangements. Excluding deconversion revenue from each period and revenue from Ensenta from the second quarter of fiscal 2018, revenue increased 5% in the Payments segment. The improvement in the most recent quarter was due to increased remittance and card processing revenue. Cost of revenue increased 8%, in part due to increased spending related to our strategic partnership with First Data and PSCU to expand our credit and debit card platform.For the six months ended December 31, 2017, Payments segment revenue increased 3%, despite decreased deconversion fees. Excluding deconversion fees from each six month period, and excluding Ensenta revenue from 23Table of Contentsfiscal 2018, revenue increased 5%. Excluding deconversion fees from each period, and Vanguard revenue from the second quarter of fiscal 2018, revenue increased 5%. Cost of revenue increased 6% for the second quarter of fiscal 2018 compared to the second quarter of fiscal 2017, remaining consistent as a percentage of revenue. Revenue in the Complementary segment increased 5% for the six months ended December 31, 2017 compared to the prior year-to-date period, or 4% after excluding deconversion fees and Vanguard revenue. The increase was driven by increased outsourcing and cloud services, as well as increased transaction and digital processing. Revenue classified in the Corporate and Other segment includes revenue from hardware and other products not specifically attributed to any of the other three segments. Revenue within this segment is expected to be lower in fiscal 2018 compared to fiscal 2017 due to the sale of the jhaDirect product line in the first quarter of fiscal 2018. For the full fiscal year 2017, revenue from jhaDirect totaled $6,536.Cost of revenue for the Corporate and Other segment includes operating cost not directly attributable to any of the other three segments. The increased cost of revenue in the second quarter and year-to-date is primarily related to increased salary and benefit costs. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCESThe Company's cash and cash equivalents decreased to $57,719 at December 31, 2017 from $114,765 at June 30, 2017. This was partially offset by $350 of proceeds from the sale of businesses, and $205 of proceeds from asset sales. Cash used in investing activities for the first six months of fiscal 2017 totaled $69,703 and included $41,673 for the development of software, capital expenditures of $17,405, and $11,455 for the purchase and development of internal use software, partially offset by $830 of proceeds from the sale of assets. Financing activities used cash of $31,645 for the first six months of fiscal 2018. Cash used was $50,000 for repayment on or our revolving credit facility, $30,018 for the purchase of treasury shares, dividends paid to stockholders of $47,844, and $3,783 net cash outflow from the issuance of stock and tax related to stock-based compensation. These uses were partially offset by borrowings of $100,000 on our revolving credit facility. Financing activities used cash in the first six months of fiscal 2017 totaling $100,286. Cash used was $103,885 for the purchase of treasury shares, dividends paid to stockholders of $43,582, repayments on capital leases of $200, and $2,619 net cash outflow from the issuance of stock and tax related to stock-based compensation, partially offset by borrowings on our revolving credit facility of $50,000. Capital Requirements and ResourcesThe Company generally uses existing resources and funds generated from operations to meet its capital requirements. Capital expenditures totaling $12,249 and $17,405 for the six months ending December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016, respectively, were made primarily for additional equipment and the improvement of existing facilities. These additions were funded from cash generated by operations. Total consolidated capital expenditures on facilities and equipment for the Company for fiscal year 2018 are not expected to exceed $70,000 and will be funded from cash generated by operations.The Board of Directors has authorized the Company to repurchase shares of its common stock. Under this authorization, the Company may finance its share repurchases with available cash reserves or borrowings on its existing line-of-credit. The share repurchase program does not include specific price targets or timetables and may be suspended at any time. At December 31, 2017, there were 25,962 shares in treasury stock and the Company had the remaining authority to repurchase up to 4,029 additional shares. The total cost of treasury shares at December 31, 2017 is $1,036,292. During the first six months of fiscal 2018, the Company repurchased 302 treasury shares for $30,018. At June 30, 2017, there were 25,660 shares in treasury stock and the Company had authority to repurchase up to 4,330 additional shares.Revolving credit facilityThe revolving credit facility allows for borrowings of up to $300,000, which may be increased by the Company at any time until maturity to $600,000.

QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISKMarket risk refers to the risk that a change in the level of one or more market prices, interest rates, indices, volatilities, correlations or other market factors such as liquidity, will result in losses for a certain financial instrument or group of financial instruments. We are currently exposed to credit risk on credit extended to customers and at times are exposed to interest risk on outstanding debt. We do not currently use any derivative financial instruments. We actively monitor these risks through a variety of controlled procedures involving senior management.Based on the controls in place and the credit worthiness of the customer base, we believe the credit risk associated with the extension of credit to our customers will not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position, results of operations, or cash flows.Based on our outstanding debt with variable interest rates as of December 31, 2017, a 1% increase in our borrowing rate would increase our annual interest expense by $1,000.ITEM 4. Based upon that evaluation, the CEO and CFO concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures are effective to ensure that information we are required to disclose in reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in SEC rules and forms. For this purpose, disclosure controls and procedures include controls and procedures designed to ensure that information that is required to be disclosed under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to the Company's management, including the CEO and CFO, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.Changes in Internal Control over Financial ReportingDuring the fiscal quarter ending December 31, 2017, there was no change in internal control over financial reporting that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to affect, the Company's internal control over financial reporting. PART II. OTHER INFORMATIONITEM 1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGSWe are subject to various routine legal proceedings and claims arising in the ordinary course of our business. In the opinion of management, any liabilities resulting from current lawsuits are not expected, either individually or in the aggregate, to have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial statements. In accordance with U.S. GAAP, we record a liability when it is both probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. These liabilities are reviewed at least quarterly and adjusted to reflect the impacts of negotiations, settlements, rulings, advice of legal counsel, and other information and events pertaining to a particular case or proceeding.ITEM 2. There were 55 shares surrendered to the Company to satisfy tax withholding obligations in connection with employee restricted stock awards. These authorizations have no specific dollar or share price targets and no expiration dates.27Table of ContentsITEM 6.
