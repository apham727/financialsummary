We design, make and sell semiconductors to electronics designers and manufacturers all over the world. We report the results of our remaining business activities in Other. Other includes operating segments that do not meet the quantitative thresholds for individually reportable segments and cannot be aggregated with other operating segments. Other includes DLP® products, calculators and custom ASIC products. Our centralized manufacturing and support organizations, such as facilities, procurement and logistics, provide support to our operating segments, including those in Other. Costs incurred by these organizations, including depreciation, are charged to the segments on a per-unit basis. Consequently, depreciation expense is not an independently identifiable component within the segments’ results and, therefore, is not provided. The revenue information is not necessarily indicative of the geographic area in which the end applications containing our products are ultimately consumed because our products tend to be shipped to the locations where our customers manufacture their products. Specifically, many of our products are shipped to our customers in China who may include these parts in the manufacture of their own end products, which they may in turn export to their customers around the world. The Consolidated Statements of Income, Comprehensive Income and Cash Flows for the periods ended June 30, 2018 and 2017, and the Consolidated Balance Sheet as of June 30, 2018, are not audited but reflect all adjustments that are of a normal recurring nature and are necessary for a fair statement of the results of the periods shown. Certain information and note disclosures normally included in annual consolidated financial statements have been omitted pursuant to the rules and regulations of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. Because the consolidated interim financial statements do not include all of the information and notes required by GAAP for a complete set of financial statements, they should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and notes included in our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2017. The results for the three- and six-month periods are not necessarily indicative of a full year’s results. We have a variety of types of contracts with our customers and distributors. In determining whether a contract exists, we evaluate the terms of the agreement, the relationship with the customer or distributor and their ability to pay. We recognize revenue from sales of our products, including sales to our distributors, at a point in time, generally upon shipment or delivery to the customer or distributor, depending upon the terms of the sales order. Control is considered transferred when title and risk of loss pass, when the customer becomes obligated to pay and, where required, when the customer has accepted the products. For sales to distributors, payment is due on our standard commercial terms and is not contingent upon resale of the products. Revenue from sales of our products that is subject to inventory consignment agreements is recognized at a point in time, when the customer or distributor pulls product from consignment inventory that we store at designated locations. Transfer of control occurs at that point, when title and risk of loss transfers and the customer or distributor becomes obligated to pay for the products pulled from inventory. Until the products are pulled for use or sale by the customer or distributor, we retain control over the products’ disposition, including the right to pull back or relocate the products. The amount of revenue recognized is adjusted based on allowances, which are prepared on a portfolio basis using a most likely amount methodology based on analysis of historical data, current economic conditions and contractual terms. These allowances, which are not material, generally include adjustments for pricing arrangements, product returns and incentives. The length of time between invoicing and payment is not significant under any of our payment terms. In instances where the timing of revenue recognition differs from the timing of invoicing, we have determined our contracts generally do not include a significant financing component. In addition, we record allowances for accounts receivable that we estimate may not be collected. We monitor collectability of accounts receivable primarily through review of accounts receivable aging. When collection is at risk, we assess the impact on amounts recorded for bad debts and, if necessary, record a charge in the period such determination is made. We recognize shipping fees, if any, received from customers in revenue. We include shipping and handling costs in COR. The majority of our customers pay these fees directly to third parties. Under the two-class method, a portion of Net income is allocated to these participating securities and, therefore, is excluded from the calculation of EPS allocated to common stock, as shown in the table below. Derivatives and hedging
We use derivative financial instruments to manage exposure to foreign exchange risk. These instruments are primarily forward foreign currency exchange contracts, which are used as economic hedges to reduce the earnings impact that exchange rate fluctuations may have on our non-U.S. dollar net balance sheet exposures. We do not apply hedge accounting to our foreign currency derivative instruments. In connection with the issuance of long-term debt, we may use financial derivatives such as treasury-rate lock agreements that are recognized in AOCI and amortized over the life of the related debt. The results of these derivative transactions have not been material. Fair values of financial instruments
The fair values of our derivative financial instruments were not material as of June 30, 2018. Our investments in cash equivalents, short-term investments and certain long-term investments, as well as our deferred compensation liabilities, are carried at fair value. The carrying values for other current financial assets and liabilities, such as accounts receivable and accounts payable, approximate fair value due to the short maturity of such instruments. The carrying value of our long-term debt approximates the fair value as measured using broker-dealer quotes, which are Level 2 inputs. See Note 4 for a description of fair value and the definition of Level 2 inputs. Changes in accounting standards – adopted standards for current period
ASU No. The most significant impact from adopting the standard relates to our accounting for royalty income on licenses of intellectual property; however, the effect of such change during any individual reporting period will not materially impact our results of operations and financial position. We have determined that the value of these agreements is allocated more heavily to the initial performance obligation. These items are included in other current and non-current assets and liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The time frame between when the customer places an order for products and when it is shipped is less than 12 months. Generally, we invoice customers for payment upon shipment or when goods are pulled from consignment inventory, which results in an unconditional right to consideration. Our contract assets are primarily related to our rights to consideration for satisfied or partially satisfied performance obligations on our royalty agreements for which payment has not been received as of the reporting date. We recognized an increase to opening retained earnings of $206 million, net of taxes, as of January 1, 2018, due to the cumulative impact of adopting ASC 606, with the impact primarily related to our fixed payment patent licensing agreements that were not completed as of the adoption date. A contract asset of $283 million and deferred tax liabilities of $55 million were recorded as of January 1, 2018, related to the transition period adjustments. Occasionally, as of the end of a reporting period, some of the performance obligations associated with contracts will have been unsatisfied or only partially satisfied. In accordance with the practical expedients available in the guidance, we do not disclose the value of unsatisfied performance obligations for contracts with an original expected duration of one year or less. Similarly, we do not disclose information for variable-rate consideration on our sales-based or usage-based royalties for our patent licenses. For royalty income from licensing our patent portfolios, income is allocated to performance obligations that have not yet been satisfied. The remaining performance obligations represent contracted income that has not yet been recognized, including amounts that will be invoiced and recognized as income in future periods. As of June 30, 2018, we had $72 million of remaining performance obligations that had not yet been satisfied. We expect to recognize 22 percent of our remaining performance obligations as income over the next 12 months and the remainder thereafter. As of June 30, 2018, we had contract assets of $275 million. During the six months ended June 30, 2018, our contract assets were reduced by $8 million, due to $16 million of cash received offset by $8 million of income recognized. We generally expense sales commissions when incurred because the amortization period would have been one year or less. Recognition of the costs of these leases on the income statement will be dependent upon their classification as either an operating or a financing lease. We do not expect to have any financing leases at the time of adoption. This standard will be effective for our interim and annual periods beginning January 1, 2019, and must be applied on a modified retrospective basis. In July 2018, the FASB approved an optional transition method to initially account for the impact of the adoption with a cumulative-effect adjustment to the January 1, 2019, rather than the January 1, 2017, financial statements. This will eliminate the need to restate amounts presented prior to January 1, 2019. We will adopt the standard effective January 1, 2019, and we expect to elect this optional transition method, as well as certain practical expedients permitted under the transition guidance within the standard. We are currently evaluating the potential impact of this standard on our financial position, but we do not expect it to have a material impact on our results of operations. ASU No. Using this methodology will result in earlier recognition of losses than under the current incurred loss approach, which requires waiting to recognize a loss until it is probable of having been incurred. There are other provisions within the standard that affect how impairments of other financial assets may be recorded and presented, and that expand disclosures. This standard will be effective for our interim and annual periods beginning January 1, 2020, and permits earlier application but not before periods beginning January 1, 2019. The standard will be applied using a modified retrospective approach. We are currently evaluating the potential impact of this standard, but we do not expect it to have a material impact on our financial position and results of operations. ASU No. The provisions from this guidance are effective for interim and annual periods beginning after January 1, 2019. Early adoption is permitted. We plan to adopt this standard during the interim period in which we complete our accounting for the tax effects of the enactment of the Tax Act, applying the guidance to the period of adoption. This standard will have no impact on our results of operations. We are currently evaluating the potential impact of this standard on our financial position. 3. Income taxes
Our Provision for income taxes was $301 million and $430 million for the second quarters of 2018 and 2017, respectively, and $488 million and $688 million for the first six months of 2018 and 2017, respectively. Our estimated annual effective tax rate is about 20 percent, which does not include discrete tax items. This differs from the 21 percent statutory corporate tax rate due to the effect of U.S. tax benefits, offset by a 2018 transitional tax effect. The estimates could change when additional information on implementation of the provisions of the Tax Act becomes available. The Tax Act was enacted on December 22, 2017. We have not completed our accounting for the tax effects of enactment of the Tax Act. We have made reasonable estimates of the tax on indefinitely reinvested earnings and the effects on our existing deferred tax balances. This resulted in additional tax expense in 2017 of $773 million, consisting of $714 million related to the tax on indefinitely reinvested earnings and $59 million related to remeasuring our existing deferred tax balances. The tax on indefinitely reinvested earnings is based on our non-U.S. post-1986 earnings and profits that we previously deferred from U.S. income taxes. We have not yet completed our calculation of the total post-1986 earnings and profits for these non-U.S. subsidiaries. In the first quarter of 2018, we reduced the amount of income tax expense recorded for indefinitely reinvested earnings to $669 million from $714 million recorded in 2017. In the second quarter of 2018, we reduced the amount of income tax expense recorded for the effects of the Tax Act on our deferred tax balances to $50 million from $59 million recorded in 2017. These adjustments did not affect the estimated annual effective tax rate for 2018. The calculations of the tax effect of the Tax Act for both indefinitely reinvested earnings and deferred tax assets and liabilities are expected to be completed with the preparation of the U.S. 2017 tax return in the fourth quarter of 2018. Valuation of debt and equity investments and certain liabilities
Debt and equity investments
We classify our investments as available for sale, trading, equity method or non-marketable equity. Most of our investments are debt securities, which are classified as available for sale. Available-for-sale and trading securities are stated at fair value, which is generally based on market prices or broker quotes. See Fair-value considerations below. Unrealized gains and losses from available-for-sale debt securities are recorded as an increase or decrease, net of taxes, in AOCI on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. We classify certain mutual funds as trading securities. These mutual funds hold a variety of debt and equity investments intended to generate returns that offset changes in certain deferred compensation liabilities. Our other investments include equity-method investments and non-marketable equity investments, which are not measured at fair value. These investments consist of interests in venture capital funds and other non-marketable equity securities. We did not recognize any credit losses related to available-for-sale investments for the first six months of 2018 and 2017. Proceeds from sales, redemptions and maturities of short-term available-for-sale investments were $1.38 billion and $1.27 billion for the second quarters of 2018 and 2017, respectively, and $2.83 billion and $2.39 billion for the first six months of 2018 and 2017, respectively. Gross realized gains and losses from these sales were not material. Fair-value considerations
We measure and report certain financial assets and liabilities at fair value on a recurring basis. The three-level hierarchy discussed below indicates the extent and level of judgment used to estimate fair-value measurements. Level 2 also includes assets and liabilities that are valued using models or other pricing methodologies that do not require significant judgment since the input assumptions used in the models, such as interest rates and volatility factors, are corroborated by readily observable data. We utilize a third-party data service to provide Level 2 valuations. We verify these valuations for reasonableness relative to unadjusted quotes obtained from brokers or dealers based on observable prices for similar assets in active markets. These values are generally determined using pricing models that utilize management estimates of market participant assumptions. As of June 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017, we had no Level 3 assets or liabilities, other than certain assets held by our postretirement plans. The following are our assets and liabilities that were accounted for at fair value on a recurring basis. These tables do not include cash on hand, assets held by our postretirement plans, or assets and liabilities that are measured at historical cost or any basis other than fair value. Goodwill and acquisition-related intangibles
Goodwill was $4.36 billion as of June 30, 2018, and December 31, 2017. There was no impairment of goodwill during the first six months of 2018 or 2017. Fully amortized assets are written off against accumulated amortization. 6. Debt and lines of credit
Short-term borrowings
We maintain a line of credit to support commercial paper borrowings, if any, and to provide additional liquidity through bank loans. As of June 30, 2018, we had a variable-rate revolving credit facility from a consortium of investment-grade banks that allows us to borrow up to $2 billion until March 2023. As of June 30, 2018, our credit facility was undrawn, and we had no commercial paper outstanding. Long-term debt
We retired $500 million of maturing debt in May 2018. In the second quarter of 2018, we issued an aggregate principal amount of $1.5 billion of fixed-rate, long-term debt due in 2048, comprised of the issuance of $1.3 billion in May 2018 and an additional $200 million in June 2018. We incurred $16 million of issuance and other related costs. We received $1.5 billion in proceeds, net of the original issuance discount and premium, to be used for general corporate purposes. This was net of the amortization of the debt discounts, premiums and debt issuance costs. Capitalized interest was not material. Contingencies
Indemnification guarantees
We routinely sell products with an intellectual property indemnification included in the terms of sale. Historically, we have had only minimal, infrequent losses associated with these indemnities. Consequently, we cannot reasonably estimate any future liabilities that may result. During the periods presented, there have been no material accruals or payments regarding product warranty or product liability. Historically, we have experienced a low rate of payments on product claims. Although we cannot predict the likelihood or amount of any future claims, we do not believe they will have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or liquidity. Our stated warranties for semiconductor products obligate us to repair, replace or credit the purchase price of a covered product back to the buyer. Product claim consideration may exceed the price of our products. General
We are subject to various legal and administrative proceedings. Although it is not possible to predict the outcome of these matters, we believe that the results of these proceedings will not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or liquidity. 9. Supplemental financial information
Acquisition charges
Acquisition charges represent the ongoing amortization of intangible assets resulting from the acquisition of National Semiconductor Corporation. These amounts are included in Other for segment reporting purposes, consistent with how management measures the performance of its segments. See Note 5 for additional information. We have recognized $21 million of restructuring charges on a cumulative basis through June 30, 2018, for severance and benefit costs related to the previously reported reorganization of the product lines within our two reportable segments. We have paid $18 million to terminated employees for severance and benefits. Any further charges are not expected to be material. We have recognized $36 million of restructuring charges on a cumulative basis through June 30, 2018, for severance and benefits costs, as well as accelerated depreciation, related to the phase out of a manufacturing facility in Greenock, Scotland. Total restructuring charges, primarily severance and benefit costs, are estimated to be about $40 million. The remaining charges are expected to be recognized through 2019. The restructuring accrual balances are primarily reported as a component of either Accrued expenses and other liabilities or Other long-term liabilities on our Consolidated Balance Sheets, depending on the expected timing of payment. The table below details where these transactions are recorded in our Consolidated Statements of Income. Stock compensation
Total shares of 2,135,405 and 9,028,819 were issued from treasury shares during the second quarter and first six months of 2018, respectively, related to stock compensation. Management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations. Overview
We design, make and sell semiconductors to electronics designers and manufacturers all over the world. We invest in manufacturing technologies and do most of our manufacturing in-house. This strategic decision to directly control our manufacturing helps ensure a consistent supply of products for our customers and also allows us to invest in technology that differentiates the features of our products. We have focused on creating a competitive manufacturing cost advantage by increasing factory loadings of our advanced analog 300-millimeter wafers, which have about a 40 percent cost advantage per unpackaged chip over 200-millimeter wafers. 300-millimeter wafers will support the majority of our Analog growth going forward. Additionally, we keep our manufacturing costs low by using mature assets acquired ahead of demand when their prices are most attractive. Our customers need multiple chips for their systems. The breadth of our portfolio means we can solve more of these needs than our competitors, which gives us access to more customers and the opportunity to sell more products and generate more revenue per customer system. We invest more than $1 billion each year to develop new products for our portfolio, which includes tens of thousands of products. Customers often begin their initial product selection process and design-in journey on our website, and the breadth of our portfolio attracts more customers to our website than any of our competitors. Our web presence, combined with our global sales force that is also greater in size than those of our competitors, are advantages that give us unique access to about 100,000 customers designing TI semiconductors into their end products. Together, the attributes above result in diverse and long-lived positions that deliver high terminal value to our shareholders. Because of the breadth of our portfolio, we are not dependent on any single product, and because of the breadth of our markets we are not dependent on any single application or customer. Some of our products generate revenue for decades, which strengthens the return on our investments. Our strategic focus, and where we invest the majority of our resources, is on Analog and Embedded Processing, with a particular emphasis on designing and selling those products into the industrial and automotive markets, which we believe represent the best growth opportunities. Analog and embedded processing products sold into industrial and automotive markets provide long product life cycles, intrinsic diversity, and less capital-intensive manufacturing, which we believe offer stability, profitability and strong cash generation. This business model is the foundation of our capital management strategy, which is based on our belief that free cash flow growth, especially on a per share basis, is important for maximizing shareholder value over the long term. We also believe that free cash flow will be valued only if it is productively invested in the business or returned to shareholders. The combined effect of these sustainable competitive advantages is that over time we have gained market share in Analog and Embedded Processing and have grown free cash flow. Our business model puts us in a unique class of companies with the ability to grow, generate cash, and return that cash to shareholders. See Note 1 to the financial statements for more information regarding our segments. When factory loadings decrease, our fixed costs are spread over reduced output and, absent other circumstances, our profit margins decrease. Conversely, as factory loadings increase, our fixed costs are spread over increased output and, absent other circumstances, our profit margins increase. Increases and decreases in factory loadings tend to correspond to increases and decreases in demand. EPS included a 3 cent discrete tax benefit not in our original guidance. Revenue increased 9 percent from the same quarter a year ago. Demand for our Analog and Embedded Processing products continued to be strong in the industrial and automotive markets. Our cash flow from operations of $6.6 billion for the trailing 12 months again underscored the strength of our business model. Free cash flow for the trailing 12 months was $5.7 billion, or 36.6 percent of revenue. This reflects the quality of our product portfolio, as well as the efficiency of our manufacturing strategy, including the benefit of 300-millimeter Analog production. We have returned $5.6 billion to owners in the past 12 months through stock repurchases and dividends, and our strategy to return to owners all of our free cash flow remains consistent. Over the last 12 months, our dividends represented 41 percent of free cash flow, emphasizing their sustainability. We continue to expect our ongoing annual operating tax rate to be about 20 percent in 2018 and 16 percent starting in 2019. For an explanation of free cash flow and the term “annual operating tax rate,” see the Non-GAAP financial information section. Gross profit of $2.62 billion was up $245 million, or 10 percent, primarily due to higher revenue. As a percentage of revenue, gross profit increased to 65.2 percent from 64.3 percent. Acquisition charges of $79 million were non-cash. See Note 9 to the financial statements. Operating profit was $1.71 billion, or 42.6 percent of revenue, compared with $1.48 billion, or 40.1 percent of revenue. Our Provision for income taxes was $301 million compared with $430 million, which includes discrete tax benefits of $43 million and $28 million, respectively. Our annual operating tax rate, which does not include discrete tax items, is about 20 percent compared with 31 percent in 2017. We use “annual operating tax rate” to describe the estimated annual effective tax rate. The 2018 rate differs from the 21 percent U.S. statutory corporate tax rate due to the effect of U.S. tax benefits, offset by a transitional non-cash tax expense. Net income was $1.41 billion compared with $1.06 billion. EPS was $1.40 compared with $1.03. High Volume revenue decreased due to the mix of products shipped. Operating profit increased due to higher revenue and associated gross profit. Operating profit increased primarily due to higher revenue and associated gross profit. Results of operations – first six months of 2018 compared with first six months of 2017
Revenue of $7.81 billion increased $711 million, or 10 percent, due to higher revenue from Analog and Embedded Processing. Gross profit of $5.07 billion was up $548 million, or 12 percent, primarily due to higher revenue. As a percentage of revenue, gross profit increased to 64.9 percent from 63.7 percent. Operating expenses were $1.64 billion compared with $1.62 billion. Acquisition charges of $159 million were non-cash. See Note 9 to the financial statements. Operating profit was $3.26 billion, or 41.8 percent of revenue, compared with $2.73 billion, or 38.5 percent of revenue. Our Provision for income taxes was $488 million compared with $688 million, which includes discrete tax benefits of $172 million and $152 million, respectively. The decrease in our tax provision was primarily due to a lower U.S. statutory corporate tax rate and other net benefits resulting from the Tax Act, partially offset by higher income before income taxes. Net income was $2.77 billion compared with $2.05 billion. EPS was $2.75 compared with $2.00. High Volume revenue decreased due to the mix of products shipped. Operating profit increased due to higher revenue and associated gross profit. Operating profit increased primarily due to higher revenue and associated gross profit. Other revenue decreased by $76 million, and operating profit declined by $40 million. Accounts receivable were $1.55 billion, an increase of $273 million compared with the end of 2017. Days sales outstanding at the end of the second quarter of 2018 were 35 compared with 31 at the end of 2017. Inventory was $2.09 billion, an increase of $133 million from the end of 2017. Days of inventory at the end of the second quarter of 2018 were 135 compared with 134 at the end of 2017. Liquidity and capital resources
Our primary source of liquidity is cash flow from operations. Additional sources of liquidity are Cash and cash equivalents, Short-term investments and a variable-rate, revolving credit facility. Cash flows from operating activities for the first six months of 2018 were $2.94 billion, an increase of $1.23 billion from the year-ago period. This increase was due to higher Net income and a reduction in cash used for working capital, both of which benefited from a lower tax rate. Our revolving credit facility is with a consortium of investment-grade banks and allows us to borrow up to $2 billion until March 2023. This credit facility also serves as support for the issuance of commercial paper. As of June 30, 2018, our credit facility was undrawn, and we had no commercial paper outstanding. Capital expenditures were $438 million compared with $278 million in the year-ago period and were primarily for semiconductor manufacturing equipment in both periods. We had proceeds from sales of short-term investments, net of purchases, that provided cash of $621 million compared with $498 million in the year-ago period. Financing activities for the first six months of 2018 used $1.86 billion compared with $1.99 billion in the year-ago period. In 2018, we received net proceeds of $1.50 billion from the issuance of fixed-rate, long-term debt and retired maturing debt of $500 million. In the year-ago period, we received net proceeds of $605 million from the issuance of fixed-rate, long-term debt and retired maturing debt of $625 million. Dividends paid were $1.22 billion compared with $998 million in the year-ago period, reflecting an increase in the dividend rate, partially offset by fewer shares outstanding. We used $1.89 billion to repurchase 17.8 million shares of our common stock compared with $1.20 billion used in the year-ago period to repurchase 15.2 million shares. Employee exercises of stock options provided cash proceeds of $280 million compared with $245 million in the year-ago period. We had $2.92 billion of Cash and cash equivalents and $2.21 billion of Short-term investments as of June 30, 2018. We believe we have the necessary financial resources and operating plans to fund our working capital needs, capital expenditures, dividend and debt-related payments, and other business requirements for at least the next 12 months. We believe that free cash flow and the associated ratios provide insight into our liquidity, our cash-generating capability and the amount of cash potentially available to return to shareholders, as well as insight into our financial performance. These non-GAAP measures are supplemental to the comparable GAAP measures. Reconciliation to the most directly comparable GAAP measures is provided in the table below. We believe the term annual operating tax rate more clearly communicates that discrete tax items are excluded from such rate. The term also helps differentiate from the effective tax rate, which includes discrete tax items. No adjustments are made to the estimated annual effective tax rate when using the term annual operating tax rate. Long-term contractual obligations
Information regarding long-term debt obligations is described in the long-term contractual obligations table in Item 7 of our Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2017. Additionally, in the first six months of 2018, we issued $1.50 billion principal amount of 4.15 percent notes maturing in 2048 and retired $500 million of maturing debt. Critical accounting policies
Our critical accounting policies are described in Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Critical Accounting Policies in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2017. Changes in accounting standards
