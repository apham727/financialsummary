We use the terms “Accenture,” “we” and “our” in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements to refer to Accenture plc and its subsidiaries. These Consolidated Financial Statements should therefore be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes thereto for the fiscal year ended August 31, 2017 included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC on October 26, 2017.The accompanying unaudited interim Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP, which requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect amounts reported in the Consolidated Financial Statements and accompanying disclosures. Although these estimates are based on management’s best knowledge of current events and actions that we may undertake in the future, actual results may differ from those estimates. The Consolidated Financial Statements reflect all adjustments of a normal, recurring nature that are, in the opinion of management, necessary for a fair presentation of results for these interim periods. The results of operations for the three and six months ended February 28, 2018 are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for the fiscal year ending August 31, 2018. Allowances for Client Receivables and Unbilled ServicesAs of February 28, 2018 and August 31, 2017, total allowances recorded for client receivables and unbilled services were $52,236 and $74,450, respectively. Depreciation and AmortizationDepreciation expense was $107,445 and $213,596 for the three and six months ended February 28, 2018, respectively, and $84,639 and $169,659 for the three and six months ended February 28, 2017, respectively. As of February 28, 2018 and August 31, 2017, total accumulated depreciation was $2,042,405 and $1,912,146, respectively. Deferred transition amortization expense was $71,288 and $153,142 for the three and six months ended February 28, 2018, respectively, and $69,844 and $139,129 for the three and six months ended February 28, 2017, respectively. Under current guidance in U.S. GAAP, in the case of depreciable or amortizable assets, the income tax consequences are deferred at the time of the intra-entity transfer and recognized as the assets are depreciated or amortized. The guidance requires modified retrospective transition with a cumulative catch-up adjustment to opening retained earnings in the period of adoption. The deferred tax assets, which could be up to $2.1 billion, represent income tax consequences of prior intra-entity transfers of assets, which are currently recognized over the expected life of the assets. Beginning in fiscal 2019, we will recognize incremental income tax expense as these deferred tax assets are utilized. Initially, this could represent approximately a 3.5 percentage point increase in the annual effective tax rate. However, the actual impact of adoption will depend on numerous factors, including activity for fiscal 2018 and management’s expectations regarding recoverability of the related deferred taxes. The guidance requires a modified retrospective method upon adoption. September 1, 2019 While we are continuing to assess the potential impact of this ASU, we currently believe the most significant impact relates to our accounting for office space operating leases. The core principle of the ASU is that an entity should recognize revenue for the transfer of goods or services equal to the amount that it expects to be entitled to receive for those goods or services. The ASU requires additional disclosure about the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from customer contracts, including significant judgments and changes in judgments. The guidance allows for both retrospective and modified retrospective methods of adoption. September 1, 2018 We performed an initial assessment of the impact of the ASU and developed a transition plan, including necessary changes to policies, processes, and internal controls as well as system enhancements to generate the information necessary for the new disclosures. The project is on schedule for adoption on September 1, 2018 and we will apply the modified retrospective method. We expect revenue recognition across our portfolio of services to remain largely unchanged. However, we expect to recognize revenue earlier than we do under current guidance in a few areas, including accounting for variable fees and for certain consulting services, which will be recognized over time rather than at a point in time. The income effect does not take into account “Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests — other,” since those shares are not redeemable or exchangeable for Accenture plc Class A ordinary shares. The pro forma effects of these acquisitions on our operations were not material. 5. Total amortization related to our intangible assets was $33,324 and $66,452 for the three and six months ended February 28, 2017, respectively. Subsequent EventOn March 21, 2018, the Board of Directors of Accenture plc declared a semi-annual cash dividend of $1.33 per share on its Class A ordinary shares for shareholders of record at the close of business on April 12, 2018 payable on May 15, 2018. The payment of the cash dividend will result in the issuance of an immaterial number of additional restricted share units to holders of restricted share units.7. DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTSIn the normal course of business, we use derivative financial instruments to manage foreign currency exchange rate risk. Our derivative financial instruments consist of deliverable and non-deliverable foreign currency forward contracts. Cash Flow HedgesFor a cash flow hedge, the effective portion of the change in estimated fair value of a hedging instrument is recorded in Accumulated other comprehensive loss as a separate component of Shareholders’ Equity and is reclassified into Cost of services in the Consolidated Income Statements during the period in which the hedged transaction is recognized. Other DerivativesRealized gains or losses and changes in the estimated fair value of foreign currency forward contracts that have not been designated as hedges were net gains of $56,316 and $46,783 for the three and six months ended February 28, 2018, respectively, and a net gain of $19,780 and a net loss of $118,313 for the three and six months ended February 28, 2017, respectively. In the Consolidated Balance Sheets, we record derivative assets and liabilities at gross fair value. The Tax Act lowered the U.S. statutory federal income tax rate from 35% to 21%, effective January 1, 2018, resulting in a blended U.S. statutory federal income tax rate of 25.7% for our fiscal year ended August 31, 2018. The Tax Act could modestly impact our ongoing effective tax rate by imposing taxes on our intercompany transactions and limiting our ability to deduct certain expenses. Due to the timing of the enactment and the complexity involved in applying the provisions of the Tax Act, we have recorded provisional amounts in our financial statements as of February 28, 2018. We recognized a provisional tax expense of $136,724 primarily to remeasure our net deferred tax assets at the new, lower rates. As we collect and analyze data, including our forecast of when we expect to realize certain deferred tax amounts, we may adjust the provisional amounts. In addition, we have not yet made an accounting policy election to consider the taxes on our intercompany transactions in determining the amount of our valuation allowance. Those adjustments and the election may materially impact our provision for income taxes and effective tax rate in the period in which the adjustments are made. We apply an estimated annual effective tax rate to our year-to-date operating results to determine the interim provision for income tax expense. Our effective tax rates for the three months ended February 28, 2018 and 2017 were 26.1% and 20.7%, respectively. Our effective tax rates for the six months ended February 28, 2018 and 2017 were 23.0% and 20.5%, respectively. Excluding the provisional tax expense, described above, the effective tax rates would have been 15.1% and 18.0% for the three and six months ended February 28, 2018, respectively. The effective tax rates for the three and six months ended February 28, 2018 benefited from lower expenses for adjustments to prior year tax liabilities in fiscal 2018, partially offset by lower benefits from final determinations of prior year U.S. taxes in fiscal 2018. 9. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIESCommitments We have either the right to purchase at fair value or, if certain events occur, may be required to purchase at fair value outstanding shares of our Avanade Inc. and SinnerSchrader AG subsidiaries. As of February 28, 2018 and August 31, 2017, we have reflected the fair value of $93,358 and $52,996, respectively, related to redeemable common stock and the intrinsic value of the options on redeemable common stock of these subsidiaries in Other accrued liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Indemnifications and GuaranteesIn the normal course of business and in conjunction with certain client engagements, we have entered into contractual arrangements through which it may be obligated to indemnify clients with respect to certain matters. As of February 28, 2018 and August 31, 2017, our aggregate potential liability to our clients for expressly limited guarantees involving the performance of third parties was approximately $872,000 and $697,000, respectively, of which all but approximately $154,000 and $149,000, respectively, may be recovered from the other third parties if we are obligated to make payments to the indemnified parties as a consequence of a performance default by the other third parties. For arrangements with unspecified limitations, we cannot reasonably estimate the aggregate maximum potential liability, as it is inherently difficult to predict the maximum potential amount of such payments, due to the conditional nature and unique facts of each particular arrangement. To date, we have not been required to make any significant payment under any of the arrangements described above. Legal ContingenciesAs of February 28, 2018, we or our present personnel had been named as a defendant in various litigation matters. SUBSEQUENT EVENTOn March 13, 2018, Accenture Holdings plc merged with and into Accenture plc. Accenture Holdings plc dissolved and all assets and liabilities were transferred to Accenture plc. The Consolidated Financial Statements reflect the ownership interests in Accenture Holdings plc and Accenture Canada Holdings Inc. held by certain current and former members of Accenture Leadership as noncontrolling interests. Prior to the merger, a 4% non-controlling ownership interest percentage was held by Accenture Holdings plc and Accenture Canada Holdings Inc. and subsequent to the merger, the non-controlling ownership percentage is less than 1% held by only Accenture Canada Holdings Inc.16Table of ContentsITEM 2. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONSThe following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our Consolidated Financial Statements and related Notes included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended August 31, 2017, and with the information under the heading “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended August 31, 2017.We use the terms “Accenture,” “we,” “our” and “us” in this report to refer to Accenture plc and its subsidiaries. All references to years, unless otherwise noted, refer to our fiscal year, which ends on August 31. For example, a reference to “fiscal 2018” means the 12-month period that will end on August 31, 2018. All references to quarters, unless otherwise noted, refer to the quarters of our fiscal year.We use the term “in local currency” so that certain financial results may be viewed without the impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, thereby facilitating period-to-period comparisons of business performance. Financial results “in local currency” are calculated by restating current period activity into U.S. dollars using the comparable prior year period’s foreign currency exchange rates. Words such as “may,” “will,” “should,” “likely,” “anticipates,” “expects,” “intends,” “plans,” “projects,” “believes,” “estimates,” “positioned,” “outlook” and similar expressions are used to identify these forward-looking statements. These statements are not guarantees of future performance and involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions that are difficult to predict. Forward-looking statements are based upon assumptions as to future events that may not prove to be accurate. Actual outcomes and results may differ materially from what is expressed or forecast in these forward-looking statements. This could increase the variability of our revenues and impact our margins.•Our results of operations and share price could be adversely affected if we are unable to maintain effective internal controls.•We might be unable to access additional capital on favorable terms or at all. If we raise equity capital, it may dilute our shareholders’ ownership interest in us.•We are incorporated in Ireland and a significant portion of our assets is located outside the United States. As a result, it might not be possible for shareholders to enforce civil liability provisions of the federal or state securities laws of the United States. We may also be subject to criticism and negative publicity related to our incorporation in Ireland.•Irish law differs from the laws in effect in the United States and might afford less protection to shareholders.For a more detailed discussion of these factors, see the information under the heading “Risk Factors” in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended August 31, 2017. Our forward-looking statements speak only as of the date of this report or as of the date they are made, and we undertake no obligation to update any forward-looking statements.18Table of ContentsOverviewRevenues are driven by the ability of our executives to secure new contracts and to deliver services and solutions that add value relevant to our clients’ current needs and challenges. The level of revenues we achieve is based on our ability to deliver market-leading services and solutions and to deploy skilled teams of professionals quickly and on a global basis. Our results of operations are affected by economic conditions, including macroeconomic conditions and levels of business confidence. There continues to be significant volatility and economic and geopolitical uncertainty in many markets around the world, which may impact our business. We continue to monitor the impact of this volatility and uncertainty and seek to manage our costs in order to respond to changing conditions. There also continues to be volatility in foreign currency exchange rates. The majority of our net revenues are denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar, including the Euro and the U.K. pound. Unfavorable fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates have had and could have in the future a material effect on our financial results. Net revenues for the six months ended February 28, 2018 increased 14% in U.S. dollars and 10% in local currency compared to the six months ended February 28, 2017. Demand for our services and solutions continued to be strong, resulting in growth across all areas of our business. We experienced very strong growth in Growth Markets and Europe and strong growth in North America. Revenue growth in local currency was very strong in consulting and strong in outsourcing during the second quarter of fiscal 2018. While the business environment remained competitive, pricing was relatively stable. We use the term “pricing” to mean the contract profitability or margin on the work that we sell.In our consulting business, net revenues for the second quarter of fiscal 2018 increased 17% in U.S. dollars and 11% in local currency compared to the second quarter of fiscal 2017. Net consulting revenues for the six months ended February 28, 2018 increased 15% in U.S. dollars and 11% in local currency compared to the six months ended February 28, 2017. Our consulting revenue growth continues to be driven by strong demand for digital-, cloud- and security-related services and assisting clients with the adoption of new technologies. In addition, clients continue to be focused on initiatives designed to deliver cost savings and operational efficiency, as well as projects to integrate their global operations and grow and transform their businesses.In our outsourcing business, net revenues for the second quarter of fiscal 2018 increased 13% in U.S. dollars and 8% in local currency compared to the second quarter of fiscal 2017. Net outsourcing revenues for the six months ended February 28, 2018 increased 12% in U.S. dollars and 9% in local currency compared to the six months ended February 28, 2017. We continue to experience growing demand to assist clients with cloud enablement and the operation and maintenance of digital-related services. In addition, clients continue to be focused on transforming their operations to improve effectiveness and cost efficiency.As we are a global company, our revenues are denominated in multiple currencies and may be significantly affected by currency exchange rate fluctuations. If the U.S. dollar weakens against other currencies, resulting in favorable currency translation, our revenues, revenue growth and results of operations in U.S. dollars may be higher. If the U.S. dollar strengthens against other currencies, resulting in unfavorable currency translation, our revenues, revenue growth and results of operations in U.S. dollars may be lower. The U.S. dollar weakened against various currencies during the three and six months ended February 28, 2018 compared to the three and six months ended February 28, 2017, resulting in favorable currency translation and U.S. dollar revenue growth that was approximately 6% and 4% higher, respectively, than our revenue growth in local currency. Assuming that exchange rates stay within recent ranges for the remainder of fiscal 2018, we estimate that our full fiscal 2018 revenue growth in U.S. dollars will be approximately 4.0% higher in U.S. dollars than our revenue growth in local currency.The primary categories of operating expenses include Cost of services, Sales and marketing and General and administrative costs. Cost of services is primarily driven by the cost of client-service personnel, which consists mainly of compensation, subcontractor and other personnel costs, and non-payroll costs on outsourcing contracts. General 19Table of Contentsand administrative costs primarily include costs for non-client-facing personnel, information systems, office space and certain acquisition-related costs.Utilization for the second quarter of fiscal 2018 was 91%, flat with the second quarter of fiscal 2017. We continue to hire to meet current and projected future demand. We proactively plan and manage the size and composition of our workforce and take actions as needed to address changes in the anticipated demand for our services and solutions, given that compensation costs are the most significant portion of our operating expenses. Based on current and projected future demand, we have increased our headcount, the majority of which serve our clients, to approximately 442,000 as of February 28, 2018, compared to approximately 401,000 as of February 28, 2017. The year-over-year increase in our headcount reflects an overall increase in demand for our services and solutions, as well as headcount added in connection with acquisitions. Attrition, excluding involuntary terminations, for the second quarter of fiscal 2018 was 13%, up from 12% in the second quarter of fiscal 2017. We evaluate voluntary attrition, adjust levels of new hiring and use involuntary terminations as means to keep our supply of skills and resources in balance with changes in client demand. In addition, we adjust compensation in certain skill sets and geographies in order to attract and retain appropriate numbers of qualified employees. For the majority of our personnel, compensation increases become effective December 1st of each fiscal year. Gross margin for the six months ended February 28, 2018 was 30.9%, compared with 31.1% for the six months ended February 28, 2017. The decrease in gross margin for three and six months ended February 28, 2018 was principally due to lower consulting contract profitability as well as higher acquisition-related costs, partially offset by cost efficiencies.Sales and marketing and General and administrative costs as a percentage of net revenues were 16.3% for the second quarter of fiscal 2018 and 16.4% for the six months ended February 28, 2018, compared with 16.4% for both the second quarter of fiscal 2017 and six months ended February 28, 2017. We continuously monitor these costs and implement cost-management actions, as appropriate. Operating margin for the six months ended February 28, 2018 was 14.5%, compared with 14.7% for the six months ended February 28, 2017. The effective tax rates for the three and six months ended February 28, 2018 were 26.1% and 23.0%, respectively. The effective tax rates for the three and six months ended February 28, 2017 were 20.7% and 20.5%, respectively. Absent this charge, our effective tax rates for the three and six months ended February 28, 2018 would have been 15.1% and 18.0%, respectively. Diluted earnings per share were $3.16 for the six months ended February 28, 2018, compared with $2.91 for the six months ended February 28, 2017. Excluding the impact of this charge, diluted earnings per share would have been $1.58 for the second quarter of fiscal 2018 and $3.37 for the six months ended February 28, 2018. New BookingsNew bookings for the second quarter of fiscal 2018 were $10.25 billion, with consulting bookings of $5.65 billion and outsourcing bookings of $4.60 billion. Four countries, including Russia, were previously in Growth Markets, but are now included in Europe. Operating expenses before reimbursable expenses for the second quarter of fiscal 2018 increased $1,124 million, or 16%, over the second quarter of fiscal 2017, and increased as a percentage of net revenues to 86.6% from 86.3% during this period.Cost of ServicesCost of services for the second quarter of fiscal 2018 increased $961 million, or 15%, over the second quarter of fiscal 2017, and increased as a percentage of revenues to 71.7% from 71.4% during this period. Cost of services before reimbursable expenses for the second quarter of fiscal 2018 increased $924 million, or 16%, over the second quarter of fiscal 2017, and increased as a percentage of net revenues to 70.3% from 69.9% during this period. Gross margin for the second quarter of fiscal 2018 decreased to 29.7% from 30.1% during the second quarter of fiscal 2017. The decrease in gross margin was principally due to lower consulting contract profitability as well as higher acquisition-related costs, partially offset by cost efficiencies.Sales and MarketingSales and marketing expense for the second quarter of fiscal 2018 increased $128 million, or 15%, over the second quarter of fiscal 2017, and decreased as a percentage of net revenues to 10.4% from 10.5% during this period. General and Administrative Costs General and administrative costs for the second quarter of fiscal 2018 increased $72 million, or 15%, over the second quarter of fiscal 2017, and remained flat as a percentage of net revenues at 5.9% during this period. In addition, during the second quarter of fiscal 2018, we experienced higher acquisition-related costs compared to the second quarter of fiscal 2017. For the second quarter of fiscal 2018, other expense increased $31 million over the second quarter of fiscal 2017, primarily due to higher net foreign exchange losses. Provision for Income TaxesThe effective tax rate for the second quarter of fiscal 2018 was 26.1%, compared with 20.7% for the second quarter of fiscal 2017. In the second quarter of fiscal 2018, we recorded a $137 million charge associated with the enactment of the Tax Act. Absent this charge, our effective tax rate for the second quarter of fiscal 2018 would have been 15.1%. The effective tax rate for the three months ended February 28, 2018 benefited from lower expenses for adjustments to prior year tax liabilities in fiscal 2018, partially offset by lower benefits from final determinations of prior year U.S. taxes in fiscal 2018. The $0.04 increase in our diluted earnings per share included the impact of the $137 million charge associated with the Tax Act, which decreased diluted earnings per share for the second quarter of fiscal 2018 by $0.21. Excluding the impact of this charge, diluted earnings per share for the second quarter of fiscal 2018 increased $0.25 compared with the second quarter of fiscal 2017, due to increases of $0.17 from higher revenues and operating results, $0.10 from a lower effective tax rate and $0.01 from lower weighted average shares outstanding. These increases were partially offset by decreases of $0.02 from higher non-operating expense and $0.01 from higher net income attributable to other non-controlling interests. Four countries, including Russia, were previously in Growth Markets, but are now included in Europe. Operating expenses before reimbursable expenses for the six months ended February 28, 2018 increased $1,977 million, or 14%, over the six months ended February 28, 2017, and increased as a percentage of net revenues to 85.5% from 85.3% during this period.Cost of ServicesCost of services for the six months ended February 28, 2018 increased $1,688 million, or 13% over the six months ended February 28, 2017, and increased as a percentage of revenues to 70.7% from 70.5% during this period. Cost of services before reimbursable expenses for the six months ended February 28, 2018 increased $1,609 million or 14% over the six months ended February 28, 2017, and increased as a percentage of net revenues to 69.1% from 68.9% during this period. Gross margin for the six months ended February 28, 2018 decreased to 30.9% from 31.1% during the six months ended February 28, 2017. The decrease in gross margin was principally due to lower consulting contract profitability as well as higher acquisition-related costs, partially offset by cost efficiencies.Sales and MarketingSales and marketing expense for the six months ended February 28, 2018 increased $241 million, or 14%, over the six months ended February 28, 2017, and remained flat as a percentage of net revenues at 10.5% during this period.General and Administrative Costs General and administrative costs for the six months ended February 28, 2018 increased $128 million, or 13%, over the six months ended February 28, 2017, and decreased as a percentage of net revenues to 5.9% from 6.0% during this period. In addition, during the six months ended February 28, 2018, we experienced higher acquisition-related costs compared to the six months ended February 28, 2017. For the six months ended February 28, 2018, other expense increased $23 million over the six months ended February 28, 2017, primarily due to higher net foreign exchange losses. Provision for Income TaxesThe effective tax rate for the six months ended February 28, 2018 was 23.0%, compared with 20.5% for the six months ended February 28, 2017. In the second quarter of fiscal 2018, we recorded a $137 million charge associated with the enactment of the Tax Act. Absent this charge, our effective tax rate for the six months ended February 28, 2018 would have been 18.0%. The effective tax rate for the six months ended February 28, 2018 benefited from lower expenses for adjustments to prior year tax liabilities in fiscal 2018, partially offset by lower benefits from final determinations of prior year U.S. taxes in fiscal 2018. Our provision for income taxes is based on many factors and subject to volatility year to year. We expect the fiscal 2018 annual effective tax rate to be in the range of 24% to 26%. Excluding the charge associated with the Tax 26Table of ContentsAct, we expect the fiscal 2018 annual effective tax rate to be in the range of 22% to 24%. The $0.25 increase in our diluted earnings per share included the impact of the $137 million charge associated with the Tax Act, which decreased diluted earnings per share for the six months ended February 28, 2018 by $0.21. Excluding the impact of this charge, diluted earnings per share for the six months ended February 28, 2018 increased $0.46 compared with the six months ended February 28, 2017, due to increases of $0.36 from higher revenues and operating results, $0.10 from a lower effective tax rate and $0.03 from lower weighted average shares outstanding. These increases were partially offset by decreases of $0.02 from higher net income attributable to other non-controlling interests and $0.01 from higher non-operating expenses. 27Table of ContentsSubstantially all of our cash is held in jurisdictions where there are no regulatory restrictions or material tax effects on the free flow of funds. Domestic cash inflows for our Irish parent, principally dividend distributions from lower-tier subsidiaries, have been sufficient to meet our historic cash requirements, and we expect this to continue into the future. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017, we entered into agreements that will allow us to establish a commercial paper program for short-term borrowings of up to $1 billion, backed by our syndicated loan facility. These shares are held as treasury shares by Accenture plc and may be utilized to provide for select employee benefits, such as equity awards to our employees. These purchases of shares in connection with employee share plans do not affect our aggregate available authorization for our publicly announced open-market share purchase and the other share purchase programs.We intend to continue to use a significant portion of cash generated from operations for share repurchases during the remainder of fiscal 2018. Additionally, as these factors may change over the course of the year, the amount of share repurchase activity during any particular period cannot be predicted and may fluctuate from time to time. The registration statement allowed us, at our option, to issue freely tradable Accenture plc Class A ordinary shares in lieu of cash upon redemptions of Accenture Holdings plc ordinary shares held by current and former members of Accenture Leadership and their permitted transferees. In connection with the merger of Accenture Holdings plc with and into Accenture plc, we have terminated the registration statement. To date, we have not been required to make any significant payment under any of the arrangements described above. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISKDuring the six months ended February 28, 2018, there were no material changes to the information on market risk exposure disclosed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended August 31, 2017. For a discussion of our market risk associated with foreign currency risk, interest rate risk and equity price risk as of August 31, 2017, see “Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk” in Part II, Item 7A, of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended August 31, 2017.ITEM 4. Any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives. Based on that evaluation, the principal executive officer and the principal financial officer of Accenture plc have concluded that, as of the end of the period covered by this report, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective at the reasonable assurance level.Changes in Internal Control Over Financial ReportingThere has been no change in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the second quarter of fiscal 2018 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.29Table of ContentsPART II — OTHER INFORMATIONITEM 1.
