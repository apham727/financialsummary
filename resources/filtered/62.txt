All adjustments considered necessary for a fair presentation have been included. This report should be read in conjunction with the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2017. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Amounts in tables in the financial statements and accompanying footnotes may not sum due to rounding. The Company adopted Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, with a date of initial application of January 1, 2018. The Company enters into arrangements with customers to provide services, software and software-related services such as maintenance and implementation and training either individually or as part of an integrated offering of multiple services. To identify its performance obligations, the Company considers all of the solutions or services promised in the contract regardless of whether they are explicitly stated or are implied by customary business practices. The Company recognizes revenue when or as it satisfies a performance obligation by transferring control of a solution or service to a customer.Revenue is measured based on the consideration that the Company expects to receive in a contract with a customer. The Company’s contracts with its customers frequently contain variable consideration. Variable consideration exists when the amount which the Company expects to receive in a contract is based on the occurrence or non-occurrence of future events, such as processing services performed under usage-based pricing arrangements or professional services billed on a time and materials basis. Variable consideration is also present in certain transactions in the form of discounts, credits, price concessions, penalties, and similar items. If the amount of a discount or rebate in a contract is fixed and not contingent, that discount or rebate is not variable consideration. The Company estimates variable consideration in its contracts primarily using the expected value method. In some contracts, the Company applies the most likely amount method by considering the single most likely amount in a limited range of possible consideration amounts. Variable consideration included in the transaction price is constrained such that a significant revenue reversal is not probable. Taxes collected from customers and remitted to governmental authorities are not included in revenue. Postage costs associated with print and mail services are accounted for as a fulfillment cost and are included in cost of revenues.Technology or service components from third parties are frequently embedded in or combined with our applications or service offerings. We are often responsible for billing the client in these arrangements and transmitting the applicable fees to the third party. The Company determines whether it is responsible for providing the actual solution or service as a principal, or for arranging for the solution or service to be provided by the third party as an agent. Judgment is applied to determine whether we are the principal or the agent by evaluating whether the Company has control of the solution or service prior to it being transferred to the customer. The principal versus agent assessment is performed at the performance obligation level. Indicators that the Company considers in determining if it has control include whether the Company is primarily responsible for fulfilling the promise to provide the specified solution or service to the customer, the Company has inventory risk and the Company has discretion in establishing the price the customer ultimately pays for the solution or service. Depending upon the level of our contractual responsibilities and obligations for delivering solutions to end customers, we have arrangements where we are the principal and recognize the gross amount billed to the customer and other arrangements where we are the agent and recognize the net amount retained. If the allocation objective is met at contractual prices, no allocations are made. Otherwise, the Company allocates the transaction price to each performance obligation identified in the contract on a relative standalone selling price basis, except when the criteria are met for allocating variable consideration or a discount to one or more, but not all performance obligations in the contract. Determining whether the criteria for allocating variable consideration to one or more, but not all, performance obligations in the contract requires significant judgment and may affect the timing and amount of revenue recognized. The Company does not typically meet the requirements to allocate discounts to one or more, but not all, performance obligations in a contract.In order to determine the standalone selling price of its promised solutions or services, the Company conducts a regular analysis to determine whether various solutions or services have an observable standalone selling price. If the Company does not have an observable standalone selling price for a particular solution or service, then standalone selling price for that particular solution or service is estimated using all information that is reasonably available and maximizing observable inputs with approaches including historical pricing, cost plus a margin, adjusted market assessment, and residual approach.The following describes the nature of the Company’s primary types of revenues and the revenue recognition policies and significant payment terms as they pertain to the types of transactions the Company enters into with its customers.Processing Services RevenuesProcessing services are primarily comprised of data processing and application management, including our SaaS, BPaaS, and cloud offerings. Revenues from processing services are typically volume- or activity-based depending on factors such as the number of accounts processed, transactions or trades processed, users, number of hours of services or computer resources used. The payment terms may include tiered pricing structures with the base tier representing a minimum monthly usage fee. Pricing within the tiers typically resets on a monthly basis and minimum monthly volumes are generally met or exceeded. Contract lengths for processing services typically span multiple years. Payment is generally due in advance or in arrears on a monthly or quarterly basis and may include fixed or variable payment amounts depending on the specific payment terms and activity in the period. For processing services revenues, the nature of the Company’s promise to the customer is to stand ready to provide continuous access to the Company’s processing platforms and perform an unspecified quantity of outsourced and transaction-processing services for a specified term or terms. Accordingly, processing services are generally viewed as a stand-ready performance obligation comprised of a series of distinct daily services. A time-elapsed output method is used to measure progress because the Company’s efforts are expended evenly throughout the period given the nature of the promise is a stand-ready service. The Company has evaluated its variable payment terms related to its processing services revenues accounted for as a series of distinct days of service and concluded that they generally meet the criteria for allocating variable consideration entirely to one or more, but not all, performance obligations in a contract. Accordingly, when the criteria are met, variable amounts based on the number and type of services performed during a period are allocated to and recognized on the day in which the Company performs the related services. Fixed fees for processing services are generally recognized ratably over the contract period.Professional Services RevenuesProfessional services revenues are comprised of implementation, conversion, and programming services associated with the Company’s data processing and application management agreements, implementation or installation services related to licensed software, and other consulting services. A significant portion of our professional services revenues are derived from contracts for dedicated personnel resources who are often working full-time at a client site and under the client's direction. These revenues generally re-occur as contracts are renewed. Implementation services and other professional services are typically considered distinct performance obligations. However, when these services involve significant customization or modification of an underlying solution or offering, or if the services are complex and not available from a third-party provider and must be completed prior to a customer having the ability to benefit from a solution or offering, then such services and the underlying solution or offering will be accounted for as a combined performance obligation. For professional services that are distinct and billed on a time and materials basis, revenue is generally recognized using an output method that corresponds with the time and materials billed and delivered, which is reflective of the transfer of the services to the customer. Additionally, the nature of the Company’s promise in granting these software licenses to a customer is typically to provide the customer a right to use the Company’s intellectual property. The Company’s software licenses are generally considered distinct performance obligations, and revenue allocated to the software license is typically recognized at a point in time upon delivery of the license.In conjunction with software licenses, the Company commonly provides the customer with additional services such as maintenance as well as associated implementation and other professional services related to the software license. Payments for maintenance are typically due annually, quarterly, or monthly in advance. Maintenance is typically comprised of technical support and unspecified updates and upgrades. The Company generally satisfies these performance obligations evenly using a time-elapsed output method over the contract term given there is no discernible pattern of performance. When a software license contract also includes professional services that provide significant modification or customization of the software license, the Company combines the software license and professional services into a single performance obligation, and revenue for the combined performance obligation is recognized as the professional services are provided consistent with the methods described above for professional services revenues. The licensed software may be considered a separate performance obligation from the hosting services if the customer can take possession of the software during the contractual term without incurring a significant penalty and if it is feasible for the customer to run the software on its own infrastructure or hire a third party to host the software. If the licensed software and hosting services are separately identifiable, license revenues are recognized when the hosting services commence and it is within the customer's control to obtain a copy of the software, and hosting revenues are recognized using the time-elapsed output method as the service is provided. If the software license is not separately identifiable from the hosting service, then the related revenues for the combined performance obligation are recognized ratably over the hosting period. Occasionally, the Company offers extended payment terms on its license transactions and evaluates whether any potential significant financing components exist. For certain of its business units, the Company will provide a software license through a rental model for customers who would prefer a periodic fee instead of a larger up-front payment. Revenue recognition under these arrangements follow the same recognition pattern as the arrangements outlined above; however, the customer generally pays for the software license and maintenance in monthly or quarterly installments as opposed to an upfront software license fee. Judgment is required to determine whether these arrangements contain a significant financing component. The Company evaluates whether there is a significant difference between the amount of promised consideration over the rental term and the cash selling price of the software license, and the overall impact of the time value of money on the transaction. Rental software license arrangements that include a significant financing component are adjusted for the time value of money at the Company’s incremental borrowing rate by recording a contract asset and interest income. The Company does not adjust the promised amount of consideration for the effects of the time value of money if it is expected, at contract inception, that the period between when the Company transfers a promised solution or service to a customer and when the customer pays for that solution or service will be one year or less.Hardware and Other RevenuesHardware and other miscellaneous revenues are generally recognized at a point in time upon delivery. The Company typically does not stock in inventory the hardware solutions sold but arranges for delivery of hardware from third-party suppliers. The Company determines whether hardware delivered from third-party suppliers should be recognized on a gross or net basis by evaluating whether the Company has control of the solution or service prior to it being transferred to the customer.Material RightsSome of the Company’s contracts with customers include options for the customer to acquire additional solutions or services in the future, including options to renew existing services. Options may represent a material right to acquire solutions or services if the discount is incremental to the range of discounts typically given for those solutions or services to that class of customer in that geographical area or market, and the customer would not have obtained the option without entering into the contract. If deemed to be a material right, the Company will account for the material right as a separate performance obligation and determine the standalone selling price based on directly observable prices when available. If the standalone selling price is not directly observable, then the Company estimates the standalone selling price to be equal to the discount that the customer would obtain by exercising the option, as adjusted for any discount that the customer would receive without exercising the option and for the likelihood that the option will be exercised. Origination costs relate primarily to the payment of sales commissions that are directly related to sales transactions. Fulfillment costs include the cost of implementation services related to SaaS and other cloud-based arrangements when the implementation service is not distinct from the ongoing service. When origination costs and fulfillment costs that will be used to satisfy future performance obligations are directly related to the execution of our contracts with customers, and the costs are recoverable under the contract, the costs are capitalized as a deferred contract cost. Origination costs for contracts that contain a distinct software license recognized at a point in time are allocated between the license and all other performance obligations of the contract and amortized according to the pattern of performance for the respective obligations. Otherwise, origination costs are capitalized as a single asset for each contract and amortized using an appropriate single measure of performance considering all of the performance obligations in the contract. The Company amortizes origination costs over the expected benefit period to which the deferred contract cost relates. Commissions paid on renewals are amortized over the renewal period. Capitalized fulfillment costs are amortized over the lesser of the useful life of the solution or the expected customer relationship period. As a result, the Company has changed its accounting policy for revenue recognition. For completed contracts that have variable consideration, the Company uses the transaction price at the date the contract was completed rather than estimating variable consideration amounts in the comparative reporting periods. Further, the Company does not disclose the amount of consideration allocated to the remaining performance obligations or an explanation of when the Company expects to recognize that amount as revenue for the 2016 and 2015 reporting periods presented before the date of the initial application. Lastly, the Company did not retrospectively restate contracts modified before the beginning of the earliest reporting period presented but reflects the aggregate effect of all modifications that occurred before the beginning of the earliest period presented.Principal vs. Agent ConsiderationsIn customer transactions that also involve third parties, the Company determines whether it is responsible for providing the ultimate solution or service as a principal, or whether it is merely arranging for the solution or service to be provided by the third party as an agent. When the Company is acting as a principal in a transaction, the Company recognizes the gross amounts billed as revenue. When the Company is acting as an agent in a transaction, the Company recognizes the net amount retained as revenue. Previously, the Company followed the guidance of Topic 605, which lists eight specific indicators that are determinative in evaluating whether a contract is recorded on a gross or a net basis. Under Topic 606, the determination is based on whether an entity obtains control of goods or services prior to transfer to a customer. The Company determined interchange and third-party network fees associated with certain parts of the payment processing business were significantly impacted by the adoption of Topic 606. Previously, gross accounting applied to certain types of these transactions, depending on the specific facts and circumstances. However, under Topic 606 revenues from these arrangements will be presented on a net basis because the Company has concluded that it is acting as an agent in the transaction. Software License RentalsThe Company previously recognized revenue for initial license fees only when a contract existed, the fee was fixed or determinable, software delivery had occurred, collection was deemed probable, and vendor specific objective evidence of fair value had been established for any undelivered elements in the arrangement. If those criteria were not met, the initial license revenue was either deferred or recognized over time depending on the specific facts and circumstances. Software license rentals typically include payments that are delayed for a period of time, causing the Company to conclude that some portion of the license fee was not fixed or determinable. In these arrangements, license revenue would be deferred until payments become due and payable. Under Topic 606, the Company’s software licenses are generally considered distinct performance obligations, and revenue allocated to the software license is typically recognized at a point in time upon delivery of the license. Software license revenue is also typically recognized at a point in time upon delivery of the license under Topic 606 even if it is sold in a rental model or with extended payment terms, provided collectability is probable. Accordingly, a larger portion of software license revenue is recognized upfront for such transactions under Topic 606 than under Topic 605.Term License Early RenewalsThe Company previously recognized revenue for term software license renewals upon execution of a license renewal contract, provided all other revenue recognition requirements were met. Under Topic 606, revenue attributable to software term license renewals is now recognized at a later date than it would have been recognized under the previous accounting policy. In some cases, customers pay in advance of our delivery of solutions or services; in other cases, payment is due as services are performed or in arrears following the delivery of the solutions or services. Differences in timing between revenue recognition and invoicing result in accrued trade receivables, contract assets, or deferred revenue on our Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet. This occurs most commonly when software term licenses recognized at a point in time are paid for periodically over the license term. Contract assets are transferred to receivables when the rights become unconditional, typically upon invoicing of the related performance obligations in the contract or upon achieving the requisite project milestone. Deferred revenues are relieved as revenue is recognized. Contract assets and deferred revenues are reported on a contract-by-contract basis at the end of each reporting period. Changes in the contract asset and deferred revenue balances during the three months ended March 31, 2018 were not materially impacted by any factors other than those described above. Transaction Price Allocated to the Remaining Performance ObligationsAs of March 31, 2018, approximately $19.5 billion of revenue is estimated to be recognized in the future from the Company’s remaining unfulfilled performance obligations, which are primarily comprised of recurring account- and volume-based processing services. This excludes the amount of anticipated recurring renewals not yet contractually obligated. The Company expects to recognize approximately 35% of our remaining performance obligations over the next 12 months, approximately another 25% over the next 13 to 24 months, and the balance thereafter. Amortization expense for the quarter with respect to these intangible assets was $167 million. Settlement deposits represent funds we hold that were drawn from our clients to facilitate settlement activities. Settlement receivables represent amounts funded by us. Settlement payables consist of settlement deposits from clients, settlement payables to third parties, and outstanding checks related to our settlement activities for which the right of offset does not exist or we do not intend to exercise our right of offset. As of March 31, 2018, the weighted average interest rate on the Revolving Loan, excluding fees, was 2.73%. The obligations of FIS under the FIS Credit Agreement and under all of its outstanding senior notes rank equal in priority and are unsecured. As a result of the redemption of the Notes and the pay down of the 2018 Term Loans, FIS incurred a pre-tax charge of approximately $25 million consisting of the call premium on the Notes and the write-off of previously capitalized debt issuance costs.On July 10, 2017, FIS issued €1,000 million and £300 million principal amount of new senior notes in an inaugural European bond offering. We monitor the financial stability of our counterparties on an ongoing basis. The lender commitments under the undrawn portions of the Revolving Loan are comprised of a diversified set of financial institutions, both domestic and international. The failure of any single lender to perform its obligations under the Revolving Loan would not adversely impact our ability to fund operations.The fair value of the Company’s long-term debt is estimated to be approximately $14 million lower than the carrying value as of March 31, 2018. This estimate is based on quoted prices of our senior notes and trades of our other debt in close proximity to March 31, 2018, which are considered Level 2-type measurements. This estimate is subjective in nature and involves uncertainties and significant judgment in the interpretation of current market data. Therefore, the values presented are not necessarily indicative of amounts the Company could realize or settle currently. Net Investment Hedges In June 2017, the Company entered into two Euro-denominated foreign currency exchange forward contracts totaling €999 million and a GBP-denominated foreign currency exchange forward contract of £298 million, which were designated as a net investment hedge of its investment in Euro and GBP denominated operations, respectively, in order to reduce the volatility in the income statement caused by the changes in foreign currency exchange rates of the Euro and GBP with respect to the U.S. dollar. The ineffective portion of the hedging instruments impacts net income when the ineffectiveness occurs. During the first quarter of 2018, net investment hedge combined losses of $38 million, net of tax, respectively, were recognized in other comprehensive income as a component of foreign currency translation adjustments. No ineffectiveness was recorded on the net investment hedges above. Plaintiffs in the action seek damages and attorneys’ fees, as well as equitable relief, for alleged breaches of fiduciary duty and prohibited transactions under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974. The action also makes claims against the Plan's sponsor and record-keeper. Reliance Trust Company is vigorously defending the action and believes that it has meritorious defenses. Transpev’s remaining assets were later acquired by Prosegur, an unrelated third party. When Transpev discontinued its operations after the asset sale to Prosegur, it had unpaid federal taxes and social contributions owing to the Brazilian tax authorities. The Brazilian tax authorities brought a claim against Transpev and beginning in 2012 brought claims against Prosegur and Servicos on the grounds that Prosegur and Servicos were successors in interest to Transpev. To date, the Brazilian tax authorities filed 11 claims against Servicos asserting potential tax liabilities of approximately $15 million. These additional claims amount to approximately $56 million making the total potential exposure for all 36 claims approximately $71 million. Historically, the Company has not made any material payments under such indemnifications, but continues to monitor the conditions that are subject to the indemnifications to identify whether it is probable that a loss has occurred, and would recognize any such losses when they are estimable. In addition, the Company warrants to customers that its software operates substantially in accordance with the software specifications. Historically, no material costs have been incurred related to software warranties and no accruals for warranty costs have been made. FIS also provides ongoing management consulting services and other services to Cardinal. The original accounting for this transaction resulted in the establishment of a contract intangible asset and a liability for amounts payable to the original partner banks upon final migration of their respective card portfolios and achieving targeted volumes. The unamortized contract intangible asset balance as of March 31, 2018 was $61 million. The carrying value of the noncontrolling interest as of March 31, 2018 was $109 million.The Company recorded revenues of $87 million and $80 million during the three months ended March 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively, from Banco Bradesco. Revenues from Banco Bradesco included $3 million of unfavorable currency impact during the three months ended March 31, 2018, resulting from foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations between the U.S. Dollar and Brazilian Real. This share repurchase authorization replaced any existing share repurchase authorization. The divestiture is consistent with our strategy to focus on our IP-led businesses. The businesses sold were included within the GFS and IFS segments. The sale did not meet the standard necessary to be reported as discontinued operations; therefore, the pre-tax loss and related prior period earnings remain reported within earnings. Prior to the sale, the Capco consulting business and risk and compliance consulting business' pre-tax earnings, excluding certain unallocated corporate costs, for the period ended March 31, 2017 was $4 million. After the sale on July 31, 2017, FIS began to recognize after-tax equity method investment earnings outside of operating income and segment Adjusted EBITDA. The divestiture is consistent with our strategy to serve the financial services markets. Net cash proceeds, after payment of taxes and transaction-related expenses, were approximately $500 million. The sale did not meet the standard necessary to be reported as discontinued operations; therefore, the gain and related prior period earnings remain reported within earnings. Clients in this segment include regional and community banks, credit unions and commercial lenders, as well as government institutions, merchants and other commercial organizations. IFS’ primary software applications function as the underlying infrastructure of a financial institution's processing environment. These applications include core bank processing software, which banks use to maintain the primary records of their customer accounts, and complementary applications and services that interact directly with the core processing applications. This market is primarily served through integrated solutions and characterized by multi-year processing contracts that generate highly recurring revenues. The predictable nature of cash flows generated from this segment provides opportunities for further investments in innovation, integration, information and security, and compliance in a cost effective manner. GFS clients include the largest global financial institutions, including those headquartered in the United States, as well as all international financial institutions we serve as clients in more than 130 countries. These institutions face unique business and regulatory challenges and account for the majority of financial institution information technology spend globally. The purchasing patterns of GFS clients vary from those of IFS clients who typically purchase solutions on an outsourced basis. GFS clients purchase our solutions and services in various ways including licensing and managing technology “in-house”, fully outsourced end-to-end solutions, and using consulting and third-party service providers. We have long-established relationships with many of these financial institutions that generate significant recurring revenue. GFS clients also include asset managers, buy- and sell-side securities and trading firms, insurers and private equity firms. The overhead and leveraged costs relate to marketing, corporate finance and accounting, human resources, legal, and amortization of acquisition-related intangibles and other costs that are not considered when management evaluates revenue-generating segment performance, such as acquisition integration and severance costs. The Corporate and Other segment also includes the impact on revenue for 2018 and 2017 of adjusting SunGard's deferred revenue to fair value. During the three months ended March 31, 2018 and 2017, the Company recorded certain costs relating to integration and severance activity primarily from the SunGard acquisition of $57 million and $80 million, respectively.Adjusted EBITDAThis measure is reported to the chief operating decision maker for purposes of making decisions about allocating resources to the segments and assessing their performance. For this reason, Adjusted EBITDA, as it relates to our segments, is presented in conformity with Accounting Standards Codification Topic 280, "Segment Reporting". The non-operating items affecting the segment profit measure generally include acquisition accounting adjustments, acquisition, integration and severance costs, and restructuring expenses. For consolidated reporting purposes, these costs and adjustments are recorded in the Corporate and Other segment for the periods discussed below. Adjusted EBITDA for the respective segments excludes the foregoing costs and adjustments. Summarized financial information for the Company’s segments is shown in the following tables. Long-term assets, excluding goodwill and other intangible assets, located outside of the United States total $577 million and $535 million as of March 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. These assets are predominantly located in Brazil, India, Germany and the United Kingdom. This share repurchase authorization replaced any existing share repurchase authorization plan. Approximately $3.5 billion of plan capacity remained available for repurchases as of March 31, 2018. 26Table of ContentsITEM 2.

OverviewFIS is a global leader in financial services technology with a focus on retail and institutional banking, payments, asset management and wealth and retirement, risk and compliance and outsourcing solutions. Through the depth and breadth of our solutions portfolio, global capabilities and domain expertise, FIS serves more than 20,000 clients in over 130 countries. Headquartered in Jacksonville, Florida, FIS employs more than 53,000 people worldwide and holds leadership positions in payment processing, financial software and banking solutions. We have grown organically as well as through acquisitions, which have contributed critical applications and services that complement or enhance our existing offerings, diversifying our revenues by customer, geography and service offering. Revenues by segment and the adjusted EBITDA of our segments are discussed below in Segment Results of Operations. Business Trends and ConditionsOur revenue is primarily derived from a combination of recurring technology and processing services, professional services and software license fees. The majority of our revenue has historically been recurring, and has been provided under multi-year contracts that contribute relative stability to our revenue stream. These services, in general, are considered critical to our clients' operations. A considerable portion of these recurring revenues is derived from transaction processing fees that fluctuate with the level of accounts and card transactions, among other variable measures, associated with consumer, commercial and capital markets activity. Professional services revenues are typically non-recurring, and sales of software licenses are less predictable, a portion of which can be regarded as discretionary spending by our clients. The SunGard acquisition broadened our solution portfolio, enabling us to expand beyond our traditional banking and payments markets into the institutional and wholesale side of financial institutions as well as other capital markets organizations. It also significantly expanded our existing solutions and client base in wealth and retirement, treasury and corporate payments. These solutions are in demand among our regional and community financial institution clients as they look for ways to replace highly regulated fee revenues. The combination also favorably impacted our revenue mix, with a greater concentration of license revenues and higher margin services. Through the integration of SunGard into our existing operations, we achieved significant cost savings around administration and technology expenses, and exited 2017 with a cost synergy run-rate savings exceeding $325 million. We are actively migrating many financial institutions to outsourced integrated technology solutions to improve their profitability and address increasing and on-going regulatory requirements. As a provider of outsourcing solutions, we benefit from multi-year recurring revenue streams, which help moderate the effects of broader year-to-year economic and market changes that otherwise might have a larger impact on our results of operations. We believe our integrated solutions and outsourced services are well-positioned to address this outsourcing trend across the markets we serve.Consumer preference continues to shift from traditional branch banking services to digital banking solutions, and our clients seek to provide a single integrated banking experience through their branch, mobile, internet and voice-banking channels. We are focused on enabling our clients to deliver this experience to their customers through our integrated solutions and services. We continue to innovate and invest in these integrated solutions and services to assist clients as they address this market demand. This is an area of on-going competition from global banks, international providers and disruptive technology innovators. 28Table of ContentsWe continue to see demand for innovative solutions in the payments market that will deliver faster, more convenient payment solutions in mobile channels, internet applications and cards. We believe digital payments will grow and partially replace existing payment tender volumes over time as consumers and merchants embrace the convenience, incremental services and benefits. Digital payment volume is growing significantly but does not yet represent a meaningful amount of the payments market. Additionally, new formidable non-traditional payments competitors and large merchants are investing in and innovating digital payment technologies to address the emerging market opportunity, and it is unclear the extent to which particular technologies or services will succeed. We believe the growth of digital payments continues to present both an opportunity and a risk to us as the market develops. Although we cannot predict which digital payment technologies or solutions will be successful, we cautiously believe our client relationships, payments infrastructure and experience, adapted solutions and emerging solutions are well-positioned to maintain or grow our clients' existing payment volumes, which is our focus. High profile North American merchant payment card information security breaches have pushed the payment card industry towards EMV integrated circuit cards as financial institutions, card networks and merchants seek to improve information security and reduce fraud costs. We invested in our card management solutions and card manufacturing and processing capabilities to accommodate EMV integrated circuit cards so we can continue to guide our clients through this technology transition and grow our card-driven businesses. A large portion of the migration to EMV is complete. The remaining portion will continue as financial institutions issue replacement cards.We anticipate consolidation within the banking industry will continue, primarily in the form of merger and acquisition activity, which we believe as a whole is detrimental to our business. However, consolidation resulting from specific merger and acquisition transactions may be beneficial to our business. When consolidations of financial institutions occur, merger partners often operate systems obtained from competing service providers. The newly formed entity generally makes a determination to migrate its core and payments systems to a single platform. When a financial institution processing client is involved in a consolidation, we may benefit by their expanding the use of our services if such services are chosen to survive the consolidation and support the newly combined entity. Conversely, we may lose revenue if we are providing services to both entities, or if a client of ours is involved in a consolidation and our services are not chosen to survive the consolidation and support the newly combined entity. It is also possible that larger financial institutions resulting from consolidation may have greater leverage in negotiating terms or could decide to perform in-house some or all of the services that we currently provide or could provide. We seek to mitigate the risks of consolidations by offering other competitive services to take advantage of specific opportunities at the surviving company. Notwithstanding challenging global economic conditions, our on-going international business continued to experience growth in the first quarter of 2018 on a constant currency basis. Demand for our solutions may also continue to be driven in developing countries by government-led financial inclusion policies aiming to reduce the unbanked population and by growth in the middle classes in these markets driving the need for more sophisticated banking solutions. The majority of our European revenue is generated by clients in the United Kingdom, France and Germany. In 2018, we anticipate minimal foreign currency impacts.Brazilian Venture revenue attributable to our Brazilian Venture partner, Banco Bradesco, was $87 million during the three months ended March 31, 2018 and $317 million during the year ended December 31, 2017. The contract that we have with our Brazilian Venture partner allows for the termination or partial termination of the contract, which ends September 30, 2020, at any point during the 10-year term if minimum targets are met. Minimum targets under the Brazilian Venture agreement have been met and the parties have begun negotiations to determine their future business relationship. During these negotiations, the Brazilian Venture agreement remains in effect. Depending on the results of these negotiations, our future revenue and earnings growth in Brazil could be adversely impacted. This is a trend we expect to continue. Such attacks have become a point of focus for individuals, businesses and governmental entities. The objectives of these attacks include, among other things, gaining unauthorized access to systems to facilitate financial fraud, disrupt operations, cause denial of service events, corrupt data, and steal non-public information. These circumstances present both a threat and an opportunity for FIS. As part of our business, we electronically receive, process, store and transmit a wide range of confidential information, including sensitive customer information and personal consumer data. We also operate payment, cash access and prepaid card systems. FIS remains focused on making strategic investments in information security to protect our clients and our information systems. This includes both capital expenditures and operating expense on hardware, software, personnel and consulting services. We also participate in industry and governmental initiatives to improve information security for our clients. These businesses had lower margins than many of our other businesses. The consulting businesses sold were included within the GFS and IFS segments. We are frequently a party to multiple concurrent contracts with the same client. These situations require judgment to determine whether the individual contracts should be combined or evaluated separately for purposes of revenue recognition. In making this determination, we consider the timing of negotiating and executing the contracts, whether the different elements of the contracts are negotiated as a package with a single commercial objective, whether the solutions or services promised in the contracts are a single performance obligation, and whether any of the payment terms of the contracts are interrelated. Our individual contracts also frequently include multiple promised solutions or services. We must apply judgment in these circumstances in determining whether individual promised solutions or services can be considered distinct or should instead be combined with other promised solutions or services in the contract. We recognize revenue when or as we satisfy a performance obligation by transferring control of a solution or service to a customer. We must use judgment to determine the appropriate measure of progress for performance obligations satisfied over time and the timing of when the customer obtains control for performance obligations satisfied at a point in time. Judgment is also required in estimating and allocating variable consideration to one or more, but not all, performance obligations in a contract, determining the standalone selling prices of each performance obligation, and allocating the transaction price to each distinct performance obligation in a contract. Due to the large number, broad nature and average size of individual contracts we are party to, the impact of judgments and assumptions that we apply in recognizing revenue for any single contract is not likely to have a material effect on our consolidated operations or financial position. However, the broader accounting policy assumptions that we apply across similar contracts or classes of clients could significantly influence the timing and amount of revenue recognized in our historical and future results of operations or financial position. Additionally, the three months ended March 31, 2018 also benefited from a $22 million favorable foreign currency impact primarily resulting from a weaker U.S. Dollar in 2018. Cost of Revenues and Gross ProfitCost of revenues totaled $1,414 million and $1,491 million during the three-month periods ended March 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively, resulting in gross profit of $652 million and $657 million during the respective three-month periods. The change in gross profit during the 2018 period as compared to 2017 primarily resulted from the revenue variances noted above. The gross profit percentage change during the three months ended March 31, 2018, as compared to 2017 is positively impacted by the Capco consulting business divestiture during 2017, as well as realization of ongoing expense synergies. 31Table of ContentsSelling, General and Administrative ExpensesSelling, general and administrative expenses totaled $358 million and $411 million during the three-month periods ended March 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. The changes in operating income for the three month period of 2018 as compared to 2017 resulted from the variances addressed above. The increase in operating margin resulted primarily from integration and cost management initiatives and the Capco consulting business divestiture during 2017. Provision for Income TaxesIncome tax expense totaled $34 million and $74 million during the three-month periods ended March 31, 2018 and 2017, resulting in effective tax rates of 15% and 35%, respectively. The 2018 effective tax rate includes the impact of the reduction in the US federal income tax rate from 35% to 21% due to tax reform enacted December 22, 2017. The Company included provisional amounts in its December 31, 2017 annual financial statements for certain tax reform items. These items were provisional as the data necessary for their completion was not fully available. As a result, we recorded a $1 million loss from this equity method investment during the first quarter of 2018.Earnings, Net of Tax, Attributable to FIS Common StockholdersEarnings, net of tax, attributable to FIS common stockholders totaled $182 million and $129 million resulting in earnings per diluted share of $0.54 and $0.39 for the three-month periods ended March 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. For this reason, Adjusted EBITDA, as it relates to our segments, is presented in conformity with Accounting Standards Codification Topic 280, "Segment Reporting". The non-operating items affecting the segment profit measure generally include acquisition accounting adjustments, acquisition, integration and severance costs, and restructuring expenses. For consolidated reporting purposes, these costs and adjustments are recorded in the Corporate and Other segment for the periods discussed below. Adjusted EBITDA for the respective segments excludes the foregoing costs and adjustments. Adjusted EBITDA margin increased 10 basis points to 42.5% primarily driven by a revenue mix shift and continued cost management. Adjusted EBITDA increased $40 million, or 15.2%, primarily resulting from realization of ongoing expense synergies. Adjusted EBITDA margins increased 650 basis points to 32.9% resulting from the positive impact of the Capco consulting business divestiture during 2017, as well as realization of ongoing expense synergies. Our cash requirements also include payments for labor claims related to FIS' former item processing and remittance operations in Brazil. As of March 31, 2018, we had cash and cash equivalents of $725 million and long-term debt of $9.1 billion, including the current portion, net of capitalized debt issuance costs. Of the $725 million cash and cash equivalents, approximately $455 million is held by our foreign entities. The majority of our domestic cash and cash equivalents represents net deposits-in-transit at the balance sheet dates and relates to daily settlement activity. We expect that cash and cash equivalents plus cash flows from operations over the next twelve months will be sufficient to fund our operating cash requirements, capital expenditures and mandatory debt service. We currently expect to continue to pay quarterly dividends. However, the amount, declaration and payment of future dividends is at the discretion of the Board of Directors and depends on, among other things, our investment opportunities, results of operations, financial condition, cash requirements, future prospects, and other factors that may be considered relevant by our Board of Directors, including legal and contractual restrictions. Additionally, the payment of cash dividends may be limited by covenants in certain debt agreements. A regular quarterly dividend of $0.32 per common share was paid on March 30, 2018 to shareholders of record as of the close of business on March 16, 2018. On July 20, 2017 our Board of Directors approved a plan authorizing repurchases of up to $4.0 billion of our outstanding common stock in the open market at prevailing market prices or in privately negotiated transactions through December 31, 2020. This share repurchase authorization replaced any existing share repurchase authorization. Cash Flows from OperationsCash flows from operations were $354 million and $454 million during the three-month periods ended March 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. Our net cash provided by operating activities consists primarily of net earnings, adjusted to add back depreciation and amortization. Cash flows from operations were $100 million lower in the 2018 period primarily due to U.S. federal estimated income tax payments normally due in the third and fourth quarter of 2017 that were paid during the first quarter of 2018 due to the Hurricane Irma Relief Program and timing of working capital. Off-Balance Sheet ArrangementsFIS does not have any off-balance sheet arrangements.Recent Accounting Pronouncements Recently Adopted Accounting Guidance On August 26, 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. For public companies, the amendments are effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2018, and interim periods within those annual periods beginning after December 15, 2019. Early adoption is permitted for any organization in any interim or annual period. FIS elected to adopt this standard in the third quarter of 2017. FIS has applied the presentation guidance above to its statements of cash flows and all adjustments have been reflected on a retrospecive basis. The primary impact of adopting the new guidance is our 2017 presentation of debt prepayment and related costs being reflected in financing activities rather than operating activities. This adoption impacted 2017 cash flows.In August 2017, the FASB issued ASU No. The amendments were meant to improve the financial reporting of hedging relationships to better portray the economic results of an entity’s risk management activities in its financial statements. The amendments in this update also make certain targeted improvements to simplify the application of the hedge accounting guidance in current GAAP. ASU 2017-12 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within those fiscal years; the ASU allows for early adoption in any interim period after issuance of the update. FIS elected to adopt this standard as of January 1, 2018. The ASU improves the presentation of net periodic pension cost and net periodic postretirement benefit cost in the statements of operations. Under ASU 2017-07, the service cost component of the net periodic benefit cost is disclosed in the same income statement line item as other employee compensation costs arising from services rendered during the period, and the other components are reported separately from the line item that includes the service cost and outside of any subtotal of operating income. ASU 2017-07 is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2017 and early adoption is permitted. FIS adopted the provisions of ASU 2016-18 as of January 1, 2018. 35Table of ContentsIn November 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. ASU 2016-18 requires companies to include restricted amounts with Cash and cash equivalents when reconciling the beginning and end of period total amounts shown on the Statements of Cash Flows. FIS adopted the provisions of ASU 2016-01 as of January 1, 2018. FIS had no restricted cash during 2017 or 2018. ASU 2016-01 amends guidance on the classification and measurement of financial instruments, including significant revisions in accounting related to the classification and measurement of investments in equity securities and presentation of certain fair value changes for financial liabilities when the fair value option is elected. The amendment requires equity securities to be measured at fair value with changes in fair value recognized through net earnings and amends certain disclosure requirements associated with the fair value of financial instruments. In February 2018, the FASB issued ASU No. FIS adopted the provisions of ASU 2016-01 as of January 1, 2018. ASU 2014-09 amends substantially all authoritative literature for revenue recognition, including industry-specific requirements, and converges the guidance under this topic with that of the International Financial Reporting Standards. It also includes guidance on accounting for the incremental costs of obtaining and costs incurred to fulfill a contract with a customer. The ASU implements a five-step process for customer contract revenue recognition that focuses on transfer of control, as opposed to transfer of risk and rewards. The amendment also requires enhanced disclosures regarding the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenues and cash flows from contracts with customers. The FASB has issued several amendments to Topic 606, including further guidance on principal versus agent consideration, clarification on identifying performance obligations and accounting for licenses of intellectual property.The effective date of the standard was postponed to reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, with early adoption allowed for reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016. We adopted the new standard effective January 1, 2018.Entities can transition to the standard with retrospective application to the earliest years presented in their financial statements, retrospectively using certain practical expedients, or with a cumulative-effect adjustment as of the date of adoption. •Recognition of certain term license early renewals are now deferred until the conclusion of the term in effect at the time of renewal. Previously, term license early renewals were generally recognized upon execution of the renewal agreement. •We now recognize the license portion of software rental fees in certain of our global trading, asset management, and securities processing businesses upon delivery. Previously, software license rental fees were recognized ratably over the rental period as the payments became due and payable.Impacts related to other changes introduced by the standard were substantially less significant than those listed above.Upon retrospective application of Topic 606, our revenues decreased by approximately $455 million and $410 million and net earnings decreased approximately $58 million and $43 million for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 respectively. We recorded a net reduction to opening retained earnings of approximately $23 million as of January 1, 2016 due to the cumulative impact of adopting the standard. The impact of Topic 606 on our 2017 and 2016 operating results may or may not be representative of the impact on subsequent years’ results. Under the new guidance, lessor accounting is largely unchanged. The pronouncement currently requires a modified retrospective transition approach for leases existing at, or entered into after, the beginning of the earliest comparative period presented in the financial statements. The modified retrospective approach would not require any transition accounting for leases that expire before the earliest comparative period presented. A full retrospective transition approach is not permitted. However, a new transition method has been approved by the FASB, though an official ASU has not been issued, that will permit the use of the effective date of the new standard as the date of initial application. This proposed option will result in issuers not having to adjust comparative period financial statements for the effects of the new leases standard, or make the new required lease disclosures for periods before the effective date. Public business entities should apply the amendments in ASU 2016-02 for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted. We are currently assessing the impact the adoption of ASU 2016-02 will have on our financial position and results of operations.On June 16, 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. Under current guidance, the credit losses are calculated based on multiple credit impairment objectives and recognition is delayed until the loss is probable to occur. Under the new guidance, financial assets measured at amortized cost basis must now be shown as the net amount expected to be collected. The credit loss allowance is a contra-valuation account. Available-for-sale securities should continue to be recognized in a similar manner to current GAAP; however, the allowance should be presented as an allowance instead of a write-down of the basis of the asset. For public companies that are SEC filers, the amendments are effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2019, and interim periods within those annual periods. Early adoption is permitted for any organization in any interim or annual period beginning after December 15, 2018. We do not plan to early adopt and expect that the new guidance will not have a material impact on our financial statement presentation, financial position, or results of operations.Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosure About Market RisksMarket RiskWe are exposed to market risks primarily from changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates. We periodically use certain derivative financial instruments, including interest rate swaps and foreign currency forward contracts, to manage interest rate and foreign currency risk. We do not use derivatives for trading purposes, to generate income or to engage in speculative activity.Interest Rate RiskIn addition to existing cash balances and cash provided by operating activities, we use fixed rate and variable rate debt to finance our operations. We are exposed to interest rate risk on these debt obligations and related interest rate swaps, if any. The carrying value of the senior notes was $8,602 million as of March 31, 2018. The fair value of the senior notes was approximately $8,589 million as of March 31, 2018. The potential reduction in fair value of the senior notes from a hypothetical 10 percent increase in market interest rates would not be material to the overall fair value of the debt. We performed the foregoing sensitivity analysis based on the principal amount of our floating rate debt as of March 31, 2018. This sensitivity analysis is based solely on the principal amount of such debt as of March 31, 2018, and does not take into account any changes that occurred in the prior 12 months or that may take place in the next 12 months in the amount of our outstanding debt. For comparison purposes, based on principal amounts of floating rate debt outstanding as of March 31, 2017, and calculated in the same manner as set forth above, an increase of 100 basis points in the LIBOR rate would have increased our annual interest expense, after we calculate the impact of our interest rate swaps, by $2 million. As of March 31, 2018, we had no interest rate swaps.Foreign Currency RiskWe are exposed to foreign currency risks that arise from normal business operations. These risks include the translation of local currency balances of foreign subsidiaries, transaction gains and losses associated with intercompany loans with foreign subsidiaries and transactions denominated in currencies other than a location's functional currency. We manage the exposure to these risks through a combination of normal operating activities and the use of foreign currency forward contracts and non-derivative investment hedges. Contracts are denominated in currencies of major industrial countries. Our exposure to foreign currency exchange risks generally arises from our non-U.S. operations, to the extent they are conducted in local currency. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates affect translations of revenues denominated in currencies other than the U.S. Dollar. During the three months ended March 31, 2018 and 2017, we generated approximately $379 million and $455 million, respectively, in revenues denominated in currencies other than the U.S. Dollar. The major currencies to which our revenues are exposed are the Brazilian Real, the Euro, the British Pound Sterling and the Indian Rupee. Revenues included $22 million of favorable foreign currency impact during the three months ended March 31, 2018, resulting from changes in the U.S. Dollar during 2018 as compared to 2017. Net earnings included $3 million of unfavorable foreign currency impact during the three months ended March 31, 2018. In 2018, we expect minimal foreign currency impact on our net earnings. We do not enter into foreign currency derivative instruments for trading purposes or to engage in speculative activity. We do periodically enter into foreign currency forward exchange contracts to hedge foreign currency exposure to intercompany loans. We did not have any of these derivatives as of March 31, 2018. Item 4. However, in connection with the adoption of ASC 606, we did implement changes to our processes related to revenue recognition and the control activities within those processes. Risk Factors See “Item 1A. - Risk Factors” in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2017 for a detailed discussion of risk factors affecting the Company. There have been no material changes in the Risk Factors described therein. Item 2. This share repurchase authorization replaced any existing share repurchase authorization plan. Approximately $3.5 billion of plan capacity remained available for repurchases as of March 31, 2018. 39Table of ContentsItem 6.
