We use the terms “Accenture,” “we” and “our” in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements to refer to Accenture plc and its subsidiaries. These Consolidated Financial Statements should therefore be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes thereto for the fiscal year ended August 31, 2017 included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC on October 26, 2017.The accompanying unaudited interim Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP, which requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect amounts reported in the Consolidated Financial Statements and accompanying disclosures. Although these estimates are based on management’s best knowledge of current events and actions that we may undertake in the future, actual results may differ from those estimates. The Consolidated Financial Statements reflect all adjustments of a normal, recurring nature that are, in the opinion of management, necessary for a fair presentation of results for these interim periods. The results of operations for the three and nine months ended May 31, 2018 are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for the fiscal year ending August 31, 2018.On March 13, 2018, Accenture Holdings plc merged with and into Accenture plc, with Accenture plc as the surviving entity. As a result, all of the assets and liabilities of Accenture Holdings plc were acquired by Accenture plc, and Accenture Holdings plc ceased to exist. Allowances for Client Receivables and Unbilled ServicesAs of May 31, 2018 and August 31, 2017, total allowances recorded for client receivables and unbilled services were $56,653 and $74,450, respectively. Depreciation and AmortizationDepreciation expense was $101,814 and $315,410 for the three and nine months ended May 31, 2018, respectively, and $86,148 and $255,807 for the three and nine months ended May 31, 2017, respectively. As of May 31, 2018 and August 31, 2017, total accumulated depreciation was $2,028,174 and $1,912,146, respectively. Deferred transition amortization expense was $95,696 and $248,838 for the three and nine months ended May 31, 2018, respectively, and $66,634 and $205,763 for the three and nine months ended May 31, 2017, respectively. Under current guidance in U.S. GAAP, in the case of depreciable or amortizable assets, the income tax consequences are deferred at the time of the intra-entity transfer and recognized as the assets are depreciated or amortized. The guidance requires modified retrospective transition with a cumulative catch-up adjustment to opening retained earnings in the period of adoption. The deferred tax assets, which could be up to $2.1 billion, represent income tax consequences of prior intra-entity transfers of assets, which are currently recognized over the expected life of the assets. Beginning in fiscal 2019, we will recognize incremental income tax expense as these deferred tax assets are utilized. Initially, this could represent approximately a 3.5 percentage point increase in the annual effective tax rate. However, the actual impact of adoption will depend on numerous factors, including activity for fiscal 2018 and management’s expectations regarding recoverability of the related deferred taxes. The guidance requires a modified retrospective method upon adoption. September 1, 2019 While we are continuing to assess the potential impact of this ASU, we currently believe the most significant impact relates to our accounting for office space operating leases. The core principle of the ASU is that an entity should recognize revenue for the transfer of goods or services equal to the amount that it expects to be entitled to receive for those goods or services. The ASU requires additional disclosure about the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from customer contracts, including significant judgments and changes in judgments. The ASU also requires amortization of incremental costs to obtain a customer contract over the term of the customer arrangement. The guidance allows for both retrospective and modified retrospective methods of adoption. September 1, 2018 We performed a preliminary assessment of the impact of the ASU and are executing a transition plan, including necessary changes to policies, processes, and internal controls as well as system enhancements to generate the information necessary for the new disclosures. The project is on schedule for adoption on September 1, 2018 and we will apply the modified retrospective method. We expect revenue recognition across our portfolio of services to remain largely unchanged. However, we expect to recognize revenue earlier than we do under current guidance in a few areas, including accounting for variable fees and for certain consulting services, which will be recognized over time rather than at a point in time. Additionally, we will capitalize and amortize the direct and incremental costs of obtaining customer contracts over the term of the customer arrangement rather than expense these costs when incurred. While we have not finalized our assessment of the impact of the ASU, based on the analysis completed to date, we do not currently anticipate that the ASU will have a material impact on ourConsolidated Financial Statements. The income effect does not take into account “Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests - other,” since those shares are not redeemable or exchangeable for Accenture plc Class A ordinary shares. The pro forma effects of these acquisitions on our operations were not material. 5. Total amortization related to our intangible assets was $41,698 and $108,150 for the three and nine months ended May 31, 2017, respectively. The payment of the cash dividends also resulted in the issuance of an immaterial number of additional restricted share units to holders of restricted share units.7. DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTSIn the normal course of business, we use derivative financial instruments to manage foreign currency exchange rate risk. Our derivative financial instruments consist of deliverable and non-deliverable foreign currency forward contracts. Cash Flow HedgesFor a cash flow hedge, the effective portion of the change in estimated fair value of a hedging instrument is recorded in Accumulated other comprehensive loss as a separate component of Shareholders’ Equity and is reclassified into Cost of services in the Consolidated Income Statements during the period in which the hedged transaction is recognized. Other DerivativesRealized gains or losses and changes in the estimated fair value of foreign currency forward contracts that have not been designated as hedges were net losses of $84,480 and $37,698 for the three and nine months ended May 31, 2018, respectively, and a net gain of $89,035 and a net loss of $29,279 for the three and nine months ended May 31, 2017, respectively. In the Consolidated Balance Sheets, we record derivative assets and liabilities at gross fair value. RETIREMENT AND PROFIT SHARING PLANSIn May 2017, we settled our U.S. pension plan obligations. Plan participants elected to receive either a lump-sum distribution or to transfer benefits to a third-party annuity provider. As a result of the settlement, we were relieved of any further obligation under our U.S. pension plan. During the three months ended May 31, 2017, we recorded a pension settlement charge of $509,793, and related income tax benefits of $198,219. The charge primarily consisted of unrecognized actuarial losses of $460,908 previously included in Accumulated other comprehensive loss. The Tax Act lowered the U.S. statutory federal income tax rate from 35% to 21%, effective January 1, 2018, resulting in a blended U.S. statutory federal income tax rate of 25.7% for our fiscal year ended August 31, 2018. The Tax Act could modestly impact our ongoing effective tax rate by imposing taxes on our intercompany transactions and limiting our ability to deduct certain expenses. In the three months ended February 28, 2018, we recognized a provisional tax expense of $136,724 primarily to remeasure our net deferred tax assets at the new, lower rates. In the three months ended May 31, 2018, we recorded an adjustment of $40,927 to our provisional tax expense resulting from our continued analysis of the Tax Act. As we collect and analyze data, including our forecast of when we expect to realize certain deferred tax amounts, we may adjust the provisional amounts. In addition, we have not yet made an accounting policy election to consider the taxes on our intercompany transactions in determining the amount of our valuation allowance. Those adjustments and the election may materially impact our provision for income taxes and effective tax rate in the period in which the adjustments are made. We apply an estimated annual effective tax rate to our year-to-date operating results to determine the interim provision for income tax expense. In addition, we recognize taxes related to unusual or infrequent items or resulting from a change in judgment regarding a position taken in a prior year as discrete items in the interim period in which the event occurs. Our effective tax rates for the three months ended May 31, 2018 and 2017 were 34.4% and 19.4%, respectively. Our effective tax rates for the nine months ended May 31, 2018 and 2017 were 27.2% and 20.2%, respectively. Excluding the provisional tax expense associated with the enactment of the Tax Act and $80,847 of expense from a non-U.S. tax law change, the effective tax rates would have been 26.8% and 21.3% for the three and nine months ended May 31, 2018, respectively. The effective tax rate for the nine months ended May 31, 2018 benefited from lower expenses for adjustments to prior year tax liabilities in fiscal 2018, partially offset by lower benefits from final determinations of prior year U.S. taxes in fiscal 2018. 10. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIESCommitments We have either the right to purchase at fair value or, if certain events occur, may be required to purchase at fair value outstanding shares of our Avanade Inc. and SinnerSchrader AG subsidiaries. As of May 31, 2018 and August 31, 2017, we have reflected the fair value of $103,122 and $52,996, respectively, related to redeemable common stock and the intrinsic value of the options on redeemable common stock of these subsidiaries in Other accrued liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Indemnifications and GuaranteesIn the normal course of business and in conjunction with certain client engagements, we have entered into contractual arrangements through which we may be obligated to indemnify clients with respect to certain matters. As of May 31, 2018 and August 31, 2017, our aggregate potential liability to our clients for expressly limited guarantees involving the performance of third parties was approximately $811,000 and $697,000, respectively, of which all but approximately $145,000 and $149,000, respectively, may be recovered from the other third parties if we are obligated to make payments to the indemnified parties as a consequence of a performance default by the other third parties. For arrangements with unspecified limitations, we cannot reasonably estimate the aggregate maximum potential liability, as it is inherently difficult to predict the maximum potential amount of such payments, due to the conditional nature and unique facts of each particular arrangement. To date, we have not been required to make any significant payment under any of the arrangements described above. Legal ContingenciesAs of May 31, 2018, we or our present personnel had been named as a defendant in various litigation matters. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONSThe following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our Consolidated Financial Statements and related Notes included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended August 31, 2017, and with the information under the heading “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended August 31, 2017.We use the terms “Accenture,” “we,” “our” and “us” in this report to refer to Accenture plc and its subsidiaries. All references to years, unless otherwise noted, refer to our fiscal year, which ends on August 31. For example, a reference to “fiscal 2018” means the 12-month period that will end on August 31, 2018. All references to quarters, unless otherwise noted, refer to the quarters of our fiscal year.We use the term “in local currency” so that certain financial results may be viewed without the impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, thereby facilitating period-to-period comparisons of business performance. Financial results “in local currency” are calculated by restating current period activity into U.S. dollars using the comparable prior year period’s foreign currency exchange rates. Words such as “may,” “will,” “should,” “likely,” “anticipates,” “expects,” “intends,” “plans,” “projects,” “believes,” “estimates,” “positioned,” “outlook” and similar expressions are used to identify these forward-looking statements. These statements are not guarantees of future performance and involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions that are difficult to predict. Forward-looking statements are based upon assumptions as to future events that may not prove to be accurate. Actual outcomes and results may differ materially from what is expressed or forecast in these forward-looking statements. This could increase the variability of our revenues and impact our margins.•Our results of operations and share price could be adversely affected if we are unable to maintain effective internal controls.•We might be unable to access additional capital on favorable terms or at all. If we raise equity capital, it may dilute our shareholders’ ownership interest in us.•We are incorporated in Ireland and a significant portion of our assets is located outside the United States. As a result, it might not be possible for shareholders to enforce civil liability provisions of the federal or state securities laws of the United States. We may also be subject to criticism and negative publicity related to our incorporation in Ireland.•Irish law differs from the laws in effect in the United States and might afford less protection to shareholders.For a more detailed discussion of these factors, see the information under the heading “Risk Factors” in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended August 31, 2017. Our forward-looking statements speak only as of the date of this report or as of the date they are made, and we undertake no obligation to update any forward-looking statements.18Table of ContentsOverviewRevenues are driven by the ability of our executives to secure new contracts and to deliver services and solutions that add value relevant to our clients’ current needs and challenges. The level of revenues we achieve is based on our ability to deliver market-leading services and solutions and to deploy skilled teams of professionals quickly and on a global basis. Our results of operations are affected by economic conditions, including macroeconomic conditions and levels of business confidence. There continues to be significant volatility and economic and geopolitical uncertainty in many markets around the world, which may impact our business. We continue to monitor the impact of this volatility and uncertainty and seek to manage our costs in order to respond to changing conditions. There also continues to be volatility in foreign currency exchange rates. The majority of our net revenues are denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar, including the Euro and the U.K. pound. Unfavorable fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates have had and could have in the future a material effect on our financial results. Net revenues for the nine months ended May 31, 2018 increased 14% in U.S. dollars and 10% in local currency compared to the nine months ended May 31, 2017. Demand for our services and solutions continued to be strong, resulting in growth across all areas of our business. We experienced very strong growth in Growth Markets and North America and strong growth in Europe. Revenue growth in local currency was very strong in consulting and outsourcing during the third quarter of fiscal 2018. While the business environment remained competitive, pricing was relatively stable. We use the term “pricing” to mean the contract profitability or margin on the work that we sell.In our consulting business, net revenues for the third quarter of fiscal 2018 increased 18% in U.S. dollars and 12% in local currency compared to the third quarter of fiscal 2017. Net consulting revenues for the nine months ended May 31, 2018 increased 16% in U.S. dollars and 12% in local currency compared to the nine months ended May 31, 2017. Our consulting revenue growth continues to be driven by strong demand for digital-, cloud- and security-related services and assisting clients with the adoption of new technologies. In addition, clients continue to be focused on initiatives designed to deliver cost savings and operational efficiency, as well as projects to integrate their global operations and grow and transform their businesses.In our outsourcing business, net revenues for the third quarter of fiscal 2018 increased 14% in U.S. dollars and 10% in local currency compared to the third quarter of fiscal 2017. Net outsourcing revenues for the nine months ended May 31, 2018 increased 13% in U.S. dollars and 9% in local currency compared to the nine months ended May 31, 2017. We continue to experience growing demand to assist clients with the operation and maintenance of digital-related services and cloud enablement. In addition, clients continue to be focused on transforming their operations to improve effectiveness and cost efficiency. As we are a global company, our revenues are denominated in multiple currencies and may be significantly affected by currency exchange rate fluctuations. If the U.S. dollar weakens against other currencies, resulting in favorable currency translation, our revenues, revenue growth and results of operations in U.S. dollars may be higher. If the U.S. dollar strengthens against other currencies, resulting in unfavorable currency translation, our revenues, revenue growth and results of operations in U.S. dollars may be lower. The U.S. dollar weakened against various currencies during the three and nine months ended May 31, 2018 compared to the three and nine months ended May 31, 2017, resulting in favorable currency translation and U.S. dollar revenue growth that was approximately 5% and 4% higher, respectively, than our revenue growth in local currency. Assuming that exchange rates stay within recent ranges for the remainder of fiscal 2018, we estimate that our full fiscal 2018 revenue growth in U.S. dollars will be approximately 3.0% higher in U.S. dollars than our revenue growth in local currency.The primary categories of operating expenses include Cost of services, Sales and marketing and General and administrative costs. Cost of services is primarily driven by the cost of client-service personnel, which consists mainly of compensation, subcontractor and other personnel costs, and non-payroll costs on outsourcing contracts. General 19Table of Contentsand administrative costs primarily include costs for non-client-facing personnel, information systems, office space and certain acquisition-related costs.Utilization for the third quarter of fiscal 2018 was 91%, flat with the third quarter of fiscal 2017. We continue to hire to meet current and projected future demand. We proactively plan and manage the size and composition of our workforce and take actions as needed to address changes in the anticipated demand for our services and solutions, given that compensation costs are the most significant portion of our operating expenses. Based on current and projected future demand, we have increased our headcount, the majority of which serve our clients, to approximately 449,000 as of May 31, 2018, compared to approximately 411,000 as of May 31, 2017. The year-over-year increase in our headcount reflects an overall increase in demand for our services and solutions, as well as headcount added in connection with acquisitions. Attrition, excluding involuntary terminations, for the third quarter of fiscal 2018 was 17%, up from 15% in the third quarter of fiscal 2017. We evaluate voluntary attrition, adjust levels of new hiring and use involuntary terminations as means to keep our supply of skills and resources in balance with changes in client demand. In addition, we adjust compensation in certain skill sets and geographies in order to attract and retain appropriate numbers of qualified employees. For the majority of our personnel, compensation increases become effective December 1st of each fiscal year. Gross margin for the nine months ended May 31, 2018 was 31.3%, compared with 31.7% for the nine months ended May 31, 2017. The decrease in gross margin for the nine months ended May 31, 2018 was principally due to higher labor costs compared to the same period in fiscal 2017 as well as higher acquisition-related costs, partially offset by other cost efficiencies and improved contract profitability in the third quarter of fiscal 2018.Sales and marketing and General and administrative costs as a percentage of net revenues were 16.5% for the third quarter of fiscal 2018 and 16.4% for the nine months ended May 31, 2018, compared with 17.3% for the third quarter of fiscal 2017 and 16.7% for the nine months ended May 31, 2017. We continuously monitor these costs and implement cost-management actions, as appropriate. For the third quarter of fiscal 2018 compared to the same period in fiscal 2017, Sales and marketing costs as a percentage of net revenues decreased 40 basis points, principally due to improved operational efficiency in our business development activities, and General and administrative costs as a percentage of net revenues decreased 50 basis points. For the nine months ended May 31, 2018 compared to the same period in fiscal 2017, Sales and marketing and General and administrative costs as a percentage of net revenues each decreased 10 basis points.During the third quarter of fiscal 2017, we recorded a $510 million pension settlement charge and related $198 million reduction in taxes for the U.S. pension plan termination. Operating margin for the nine months ended May 31, 2018 was 14.9%, compared with 13.0% for the nine months ended May 31, 2017. The pension settlement charge decreased operating margin by 570 and 200 basis points for the three and nine months ended May 31, 2017, respectively. Excluding the effect of the pension settlement charge, operating margin for the three and nine months ended May 31, 2017 would have been 15.5% and 15.0%, respectively. The effective tax rates for the three and nine months ended May 31, 2018 were 34.4% and 27.2%, respectively. The effective tax rates for the three and nine months ended May 31, 2017 were 19.4% and 20.2%, respectively. Absent these charges and $81 million of expense from a non-U.S. tax law change, our effective tax rate for the three and nine months ended May 31, 2018 would have been 26.8% and 21.3%, respectively. Absent the pension settlement charge and related taxes, our effective tax rates for the three and nine months ended May 31, 2017 would have been 26.6% and 22.7%, respectively. Diluted earnings per share were $1.60 for the third quarter of fiscal 2018, compared with $1.05 for the third quarter of fiscal 2017. Diluted earnings per share were $4.76 for the nine months ended May 31, 2018, compared with $3.96 for the nine months ended May 31, 2017. The impact of tax law changes decreased diluted earnings per share by $0.19 and $0.40 during the three and nine months ended May 31, 2018, respectively. The impact of the pension settlement 20Table of Contentscharge, net of taxes, decreased diluted earnings per share by $0.47 in both the three and nine months ended May 31, 2017. Excluding these impacts, diluted earnings per share would have been $1.79 and $1.52 for the third quarter of fiscal 2018 and 2017, respectively and $5.16 and $4.43 for the nine months ended May 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. As a result, all of the assets and liabilities of Accenture Holdings plc were acquired by Accenture plc, and Accenture Holdings plc ceased to exist. The merger was internal and administrative in nature. New BookingsNew bookings for the third quarter of fiscal 2018 were $11.75 billion, with consulting bookings of $5.91 billion and outsourcing bookings of $5.84 billion. Four countries, including Russia, were previously in Growth Markets, but are now included in Europe. Prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current period presentation. Operating expenses before reimbursable expenses for the third quarter of fiscal 2018 increased $694 million, or 9%, over the third quarter of fiscal 2017, and decreased as a percentage of net revenues to 84.3% from 90.2% during this period.Cost of ServicesCost of services for the third quarter of fiscal 2018 increased $1,073 million, or 17%, over the third quarter of fiscal 2017, and increased as a percentage of revenues to 69.4% from 68.9% during this period. Cost of services before reimbursable expenses for the third quarter of fiscal 2018 increased $1,038 million, or 17%, over the third quarter of fiscal 2017, and increased as a percentage of net revenues to 67.8% from 67.2% during this period. Gross margin for the third quarter of fiscal 2018 decreased to 32.2% from 32.8% during this period . The decrease in gross margin was principally due to higher labor costs as a percentage of net revenues compared to the same period in fiscal 2017, partially offset by other cost efficiencies and improved contract profitability.Sales and MarketingSales and marketing expense for the third quarter of fiscal 2018 increased $121 million, or 12%, over the third quarter of fiscal 2017, and decreased as a percentage of net revenues to 10.7% from 11.1% during this period principally due to improved operational efficiency in our business development activities.General and Administrative Costs General and administrative costs for the third quarter of fiscal 2018 increased $44 million, or 8%, over the third quarter of fiscal 2017, and decreased as a percentage of net revenues to 5.7% from 6.2% during this period. Pension Settlement ChargeWe recorded a pension settlement charge of $510 million during the third quarter of fiscal 2017 as a result of the termination of our U.S. pension plan. The pension settlement charge decreased operating margin for the third quarter of fiscal 2017 by 570 basis points. Excluding the effect of this charge, operating margin for the third quarter of fiscal 2018 increased 20 basis points compared to the third quarter of fiscal 2017. We estimate that the aggregate percentage impact of foreign currency exchange rates on our operating income during the third quarter of fiscal 2018 was similar to that disclosed for net revenue. In the three months ended May 31, 2018, we recorded a $122 million charge associated with tax law changes. Absent this charge, the effective tax rate would have been 26.8% for the third quarter of fiscal 2018. Absent the pension settlement charge and related tax impact, the tax rate for the third quarter of fiscal 2017 would have been 26.6%. 24Table of ContentsNet Income Attributable to Noncontrolling InterestsNet income attributable to noncontrolling interests for the third quarter of fiscal 2018 decreased $20 million, or 57%, from the third quarter of fiscal 2017 due to the decrease in the non-controlling ownership percentage from 4% held by Accenture Holdings plc and Accenture Canada Holdings Inc. to less than 1% held by only Accenture Canada Holdings Inc. driven by the Accenture Holdings plc merger with and into Accenture plc. Earnings Per ShareDiluted earnings per share were $1.60 for the third quarter of fiscal 2018, compared with $1.05 for the third quarter of fiscal 2017. The $0.55 increase in our diluted earnings per share included the impact of tax law changes, which decreased diluted earnings per share for the third quarter of fiscal 2018 by $0.19. The impact of the pension settlement charge, net of taxes, decreased diluted earnings per share by $0.47 for the third quarter of fiscal 2017. Excluding these impacts, diluted earnings per share for the third quarter of fiscal 2018 increased $0.27 compared with the third quarter of fiscal 2017 due to an increase of $0.28 from higher revenues and operating results, $0.01 from lower weighted average shares outstanding and $0.01 from lower net income attributable to other non-controlling interests. These increases were partially offset by decreases of $0.02 from higher non-operating expense and $0.01 from a higher effective tax rate. Four countries, including Russia, were previously in Growth Markets, but are now included in Europe. Prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current period presentation. Operating expenses before reimbursable expenses for the nine months ended May 31, 2018 increased $2,671 million, or 12%, over the nine months ended May 31, 2017, and decreased as a percentage of net revenues to 85.1% from 87.0% during this period.Cost of ServicesCost of services for the nine months ended May 31, 2018 increased $2,761 million, or 15% over the nine months ended May 31, 2017, and increased as a percentage of revenues to 70.2% from 70.0% during this period. Cost of services before reimbursable expenses for the nine months ended May 31, 2018 increased $2,647 million or 15% over the nine months ended May 31, 2017, and increased as a percentage of net revenues to 68.7% from 68.3% during this period. Gross margin for the nine months ended May 31, 2018 decreased to 31.3% from 31.7% during this period. The decrease in gross margin was principally due to higher labor costs compared to the same period in fiscal 2017 as well as higher acquisition-related costs, partially offset by other cost efficiencies and improved contract profitability in the third quarter of fiscal 2018.Sales and MarketingSales and marketing expense for the nine months ended May 31, 2018 increased $362 million, or 13%, over the nine months ended May 31, 2017, and decreased as a percentage of net revenues to 10.6% from 10.7% during this period. General and Administrative Costs General and administrative costs for the nine months ended May 31, 2018 increased $172 million, or 11%, over the nine months ended May 31, 2017, and decreased as a percentage of net revenues to 5.9% from 6.0% during this period.Pension Settlement ChargeWe recorded a pension settlement charge of $510 million during the nine months ended May 31, 2017 as a result of the termination of our U.S. pension plan. The pension settlement charge decreased operating margin for the nine months ended May 31, 2017 by 200 basis points. Excluding the effect of this charge, operating margin for the nine months ended May 31, 2018 decreased 10 basis points compared to the nine months ended May 31, 2017. We estimate that the aggregate percentage impact of foreign currency exchange rates on our operating income during the nine months ended May 31, 2018 was similar to that disclosed for net revenue. In addition, during the nine months ended May 31, 2018, we experienced higher acquisition-related costs compared to the nine months ended May 31, 2017. For the nine months ended May 31, 2018, other expense increased $33 million over the nine months ended May 31, 2017, primarily due to higher net foreign exchange losses. Provision for Income TaxesThe effective tax rate for the nine months ended May 31, 2018 was 27.2% compared with 20.2% for the nine months ended May 31, 2017. In the nine months ended May 31, 2018, we recorded a $258 million charge associated with tax law changes. Absent this charge, our effective tax rate for the nine months ended May 31, 2018 would have been 21.3%. Absent the pension settlement charge and related tax impact, the tax rate for the nine months ended May 31, 2017 would have been 22.7%. The effective tax rate for the nine months ended May 31, 2018 benefited from lower expenses for adjustments to prior year tax liabilities in fiscal 2018, partially offset by lower benefits from final 28Table of Contentsdeterminations of prior year U.S. taxes in fiscal 2018. Our provision for income taxes is based on many factors and subject to volatility year to year. We expect the fiscal 2018 annual effective tax rate to be in the range of 27% to 28%. Excluding the tax law changes, we expect the fiscal 2018 annual effective tax rate to be in the range of 22.5% to 23.5%. Earnings Per ShareDiluted earnings per share were $4.76 for the nine months ended May 31, 2018, compared with $3.96 for the nine months ended May 31, 2017. The $0.80 increase in our diluted earnings per share included the impact of tax law changes, which decreased diluted earnings per share for the nine months ended May 31, 2018 by $0.40. The impact of the pension settlement charge, net of taxes, decreased diluted earnings per share by $0.47 for the nine months ended May 31, 2017. These increases were partially offset by decreases of $0.03 from higher non-operating expenses and $0.01 from higher net income attributable to other non-controlling interests. Substantially all of our cash is held in jurisdictions where there are no regulatory restrictions or material tax effects on the free flow of funds. Domestic cash inflows for our Irish parent, principally dividend distributions from lower-tier subsidiaries, have been sufficient to meet our historic cash requirements, and we expect this to continue into the future. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017, we entered into agreements that will allow us to establish a commercial paper program for short-term borrowings of up to $1 billion, backed by our syndicated loan facility. These shares are held as treasury shares by Accenture plc and may be utilized to provide for select employee benefits, such as equity awards to our employees. These purchases of shares in connection with employee share plans do not affect our aggregate available authorization for our publicly announced open-market share purchase and the other share purchase programs. Accordingly, as of March 13, 2018, there were no longer any ordinary shares of Accenture Holdings plc outstanding.We intend to continue to use a significant portion of cash generated from operations for share repurchases during the remainder of fiscal 2018. Additionally, as these factors may change over the course of the year, the amount of share repurchase activity during any particular period cannot be predicted and may fluctuate from time to time. Under the registration statement we, at our option, could issue freely tradable Accenture plc Class A ordinary shares in lieu of cash upon redemptions of Accenture Holdings plc ordinary shares held by current and former members of Accenture Leadership and their permitted transferees.
