We design, manufacture, and sell a broad range of products that capture and move data. We also provide a full range of services, including maintenance, technical support, repair, and managed services, including cloud-based subscriptions. End-users of our products and services include those in retail and e-commerce, transportation and logistics, manufacturing, healthcare, hospitality, warehouse and distribution, energy and utilities, and education industries around the world. We provide our products and services globally through a direct sales force and an extensive network of channel partners. These condensed consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and notes included in the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2017.The Company reclassified $41 million of costs from Accrued liabilities to Accounts payable on the Consolidated Balance Sheets for the period ended December 31, 2017 to conform to the current period presentation. These results, however, are not necessarily indicative of the results expected for the full year ending December 31, 2018. The average life of repair and maintenance service contracts is approximately three years. The duration of professional service arrangements range from a day to several weeks or months. We recognize revenues when we transfer control of promised goods or services to our customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which we expect to receive in exchange for those goods or services. The Company elects to exclude from the transaction price sales and other taxes assessed by a governmental authority and collected by the Company from a customer. The adoption of ASC 606 did not have a material effect on the Company’s consolidated financial statements or results of operations. Had the Company applied the previous revenue recognition guidance, revenue would have been $1 million lower for the quarter ended September 29, 2018 and $3 million lower for the nine-month period ended September 29, 2018.See Note 3, Revenues for further information. ASU 2016-01 amends various aspects of the recognition, measurement, presentation, and disclosure for financial instruments. It replaces the existing incurred loss impairment model with an expected loss methodology, which will result in more timely recognition of credit losses. There are two transition methods available under the new standard dependent upon the type of financial instrument, either cumulative effect or prospective. The standard will be effective for the Company in the first quarter of 2020. Earlier adoption is permitted for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2018. Management has assessed the impact of adoption of the new standard and determined there will be no material impacts to the Company's consolidated financial statements or disclosures resulting from the adoption of this ASU, which we expect to adopt in the first quarter of 2020. The principal difference from previous guidance is that the lease assets 8Table of Contentsand lease liabilities arising from operating leases were not previously recognized in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The recognition, measurement and cash flows arising from a lease by a lessee have not significantly changed. The ASUs will be effective for the Company in the first quarter of 2019, with early adoption permitted. In transition, lessees and lessors are required to recognize and measure leases at either the beginning of the earliest period presented or the beginning of the period adopted, using a modified retrospective approach. Management expects to elect to not adjust the comparative reporting periods, and apply the ASUs beginning in the period of adoption. In transition, there are also a number of optional practical expedients that entities may elect to apply. Management expects to elect certain practical expedients that it will apply upon transition, which principally include the election to not reassess existing or expired contracts to determine if such contracts contain a lease or if the lease classification would differ, as well as the election to not separate lease and non-lease components for arrangements where the Company is a lessee. This ASU clarifies existing guidance related to implementation costs incurred in cloud computing arrangements, including the recognition, subsequent measurement, and financial statement presentation of such costs. The standard will be effective for the Company in the first quarter of 2020, with earlier adoption permitted. Management is still assessing the impact of adoption on its consolidated financial statements.Note 3 Revenues As prescribed in ASC 606, the Company recognizes revenue to depict the transfer of goods or services to a customer at an amount that reflects the consideration which the entity expects to receive in exchange for those goods or services.Performance ObligationsWe enter into contract arrangements that may include various combinations of tangible products and services, which generally are capable of being distinct and accounted for as separate performance obligations. For these types of contract arrangements, we evaluate whether two or more contracts should be combined and accounted for as one single contract and whether the combined or single contract has more than one performance obligation. This evaluation requires significant judgment and the decision to combine a group of contracts or separate the combined or single contract into multiple performance obligations could change the amount of revenue recorded in the reporting period. When the standalone selling prices are not directly observable, we estimate the standalone selling prices primarily based on the expected cost-plus margin approach. For arrangements comprised strictly of the sale of product and performance of maintenance type services where the standalone selling price of the maintenance service is not discernible, we estimate the standalone selling price of the maintenance contract through the use of the residual approach. When the residual approach cannot be applied, regional pricing, marketing strategies and business practices are evaluated and analyzed to derive the estimated standalone selling price through the use of a cost-plus margin methodology.The Company recognizes revenue when transfer of control has occurred for the goods or services sold. Control is deemed to have been transferred when the customer has the ability to direct the use of and has obtained substantially all of the remaining benefits from the goods and services sold. For each performance obligation satisfied over time, the Company measures its progress toward completion to determine the timing of revenue recognition. Assuming all other criteria for revenue recognition have been met, for products and services sold on a standalone basis, revenue is generally recognized upon shipment and by using an output 9Table of Contentsmethod or time-based method respectively. In cases where a bundle of products and services are delivered to the customer, judgment is required to select the method of progress which best reflects the transfer of control.The Company’s remaining obligations that are greater than one year in duration relate primarily to repair and support services. The aggregated transaction price allocated to remaining performance obligations related to these types of service arrangements was $457 million as of September 29, 2018. We expect to recognize these performance obligations over an approximate three-year average contract term. For some of our transactions, products are sold with a right of return, and we may also provide other rebates, price protection, or incentives, which are accounted for as variable consideration. The Company estimates the amount of variable consideration by using the expected value or the most likely amount method and reduces the revenue by those estimated amounts, only to the extent it is probable that a significant reversal in the cumulative revenue recognized will not occur. Substantially all of our revenue for tangible products is recognized at a point in time, whereby revenue for services and software is predominantly recognized over time.Contract BalancesProgress on satisfying performance obligations under contracts with customers and the related billings and cash collections are recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheets in Accounts receivable, net and Prepaid expenses and other current assets. The opening and closing contract assets balances were $7 million and $5 million, as of January 1, 2018 and September 29, 2018, respectively, and were recorded within Prepaid expenses and other current assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. These contract assets result from timing differences between the billing schedule and the products and services delivery schedules, as well as, the impact from the allocation of the transaction price among performance obligations for contracts that include multiple performance obligations. Our policy is to test these contract asset balances for impairment in accordance with ASC 310 Receivables. No impairment losses have been recorded for the three and nine-month periods ended September 29, 2018.Deferred revenue on the Consolidated Balance Sheets, consist of payments and billings in advance of our performance. The combined short-term and long-term deferred revenue balances were $360 million and $334 million at September 29, 2018 and December 31, 2017, respectively. During the three-month and nine-month period ended September 29, 2018, the Company recognized $32 million and $152 million in revenue respectively, which was previously included in the beginning balance of deferred revenue. Our payment terms vary by the type and location of our customer and the products or services offered. The time between invoicing and when payment is due is not significant. In instances where the timing of revenue recognition differs from the timing of invoicing, we have determined that our contracts do not include a significant financing component.10Table of ContentsCosts to obtain a contractOur incremental direct costs of obtaining a contract, which consist of sales commissions and incremental fringe benefits, are deferred and amortized over the weighted-average contract term, consistent with the guidance in ASC 340 Other Assets and Deferred Costs. The incremental costs to obtain a contract, which were previously expensed as incurred under ASC 605, and the determination of the amortization period are derived at a portfolio level and the amortization is recognized on a straight-line basis. The adoption of ASC 606 required the capitalization of these costs which resulted in an adjustment to increase retained earnings. The Company recorded a $12 million increase to Other long-term assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheet as of January 1, 2018. The Company recognized amortization expense related to commissions during the three-month and nine-month period ended September 29, 2018 of $2 million and $7 million, respectively. The ending balance of the deferred commissions was $13 million as of September 29, 2018. Manufactured inventory cost includes materials, labor, and manufacturing overhead. Purchased inventory cost also includes internal purchasing overhead costs.Provisions are made to reduce excess and obsolete inventories to their estimated net realizable values. The Xplore business designs, integrates, and markets rugged tablets that are primarily used by industrial, government, and field service organizations. The acquisition of Xplore was intended to expand the Company’s portfolio of mobile computing devices to serve a wider range of customers. The Xplore acquisition was accounted for under the acquisition method of accounting for business combinations. In connection with this acquisition, the Company paid $87 million in cash during the third quarter of 2018, which included, $72 million for the net assets acquired, a $9 million payment of Xplore debt as well as $6 million of other Xplore transaction-related obligations. The Company utilized estimated fair values as of August 14, 2018 to allocate the total consideration paid to the net tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed. The fair value of these net assets acquired was based on a number of estimates and assumptions as well as customary valuation procedures and techniques. While we believe these estimates provide a reasonable basis to record the net assets acquired, the purchase price allocation is considered preliminary and subject to adjustment during the measurement period, which is up to one year from the acquisition date of August 14, 2018. The primary fair value estimates considered preliminary are identifiable intangible assets, inventory, and income tax-related items.The preliminary opening balance sheet of Xplore was included in the Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheet and operating results beginning August 14, 2018. The goodwill principally relates to the planned expansion of the Xplore product offerings into current and new markets. This goodwill has been allocated to the EVM segment. The Company substantially completed all initiatives under the Acquisition Plan as of December 31, 2017. Actions under the Productivity Plan include organizational design changes, process improvements and automation. Exit and restructuring costs are not included in the operating results of our segments as they do not impact the specific segment measures as reviewed by our Chief Operating Decision Maker and therefore are reported as a component of Corporate, eliminations. See Note 14, Segment Information.Total exit and restructuring charges of $21 million life-to-date specific to the Productivity Plan have been recorded through September 29, 2018 and relate to employee severance and related benefits and other expenses. Exit and restructuring charges of $4 million and $9 million were recorded in the respective three and nine-month periods ended September 29, 2018. The long-term portion of the accrual relates to non-cancellable lease payments associated with exited facilities whose latest term expires May 2021.Note 7 Fair Value MeasurementsFinancial assets and liabilities are measured using inputs from three levels of the fair value hierarchy in accordance with ASC Topic 820, “Fair Value Measurements.” Fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. The fair value hierarchy gives the lowest priority to Level 3 inputs.In determining fair value, the Company utilizes valuation techniques that maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs to the extent possible. See gross balance reporting in Note 8, Derivative Instruments. Note 8 Derivative InstrumentsIn the normal course of business, the Company is exposed to global market risks, including the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates. The Company uses derivative instruments to manage its exposure to such risks and may elect to designate certain derivatives as hedging instruments under ASC 815, Derivatives and Hedging. The Company formally documents all relationships between designated hedging instruments and hedged items as well as its risk management objectives and strategies for undertaking hedge transactions. The Company does not hold or issue derivatives for trading or speculative purposes.In accordance with ASC 815, the Company recognizes derivative instruments as either assets or liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets and measures them at fair value. The Company manages its exposure to counterparty credit risk by establishing minimum credit standards, diversifying its counterparties, and monitoring its concentrations of credit. The Company’s counterparties are commercial banks with expertise in derivative financial instruments. The Company evaluates the impact of market risk on the fair value and cash flows of its derivative and other financial instruments by considering reasonably possible changes in interest rates and currency exchange rates. The Company continually monitors the creditworthiness of the customers to which it grants credit terms in the normal course of business. The terms and conditions of the Company’s credit policies are designed to mitigate or eliminate concentrations of credit risk with any single customer.The Company’s master netting and other similar arrangements with the respective counterparties allow for net settlement under certain conditions, which are designed to reduce credit risk by permitting net settlement with the same counterparty. We elect to present the assets and liabilities of our derivative financial instruments on a net basis on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. If the derivative financial instruments had been presented gross on the Consolidated Balance Sheets, the asset and liability positions each would have been increased by $1 million as of September 29, 2018 and $11 million at December 31, 2017, respectively.Foreign Currency Exchange Risk ManagementThe Company conducts business on a multinational basis in a wide variety of foreign currencies. Exposure to market risk for changes in foreign currency exchange rates arises from euro denominated external revenues, cross-border financing activities between subsidiaries, and foreign currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities. The Company manages its objective of preserving the economic value of non-functional currency denominated cash flows by initially hedging transaction exposures with natural offsets to the fullest extent possible and, once these opportunities have been exhausted, through foreign exchange forward and option contracts.The Company manages the exchange rate risk of anticipated euro denominated sales using forward contracts which typically mature within twelve months of execution. The Company designates these derivative contracts as cash flow hedges. The realized gain or loss is then recorded as an adjustment to Net sales on the Consolidated Statements of Operations. Realized amounts reclassified to Net sales were a $7 million gain and a $5 million loss for the quarter ending September 29, 2018 and September 30, 2017, respectively. For the comparable nine-month period ended September 29, 2018 and September 30, 2017, realized amounts reclassified to Net sales were a $1 million gain and a $4 million loss, respectively. As of September 29, 2018, and December 31, 2017, the notional amounts of the Company’s foreign exchange cash flow hedges were €449 million and €389 million, respectively. The Company has reviewed cash flow hedges for effectiveness and determined they are highly effective. The Company uses forward contracts, which are not designated as hedging instruments, to manage its balance sheet exposures related to its Brazilian real, British pound, Euro, Canadian dollar, Czech koruna, Australian dollar, Swedish krona, Japanese yen Singapore dollars, Mexican Peso and Chinese Yuan denominated net assets. These forward contracts typically mature within one-month after execution. Monetary gains and losses on these forward contracts are recorded in income each quarter and are 15Table of Contentsgenerally offset by the transaction gains and losses related to their net asset positions. In August 2018, the Company made a Euro denominated borrowing on the Revolving Credit Facility. See Note 9, Long-Term Debt. See Note 9, Long-Term Debt. As a result, the Company is exposed to market risk associated with the variable interest rate payments on the term loans, revolving credit facility and receivables financing facility.The Company manages its exposure to changes in interest rates by utilizing interest rate swaps to hedge this exposure and to achieve a desired proportion of fixed versus floating-rate debt, based on current and projected market conditions. The Company does not enter into derivative instruments for trading or speculative purposes.In December 2017, the Company entered into an $800 million forward long-term interest rate swap agreement to lock into a fixed LIBOR interest rate base for debt facilities subject to monthly interest payments, including Term Loan A, the Revolving Credit Facility and receivables financing facility. Under the terms of the agreement, $800 million in variable-rate debt will be swapped for a fixed interest rate with net settlement terms due effective in December 2018. The changes in fair value of these swaps are not designated as hedges and are recognized immediately as Interest expense, net on the Consolidated Statements of Operations.The Company previously had a floating-to-fixed interest rate swap, which was designated as a cash flow hedge. This swap was terminated and hedge accounting treatment was discontinued in 2014. The terminated swap has approximately $3 million remaining to be amortized through AOCI on the Consolidated Balance Sheets and subsequently reclassified into Interest expense, net, on the Consolidated Statements of Operations through June 2021. There was less than $1 million expensed by the Company in the third quarter of 2018 and $1 million expensed for the nine-month period ended September 29, 2018.The Company has three interest rate swaps related to Term Loan B previously entered into for the purpose of converting floating-rate debt to fixed-rate debt. The first swap was entered into with a syndicated group of commercial banks for the purpose of fixing the interest rate on the Company’s floating-rate debt. The second swap largely offsets the first swap, causing interest payments to again be exposed to rate fluctuations. Neither of these instruments are designated as accounting hedges and changes in fair value are recognized in Interest expense, net on the Consolidated Statements of Operations. The third interest rate swap converting the floating-rate debt to fixed-rate debt was designated as a cash flow hedge and receives hedge accounting treatment. All three swaps have a termination date in June 2021. The Company has determined the third swap to be 16Table of Contentshighly effective. These fair value amounts, developed based on inputs classified as Level 2 within the fair value hierarchy, represent the estimated value at which the Company’s lenders could trade its debt within the financial markets and does not represent the settlement value of these long-term debt liabilities to the Company. The fair value of the long-term debt will continue to vary each period based a number of factors including fluctuations in market interest rates, as well as changes to the Company’s credit ratings.Credit FacilitiesOn May 31, 2018, the Company entered into Amendment No.1. Amendment No. Additionally, Amendment No. 1 provides for the capacity to make Euro denominated draws on the Revolving Credit Facility. As part of the Amendment No. 1, the Company entered into a partial early debt termination of $300 million and repricing of Term Loan B. Amendment No. 1 lowered the index rate spread for LIBOR loans from LIBOR + 200 bp to LIBOR + 175 bp.In accounting for the impact of Amendment No. In addition, the issuance of Amended Term Loan A and the increase to the Revolving Credit Facility resulted in $2 million of one-time third party fees for arranger, legal, and other services, which were capitalized and will be amortized over the term of the credit facilities.As of September 29, 2018, the Term Loan A interest rate was 3.99%, and the Term Loan B interest rate was 4.06%. Borrowings under Term Loan A and B bear interest at a variable rate. Term Loan B borrowings are subject to a floor of 2.75%. Interest payments are payable monthly or quarterly on Term Loan A and quarterly on Term Loan B. The Company has entered into interest rate swaps to manage interest rate risk on Term Loan B. See Note 8, Derivative Instruments.Amendment No. 1 also requires the Company to prepay certain amounts in the event of certain circumstances or transactions. The Company may make prepayments against the Term Loans, in whole or in part, without premium or penalty. Under Amendment No. 1, Term Loan A will mature on July 27, 2021 and Term Loan B will mature on October 27, 2021.The Revolving Credit Facility is available for working capital and other general corporate purposes including letters of credit. As of September 29, 2018, the Company had issued letters of credit totaling $5 million, which reduced funds available for other borrowings under the agreement to $795 million. Borrowings bear interest at a variable rate plus an applicable margin. As of September 29, 2018, the Revolving Credit Facility had an average interest rate of 3.45%. Interest payments are payable monthly or quarterly for the Revolving Credit Facility. In August 2018, the Company made a Euro denominated draw on the Revolving Credit Facility. The Revolving Credit Facility will mature and the related commitments will terminate on July 27, 2021.Receivables Financing Facility In December 2017, the Company entered into a receivables financing facility with a financial institution that has a borrowing limit of up to $180 million. As collateral, the Company pledges a perfected first-priority security interest in its domestically originated accounts receivable. The Company has accounted for transactions under this receivable financing facility as secured borrowings.At September 29, 2018, the Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheets included $427 million of receivables that were pledged under the receivables financing facility, of which $136 million had been borrowed. Borrowings bear interest at a variable rate plus an applicable margin. As of September 29, 2018, the receivables financing facility had an average interest rate of 3.07% and requires monthly interest payments. The receivables financing facility will mature on November 29, 2019.Both the Revolving Credit Facility and receivables financing facility include terms and conditions that limit the incurrence of additional borrowings and require that certain financial ratios be maintained at designated levels. On September 29, 2018, the Company was in compliance with all debt covenants.Note 10 Commitments and Contingencies WarrantiesIn general, the Company provides warranty coverage of 1 year on mobile computers, printers and batteries. Advanced data capture products are warrantied from 1 to 5 years, depending on the product. Thermal printheads are warrantied for 6 months and battery-based products, such as location tags, are covered by a 90-day warranty. The Company currently believes that the outcomes of such proceedings, individually and in the aggregate, will not have a material adverse impact on its business, cash flows, financial position, or results of operations. Any legal proceedings are subject to inherent uncertainties, and the Company’s view of these matters and its potential effects may change in the future. The Company establishes an accrued liability for loss contingencies related to legal matters when the loss is both probable and estimable. In addition, for some matters for which a loss is probable or reasonably possible, an estimate of the amount of loss or range of loss is not possible, and we may be unable to estimate the possible loss or range of losses that could potentially result from the application of non-monetary remedies. A putative federal class action lawsuit, Waring v. Symbol Technologies, Inc., et al., was filed on August 16, 2005 against Symbol Technologies, Inc. and two of its former officers in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York by Robert Waring. At a mediation held on March 15, 2018, the parties reached an agreement in principle to settle the matter, and Zebra reached agreements with certain of its insurers to fund the settlement and therefore, no amounts have been recorded. Additionally, in December 2017, the Company entered into a VDA with the State of Delaware. The Company has engaged an outside consultant to facilitate the assessment of the estimated liability that may result from these activities. Note 11 Income Taxes The Company’s effective tax rates for the three-month and nine-month periods ended September 29, 2018 were 11.2% and 18.6%, respectively. The variances from the 2018 federal statutory rate of 21% for the three and nine months ended September 29, 2018 were attributable to the effect of lower tax rates in foreign jurisdictions and the generation of tax credits. These benefits were partially offset by increases related to foreign earnings subject to U.S. taxation, the U.S. impact of the Enterprise acquisition and certain discrete items. The variances from the 2017 federal statutory rate of 35% for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2017 were attributable to pre-tax losses in the U.S., lower tax rates in foreign jurisdictions, the generation of tax credits, and the impact of certain discrete items, which were partially offset by the U.S. impact of the Enterprise acquisition and state deferred tax expense due to changes in our business operations. The discrete items included the favorable impacts of share-based compensation as well as benefits associated with an intercompany sale of intellectual property and a rate decrease in Singapore.19Table of ContentsThe Company earns a significant amount of its operating income outside of the U.S. The Company’s policy considers its U.S. investment in directly-owned foreign affiliates to be indefinitely reinvested. Under the Act, future remittance of dividends from foreign subsidiaries to the U.S. parent will generally no longer be subject to U.S. tax when repatriated, but may be subject to withholding taxes of the payor affiliate country. Additionally, gains and losses on taxable dispositions of U.S.-owned foreign affiliates continue to be subject to U.S. tax.Pre-tax earnings outside the United States are primarily generated in the United Kingdom, Singapore, and Luxembourg, with statutory rates of 19%, 17%, and 27%, respectively. During 2017, the Company received approval from the Singapore Economic Development Board for a tax rate of 10% with the Company’s commitment to make increased investments in Singapore. The Singapore incentivized rate expires on December 31, 2018.Quarterly, Management evaluates all jurisdictions based on historical pre-tax earnings and taxable income to determine the need for valuation allowances. Based on this analysis, a valuation allowance has been recorded for any jurisdictions where, in the Company’s judgment, tax benefits will not be realized.As part of the purchase price allocation of the stock acquisition of Xplore in the current period, the Company recorded $2 million in deferred tax assets associated with the difference between fair market value of the net assets acquired and carry-over tax basis. See Note 5 Business Acquisition.Uncertain Tax Positions During the third quarter of 2018, the Company settled the U.S. income tax audits for fiscal years 2013, 2014, and 2015. The settlement resulted in an incremental $2 million income tax expense including the reversal of $12 million in previously recorded unrecognized tax benefits. During the nine months ended September 29, 2018, the Company recorded a $14 million charge related to increases in income tax uncertainties for prior year tax positions, including interest and penalties. The Company is currently undergoing a UK income tax audit for fiscal years 2012 and 2014. Fiscal years 2004 through 2017 remain open to examination by multiple foreign and U.S. state taxing jurisdictions. The Company continues to believe its tax positions are supportable, however, the Company anticipates that $22 million of uncertain tax benefits may be disallowed within the next twelve months and has reflected this liability as current within the Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheets. Based on current operations, we estimate that the Company is subject to the Global Intangible Low-Taxed Income and the Deduction for Foreign-Derived Intangible Income provisions of the Act. We estimate that the new limitations which defer U.S. interest deductions in excess of 30% of Adjusted Taxable Income are not applicable. These impacts are included in the calculation of our annual estimated effective tax rate.The Company has updated its calculation of the one-time transition tax to a total liability of $34 million and recorded a $3 million benefit in the nine-month period ended September 29, 2018. The Company utilized a total of $27 million of available net operating losses, research and developments credits, alternative minimum tax credits, and foreign tax credits resulting in a liability of $7 million. At September 29, 2018, in addition to the one-time transition tax, we continue to analyze the final impacts related to performance-based compensation for covered employees as well as accounting for the state income tax effects of enactment of the Act. The Company remeasured U.S. deferred tax assets and liabilities based on the rates at which they are expected to reverse in the future, which is generally 21%. However, the remeasurement of deferred taxes requires further analysis regarding the state tax impacts.Note 12 Earnings per ShareBasic net earnings per share is calculated by dividing net income by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding for the period. Diluted earnings per share is computed by dividing net income by the weighted average number of shares assuming dilution. Dilutive common shares outstanding is computed using the Treasury Stock method and in periods of income, reflects the additional shares that would be outstanding if dilutive stock options were exercised for common shares during the period. There were 1,139 and 914,183 anti-dilutive options for the three-month periods ended September 29, 2018 and September 30, 2017, respectively. There were 87,458 and 687,831 anti-dilutive options for the nine-month periods ended September 29, 2018 and September 30, 2017, respectively. These hedges are designated as cash flow hedges, and the Company defers income statement recognition of gains and losses until the hedged transaction occurs. See Note 8, Derivative Instruments for more details.•Foreign currency translation adjustments relate to the Company’s non-U.S. subsidiary companies that have designated a functional currency other than the U.S. dollar. The Company is required to translate the subsidiary functional currency financial statements to dollars using a combination of historical, period-end, and average foreign exchange rates. The CODM reviews adjusted operating income to assess segment profitability. Adjusted operating income excludes purchase accounting adjustments, amortization of intangible assets, acquisition and integration costs, and exit and restructuring costs. The reallocations relate primarily to facilities, information technology, marketing and human resources expenses. All periods are presented on a comparable basis and reflect these changes. There was no impact to the Consolidated Financial Statements as a result of these reallocations.Information regarding the Company’s operations by geographic area is contained in the following table. These amounts are reported in the geographic area of the destination of the final sale. We also provide a full range of services, including maintenance, technical support, repair, and managed services, including cloud-based subscriptions. End-users of our products and services include those in the retail, transportation and logistics, manufacturing, healthcare, hospitality, warehouse and distribution, energy and utilities, and education industries around the world. Our customers have traditionally benefited from proven solutions that increase productivity and improve efficiency and asset utilization. Its major product lines include barcode and card printers, supplies, services and location solutions. Its major product lines include mobile computing, data capture, RFID, and services. For the nine-months ended September 29, 2018, the Company recorded $3,081 million of Net sales in its Consolidated Statements of Operations, of which approximately 48% were attributable to North America; approximately 34% were attributable to EMEA; and other foreign locations accounted for the remaining 18%. In connection with this acquisition, the Company paid $87 million in cash during the third quarter of 2018, which included, $72 million for the net assets acquired, a $9 million payment of Xplore debt as well as $6 million of other Xplore transaction-related obligations. The operating results of Xplore are included within our EVM segment beginning August 14, 2018 contributing approximately 0.8% to our third quarter consolidated Net sales growth. The Xplore acquisition was accounted for under the acquisition method of accounting for business combinations and the preliminary opening balance sheet is included in the Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheet at September 29, 2018. Legal SettlementDuring the second quarter of 2018, the Company began settlement discussions associated with a pending commercial lawsuit. On July 27, 2018, the Company and plaintiff executed an agreement resolving the lawsuit in its entirety. As a result, the Company recorded a $13 million pretax charge in the second quarter of 2018, which is reflected as a component of General and administrative expenses within the Consolidated Statements of Operations. Based on current operations, we estimate that the Company is subject to the Global Intangible Low-Taxed Income and the Deduction for Foreign-Derived Intangible Income provisions of the Act. We estimate that the new limitations which defer U.S. interest deductions in excess of 30% of Adjusted Taxable Income are not applicable. These impacts are included in the calculation of our annual estimated effective tax rate.During 2018, the Company has updated its calculation of the one-time transition tax and recorded a $10 million and $3 million benefit to income tax expense for the three and nine-month periods ended September 29, 2018, respectively. Foreign currency translation impact represents the difference in results that are attributable to fluctuations in the currency exchange rates used to convert the results for businesses where the functional currency is not the U.S. dollar. This impact is calculated by translating, for certain currencies, the current period results at the currency exchange rates used in the comparable prior year period, rather than the exchange rates in effect during the current period. In addition, we exclude the impact of the company’s foreign currency hedging program in both the current and prior year periods. Third quarter 2018 compared to third quarter 2017 Net sales increased by $157 million or 16.8% compared with the prior year period, reflecting growth across all regions, most notably in North America, EMEA, and Asia-Pacific. The increase in Net sales was primarily due to higher sales of mobile 25Table of Contentscomputing and barcode printing products. Net sales growth was also positively impacted by currency changes, primarily in the EMEA region, as well as the inclusion of Xplore. Consolidated Organic Net Sales growth was 15.1%.Gross margin increased to 46.2% in the current period compared to 45.9% in the prior year period. Gross margin improvement included favorable foreign currency changes and was driven by higher AIT margins primarily due to favorable business mix. EVM margins were in-line with the prior year period.Operating expenses for the quarter ended September 29, 2018 and September 30, 2017, were $343 million and $338 million, or 31.4% and 36.1% of net sales, respectively. The increase in Operating expenses was primarily due to higher compensation costs, including the impact of higher incentive-based compensation associated with financial performance, investments to accelerate organic growth as well as inclusion of Xplore expenses. These increases were partially offset by lower intangible asset amortization expense relating to certain assets that became fully amortized in the third quarter of fiscal 2017. Operating income increased 78.0% to $162 million for the current period compared to $91 million for the prior year period. The increase was due to higher Net sales and Gross profit, which was partially offset by higher Operating expenses.Total Other expenses, net was $19 million for the quarter ended September 29, 2018, as compared to $98 million in the prior year quarter. The decrease was primarily due to the prior year results including $62 million of early debt extinguishment costs and $6 million of debt modification expenses, with the current year period results benefiting from lower outstanding debt and interest rates as well as a $5 million increase in interest rate swap gains.In the quarter ending September 29, 2018, the Company recognized tax expense of $16 million compared to an expense of $5 million for the prior year quarter. The increase in tax expense for the current quarter is primarily due to increased pre-tax income and discrete tax items offset by the impacts of U.S. Tax Reform.Year to date 2018 compared to year to date 2017Net sales increased by $385 million or 14.3% compared with the prior year period, reflecting growth across all regions, most notably North America, EMEA and Asia-Pacific. The increase in Net sales was primarily due to higher sales of mobile computing, barcode printing and data capture products. Net sales growth was also positively impacted by currency changes, primarily in the EMEA region, as well as the inclusion of Xplore. Consolidated Organic Net Sales growth was 11.9%.Gross margin increased to 46.8% in the current period compared to 46.0% in the prior year period. Gross margin improvement included favorable foreign currency changes and was driven by higher margins in both the EVM and AIT segments primarily due to operational efficiencies as well as favorable business mix.Operating expenses for the period ended September 29, 2018 and September 30, 2017, were $1,011 million and $1,052 million, or 32.8% and 39.0% of net sales, respectively. The reduction in Operating expenses was primarily due to lower intangible asset amortization expense and acquisition and integration charges being partially offset by higher compensation costs, including the impact of higher incentive-based compensation associated with financial performance, a $13 million pretax charge related to a legal settlement included within general and administrative expense in the current year as well as investments to accelerate organic growth. The lower amortization expense results from certain assets that became fully amortized in the third quarter of fiscal 2017. Additionally, the Company had lower acquisition and integration charges in the current period compared to the prior year period as a result of completing of the Enterprise business integration activities during the first quarter of fiscal 2018. Operating income increased 128.0% to $431 million for the current period compared to $189 million for the prior year period. The increase was primarily due to higher Net sales and Gross profit and lower Operating expenses.Total Other expenses, net was $55 million for the period ended September 29, 2018, as compared to $179 million in the prior year period. The decrease was primarily due to the prior year results including $62 million of early debt extinguishment costs and $6 million of debt modification expenses, with the current year results benefiting from lower outstanding debt and interest rates as well as a $22 million increase in interest rate swap gains.For the nine-months ending September 29, 2018, the Company recognized a tax expense of $70 million compared to a benefit of $3 million for the prior year period. The increase in tax expense in 2018 versus the prior year is primarily due to increased pre-tax income and discrete tax items offset by the impacts of U.S. Tax Reform. 26Table of ContentsResults of Operations by Segment The following commentary should be read in conjunction with the financial results of each operating business segment as detailed in Note 14, Segment Information in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

Management believes that our existing capital resources and funds generated from operations are sufficient to meet anticipated capital requirements and service our indebtedness. The increase was primarily due to higher net income, lower cash payments for interest and income taxes as well as improved inventory management and favorable timing of accounts payable, that was partially offset by timing of accounts receivable collections.•The increase in net cash used in investing activities was driven by cash payments for the net assets of the Xplore acquisition and higher capital expenditures.

For additional information on market risk, refer to the “Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk” section of the Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2017.In the normal course of business, portions of the Company’s operations are subject to fluctuations in currency values. The Company manages these risks using derivative financial instruments. Our management assessed the effectiveness of our disclosure controls as of September 29, 2018. Based on this assessment and those criteria, our management believes that, as of September 29, 2018, our disclosure controls are effective.Changes in Internal Controls over Financial Reporting During the third quarter ended September 29, 2018, there have been no changes in our internal controls that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal controls over financial reporting.Inherent Limitations on the Effectiveness of Controls The Company’s management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, does not expect that the disclosure controls and procedures or the internal controls over financial reporting will prevent all errors and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, 31Table of Contentswithin the Company have been detected. These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake. Controls can also be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more people, or by management override of the controls. The design of any system of controls is based in part on certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions. Projections of any evaluation of controls effectiveness to future periods are subject to risks. Over time, controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or deterioration in the degree of compliance with policies or procedures.32Table of ContentsPART II - OTHER INFORMATION Item 1.Legal ProceedingsSee Note 10, Commitments and Contingencies to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in this report.Item 1A.Risk FactorsIn addition to the other information included in this report, you should carefully consider the factors discussed in Part I, “Item 1A. Risk Factors” in the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2017, and the factors identified under “Safe Harbor” at the end of Item 2 of Part I of the Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, which could materially affect our business, financial condition, cash flows, or results of operations. The risks described in the Annual Report are not the only risks facing the Company. There have been no material changes to the risk factors included in our Annual Report for the year ended December 31, 2017, other than as described below.The impact of changes in customs duties and trade policies in the United States and corresponding actions by other countries in which the Company does business could adversely affect our financial performance. The U.S. government has imposed customs duties on various imports from China that are intended to address trade imbalances. In response to such actions, China has instituted customs duties on certain U.S. goods, and both of these actions will result in increased customs duties. The Company imports a significant percentage of our products into the United States and China, and an increase in customs duties with respect to these imports could negatively impact the Company’s financial performance. Such customs duties also may cause the U.S.’ trading partners, other than China, to take actions with respect to U.S. imports or U.S. investment activities in their respective countries. Any potential changes in trade policies in the United States and the potential corresponding actions by other countries in which the Company does business could adversely affect the Company’s financial performance. Given the level of uncertainty over which provisions will be enacted, the Company cannot predict with certainty the impact of the proposals.Item 2.Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of ProceedsTreasury SharesWe did not purchase shares of Zebra Class A common stock during the period ending September 29, 2018 as part of the purchase plan program.In November 2011, our Board authorized the purchase of up to an additional 3,000,000 shares under the purchase plan program and the maximum number of shares that may yet be purchased under the program is 665,475.
