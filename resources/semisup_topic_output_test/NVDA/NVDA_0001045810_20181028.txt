We recognized an income tax benefit of $149 million and $3 million for the third quarter and first nine months of fiscal year 2019, respectively, and income tax expense of $58 million and $189 million for the third quarter and first nine months of fiscal year 2018, respectively. Income tax benefit as a percentage of income before income tax was 13.8% and nominal for the third quarter and first nine months of fiscal year 2019, respectively, and income tax expense as a percentage of income before tax was 6.5% and 8.9% for the third quarter and first nine months of fiscal year 2018, respectively. 
No customer represented 10% or more of total revenue for the third quarter and first nine months of fiscal years 2019 and 2018.
The decrease in our effective tax rate for the third quarter and first nine months of fiscal year 2019 as compared to the same periods in the prior fiscal year was primarily due to a decrease in the U.S. statutory tax rate from 35% to 21% as a result of U.S. tax reform, and a $138 million reduction in our provisional U.S. tax reform transition tax amount in the third quarter of fiscal year 2019, partially offset by a decrease in the impact of tax benefits from stock-based compensation.
We operate on a 52- or 53-week year, ending on the last Sunday in January. Fiscal years 2019 and 2018 are both 52-week years. The third quarters of fiscal years 2019 and 2018 were both 13-week quarters.
We report our business in two primary reportable segments - the GPU business and the Tegra Processor business - based on a single underlying architecture. 
Our customer programs involve rebates, which are designed to serve as sales incentives to resellers of our products in various target markets, and marketing development funds, or MDFs, which represent monies paid to our partners that are earmarked for market segment development and are designed to support our partnersâ€™ activities while also promoting NVIDIA products. We account for customer programs as a reduction to revenue and accrue for potential rebates and MDFs based on the amount we expect to be claimed by customers. 
On February 28, 2018, NVIDIA and the other respondents answered the ITC complaint and asserted various defenses including non-infringement and invalidity of the four asserted ZiiLabs 2 patents.
While our GPU and CUDA architecture is unified, our GPU product brands are aimed at specialized markets including GeForce for gamers; Quadro for designers; Tesla and DGX for artificial intelligence, or AI, data scientists and big data researchers; and GRID for cloud-based visual computing users. Our Tegra brand integrates an entire computer onto a single chip, and incorporates GPUs and multi-core CPUs to drive supercomputing for autonomous robots, drones, and cars, as well as for consoles and mobile gaming and entertainment devices. 
We record a reduction to revenue for estimated product returns at the time revenue is recognized primarily based on historical return rates. Cost of revenue includes the estimated cost of product warranties. Under limited circumstances, we may offer an extended limited warranty to customers for certain products. Additionally, we accrue for known warranty and indemnification issues if a loss is probable and can be reasonably estimated. The estimated product returns and estimated product warranty liabilities was $18 million and $15 million as of October 28, 2018 and January 28, 2018, respectively.
Under the single unifying architecture for our GPU and Tegra Processors, we leverage our visual computing expertise by charging the operating expenses of certain core engineering functions to the GPU business, while charging the Tegra Processor business for the incremental cost of the teams working directly for that business. In instances where the operating expenses of certain functions benefit both reportable segments, our CODM assigns 100% of those expenses to the reportable segment that benefits the most. GPU Business. The gross margin of our GPU business was flat during the third quarter of fiscal year 2019 compared to the third quarter of fiscal year 2018. Gross margin of our GPU business increased during the first nine months of 
Tegra Processor Business. Tegra Processor business revenue decreased by 3% for the third quarter of fiscal year 2019 compared to the third quarter of fiscal year 2018. This was driven by a decrease of about 30% in revenue from SOC modules for gaming platforms, which was partially offset by an increase of 19% in automotive revenue, primarily from DRIVE PX platforms and development agreements with automotive companies, as well as from infotainment modules.
Tegra Processor business revenue increased by 21% for the first nine months of fiscal year 2019 compared to the first nine months of fiscal year 2018. This was driven by an increase of 30% in revenue from SOC modules for gaming platforms, and an increase of 12% in automotive revenue, primarily from DRIVE PX platforms and development agreements with automotive companies, as well as from infotainment modules.
fiscal year 2019 compared to the first nine months of fiscal year 2018, primarily due to strong sales of high-end GeForce gaming GPUs and revenue growth in Datacenter. 
Tegra Processor Business. The gross margin of our Tegra Processor business increased during the third quarter and first nine months of fiscal year 2019 compared to the third quarter and first nine months of fiscal year 2018, primarily due to a favorable mix shift.
Cash provided by operating activities increased in the first nine months of fiscal year 2019 compared to the first nine months of fiscal year 2018, due to higher net income, partially offset by changes in working capital. 
Our overall gross margin increased to 60.4% for the third quarter of fiscal year 2019 from 59.5% for the third quarter of fiscal year 2018. Our overall gross margin increased to 62.7% for the first nine months of fiscal year 2019 from 59.1% for the first nine months of fiscal year 2018. These increases reflect our continued shift toward higher-value platforms, which more than offset a charge of $57 million we recorded during the third quarter of fiscal year 2019 related to prior architecture components and chips following the sharp fall-off in cryptocurrency mining demand.
GPU business revenue increased by 44% for the first nine months of fiscal year 2019 compared to the first nine months of fiscal year 2018. This increase was due primarily to over 40% growth in sales of GeForce GPU products for gaming, driven by initial sales of Turing-based GPUs for desktops, Pascal-based GPUs for desktops and by high-performance notebooks based on our Max-Q technology. Datacenter revenue, including Tesla, GRID and DGX, increased 70%, reflecting strong sales of our Volta architecture, including NVIDIA Tesla V100 and DGX systems. Revenue from Quadro GPUs for professional visualization increased 23% due primarily to higher sales across desktop and mobile workstation products. Our PC OEM revenue increased by almost 20% due primarily to sales of GPU products targeted for use in cryptocurrency mining in the first quarter of fiscal year 2019.For fiscal year 2019, we previously announced our plan to return $1.25 billion to shareholders. We now intend to return an additional $3.00 billion to shareholders by the end of fiscal year 2020, which may begin in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2019.
