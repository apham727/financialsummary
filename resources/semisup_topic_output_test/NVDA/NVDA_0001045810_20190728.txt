The increase in our effective tax rate for the second quarter of fiscal year 2020 as compared to the second quarter of fiscal year 2019 was primarily due to an increase in the amount of earnings subject to United States tax, and a decrease of tax benefits from stock-based compensation, partially offset by an increase in the impact of tax benefits from the U.S. federal research tax credit. The decrease in our effective tax rate for the first half of fiscal year 2020 as compared to the first half of fiscal year 2019 was primarily due to an increase in the impact of tax benefits from the U.S. federal research tax credit and stock-based compensation.
We report our business in two primary reportable segments - the GPU business and the Tegra Processor business - based on a single underlying architecture. 
resolved with the respective tax authorities. As of July 28, 2019, we do not believe that our estimates, as otherwise provided for, on such tax positions will significantly increase or decrease within the next twelve months.
Our GPU product brands are aimed at specialized markets including GeForce for gamers; Quadro for designers; Tesla and DGX for artificial intelligence, data scientists and big data researchers; and GRID for cloud-based visual computing users. Our Tegra brand integrates an entire computer onto a single chip, and incorporates GPUs and multi-core CPUs to drive supercomputing for autonomous robots, drones, and cars, as well as for game consoles and mobile gaming and entertainment devices. GPU Business. The gross margin of our GPU business decreased during the second quarter and first half of fiscal year 2020 compared to the second quarter and first half of fiscal year 2019, primarily reflecting lower gaming GPU and data center margins driven by product costs.
Tegra Processor Business. Tegra Processor business revenue increased by 2% for the second quarter of fiscal year 2020 compared to the second quarter of fiscal year 2019. This was driven by an increase of 30% in Automotive revenue primarily 
Tegra Processor Business. The gross margin of our Tegra Processor business increased during the second quarter of fiscal year 2020 compared to the second quarter of fiscal year 2019, primarily driven by automotive development services. The gross margin of our Tegra Processor business decreased during the first half of fiscal year 2020 compared to the first half of fiscal year 2019, primarily due to mix shifts.
GPU Business. GPU business revenue decreased by 21% in the second quarter of fiscal year 2020 compared to the second quarter of fiscal year 2019, which reflects declines in gaming GPU and Data Center revenue. GeForce GPU product sales for gaming decreased 29%, reflecting a decline in shipments of gaming desktop GPUs partially offset by revenue growth in gaming notebook GPUs. Data Center revenue, including Tesla, GRID and DGX, decreased 14%, primarily reflecting a decline in hyperscale revenue partially offset by enterprise revenue growth, driven by expanding AI workloads. Revenue from Quadro GPUs for professional visualization increased 4%, primarily reflecting strength across mobile workstation products. Our PC OEM revenue decreased by 4%, primarily driven by the absence of cryptocurrency mining processor sales.

In the first half of fiscal year 2020, we returned $195 million in quarterly cash dividends. We had no share repurchases during the first half of fiscal year 2020. We intend to return the remaining $2.11 billion through a combination of share repurchases and cash dividends. We do not expect to repurchase shares prior to the close of the acquisition of Mellanox, and therefore the intended repurchases may extend into fiscal year 2021.
