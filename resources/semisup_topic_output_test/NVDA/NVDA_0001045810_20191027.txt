Note 2 - Acquisition of Mellanox Technologies, Ltd.
We report our business in two primary reportable segments - the GPU business and the Tegra Processor business - based on a single underlying architecture. 
The increase in our effective tax rate for the third quarter and first nine months of fiscal year 2020 as compared to the third quarter and first nine months of fiscal year 2019 was primarily due to a decrease of tax benefits from stock-based compensation and an absence of the tax benefit related to the reduction in our provisional U.S. tax reform transition tax amount.
Our GPU product brands are aimed at specialized markets including GeForce for gamers; Quadro for designers; Tesla and DGX for artificial intelligence, data scientists and big data researchers; and GRID for cloud-based visual computing users. 
resolved with the respective tax authorities. As of October 27, 2019, we do not believe that our estimates, as otherwise provided for, on such tax positions will significantly increase or decrease within the next twelve months.Tegra Processor Business. Tegra Processor business revenue increased by 10% for the third quarter of fiscal year 2020 compared to the third quarter of fiscal year 2019. This was driven by an increase in revenue from SOC modules for gaming platforms, which was partially offset by a decline of 6% in Automotive revenue. The decrease in Automotive revenue reflected slowdown of infotainment modules and autonomous vehicle solutions partially offset by growth in AI cockpit solutions. 
Tegra Processor business revenue decreased by 15% for the first nine months of fiscal year 2020 compared to the first nine months of fiscal year 2019. This was driven by a decline in revenue from SOC modules for gaming platforms, which was partially offset by an increase of 12% in Automotive revenue. Growth in Automotive revenue primarily reflects growth in AI cockpit solutions and autonomous vehicle solutions.
Tegra Processor Business. The gross margin of our Tegra Processor business decreased during the third quarter of fiscal year 2020 compared to the third quarter of fiscal year 2019, primarily driven by higher OEM product costs and product mix. For the first nine months of fiscal year 2020 compared to the first nine months of fiscal year 2019, gross margin decreased primarily due to product mix.
GPU business revenue decreased by 18% in the first nine months of fiscal year 2020 compared to the first nine months of fiscal year 2019, which reflects declines in GPUs sold for gaming and Data Center revenue. GeForce GPU product sales for gaming decreased 22%, reflecting a decline in shipments of desktop GPUs partially offset by growth in notebook GPUs. Data Center revenue, which includes Tesla, GRID and DGX, decreased 11%, primarily reflecting a decline in hyperscale revenue partially offset by enterprise revenue growth driven by expanding AI workloads. Revenue from Quadro GPUs for professional visualization increased 5% due primarily reflecting strength across mobile workstation products. Our PC OEM revenue decreased by 46% primarily driven by the absence of cryptocurrency mining processor GPU sales.
One customer represented approximately 10% of our total revenue for the third quarter and approximately 11% of our total revenue for the first nine months of fiscal year 2020, and was attributable primarily to the GPU business. No customer represented 10% or more of total revenue for the third quarter and first nine months of fiscal year 2019.
Income from operations for the third quarter of fiscal year 2020 was $927 million, down 12% from a year earlier and up 62% sequentially. Net income and net income per diluted share for the third quarter of fiscal year 2020 were $899 million and $1.45, respectively, down 27% and 26%, respectively, from a year earlier, and up 63% and 61%, respectively, sequentially. The year-on-year decrease reflects lower revenue and higher operating expenses. The sequential increase reflects higher revenue and gross margin.
From a market platforms perspective, Gaming revenue was $1.66 billion, down 6% from a year ago and up 26% sequentially. The year-on-year decrease reflects lower sales of GeForce desktop GPUs from the prior year which included the launch of Turing-based GeForce GPUs, partially offset by growth in GeForce notebook GPUs and SOC modules for gaming platforms. The sequential increase reflects growth primarily from GeForce desktop and notebook GPUs.
Cash provided by operating activities increased in the first nine months of fiscal year 2020 compared to the first nine months of fiscal year 2019, due to changes in working capital driven by a reduction in days sales outstanding and a reduction in inventory. These increases were partially offset by lower net income.
GPU Business. The gross margin of our GPU business increased during the third quarter of fiscal year 2020 compared to the third quarter of fiscal year 2019, reflecting the sale of previously written off components. For the first nine months of fiscal year 2020 compared to the first nine months of fiscal year 2019, gross margin decreased primarily reflecting product transitions and product mix offset by the sale of previously written off components.We previously communicated our intent to return $3.00 billion to shareholders by the end of fiscal year 2020, including $700 million in share repurchases made during the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2019.

Our worldwide operations could be disrupted by earthquakes, telecommunications failures, power or water shortages, outages at cloud service providers, tsunamis, floods, hurricanes, typhoons, fires, extreme weather conditions, cyber-attacks, terrorist attacks, medical epidemics or pandemics and other natural or man-made disasters, catastrophic events or climate change. The occurrence of any of these disruptions could harm our business and result in significant losses, a decline in revenue and an increase in our costs and expenses. Any of these business disruptions could require substantial expenditures and recovery time in order to fully resume operations. Our corporate headquarters, and a portion of our research and development activities, are located in California, and other critical business operations, finished goods inventory, and some of our suppliers are located in Asia, near major earthquake faults known for seismic activity. In addition, a large portion of our current datacenter capacity is located in California, making our operations vulnerable to natural disasters or other business disruptions occurring in these geographical areas. The manufacture of product components, the final assembly of our products and other critical operations are concentrated in certain geographic locations, including Taiwan, China, Hong Kong, and Korea. Additionally, a significant portion of our finished goods product distribution occurs through Hong Kong. Geopolitical change or changes in government regulations and policies in the United States or abroad may result in changing regulatory requirements, trade policies, import duties and economic disruptions that could impact our operating strategies,
