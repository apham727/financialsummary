The Company has a single reportable operating segment which designs, develops, manufactures and markets similar proprietary semiconductor products, including intellectual property. In reaching this conclusion, management considers the definition of the chief operating decision maker (“CODM”), how the business is defined by the CODM, the nature of the information provided to the CODM and how that information is used to make operating decisions, allocate resources and assess performance. The Company’s CODM is the president and chief executive officer. The results of operations provided to and analyzed by the CODM are at the consolidated level, and accordingly, key resource decisions and assessment of performance are performed at the consolidated level. The Company assesses its determination of operating segments at least annually.
Each distinct promise to transfer products is considered to be an identified performance obligation for which revenue is recognized at a point in time upon transfer of control of the products to the customer. Transfer of control occurs upon shipment to the distributor or direct customer or when products are pulled from consignment inventory by the customer.

The Company adopted ASU 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606), in the first quarter of fiscal 2019 for open contracts not completed as of the adoption date using the modified retrospective approach. The impact from the cumulative effect adjustment was not material and comparative information for prior periods has not been adjusted. The impact of applying the new standard on the Company’s consolidated financial statements for the quarter ended December 28, 2018, was not material, except for an increase in accounts receivable and other current liabilities in the amount of $32.8 million to reflect customer credits as a liability. We generated net revenue of $972.0 million for the three months ended December 28, 2018, a decrease of $79.9 million or 7.6%, as compared with $1,051.9 million for the corresponding period in fiscal 2018. This decrease in net revenue is primarily related to weakness in smartphone demand, partially offset by increasing RF content per smartphone. 
The increase in research and development expenses for the three months ended December 28, 2018, as compared with the corresponding period in fiscal 2018, was primarily related to an increase in employee-related compensation expense and product development–related expenses. Research and development expense increased as a percentage of net revenue as a result of our increased investment in developing new technologies and products. 
During the three months ended December 28, 2018, $8.1 million and $7.4 million in amortization of intangibles were included in cost of goods sold and selling, general and administrative expense, respectively. During the three months ended December 29, 2017, $4.0 million in amortization of intangibles was included in selling, general and administrative expense.
The $51.7 million decrease in gross profit for the three months ended December 28, 2018, as compared with the corresponding period in fiscal 2018, was primarily the result of lower average selling prices and lower unit volumes with a gross profit impact of $170.5 million. These negative impacts were partially offset by favorable product mix that positively impacted gross profit by $119.8 million. Gross profit margin decreased to 49.9% of net revenue for the three months ended December 28, 2018, as compared with 51.0% in the corresponding period in fiscal 2018.
Cash provided by operating activities consists of net income for the period adjusted for certain non-cash items and changes in certain operating assets and liabilities. During the three months ended December 28, 2018, we generated $549.0 million of cash from operating activities, an increase of $188.2 million as compared with the $360.8 million generated during the three months ended December 29, 2017. The increase in cash from operating activities during the three months ended December 28, 2018, was primarily related to an increase in cash generated from collecting receivables and reduced payments of payables totaling $218.7 million. We may enter into foreign currency forward and option contracts with financial institutions to protect against foreign exchange risks associated with certain existing assets and liabilities, certain firmly committed transactions, forecasted future cash flows and net investments in foreign subsidiaries. However, we may choose not to hedge certain foreign exchange exposures for a variety of reasons, including, but not limited to, accounting considerations and the prohibitive economic cost of hedging particular exposures. For the three months ended December 28, 2018, we had no outstanding foreign currency forward or option contracts with financial institutions. Item 1. Legal Proceedings.
