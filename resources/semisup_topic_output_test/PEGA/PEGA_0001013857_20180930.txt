 (1) Subscription revenue reflects client arrangements (term license, cloud, and maintenance) which may be subject to a renewal.  
The change in deferred revenue in the nine months ended September 30, 2018 was primarily due to $225.1 million of revenue recognized, excluding the impact of netting contract assets and deferred revenue at the contract level, during the period that was included in deferred revenue at December 31, 2017, partially offset by new billings in advance of revenue recognition.  
Services revenue is comprised of consulting, including software license implementations, training, reimbursable expenses, and cloud, which is derived from sales of the Companys hosted Pega Platform and software application environments. The Company has concluded that most services are distinct performance obligations. Consulting may be provided on a stand-alone basis or bundled with other performance obligations.  
Term license fees are usually payable in advance on a monthly, quarterly, or annual basis over the term of the license agreement, which is typically three to five years and may be renewed for additional terms at the clients option. Perpetual license fees are usually payable when the contract is executed.  
The stand-alone selling price of cloud sales of production environments is determined based on the residual approach when sold with other performance obligations and is recognized over the term of the service. The Company utilizes the residual approach as cloud performance obligations are sold for a broad range of amounts (the selling price is highly variable) and a stand-alone selling price is not discernible from past transactions or other observable evidence. Cloud fees for production environments are usually payable in advance on a monthly, quarterly, or annual basis over the term of the service.  
The stand-alone selling price for fixed price consulting is based on the estimated hours versus actual hours in similar geographies and for similar contract sizes. Revenue for fixed price consulting is recognized over time as the services are provided. Fees for fixed price consulting are usually payable as contract milestones are achieved.  The increases in cloud gross profit percent in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2018 were primarily due to continued growth and scale in our cloud business, partially offset by an increase in client support expenses as we expanded our cloud client support function to sustain our growing cloud business.  
The decrease in term license revenue in the three months ended September 30, 2018 was primarily due to $17 million of revenue recognized in the three months ended September 30, 2017 from a large term license renewal. The decrease in term license revenue in the nine months ended September 30, 2018 was primarily due to $35.3 million of revenue recognized in the three months ended March 31, 2017 from a large term license renewal.  
The increase in the nine months ended September 30, 2018 was primarily due to an increase of $2.1 million in legal and tax fees partially offset by a decrease of $1.7 million in compensation and benefits, due to decreased headcount reflecting the realignment of contract negotiation and product development resources to augment our selling and marketing and research and development functions.  
The increases in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2018 were primarily due to increases in compensation and benefits of $4 million and $9.5 million, attributable to increased headcount and the expansion of our application development team to support the continued development of our expanding suite of software.  
The decrease in the three months ended September 30, 2018 was primarily due to a decrease in compensation and benefits of $1.2 million due to decreased headcount, reflecting the realignment of contract negotiation and product development resources to augment our selling and marketing and research and development functions.  
The increase in perpetual license revenue in the three months ended September 30, 2018 was primarily due to revenue recognized from license rights which became effective in the current period from perpetual arrangements executed in prior periods, primarily the three months ended June 30, 2018. The decrease in perpetual license revenue in the nine months ended September 30, 2018 reflects the shift in client preferences away from perpetual license arrangements.  
The increases in maintenance gross profit percent in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2018 were driven by decreases of $0.3 million and $1.5 million in compensation and benefits due to decreased headcount and a decrease in client support expenses as we transferred resources to provide dedicated support to our growing cloud business.
