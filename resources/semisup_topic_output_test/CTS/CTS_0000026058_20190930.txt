On July 31, 2019, we acquired 100% of the outstanding shares of Quality Thermistor, Inc. (QTI) for $75 million plus a contingent earn out of up to $5 million based on sales performance objectives. The purchase price includes adjustments for debt assumed and changes in working capital. QTI, doing business as QTI Sensing Solutions, is a leading designer and manufacturer of high-quality temperature sensors serving original equipment manufacturers with mission-critical applications in the industrial, aerospace, defense and medical markets. This acquisition provides us with a new core temperature sensing technology that expands our sensing product portfolio, while increasing our presence in the industrial and medical markets. 
Goodwill represents value the Company expects to be created by combining the operations of the acquired business with the Company's operations, including the expansion of customer relationships within our existing business, access to new customers, and potential cost savings and synergies. Goodwill related to the acquisition is expected to be deductible for tax purposes.
During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2019, we recognized revenues of $125 and $231, respectively, for amounts that were included in contract liabilities at the beginning of the period. 
We have debt issuance costs related to our long-term debt that are being amortized using the straight-line method over the life of the debt. Amortization expense was approximately $42 and $46 for the three months ended September 30, 2019 and 2018, respectively, and approximately $121 and $139 for the nine months ended September 30, 2019 and 2018, respectively. These costs are included in interest expense in our Condensed Consolidated Statement of Earnings. 
Contingent consideration is payable in cash upon the achievement of a revenue performance target for the year ending December 31, 2019. The Company recorded $2,167 as the acquisition date fair value of the contingent consideration based on an estimate of the probability of achieving the performance target using the most recent revenue forecast. This amount is reflected as an addition to purchase price and will be finalized once the full year 2019 results are known. 
Beginning in Q3 2019, we incurred restructuring charges of $1,671 for exit and disposal activities at three facilities, of which $800 was related to a lease termination charge resulting from our acquisition of Quality Thermistor, Inc. (see Note 19) and $871 was related to workforce and building relocation costs at two foreign facilities. The total remaining restructuring liability associated with these actions was $752 at September 30, 2019.
Certain potentially dilutive restricted stock units are excluded from diluted earning per share because they are anti-dilutive. The number of awards that were anti-dilutive for the nine month periods ended September 30, 2019 and September 30, 2018 were 20,273 and 1,538, respectively. There were no outstanding anti-dilutive awards impacting the three month periods ended September 30, 2019 and September 30, 2018.
Certain processes in the manufacture of our current and past products create by-products classified as hazardous waste. We have been notified by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, state environmental agencies, and in some cases, groups of potentially responsible parties, that we may be potentially liable for environmental contamination at several sites currently and formerly owned or operated by us. Two of those sites, Asheville, North Carolina and Mountain View, California, are designated National Priorities List sites under the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency’s Superfund program. We accrue a liability for probable remediation activities, claims and proceedings against us with respect to environmental matters if the amount can be reasonably estimated, and provide disclosures including the nature of a loss whenever it is probable or reasonably possible that a potentially material loss may have occurred but cannot be estimated. We record contingent loss accruals on an undiscounted basis. 
In June 2016, we announced plans to restructure operations by phasing out production at our Elkhart facility and transitioning it into a research and development center supporting our global operations ("June 2016 Plan"). Additional organizational changes were also implemented in various other locations. During the third quarter of 2017, we revised the June 2016 Plan. The amendment added an additional $1,100 in planned costs related to the relocation of our corporate headquarters in Lisle, IL and our plant in Bolingbrook, IL, both of which have now been consolidated into a single facility. The total restructuring liability under the June 2016 Plan was $333 at September 30, 2019, and $668 at December 31, 2018. Additional costs related to production line movements, equipment charges, and other costs will be expensed as incurred. Research and development expenses were $6,806 or 5.9% of sales in the third quarter of 2019 compared to $6,517 or 5.5% of sales in the comparable quarter of 2018. 
Operating earnings were $10,124 or 8.8% of sales in the third quarter of 2019 compared to operating earnings of $16,118 or 13.6% of sales in the third quarter of 2018.

Research and development expenses were $19,854 or 5.6% of sales in the nine months ended September 30, 2019 compared to $19,500 or 5.6% of sales in the nine months ended September 30, 2018. 
Gross margin as a percent of sales was 32.0% in the third quarter of 2019 compared to 35.4% in the third quarter of 2018. The decrease in gross margin was driven primarily by a one-time purchase accounting step-up in the value of finished goods inventory acquired with our QTI acquisition, execution challenges in our ceramic foundry operation, a product replacement charge for a transportation product, and material cost and wage increases. These were partially offset by savings related to the manufacturing transition from Elkhart, Indiana and other cost improvements.

Sales to other markets increased $417 or 1.0% due to the addition of sales from the QTI acquisition. The QTI acquisition, which was completed in July 2019, added $3,670 in sales for the quarter. Changes in foreign exchange rates decreased sales by $922 year-over-year due to the U.S. Dollar appreciating compared to the Chinese Renminbi and Euro and relating mostly to sales of products to the transportation end market.
