During the three and six months ended June 30, 2018, we recognized a decrease of revenues of $46 and an increase in revenues of $86, respectively, that were included in contract liabilities at the beginning of the period. 
Goodwill recorded in connection with this acquisition represents the value we expect to be created by combining the operations of the acquired business with our existing operations, including the expansion into markets within our existing business, access to new customers, and potential cost savings and synergies. Goodwill related to this acquisition is expected to be deductible for tax purposes. 
for the six-month periods ended June 30, 2018 and 2017, since the revenue target was not deemed likely to be attained based on our current forecast.
We have debt issuance costs related to our long-term debt that are being amortized using the straight-line method over the life of the debt. These costs are included in interest expense in our Condensed Consolidated Statement of Earnings. Amortization expense was approximately $46 for both the three months ended June 30, 2018 and June 30, 2017, respectively, and approximately $93 for both the six months ended June 30, 2018 and June 30, 2017, respectively. 
In April 2014, we announced plans to restructure our operations and consolidate our Canadian operations into other existing facilities as part of our overall plan to simplify our business model and rationalize our global footprint (“April 2014 Plan”). These restructuring actions were completed in 2015. The remaining restructuring liability related to the April 2014 Plan was $433 at June 30, 2018, and $453 at December 31, 2017. 
The increase in contract liabilities as of June 30, 2018 is primarily due to net increases in estimated future discounts and price concessions, offset by net settlements of products sold with rights of return.
Changes in exchange rates between the functional currency and the currency in which a transaction is denominated are foreign exchange transaction gains or losses. Transaction losses for the three and six months ended June 30, 2018 were $2,194 and $918, respectively and transaction gains for the three and six months ended June 30, 2017 were $1,162 and $1,557, respectively, which have been included in other income (expense) in the Condensed Consolidated Statement of Earnings.
On August 10, 2015, we entered into a five-year credit agreement (“Revolving Credit Facility”) with a group of banks in order to support our financing needs. The Revolving Credit Facility originally provided for a credit line of $200,000. On May 23, 2016, we requested and received a $100,000 increase in the aggregate revolving credit commitments under the existing credit agreement, which increased the credit line from $200,000 to $300,000. 
In June 2016, we announced plans to restructure operations by phasing out production at our Elkhart facility by the end of 2018 and transitioning it into a research and development center supporting our global operations ("June 2016 Plan"). Additional organizational changes were also implemented in various other locations. During the third quarter of 2017, we revised the June 2016 Plan. The amendment added an additional $1,100 in planned costs related to the relocation of our corporate headquarters in Lisle, IL and our plant in Bolingbrook, IL, both of which will be consolidated into a single facility. The total cost of the plan is expected to be approximately $13,400. The total restructuring liability related to severance and other one-time benefit arrangements under the June 2016 Plan was $1,223 at June 30, 2018, and $1,460 at December 31, 2017. Additional costs related to production line movements, equipment charges, and other costs will be expensed as incurred. 
Certain processes in the manufacture of our current and past products create by-products classified as hazardous waste. We have been notified by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, state environmental agencies, and in some cases, groups of potentially responsible parties, that we may be potentially liable for environmental contamination at several sites currently and formerly owned or operated by us. Some sites, such as Asheville, North Carolina and Mountain View, California, are designated National Priorities List sites under the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency’s Superfund program. We reserve for probable remediation activities and for claims and proceedings against us with respect to other environmental matters. We record reserves on an undiscounted basis. In the opinion of management, based upon presently available information relating to such matters, adequate provision for probable and estimable costs have been recorded. We do not have any known environmental obligations where a loss is probable or reasonably possible of occurring for which we do not have a reserve, nor do we have any amounts for which we have not reserved because the amount of the loss cannot be reasonably estimated. Due to the inherent nature of environmental obligations, we cannot provide assurance that our ultimate environmental liability will not materially exceed the amount of its current reserve. Our reserve and disclosures will be adjusted accordingly if additional information becomes available in the future.Research and development expenses were $12,983 or 5.6% of sales in the six months ended June 30, 2018 compared to $12,052 or 5.9% of sales in the comparable prior year period.

The increase in the effective tax rate for the three months ended June 30, 2018, compared with the same period in 2017, was primarily attributed to tax expense of $1,703 related to a one-time cash distribution from Taiwan, offset by a reduction in our statutory tax rate as a result of the 2017 Tax and Jobs Act. 
Working capital decreased by $4,283 during the six months ended June 30, 2018, primarily due the decrease in cash and cash equivalents as well as the increase in accounts payable, which were partially offset by higher accounts receivable and inventory.Item 1.  Legal Proceedings
