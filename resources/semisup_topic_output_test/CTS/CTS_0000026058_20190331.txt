for the three-month periods ended March 31, 2019 and 2018, since the revenue target was not deemed likely to be attained based on our current forecast.
Our effective income tax rate was 20.0% and 24.5% in the first quarters of 2019 and 2018, respectively. The decrease in the effective tax rate for the three months ended March 31, 2019, compared with the same period in 2018, was primarily attributed to tax benefits recorded upon vesting of restricted stock units. The first quarter 2019 tax rate was lower than the U.S. statutory federal tax rate primarily due to the aforementioned tax benefits recorded upon vesting of restricted stock units. The tax rate in the first quarter of 2018 was higher than the U.S. statutory federal tax rate primarily due to higher foreign tax rates applicable on foreign earnings.
The decrease in contract liabilities as of March 31, 2019 is primarily due to the settlement of customer discounts and price concessions recognized at the beginning of the period.
In June 2016, we announced plans to restructure operations by phasing out production at our Elkhart facility and transitioning it into a research and development center supporting our global operations ("June 2016 Plan"). Additional organizational changes were also implemented in various other locations. During the third quarter of 2017, we revised the June 2016 Plan. The amendment added an additional $1,100 in planned costs related to the relocation of our corporate headquarters in Lisle, IL and our plant in Bolingbrook, IL, both of which have now been consolidated into a single facility. The total restructuring liability related to severance and other one-time benefit arrangements under the June 2016 Plan was $537 at March 31, 2019, and $668 at December 31, 2018. Additional costs related to production line movements, equipment charges, and other costs will be expensed as incurred. 
Certain processes in the manufacture of our current and past products create by-products classified as hazardous waste. We have been notified by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, state environmental agencies, and in some cases, groups of potentially responsible parties, that we may be potentially liable for environmental contamination at several sites currently and formerly owned or operated by us. Some sites, such as Asheville, North Carolina and Mountain View, California, are designated National Priorities List sites under the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency’s Superfund program. We reserve for probable remediation activities and for claims and proceedings against us with respect to other environmental matters. We record reserves on an undiscounted basis. In the opinion of management, based upon presently available information relating to such matters, adequate provision for probable and estimable costs have been recorded. We do not have any known environmental obligations where a loss is probable or reasonably possible of occurring for which we do not have a reserve, nor do we have any amounts for which we have not reserved because the amount of the loss cannot be reasonably estimated. Due to the inherent nature of environmental obligations, we cannot provide assurance that our ultimate environmental liability will not materially exceed the amount of its current reserve. Our reserve and disclosures will be adjusted accordingly if additional information becomes available in the future.
