Intangible assets amortization expense was $560 million and $1.7 billion for the three and nine months ended March 31, 2018, respectively, and $560 million and $1.1 billion for the three and nine months ended March 31, 2017, respectively.  
Our effective tax rate was 14% and 23% for the three months ended March 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively, and 70% and 21% for the nine months ended March 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. The decrease in our effective tax rate for the current quarter compared to the prior year was primarily due to the reduction of the U.S. federal statutory tax rate as a result of the TCJA. The increase in our effective tax rate for the year-to-date compared to the prior year was primarily due to the net charge related to the enactment of the TCJA in the second quarter of fiscal year 2018. 
Continuing to enhance the attractiveness of our cloud platforms to third-party developers.  
An important element of our business model has been to create platform-based ecosystems on which many participants can build diverse solutions. A well-established ecosystem creates beneficial network effects among users, application developers, and the platform provider that can accelerate growth. Establishing significant scale in the marketplace is necessary to achieve and maintain attractive margins. We face significant competition from firms that provide competing platforms, applications, and services.  
Continuing to bring to market compelling cloud-based experiences that generate increasing traffic and market share.  
We make significant investments in new products and services that may not achieve expected returns. We will continue to make significant investments in research, development, and marketing for existing products, services, and technologies, including the Windows operating system, Microsoft Office, Bing, SQL Server, Windows Server, the Windows Store, Microsoft Azure, Office 365, other cloud-based offerings, Xbox Live, and LinkedIn. We also invest in the development and acquisition of a variety of hardware for productivity, communication, and entertainment including PCs, tablets, gaming devices, and HoloLens. Investments in new technology are speculative. Commercial success depends on many factors, including innovativeness, developer support, and effective distribution and marketing. If customers do not perceive our latest offerings as providing significant new functionality or other value, they may reduce their purchases of new software and hardware products or upgrades, unfavorably affecting revenue. We may not achieve significant revenue from new product, service, and distribution channel investments for several years, if at all. New products and services may not be profitable, and even if they are profitable, operating margins for some new products and businesses will not be as high as the margins we have experienced historically.  
A competing vertically-integrated model, in which a single firm controls the software and hardware elements of a product and related services, has succeeded with some consumer products such as personal computers, tablets, phones, gaming consoles, and wearables. Competitors pursuing this model also earn revenue from services integrated with the hardware and software platform. We also offer some vertically-integrated hardware and software products and services. To the extent we shift a portion of our business to a vertically integrated model we increase our cost of revenue and reduce our operating margins.  
Product revenue includes sales from operating systems; cross-device productivity applications; server applications; business solution applications; desktop and server management tools; software development tools; video games; and hardware such as PCs, tablets, gaming and entertainment consoles, other intelligent devices, and related accessories.
