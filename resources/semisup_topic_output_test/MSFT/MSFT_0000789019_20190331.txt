Our effective tax rate was 16% and 14% for the three months ended March 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively, and 16% and 70% for the nine months ended March 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. The increase in our effective tax rate for the three months ended March 31, 2019 compared to the prior year was primarily due to changes in the mix of our income before income taxes between the U.S. and foreign countries. The decrease in our effective tax rate for the nine months ended March 31, 2019 compared to the prior year was primarily due to the net charge related to the enactment of the TCJA in the second quarter of fiscal year 2018. 
Companies compete with us based on a growing variety of business models.  
Intangible assets amortization expense was $431 million and $560 million for the three months ended March 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively, and $1.5 billion and $1.7 billion for the nine months ended March 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively.  
Continuing to enhance the attractiveness of our cloud platforms to third-party developers.  
An important element of our business model has been to create platform-based ecosystems on which many participants can build diverse solutions. A well-established ecosystem creates beneficial network effects among users, application developers, and the platform provider that can accelerate growth. Establishing significant scale in the marketplace is necessary to achieve and maintain attractive margins. We face significant competition from firms that provide competing platforms.  
Continuing to bring to market compelling cloud-based experiences that generate increasing traffic and market share.  
Our increasing focus on cloud-based services presents execution and competitive risks. A growing part of our business involves cloud-based services available across the spectrum of computing devices. Our strategic vision is to compete and grow by building best-in-class platforms and productivity services for an intelligent cloud and an intelligent edge infused with artificial intelligence (“AI”). At the same time, our competitors are rapidly developing and deploying cloud-based services for consumers and business customers. Pricing and delivery models are evolving. Devices and form factors influence how users access services in the cloud and sometimes the user’s choice of which suite of cloud-based services to use. We are devoting significant resources to develop and deploy our cloud-based strategies. The Windows ecosystem must continue to evolve with this changing environment. We are undertaking cultural and organizational changes to drive accountability and eliminate obstacles to innovation. Our intelligent cloud and intelligent edge worldview is connected with the growth of the internet of things (“IoT”). Our success in the IoT will depend on the level of adoption of our offerings such as Microsoft Azure, Azure Stack, Azure IoT Edge, and Azure Sphere. We may not establish market share sufficient to achieve scale necessary to achieve our business objectives. 
Ensuring our cloud-based services meet the reliability expectations of our customers and maintain the security of their data.  
Competing platforms have content and application marketplaces with scale and significant installed bases. The variety and utility of content and applications available on a platform are important to device purchasing decisions. Users sometimes incur costs to move data and buy new content and applications when switching platforms. To compete, we must successfully enlist developers to write applications for our platform and ensure that these applications have high quality, security, customer appeal, and value. Efforts to compete with competitors’ content and application marketplaces may increase our cost of revenue and lower our operating margins.
