 The following table presents the change in goodwill by reportable segment for the nine months ended March 31, 2018.   
 In assessing the Americas goodwill for impairment in the third quarter of fiscal 2018, the Company was required to make significant judgments related to the fair value of the Americas. The Company used a combination of an income approach, specifically a discounted cash flow methodology, and a market approach to estimate the fair value of the Americas. The discounted cash flow methodology includes market participant assumptions for, among other factors, forecasted sales, gross profit margins, operating expenses, cash flows, perpetual growth rates and long-term discount rates, all of which required judgments and estimates by management which are inherently uncertain. The market approach methodology required significant assumptions related to comparable transactions, market multiples, capital structure and control premiums.   
 For the three and nine months ended March 31, 2018, the diluted net loss per share is the same as basic net loss per share as the effects of 939,722 and 1,195,935 potential common shares, respectively, would be anti-dilutive.  
 In connection with the sale of the TS business, the Company entered into a Transition Services Agreement (“TSA”), pursuant to which the Buyer will pay the Company to provide certain information technology, distribution, facilities, finance and human resources related services for various periods of time depending upon the services not to exceed approximately two years from the closing date. Expenses incurred by the Company to provide such services under the TSA are classified within selling, general and administrative expenses and amounts billed to the Buyer to provide such services are classified as a reduction of such expenses. As of March 31, 2018, the Buyer has formally terminated substantially all TSA services outside of certain minor information technology services and all remaining TSA services are expected to be terminated by the first half of fiscal 2019.   Operating loss for the third quarter of fiscal 2018 was $(54.4) million, a decrease of $168.7 million, or 147.6%, from the third quarter of fiscal 2017 operating income of $114.3 million. The year over year decrease in operating income was primarily driven by goodwill impairment expense, partially offset by improvements at PF and EC. Adjusted operating income for the third quarter of fiscal 2018 was $174.9 million, an increase of $2.6 million, or 1.5%, from the third quarter of fiscal 2017.  
 Avnet operating loss margin was (1.1)% in the third quarter of fiscal 2018 as compared with 2.6% of operating income margin in the third quarter of fiscal 2017. Both periods included amortization and restructuring, integration and other expenses. The third quarter of fiscal 2018 also includes goodwill impairment expense. Excluding these expenses from both periods, adjusted operating income margin was 3.7% in the third quarter of fiscal 2018 as compared to 3.9% in the third quarter of fiscal 2017.   
 Gross profit for the third quarter of fiscal 2018 was $653.5 million, an increase of $23.6 million, or 3.7%, from the third quarter of fiscal 2017 gross profit of $630.0 million primarily driven by the increase in sales. Gross profit margin decreased 55 basis points to 13.6% from the third quarter of fiscal 2017, with both operating groups contributing to the decrease.  
 Operating income for the first nine months of fiscal 2018 was $102.6 million, or 0.7% of consolidated sales, as compared with operating income of $368.0 million, or 2.9% in the first nine months of 2017 primarily driven by declines in EC partially offset by the acquisition of PF.   
 Sales for the first nine months of fiscal 2018 were $13.98 billion, an increase of 8.9%, or $1.14 billion, as compared to sales of $12.83 billion for the first nine months of fiscal 2017. This increase was primarily due to the acquisition of PF, which was acquired in the second quarter of fiscal 2017, and an overall increase in sales in EC as double-digit growth in the EMEA and Asia regions of EC offset a year to date decrease of 8.9% in the EC Americas region. Organic sales for the first nine months of 2018 increased $765.8 million, or 5.8%, compared to the first nine months of fiscal 2017 primarily due to double-digit sales growth in EMEA and Asia regions, offset by a decline of 7.9% in the Americas region.   
 Cash used for operating activities of discontinued operations was $325.1 million in the first nine months of fiscal 2017 as the sale of the TS business was completed in the third quarter of fiscal 2017.   
 EC sales of $4.40 billion in the third quarter of fiscal 2018 increased $313.2 million or 7.7% from the prior year third quarter sales of $4.09 billion. This increase was primarily driven by increased sales in Asia due to organic growth and in EMEA primarily due to the benefit from the weakening of the U.S. Dollar, partially offset by declines in the Americas region due to supplier channel and program changes. PF sales for the third quarter of fiscal 2018 were $391.0 million, an increase of $40.0 million or 11.4% from the prior year third quarter sales of $351.0 million driven by growth in all three regions including the benefit from the weakening U.S. Dollar.

Based on the information known to date, management believes that the Company has appropriately accrued in its consolidated financial statements for its share of the estimable costs of environmental and other compliance related matters.
