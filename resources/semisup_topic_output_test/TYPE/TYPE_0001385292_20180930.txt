During the nine months ended September 30, 2018, the change in contract assets reclassified to receivables as a result of the right to the transaction consideration becoming unconditional was not material.

For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2018 and 2017, the net income (loss) available to common shareholders is divided by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period to calculate diluted earnings per share. The assumed exercise of stock options and assumed vesting of restricted stock and restricted stock units were included in the computation of net income per share for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2018 and for the three months ended September 30, 2017, but were excluded in the computation of net (loss) per share for the nine months ended September 30, 2017, as their effect would have been anti-dilutive. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2018 and for the three months ended September 30, 2017, the two-class method was used in the computation of diluted net income (loss) per share, as the result was more dilutive.  Cost of revenue, excluding amortization of acquired technology, was $9.4 million and $9.7 million for the three months ended September 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively, a decrease of $0.3 million, or 3.3%, mainly due to lower total revenue.
