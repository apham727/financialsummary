During the quarter ended June 30, 2018, the Company decided to cease sales of certain service offerings that were principally acquired as part of the Companys acquisition of Swyft Media in January 2015. The decision was made in connection with other restructuring actions to re-align the Companys product and service offerings. See Note 13 for further details regarding the restructuring plan.  
Item 1. Legal Proceedings  
Revenue recognized during the three and six months ended June 30, 2018 from amounts included in deferred revenue at the beginning of the period were approximately $7.6 million and $14.4 million, respectively. Revenue recognized during both the three and six months ended June 30, 2018 from performance obligations satisfied or partially satisfied in previous periods, mainly due to changes in the estimate of royalty revenues, was $4.6 million. During the six months ended June 30, 2018, the change in contract assets reclassified to receivables as a result of the right to the transaction consideration becoming unconditional was not material. The contract modifications entered into during the six months ended June 30, 2018 did not have a significant impact on the Companys contract assets or deferred revenue.  
Our Creative Professional revenue is primarily derived from rights to use font licenses, custom font design services and hosted software as a service, or SaaS, offerings. We license fonts directly to end-users through our direct sales organization, e-commerce websites and indirectly through third-party resellers. Web font and digital ad related services refer to our web font services and web design tools. Our customers include graphic designers, advertising agencies, media organizations and corporations.  
      Under legacy GAAP, we recognized royalty revenue when it was reported to us by the licensee, typically one quarter after royalty-bearing units were shipped, at which time the fee is fixed or determinable. Under ASC 606, we now estimate royalty revenue from our royalty-based licenses in the period that the royalty-bearing event occurs. Thus, revenue from royalties reported to us in the first quarter of 2018 were recorded to retained earnings upon adoption of ASC 606, rather than being recognized as revenue as it would have been under legacy GAAP. This was partially offset by the recognition of revenue in the first quarter of 2018 for estimated royalties that were reported to us in the second quarter of 2018.  
For the three months ended June 30, 2018, the two class method was used in the computation as it was the more dilutive of the two approaches. For the six months ended June 30, 2018, and three and six months ended June 30, 2017, earnings was not allocated to participating securities in the calculation of basic and diluted earnings per share as there were net losses. For the six months ended June 30, 2018, and the three and six months ended June 30, 2017, the net loss available to common shareholders was divided by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during the period to calculate diluted earnings per share. For the six months ended June 30, 2018, and three and six months ended June 30, 2017, the assumed exercise of stock options and assumed vesting of restricted stock and restricted stock units were not included in the computation of net income (loss) per share as their effect would have been anti-dilutive.  
      the strength of international economies, including consideration of high inflation rates.  Cost of revenue, excluding amortization of acquired technology, was $10.0 million and $10.1 million for the three months ended June 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively, a decrease of $0.1 million, or 1.8%. As a percentage of sales, cost of revenue, excluding amortization of acquired technology, was 16.4% and 17.6% of total revenue in the three months ended June 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively. The decrease in cost of revenue, excluding amortization of acquired technology, is primarily due to lower costs associated with our enterprise sales business.  
Revenue was $60.7 million and $57.8 million for the three months ended June 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively, an increase of $2.9 million, or 5.0%.  
Gross profit in the three months ended June 30, 2018 increased 1.3 percentage points to 82.2% of sales in the second quarter of 2018, as compared to 80.9% of sales in the same period in 2017, mainly due to improved margins in our enterprise sales business, partially offset by the continued mix shift between Creative Professional and the higher margin OEM business.  
Revenue was $117.4 million and $110.3 million for the six months ended June 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively, an increase of $7.1 million, or 6.4%.  
Research and Development. Research and development expense was $8.5 million and $9.2 million in the three months ended June 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively, a decrease of $0.7 million, or 8.4%, mainly due to lower personnel expenses. Personnel expenses decreased $0.4 million in the three months ended June 30, 2018, as compared to the same period in 2017, due to lower headcount from restructuring actions in the fourth quarter of 2017. Outside consulting expense decreased $0.2 million period over period, mainly due to timing of projects.  
Cost of revenue excluding amortization of acquired technology increased $3.5 million, or 18.4%, to $22.4 million in the six months ended June 30, 2018 as compared to $18.9 million in the six months ended June 30, 2017. The increase in cost of revenue in the six months ended June 30, 2018 is mainly due to $2.2 million of additional non-recurring royalty expense for which there was no corresponding revenue item in the period in accordance with ASC 606. As a percentage of sales, cost of revenue, excluding amortization of acquired technology, was 19.1% and 17.2% of total revenue in the six months ended June 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively.  
Creative Professional revenue increased $7.8 million, or 25.4%, to $38.4 million for the three months ended June 30, 2018, as compared to $30.6 million for the three months ended June 30, 2017, mainly due to growth in sales to enterprise customers, including our new Mosaic solution, and increased service revenue as SaaS offerings continue to become a larger part of our portfolio.
