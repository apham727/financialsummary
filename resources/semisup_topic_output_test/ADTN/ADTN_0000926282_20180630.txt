For the three and six months ended June 30, 2018, we incurred acquisition and integration related expenses and amortization of acquired intangibles of $0.8 million and $1.0 million, respectively, related to this acquisition. 
Network Solutions includes hardware products and next-generation virtualized solutions used in service provider or business networks, as well as prior generation products.  
There were no stock options granted during the three and six months ended June 30, 2018 or 2017. 
The decrease in accounts receivable is due to the collection of customer specific payment terms that became due in the first quarter of 2018. The increase in the contract asset balance for the six months ended June 30, 2018 is primarily attributable to revenue recognized that has not yet been billed to the customer during the period. The increase in the unearned revenue balance as of June 30, 2018 is primarily attributable to cash payments received or due in advance of satisfying our performance obligations, offset by $7.1 million of revenues recognized that were included in the unearned revenue balance as of December 31, 2017.  
Our effective tax rate decreased from an expense of 27.3% in the six months ended June 30, 2017, to a benefit of 20.1%, excluding the tax effect of the bargain purchase gain, in the six months ended June 30, 2018. The decrease in the effective tax rate between the two periods is primarily attributable to the change in income and the effect of the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, which was signed into law on December 22, 2017.  
We recorded a bargain purchase gain of $11.3 million during the first quarter of 2018, net of income taxes, which is subject to customary working capital adjustments between the parties. The bargain purchase gain of $11.3 million represents the difference between the fair value of the net assets acquired over the cash paid. SEI, an OEM supplier based in Japan, is the global market leader in EPON. SEI’s Broadband Networks Division, through its SEL subsidiary, operated a North American EPON business that included sales, marketing, support, and region-specific engineering development. The North American EPON market is primarily driven by the Tier 1 cable MSO operators and has developed more slowly than anticipated. Through the transaction, SEI divested its North American EPON assets and established a relationship with ADTRAN. The transfer of these assets to ADTRAN, which included key customer relationships and a required assumption by ADTRAN of relatively low incremental expenses, along with the value of the technology license and OEM supply agreement, resulted in the bargain purchase gain. We have assessed the recognition and measurement of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on historical and forecasted data for future periods and we have concluded that our valuation procedures and resulting measures were appropriate. 
We have committed to invest up to an aggregate of $7.9 million in two private equity funds, and we have contributed $8.4 million as of June 30, 2018, of which $7.7 million has been applied to these commitments. 
Intangible assets are included in other assets in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets and include intangibles acquired in conjunction with our acquisitions of Bluesocket, Inc. on August 4, 2011, the NSN BBA business on May 4, 2012, CommScope’s active fiber access business on September 13, 2016 and Sumitomo Electric Lightwave Corp.’s North American EPON business and technology license and OEM supply agreement with Sumitomo Electric Industries, Ltd. on March 19, 2018. 
The majority of the revenue from this segment is from hardware sales and is recognized when control is transferred to our customers, which is generally when we ship the products. Shipping terms are generally FOB shipping point. Revenue is recorded net of estimated discounts and rebates using the most likely amount. Customers are typically invoiced when control is transferred and revenue is recognized. Our products generally include assurance-based warranties of 90 days to five years for product defects, which are accrued at the time revenue is recognized. 
We establish reserves for estimated excess, obsolete, or unmarketable inventory equal to the difference between the cost of the inventory and the estimated fair value of the inventory based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions. At June 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017, raw materials reserves totaled $17.5 million and $15.0 million, respectively, and finished goods inventory reserves totaled $9.7 million and $8.3 million, respectively. As a result of the above factors, net income (loss) decreased $20.1 million from $12.4 million in the three months ended June 30, 2017 to $(7.7) million in the three months ended June 30, 2018, and decreased $37.5 million from $19.1 million in the six months ended June 30, 2017 to $(18.5) million in the six months ended June 30, 2018.  
As a percentage of sales, selling, general and administrative expenses increased from 18.8% in the three months ended June 30, 2017 to 25.1% in the three months ended June 30, 2018, and increased from 19.6% in the six months ended June 30, 2017 to 26.4% in the six months ended June 30, 2018.

The decrease in research and development expenses for the three months ended June 30, 2018 is primarily attributable to decreases in engineering materials, independent contractor expense, amortization of intangibles acquired in the third quarter of 2016 that were fully amortized in 2017, and performance-based compensation expense. The decrease in research and development expenses for the six months ended June 30, 2018 is primarily attributable to decreases in engineering materials and amortization of intangibles acquired in the third quarter of 2016 that were fully amortized in 2017, partially offset by an increase in labor expense due to a restructuring program.

We maintain depository investments with certain financial institutions.
