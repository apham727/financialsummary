Depreciation expense was $3.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2019 and 2018 and was $9.3 million and $9.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2019 and 2018, respectively, which is recorded in cost of sales, selling, general and administrative expenses and research and development expenses in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income. 
For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2019, we incurred acquisition and integration related expenses and amortization of acquired intangibles of $0.5 million and $1.7 million, respectively, related to the SmartRG acquisition. No acquisition-related expenses were incurred during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2018 related to the SmartRG acquisition. 
Contingent liabilities with a fair value totaling $1.2 million were recognized at the acquisition date, the payments of which were dependent upon SmartRG achieving future revenue, EBIT or customer purchase order milestones during the first half of 2019. The required milestones were not achieved and, therefore, we recognized a gain of $1.2 million upon the reversal of these liabilities during the second quarter of 2019.  
Of the outstanding unearned revenue balance at December 31, 2018, $1.2 million and $11.7 million was recognized as revenue during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2019, respectively. 
During the three months ended June 30, 2019, the Company revised the methodology used in estimating its excess and obsolete inventory reserves. Under the revised methodology, we establish reserves for estimated excess and obsolete inventory equal to the difference between the cost of the inventory and the estimated net realizable value of the inventory based on historical usage, known trends, inventory age, and market conditions. When we dispose of excess and obsolete inventories, the related disposals are charged against the inventory reserves. See Note 8 for additional information. 
As a result of the net loss for the three months ended September 30, 2019, and for the nine months ended September 30, 2019 and 2018, 4.1 million, 3.0 million and 2.3 million, respectively, shares of unvested stock options, PSUs, RSUs and restricted stock were excluded from the calculation of diluted EPS due to their anti-dilutive effect. 
There were no stock options granted during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2019 and 2018. 
The following table presents information about the sales and gross profit of our reportable segments for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2019 and 2018. We do not produce asset information by reportable segment; therefore, it is not reported. 
Our effective tax rate increased from a benefit of 34.9%, excluding the tax effect of the bargain purchase gain, in the nine months ended September 30, 2018, to an expense of 197.1% in the nine months ended September 30, 2019. The increase in the effective tax rate between the two periods was primarily driven by the establishment of a valuation allowance against our domestic deferred tax assets in the amount of $37.1 million during the three months ended September 30, 2019, offset by a 9.38% rate reduction related to a transfer pricing study completed during the second quarter of 2019 that resulted in the assignment of operating expenditures to specific company locations, and the effective income tax rates among the respective jurisdictions. 
In October 2019, the Company announced its plans to reduce its operating expenses, including global restructuring. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2019, the Company incurred approximately $1.1 million and $1.9 million, respectively, related to these plans. 
Inventory reserves are established for estimated excess and obsolete inventory equal to the difference between the cost of the inventory and the estimated net realizable value of the inventory based on historical usage, known trends, inventory age, and market conditions. At September 30, 2019 and December 31, 2018, our inventory reserve was $32.0 million and $30.0 million, respectively. Research and development expenses increased 6.6% from $29.9 million for the three months ended September 30, 2018 to $31.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2019 and increased 2.2% from $93.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2018 to $95.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2019. The increase in research and development expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2019 was primarily attributable to increases in incremental expenses as a result of the SmartRG acquisition, personnel-related expenses and restructuring expenses. The increase in research and development expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2019 was primarily attributable to increases in incremental expenses as a result of the SmartRG acquisition, contract services and lease expense, offset by a decrease in personnel-related expenses. 
As a percentage of sales, research and development expenses increased from 21.3% for the three months ended September 30, 2018 to 27.9% for the three months ended September 30, 2019, and decreased from 24.0% for the nine months ended September 30, 2018 to 23.1% for the nine months ended September 30, 2019.

The decrease in cost of sales as a percentage of sales for the nine months ended September 30, 2019 was primarily attributable to an increase in volume, a regional revenue shift, changes in customer and product mix and a decrease in labor expense due to a restructuring program initiated in the first quarter of 2018.

The increase in selling, general and administrative expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2019 was primarily attributable to incremental expenses as a result of the SmartRG acquisition, IP litigation costs and professional and contract services offset by decreases in personnel-related expenses. The increase in selling, general and administrative expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2019 was primarily attributable to incremental expenses as a result of the SmartRG acquisition, IP litigation costs and deferred compensation offset by a decrease in personnel-related expenses.

Gain on bargain purchase of a business, net, which was $11.3 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2018, was related to our acquisition of Sumitomo Electric Lightwave Corp.’s North American EPON business and entry into a technology license and supply agreement with Sumitomo Electric Industries, Ltd. in March 2018. No gain on bargain purchase of a business was recorded during the three or nine months ended September 30, 2019.  The U.S. government has imposed tariffs on a wide-range of products and goods manufactured in China and imported into the U.S. These tariffs are intended to address trade imbalances, which include decreasing imports from China and encouraging increased production of these products in the U.S. These proposals have, and could continue to, result in increased customs duties and tariffs. We import an increasing percentage of our products into the U.S from China, and an increase in customs duties and tariffs with respect to these imports could negatively impact our gross profit, gross margins and results of operations. These customs duties and tariffs may also cause other U.S. trading partners to take certain actions with respect to U.S. imports in their respective countries. Any potential changes in trade policies in the U.S. and the potential actions by other countries in which we do business could adversely impact our financial performance.
