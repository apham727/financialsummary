Amortization expense, all of which relates to business acquisitions, was $0.4 million and $1.1 million for the three months ended March 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. 
Network Solutions includes hardware products and next-generation virtualized solutions used in service provider or business networks, as well as prior generation products.  
For the three months ended March 31, 2018, we incurred acquisition and integration related expenses and amortization of acquired intangibles of $0.2 million related to this acquisition. 
Our effective tax rate decreased from 20.3% in the three months ended March 31, 2017, to 15.1%, excluding the tax impact of the bargain purchase gain, in the three months ended March 31, 2018. The decrease in the effective tax rate between the two periods is primarily attributable to the impact of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, which was signed into law on December 22, 2017.  
There were no stock options granted during the three months ended March 31, 2018 or 2017. 
We have committed to invest up to an aggregate of $7.9 million in two private equity funds, and we have contributed $8.4 million as of March 31, 2018, of which $7.7 million has been applied to these commitments. 
We recorded a bargain purchase gain of $11.3 million during the first quarter of 2018, net of income taxes, which is subject to customary working capital adjustments between the parties. The bargain purchase gain of $11.3 million represents the difference between the fair value of the net assets acquired over the cash paid. SEI, an OEM supplier based in Japan, is a market leader in EPON. SEI’s Broadband Networks Division through its SEL subsidiary operated a North American EPON business including sales, marketing, support, and region-specific engineering development. The North American EPON market is primarily driven by the Tier 1 cable MSO operators and has developed slower than anticipated. Through the transaction, SEI divested its North American EPON assets and established a relationship with ADTRAN. The transfer of these assets to ADTRAN, which included key customer relationships and required assumption by ADTRAN of relatively low incremental expenses, along with the value of the technology license and OEM supply agreement, resulted in the bargain purchase gain. We have assessed the recognition and measurement of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on historical and forecasted data for future periods and have concluded that our valuation procedures and resulting measures were appropriate. 
The majority of the revenue from this segment is from hardware sales and is recognized when control is transferred to our customers, which is generally when we ship the products. Shipping terms are generally FOB shipping point. Revenue is recorded net of discounts and rebates using the most likely amount. Customers are typically invoiced when control is transferred and revenue is recognized. Our products generally include assurance-based warranties of 90 days to five years for product defects, which are accrued at the time revenue is recognized. 
Intangible assets are included in other assets in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets and include intangibles acquired in conjunction with our acquisitions of Bluesocket, Inc. on August 4, 2011, the NSN BBA business on May 4, 2012, CommScope’s active fiber access business on September 13, 2016 and Sumitomo Electric Lightwave Corp.’s North American EPON business and technology license and OEM supply agreement with Sumitomo Electric Industries, Ltd. on March 19, 2018. 
We issued 24 thousand shares of treasury stock during the three months ended March 31, 2018 to accommodate employee stock option exercises. The stock options had exercise prices ranging from $15.29 to $18.97. We received proceeds totaling $0.4 million from the exercise of these stock options during the three months ended March 31, 2018. Sales were $120.8 million for the three months ended March 31, 2018, compared to $170.3 million for the three months ended March 31, 2017. Our gross margin decreased to 32.9% in the three months ended March 31, 2018 from 43.3% in the three months ended March 31, 2017. Our operating income margin decreased to (22.1)% for the three months ended March 31, 2018, from 4.1% for the three months ended March 31, 2017. Net income (loss) was $(10.8) million for the three months ended March 31, 2018, compared to $6.7 million for the three months ended March 31, 2017. Our effective tax rate, excluding the effect of the bargain purchase gain in 2018, decreased to 15.1% for the three months ended March 31, 2018, from 20.3% for the three months ended March 31, 2017. Earnings (loss) per share, assuming dilution, were $(0.22) for the three months ended March 31, 2018, compared to $0.14 for the three months ended March 31, 2017. 
As a result of the above factors, net income (loss) decreased $17.5 million from $6.7 million in the three months ended March 31, 2017 to $(10.8) million in the three months ended March 31, 2018.  
Network Solutions cost of sales, as a percent of that segment’s sales, increased from 53.4% in the three months ended March 31, 2017 to 65.2% in the three months ended March 31, 2018. The increase in cost of sales as a percentage of sales for the three months ended March 31, 2018 is primarily attributable to a regional revenue shift, customer and product mix, an increase in labor expense due to a restructuring program, an increase in warranty expense due to a settlement in Q1 2017 with a third party supplier for a defective component and purchase discounts received from a contract manufacturer in Q1 2017. 
Selling, general and administrative expenses decreased 3.6% from $34.8 million in the three months ended March 31, 2017 to $33.5 million in the three months ended March 31, 2018. The decrease in selling, general and administrative expenses for the three months ended March 31, 2018 is primarily attributable to decreases in deferred compensation expense, travel expense, performance-based compensation expense, independent contractor expense, and legal expense, partially offset by an increase in labor expense due to a restructuring program.  
As a percentage of sales, cost of sales increased from 56.7% in the three months ended March 31, 2017 to 67.1% in the three months ended March 31, 2018. The increase in cost of sales as a percentage of sales for the three months ended March 31, 2018 is primarily attributable to a regional revenue shift, customer and product mix, services and support mix, an increase in labor expense due to a restructuring program, an increase in warranty expense due to a settlement in Q1 2017 with a third party supplier for a defective component and purchase discounts received from a contract manufacturer in Q1 2017. 
Our effective tax rate decreased from 20.3% in the three months ended March 31, 2017 to 15.1%, excluding the tax impact of the bargain purchase gain, in the three months ended March 31, 2018. The decrease in the effective tax rate between the two periods is primarily attributable to the impact of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, which was signed into law on December 22, 2017. 
Interest and dividend income decreased 7.2% from $933 thousand in the three months ended March 31, 2017 to $866 thousand in the three months ended March 31, 2018. The decrease in interest and dividend income for the three months ended March 31, 2018 is primarily attributable to a decrease in investment balances and a decrease in the rate of return on those investments. As of March 31, 2017, approximately $169.3 million of our cash and investments was subject to being directly affected by changes in interest rates. We have performed a hypothetical sensitivity analysis assuming market interest rates increase or decrease by 50 bps for the entire year, while all other variables remain constant. A hypothetical 50 bps decline in interest rates as of March 31, 2017 would have reduced annualized interest income on our cash, money market instruments and variable rate demand notes by approximately $0.4 million. In addition, a hypothetical 50 bps increase in interest rates as of March 31, 2017 would have reduced the fair value of our fixed-rate bonds by approximately $0.5 million.
