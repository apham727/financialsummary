For the three and six months ended June 30, 2019, we incurred amortization of acquired intangibles of $0.6 million and $1.2 million, respectively, related to the SmartRG acquisition. No acquisition-related expenses were incurred during the three and six months ended June 30, 2018 related to the SmartRG acquisition. 
Contingent liabilities with a fair value totaling $1.2 million were recognized at the acquisition date, the payments of which were dependent upon SmartRG achieving future revenue, EBIT or customer purchase order milestones during the first half of 2019. The required milestones were not achieved and, therefore, we recognized a gain of $1.2 million upon the reversal of these liabilities during the second quarter of 2019.  
Of the outstanding unearned revenue balance at December 31, 2018, $3.6 million and $10.5 million was recognized as revenue during the three and six months ended June 30, 2019, respectively. 
There were no stock options granted during the three and six months ended June 30, 2019 or 2018. 
During the three months ended June 30, 2019, the Company revised the methodology in how it estimates its excess and obsolete inventory reserves. Under the revised methodology, we establish reserves for estimated excess and obsolete inventory equal to the difference between the cost of the inventory and the estimated net realizable value of the inventory based on historical usage, known trends, inventory age, and market conditions. When we dispose of excess and obsolete inventories, the related disposals are charged against the inventory reserve. See Note 8 of Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. 
Our effective tax rate decreased from a benefit of 20.1%, excluding the tax effect of the bargain purchase gain, in the six months ended June 30, 2018, to a benefit of 6.2% in the six months ended June 30, 2019. The decrease in the effective tax rate between the two periods was primarily driven by the shift to profitability in the six months ended June 30, 2019, with tax expense being offset by a 29.1% rate reduction related to a transfer pricing study completed during the second quarter of 2019 that resulted in the assignment of operating expenditures to specific company locations, and the effective income tax rates among the respective jurisdictions. 
During the three months ended June 30, 2019, the Company determined that there was an immaterial misstatement of its excess and obsolete inventory reserves in its previously issued annual and interim financial statements. The Company corrected this misstatement by recognizing a $0.8 million out-of-period adjustment during the three months ended June 30, 2019, which increased its excess and obsolete inventory reserve and cost of goods sold for the period. For the six months ended June 30, 2019, the out-of-period adjustment was a cumulative $0.2 million reduction in its excess and obsolete inventory reserve and cost of goods sold. In addition, the Company determined that a $1.0 million cash inflow related to an insurance recovery was incorrectly classified as a cash flow from operations instead of a cash flow from investing activities within the unaudited Condensed Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows for the three months ended March 31, 2019. The accompanying Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows for the six months ended June 30, 2019 correctly reflects the $1.0 million insurance recovery as a cash inflow from investing activities. Management has determined that these misstatements were not material to any of its previously issued financial statements and that correction of the misstatements is also not material to the current or estimated annual 2019 financial results on both a quantitative and qualitative basis.  
Inventory reserves are established for estimated excess and obsolete inventory equal to the difference between the cost of the inventory and the estimated net realizable value of the inventory based on historical usage, known trends, inventory age, and market conditions. At June 30, 2019 and December 31, 2018, our inventory reserve was $31.0 million and $30.0 million, respectively. 
The following is a description of the principal activities from which we generate our revenue by reportable segment. 
An escrow in the amount of $2.8 million was set up at the acquisition date to fund post-closing working capital settlements and to satisfy indemnity obligations to the Company arising from any inaccuracy or breach of representations, warranties, covenants, agreements or obligations of the sellers. The escrow is subject to arbitration with final settlement expected during the fourth quarter of 2020. The minimum and maximum potential release of funds to the sellers ranges from zero to $2.8 million.  As a result of the above factors, net income (loss) increased $11.7 million from a net loss of $(7.7) million for the three months ended June 30, 2018 to net income of $4.0 million for the three months ended June 30, 2019, and increased $23.3 million from a net loss of $(18.5) million for the six months ended June 30, 2018 to net income of $4.8 million for the six months ended June 30, 2019.  
Research and development expenses increased 4.3% from $30.7 million for the three months ended June 30, 2018 to $32.1 million for the three months ended June 30, 2019 and increased 0.2% from $63.6 million for the six months ended June 30, 2018 to $63.7 million for the six months ended June 30, 2019. The increase in research and development expenses for the three months ended June 30, 2019 was primarily attributable to increases in incremental expenses as a result of the SmartRG acquisition and restructuring expenses. The increase in research and development expense for the six months ended June 30, 2019 was primarily attributable to increases in contract services and increases in incremental expenses as a result of the SmartRG acquisition, partially offset by decreases in personnel expense and stock-based compensation expense. 
As a percentage of sales, research and development expenses decreased from 24.0% for the three months ended June 30, 2018 to 20.5% for the three months ended June 30, 2019, and decreased from 25.5% for the six months ended June 30, 2018 to 21.2% for the six months ended June 30, 2019. Research and development expenses as a percentage of sales will fluctuate whenever there are incremental product development activities or significant fluctuations in revenue for the periods being compared. 
Network Solutions segment cost of sales, as a percentage of that segment’s sales, decreased from 60.5% for the three months ended June 30, 2018 to 57.6% for the three months ended June 30, 2019 and decreased from 62.7% for the six months ended June 30, 2018 to 57.0% for the six months ended June 30, 2019. The decrease in cost of sales as a percentage of sales for the three months ended June 30, 2019 was primarily attributable to an increase in volume, a regional revenue shift and changes in customer and product mix. The decrease in cost of sales as a percentage of sales for the six months ended June 30, 2019 was primarily attributable to an increase in volume, a regional revenue shift, changes in customer and product mix and a decrease in labor expense due to a restructuring program initiated in the first quarter of 2018. 
As a percentage of sales, selling, general and administrative expenses decreased from 25.1% for the three months ended June 30, 2018 to 21.5% for the three months ended June 30, 2019, and decreased from 26.4% for the six months ended June 30, 2018 to 22.9% for the six months ended June 30, 2019. Selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales may fluctuate whenever there is a significant fluctuation in revenue for the periods being compared. 
Interest and dividend income decreased 24.2% from $0.9 million for the three months ended June 30, 2018 to $0.7 million for the three months ended June 30, 2019, and decreased 27.9% from $1.8 million for the six months ended June 30, 2018 to $1.3 million for the six months ended June 30, 2019. The changes in interest and dividend income for the three and six months ended June 30, 2019 were primarily attributable to fluctuations in investment balances. Mr. Shannon’s termination of employment was in accordance with a Separation Agreement and General Release entered into between the Company and Mr. Shannon on June 7, 2019, which became effective on June 15, 2019 and provided for Mr. Shannon’s termination of employment as of the Separation Date (the “Separation Agreement”). Pursuant to the Separation Agreement, Mr. Shannon is subject to certain restrictive covenants, including non-competition and non-solicitation restrictions for a period of eighteen months following the Separation Date, as well as customary confidentiality and non-disparagement restrictions. As consideration for his execution of the Separation Agreement, Mr. Shannon received an aggregate lump sum payment of approximately $0.2 million, representing the equivalent of six months’ pay, less withholdings, and six months of insurance coverage premiums. Additionally, all of Mr. Shannon’s unvested restricted stock units vested, and the Company agreed to extend the expiration dates of his vested stock options to twelve months after the Separation Date.
