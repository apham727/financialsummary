For the three months ended March 31, 2019 and 2018, we incurred acquisition and integration related expenses and amortization of acquired intangibles of $1.3 million and $0.2 million respectively, related to these acquisitions. 
Our effective tax rate increased from an expense of 15.1%, excluding the tax effect of the bargain purchase gain, in the three months ended March 31, 2018, to an expense of 28.6% in the three months ended March 31, 2019. The increase in the effective tax rate between the two periods is primarily driven by the shift to profitability in the current quarter. 
There were no stock options granted during the three months ended March 31, 2019 or 2018. 
$6.9 million of the outstanding unearned revenue balance at December 31, 2018 was recognized as revenue during the three months ended March 31, 2019. 
Contingent liabilities with a fair value totaling $1.2 million were recognized at the acquisition date, the payments of which are dependent upon SmartRG achieving future revenue, EBIT or customer purchase order milestones during the first half of 2019. The contingent payments are subject to arbitration and the final payouts, if applicable, are expected to occur during the third quarter of 2019. The minimum and maximum potential payment under the total of the contingent liabilities ranges from no payment to $1.5 million. As of March 31, 2019, the fair value of the contingent liability was re-assessed and was determined to be $1.2 million, based on the expected probable outcomes. No change in fair value was recognized during the three months ended March 31, 2019. 
We have committed to invest up to an aggregate of $7.9 million in two private equity funds, and we have contributed $8.4 million as of March 31, 2019, of which $7.7 million has been applied to these commitments. 
The following is a description of the principal activities from which we generate our revenue by reportable segment. 
We establish reserves for estimated excess, obsolete, or unmarketable inventory equal to the difference between the cost of the inventory and the estimated fair value of the inventory based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions. At March 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018, raw materials reserves totaled $17.1 million and $17.6 million, respectively, and finished goods inventory reserves totaled $12.8 million and $12.4 million, respectively. 
As of March 31, 2019 and 2018, gross unrealized losses related to individual investments in a continuous loss position for twelve months or longer were not significant. 
A significant portion of these future minimum lease payments relates to one of our customers who filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in February 2019. In March 2019, we reached an agreement with this customer and they continue to make payments as outlined in the lease agreements. Therefore, we believe there is no potential risk of uncollectibility related to these outstanding balances. 
In February 2019, we announced the restructuring of our workforce predominantly in Germany, which included the closure of the office location in Munich, Germany accompanied by relocation or severance benefits for the affected employees. The restructuring is expected to be completed in the fourth quarter of 2019. The cumulative amount incurred during the three months ended March 31, 2019 related to this restructuring program is $1.8 million. We also offered a voluntary early retirement offering to certain other employees which was announced to employees in March 2019. As of March 31, 2019, we did not have sufficient information on which to estimate an additional liability associated with the voluntary early retirement program. Research and development expenses decreased 3.7% from $32.8 million in the three months ended March 31, 2018 to $31.6 million in the three months ended March 31, 2019. The decrease in research and development expenses for the three months ended March 31, 2019 is primarily attributable to decreases in restructuring and labor expenses, partially offset by an increase in incremental expenses as a result of the SmartRG and Sumitomo acquisitions. 
As a result of the above factors, net income increased $11.6 million from a net loss of $10.8 million in the three months ended March 31, 2018 to net income of $0.8 million in the three months ended March 31, 2019.  
Network Solutions cost of sales, as a percent of that segmentâ€™s sales, decreased from 65.2% in the three months ended March 31, 2018 to 56.2% in the three months ended March 31, 2019. The decrease in cost of sales as a percentage of sales for the three months ended March 31, 2019 is primarily attributable to a regional revenue shift, customer and product mix and a decrease in labor expense due to a restructuring program in the first quarter of 2018. 
Selling, general and administrative expenses increased 4.8% from $33.5 million in the three months ended March 31, 2018 to $35.1 million in the three months ended March 31, 2019. The increase in selling, general and administrative expenses for the three months ended March 31, 2019 is primarily attributable to increases in deferred compensation expense and incremental expenses as a result of the SmartRG acquisition. 
As a percentage of sales, cost of sales decreased from 67.1% in the three months ended March 31, 2018 to 57.8% in the three months ended March 31, 2019. The decrease in cost of sales as a percentage of sales for the three months ended March 31, 2019 is primarily attributable to a regional revenue shift, customer and product mix, services and support mix and a decrease in labor expense as a result of a restructuring program in the first quarter of 2018. 
As a percentage of sales, selling, general and administrative expenses decreased from 27.8% in the three months ended March 31, 2018 to 24.4% in the three months ended March 31, 2019. Selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales may fluctuate whenever there is a significant fluctuation in revenue for the periods being compared. 
Interest and dividend income decreased 31.8% from $0.9 million in the three months ended March 31, 2018 to $0.6 million in the three months ended March 31, 2019. The decrease in interest and dividend income for the three months ended March 31, 2019 is primarily attributable to fluctuations in investment balances.
