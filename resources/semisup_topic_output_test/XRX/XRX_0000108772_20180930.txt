During the nine months ended September 30, 2018, we recorded net restructuring and asset impairment charges of $91, which included $104 of severance costs related to headcount of approximately 1,850 employees worldwide and $13 of lease cancellation costs. These costs were partially offset by $26 of net reversals, primarily resulting from changes in estimated reserves from prior period initiatives.
In general, we would only be liable for the amount of these guarantees in the event we defaulted in performing our obligations under each contract; the probability of which we believe is remote. We believe that our capacity in the surety markets as well as under various credit arrangements (including our Credit Facility) is sufficient to allow us to respond to future requests for proposals that require such credit support.

For the three months ended September 30, 2018, the decrease was also attributed to lower installs of the Versant systems (partially as a result of lapping the prior year launch).
