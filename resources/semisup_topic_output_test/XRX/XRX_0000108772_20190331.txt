Total contingent rentals on operating leases, consisting principally of usage charges in excess of minimum contracted amounts, were $27 and $30, for the three months ended March 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. 
In March 2019, as part of Project Own It, we entered into a shared services arrangement with HCL Technologies (HCL) pursuant to which we are outsourcing certain global administrative and support functions, including, among others, selected information technology and finance functions (excluding accounting). The transition of these functions to HCL is expected to take up to 18 months. HCL is expected to make certain up-front and ongoing investments in software, tools and other technology to consolidate, optimize and automate the transferred functions with the goal of providing improved service levels and significant cost savings. The shared services arrangement with HCL includes a total aggregate spending commitment by us of approximately $1.3 billion over the next 7 years. However, we can terminate the arrangement at any time at our discretion, subject to payment of termination fees that decline over the term or for cause. The spending commitment excludes restructuring and related costs we are expected to incur in connection with the transition of the contemplated functions - refer to Note 11 - Restructuring Programs for additional information. The shared services arrangement with HCL is subject to compliance with European works council and employment regulatory requirements. 
Lessee accounting - the adoption of this update resulted in an increase to assets and related liabilities of approximately $385 (approximately $440 undiscounted) primarily related to leases of facilities. Lessor accounting - the adoption of this update resulted in an increase to equipment sales by approximately $3 in 2019 as compared to 2018.
For the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, operating lease rent expense, net of sublease income, were $147 and $161, respectively.
This matter is a “Conduent Liability”, as defined in the Separation and Distribution Agreement dated as of December 31, 2016 between Xerox Corporation and Conduent Incorporated, for which Conduent is required to indemnify Xerox. Conduent is entitled to direct the defense of this matter.
We may also incur costs associated with our services arrangements to generate or enhance resources and assets that will be used to satisfy our future performance obligations included in these arrangements. These costs are considered contract fulfillment costs and are amortized over the contractual service period of the arrangement to cost of services. In addition, we also provide inducements to certain customers in various forms, including contractual credits, which are capitalized and amortized as a reduction of revenue over the term of the contract. As of March 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018 amounts deferred associated with contract fulfillment costs and inducements were $12 and $12, respectively, The related amortization for the three months ended March 31, 2019 and 2018 was $1 and $1, respectively .
At March 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018, we had outstanding forward exchange and purchased option contracts with gross notional values of $954 and $1,103 respectively, with terms of less than 12 months. Approximately 76% of the contracts at March 31, 2019 mature within three months, 12% mature in three to six months and 12% in six to twelve months. The associated currency exposures being hedged at March 31, 2019 were materially consistent with our year-end currency exposures. There has not been any material change in our hedging strategy.•12% decrease in high-end black-and-white systems reflecting market trends. 
•High-end - For the three months ended March 31, 2019, revenue was nearly flat, as compared to first quarter 2018, and was driven by lower sales from our Americas sales organization, mostly offset by growth from our European region. The decline in installs was partially offset by a favorable revenue mix driven by strong demand for the higher-configuration models of our Iridesse production press. 
Gains on sales of businesses and assets for the three months ended March 31, 2019 were $15 million lower than first quarter 2018, reflecting the prior year sale of non-core business assets.
Equity in net income (loss) of unconsolidated affiliates primarily reflects our 25% share of Fuji Xerox Net income (loss). For the three months ended March 31, 2019, equity income increased $113 million as compared to the first quarter 2018, primarily reflecting $67 million of lower year-over-year charges related to our share of Fuji Xerox after-tax restructuring and other changes as well as an approximate $28 million charge related to an out-of-period charge at Fuji Xerox in the prior year. The increase also reflects savings from restructuring. 
•14% decrease in high-end color installs, reflecting lower installs of our iGen and lower-end production systems including Versant systems, partially offset by strong demand for the higher-configuration models of our Iridesse production press and higher installs of our inkjet production systems.
Non-financing interest expense for the three months ended March 31, 2019 of $27 million was $2 million lower than first quarter 2018. When combined with financing interest expense (Cost of financing), total interest expense decreased by $4 million from first quarter 2018 primarily due to a lower debt balance.101.CAL XBRL Taxonomy Extension Calculation Linkbase.
