Xerox is focused on increasing its Small and Mid-sized (SMB) coverage through resellers and partners (including multi-brand dealers) and continued distribution acquisitions. During the second quarter of 2019, acquisitions totaled $38 and included Rabbit Copiers, Inc. (Rabbit Office Automation (ROA)), a San Francisco Bay area dealer, and Heritage Business Systems, Inc. (HBS), a Delaware Valley dealer. Both dealers expand our distribution and increase the number of resources in these geographies and provide office technology sales, services and supplies in those markets.
this update resulted in an increase to equipment sales for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2019 of approximately $9 and $20, respectively, in 2019 as compared to the prior year periods. 
Profit at lease commencement on sales type leases was estimated to be approximately $86 and $76 for the three months ended September 30, 2019 and 2018, respectively, and approximately $206 and $221 for the nine months ended September 30, 2019 and 2018, respectively.
Total contingent rentals on operating leases, consisting principally of usage charges in excess of minimum contracted amounts, were $25 and $28 for the three months ended September 30, 2019 and 2018, respectively, and $80 and $89 for the nine months ended September 30, 2019 and 2018, respectively.
