The goodwill is primarily attributable to anticipated revenue growth from the combined company product portfolio, expected synergies of the combined company, and the assembled workforce of KMG.
In particular, China is a fast-developing market for the semiconductor industry, and is an area of potential continued growth for us.
During this quarter we made a prepayment of $45.0 million.
We utilize and rely upon a global workforce.
The decrease in our effective tax rate for the six months ended March 31, 2019 compared to the prior year is primarily attributable to the changes introduced by the Tax Act enacted in December 2017.
 The Company’s effective tax rate was 28.5% and 26.0% for the three and six months ended March 31, 2019, respectively, compared to a 19.6% and 63.8% effective income tax rate for the three and six months ended March 31, 2018.
We have identified our Performance Materials segment as another area of potential continued growth and the product offerings in our Performance Materials segment are similarly concentrated.
The adjustments to segment EBITDA for the three and six months ended March 31, 2019 represent addbacks of KMG acquisition and integration related expenses, and a charge for the write-up of inventory acquired from KMG to fair value, for inventory sold in the period.
We acquired KMG to extend and strengthen our position as one of the leading suppliers of consumable materials to the semiconductor industry and to expand our portfolio with the addition of KMG’s performance materials business, which we believe will enable us to be a leading global provider of performance products and services to the pipeline operations and energy industries.
Net sales of the acquired KMG business since the Acquisition Date through March 31, 2019 were $185,127.
The long-term investment was adjusted to $1,371 in the second quarter of fiscal 2019 to reflect its fair value as of March 31, 2019.Total cost of sales was $150.6 million for the three months ended March 31, 2019, which represented an increase of 121.6%, or $82.6 million, from the three months ended March 31, 2018, primarily due to the Acquisition.
Revenue was $265.4 million for the three months ended March 31, 2019, which represented an 85.6%, or $122.4 million, increase from the three months ended March 31, 2018, primarily due to the Acquisition.
Total research, development and technical expenses were $12.8 million for the three months ended March 31, 2019, which represented a decrease of 4.4%, or $0.6 million, from the three months ended March 31, 2018.
Other expense was $1.0 million for the three months ended March 31, 2019, which represented an increase of $0.9 million, from the three months ended March 31, 2018.
 Net income was $27.1 million for the three months ended March 31, 2019, which represented a decrease of 8.7%, or $2.6 million, from the three months ended March 31, 2018.We expect these technological changes, and this drive toward lower costs, higher quality and performance and higher yields, will continue in the future.
Industry analysts predict that this trend will continue, which means the semiconductor industry will be comprised of fewer and larger participants in the future if their prediction is correct.
In particular, China is a fast-developing market for the semiconductor industry, and is an area of potential continued growth for us.
