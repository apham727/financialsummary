 Revenue from services transferred to customers over time accounted for 2.7% and 2.6% of sales of net sales for the three- and six-month periods ended June 30, 2018, respectively. The majority of the Company's revenue that is recognized over time relates to the BEACON AMA software as a service.
The amount of revenue recognized in the three- and six-month periods ending June 30, 2018 that was included in the opening contract liability balance was $0.3 million and $0.6 million, respectively. The difference between the opening and closing balances of the Company's contract liabilities was the result of a timing difference between the Company's performance and the customers' prepayments. The increased receivables balance was due to higher sales in the first half of 2018 compared to the fourth quarter of 2017. Generally, receivables balances are lower at year-end than at other times of the year.
The Company relies on single suppliers for most brass castings and certain resin and electronic subassemblies in several of its product lines. The Company believes these items would be available from other sources, but that the loss of certain suppliers would result in a higher cost of materials, delivery delays, short-term increases in inventory and higher quality control costs in the short term. The Company attempts to mitigate these risks by working closely with key suppliers, purchasing minimal amounts from alternative suppliers and by purchasing business interruption insurance where appropriate.
On April 2, 2018, the Company acquired 100% of the outstanding stock of Innovative Metering Solutions, Inc. ("IMS") of Odessa, Florida, which was one of the Company's distributors serving Florida. 
The Company's performance obligations are satisfied at a point in time or over time as work progresses. Revenue from products and services transferred to customers at a single point in time accounted for 97.3% and 97.4% of net sales for the three- and six-month periods ended June 30, 2018, respectively. The majority of the Company's revenue recognized at a point in time is for the sale of municipal and flow instrumentation products. Revenue from these contracts is recognized when the customer is able to direct the use of and obtain substantially all of the benefits from the product which generally coincides with title transfer during the shipping process.
The provision for income taxes as a percentage of earnings before income taxes for the second quarter of 2018 was 22.2% compared to 35.5% in the second quarter of 2017. The provision for income taxes as a percentage of earnings before income taxes for the first half of 2018 was 22.2% compared to 34.9% for the first half of 2017. Interim provisions are tied to an estimate of the overall annual rate which can vary due to state taxes and the relationship of foreign and domestic earnings. These items cause variations between periods. The decrease between years was due almost entirely to the lower Federal tax rate, which declined from 35% in 2017 to 21% in 2018 as a result of U.S. tax reform that was enacted in December 2017. For the six-months ended June 30, 2018 and 2017, the Company recognized discrete tax benefits related to a pension plan payment (2018 only) and the excess tax benefits from stock-based compensation of $0.5 million and $0.2 million, respectively. 
The balance of contract assets was immaterial as the Company did not have a significant amount of uninvoiced receivables in the three- and six-month periods ended June 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017. 
The Company also has contracts that include both the sale and installation of flow meters as performance obligations. In those cases, the Company records revenue for installed flow meters at the point in time when the flow meters have been accepted by the customer. The customer cannot control the use of and obtain substantially all of the benefits from the equipment until the customer has accepted the installed product. Therefore, for both the flow meter and the related installation, the Company has concluded that control is transferred to the customer upon customer acceptance of the installed flow meters. In addition, the Company has a variety of ancillary revenue streams which are minor. The types and composition of the Company's revenue streams did not materially change during the three- and six-month periods ended June 30, 2018 from year end 2017.
In the opinion of management, the accompanying unaudited consolidated condensed financial statements of Badger Meter, Inc. (the “Company” or “Badger Meter”) contain all adjustments (consisting only of normal recurring accruals except as otherwise discussed) necessary to present fairly the Company’s consolidated condensed financial position at June 30, 2018, results of operations for the three- and six-month periods ended June 30, 2018 and 2017, comprehensive income for the three- and six-month periods ended June 30, 2018 and 2017, and cash flows for the six-month periods ended June 30, 2018 and 2017. The results of operations for any interim period are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for the full year.Flow instrumentation products represented 23.0% of sales for the six months ended June 30, 2018, the same as the first six months of 2017. These sales increased $2.7 million, or 5.7%, to $50.2 million for the first six months in 2018 compared to $47.5 million in the same period last year due to higher sales into the oil and gas market as well as other targeted markets.
 Flow instrumentation products represented 22.5% of sales for the three months ended June 30, 2018 compared to 23.2% during the same period in 2017. These sales increased $1.5 million, or 6.2%, to $25.6 million from $24.1 million in the same period last year. The increase was due to the continued rebound in the oil and gas market and other targeted markets served.
The Company’s net sales for the three months ended June 30, 2018 increased $9.4 million, or 9.0%, to $113.6 million compared to $104.2 million during the same period in 2017.
Municipal water sales represented 77.5% of sales in the second quarter of 2018 compared to 76.8% in the second quarter of 2017. These sales increased $7.9 million, or 9.9%, to $88.0 million in the second quarter of 2018 from $80.1 million in the second quarter of 2017. The increase was due to higher prices and increased domestic volumes sold of newer technologies in meters and related radios as well as higher service revenue. Higher international sales also contributed to the increase, particularly in the Middle East. 
Selling, engineering and administration expenses for the six months ended June 30, 2018 increased $2.6 million, or 5.3%, to $51.9 million from $49.3 million in the same period in 2017. Higher healthcare, sales commission and research and development expenses contributed to the increase in addition the additional staffing from recent acquisitions and normal inflationary increases. 
Municipal water sales represented 77.0% of sales for the first six months of 2018, the same as the first six months of 2017. These sales increased $10.2 million, or 6.4%, to $168.5 million from $158.3 million in 2017 and were driven by higher prices and increased domestic volumes sold of newer technologies in meters and related radios as well as higher service revenue. Higher international sales also contributed to the increase, particularly in the Middle East. Offsetting this somewhat were lower volumes of commercial meters sold.
The main sources of liquidity for the Company are cash from operations and borrowing capacity. Cash provided by operations was $25.2 million for the first six months of 2018 compared to $37.3 million through the first six months of 2017. Last year’s amount was favorably impacted by a decrease in inventory balances which did not recur this year. This, along with higher receivable balances are the primary reasons for the decline.
Critical to the water metering ecosystem is information and analytics. The Company’s BEACON AMA Managed Solution is the latest in metering technology. BEACON AMA combines the BEACON analytical software suite with proven ORION technologies using two-way fixed and cellular networks in a managed solution, improving utilities’ visibility of their water consumption and eliminating the need for costly utility-managed infrastructure.
Intangible assets decreased to $59.1 million at June 30, 2018 from $59.3 million at December 31, 2017 due to normal amortization expense, offset by an increase of $3.7 million related to the acquisition of IMS. The acquisition was also the main reason for the increase in goodwill from $67.4 million on December 31, 2017 to $71.1 million on June 30, 2018.
As the industry continues to evolve, the Company has been vigilant in anticipating and exceeding customer expectations. In 2011, the Company introduced AMA as a hardware and software solution for water and gas utilities, and then in early 2014 launched its new BEACON AMA system, as a managed solution, which it believes will help maintain the Company's position as a market leader. Since its inception, sales of BEACON AMA have continued to grow with large cities and private water utilities selecting BEACON AMA and the Company’s industry-leading water meters.
