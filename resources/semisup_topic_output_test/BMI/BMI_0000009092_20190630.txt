Revenue from products and services transferred to customers at a single point in time accounted for 96.3% and 97.4% of net sales for the six-month periods ended June 30, 2019 and 2018, respectively. The majority of the Company's revenue recognized at a point in time is for the sale of municipal and flow instrumentation products. Revenue from these contracts is recognized when the customer is able to direct the use of and obtain substantially all of the benefits from the product which generally coincides with title transfer during the shipping process. 
In the normal course of business, the Company is named in legal proceedings. There are currently no material legal proceedings pending with respect to the Company. 
In the first quarter of 2019, the Company made a contingent payment of $1.0 million related to the May 1, 2017 acquisition of 100% of the outstanding common stock of D-Flow Technology AB (“D-Flow”). There is an additional $2.0 million of contingent payments related to the D-Flow acquisition that is anticipated to be made in 2019 which is recorded in payables on the Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheet at June 30, 2019. 
On April 2, 2018, the Company acquired 100% of the outstanding stock of Innovative Metering Solutions, Inc. (IMS) of Odessa, Florida, which was one of the Company's distributors serving Florida. Acquisitions are accounted for under the purchase method, and accordingly, the results of operations were included in the Company's financial statements from the date of acquisition. The IMS acquisition did not have a material impact on the Company's consolidated financial statements or the notes thereto. 
Revenue for sales of products and services is derived from contracts with customers. The products and services promised in contracts include the sale of municipal water and flow instrumentation products, such as flow meters and radios, software access and other ancillary services. Contracts generally state the terms of sale, including the description, quantity and price of each product or service. Since the customer typically agrees to a stated rate and price in the contract that does not vary over the life of the contract, the majority of the Company's contracts do not contain variable consideration. The Company establishes a provision for estimated warranty and returns as well as certain after sale costs as discussed in Note 2 "Additional Financial Information Disclosures" in the Unaudited Notes to Consolidated Condensed Financial Statements. 
The Company performs its obligations under a contract by shipping products or performing services in exchange for consideration. The Company typically invoices its customers as soon as control of an asset is transferred and a receivable to the Company is established. The Company, however, recognizes a contract liability when a customer prepays for goods or services and the Company has not transferred control of the goods or services. 
The total purchase consideration was approximately $12.0 million, which included $7.7 million in cash, a $0.3 million working capital adjustment, a balance sheet holdback of $0.7 million and settlement of $3.3 million of pre-existing Company receivables. The working capital adjustment was settled in the second quarter of 2018 and the balance sheet holdback was paid in the second quarter of 2019. The Company's allocation of the purchase price at March 31, 2019 included $3.8 million of receivables, $0.8 million of inventories, $0.1 million of machinery and equipment, $3.6 million of intangibles and $3.7 million of goodwill. The intangible assets acquired are customer relationships with an estimated average useful life of 10 years. The allocation of the purchase price to the assets acquired was based upon the estimated fair values at the date of acquisition. As of March 31, 2019, the Company had completed its analysis for estimating the fair value of the assets acquired with no additional adjustments.  
A performance obligation is a promise in a contract to transfer a distinct good or service to the customer, and is the unit of measurement in Topic 606. At contract inception, the Company assesses the products and services promised in its contracts with customers. The Company then identifies performance obligations to transfer distinct products or services to the customer. In order to identify performance obligations, the Company considers all of the products or services promised in the contract regardless of whether they are explicitly stated or are implied by customary business practices. Total operating earnings for the six months ended June 30, 2019 were $29.4 million, or 14.1% of sales, compared to $26.3 million, or 12.0% of sales, in the comparable prior year period. Gross margin increased $2.5 million and improved as a percent of sales from 35.8% to 38.7%. The gross margin percent increase was largely the result of improved municipal water product mix, the benefit of pricing and lower year-over-year commodity costs, including brass as well as the nonrecurrence of facility relocation charges incurred in the prior year. SEA expenses for the six months ended June 30, 2019 decreased $0.6 million year-over-year, with normal salary and wage inflation more than offset by spending controls.  
Capital expenditures for the first six months of 2019 were $4.5 million compared to $5.2 million in the first six months of 2018. 
The Company’s net sales for the three months ended June 30, 2019 were $103.5 million compared to $113.6 million during the same period in 2018. Sales into the municipal water market were $79.5 million, a decrease of 9.7% from the prior year’s $88.0 million. The sales decline resulted from customer deferral of orders in order to obtain the latest version of advanced technology products including ORION Cellular LTE-M endpoints, where customer pilots and testing continue without issue. In addition, newly developed three and four-inch commercial E-Series® Ultrasonic water meters are now expected to begin shipping later this year. Finally, prior year municipal water sales included a large Middle East order, which did not repeat. The Company did benefit from continued positive sales mix reflecting a higher percentage of meters with radios, ultrasonic meters and SaaS revenue associated with data collection and software analytics. Sales of products into the global flow instrumentation end markets were $24.0 million, 6.6% lower than the prior year’s $25.7 million. The decline was due to the lower volumes across the vast array of industrial end markets served, most notably in North America.  
The Company’s net sales for the six months ended June 30, 2019 were $208.4 million, a decrease of 4.7% from the comparable prior year’s sales of $218.7 million. Sales into the municipal water market were $160.7 million, a decline 4.6% over the prior year’s $168.5 million. Municipal water sales benefitted from modestly higher commercial sales in the U.S., which were more than offset by lower residential volumes in both the US and international markets. Customers deferred orders in order to obtain the latest versions of newer technology radios and meters which are in advanced testing stages. The Company did benefit from continued positive sales mix reflecting a higher percentage of meters with radios, ultrasonic meters and SaaS revenue associated with data collection and software analytics. Sales of products into the global flow instrumentations end markets were $47.7 million, approximately 5.0% lower than the prior year’s $50.2 million. The majority of the decline was due lower general industrial demand across the diverse end markets served, as well as unfavorable foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations year-over-year. 
Cash provided by operations in the first six months of 2019 was $40.9 million compared to $25.2 million in the same period of 2018. The increase is due primarily to higher net earnings and effective working capital management. 
As a result of the above-mentioned items, net earnings for the three months ended June 30, 2019 were $11.4 million, or $0.39 per diluted share, compared to $6.2 million, or $0.21 per diluted share, for the same period in 2018. 
Short-term debt decreased $13.5 million to $4.6 million at June 30, 2019 from $18.1 million at December 31, 2018 due to the strong cash flow from operations, partially offset by the payment of dividends. At the end of the second quarter of 2019, the Company is in a net cash (cash less short-term debt) position of $19.3 million.

Overall, PWC declined $10.6 million compared to the previous calendar year end. Receivables at June 30, 2019 declined $6.0 million due to both lower sales volumes as well as effective collection efforts. Inventories increased modestly at June 30, 2019 with higher backlog, while Payables at June 30, 2019 were $7.1 million higher than year end due to the timing of payments. 
The industries served by the Company’s flow instrumentation products face accelerating demands to contain costs, reduce product variability, and meet ever-changing safety, regulatory and sustainability requirements. To address these challenges, customers must reap more value from every component in their systems. This system-wide scrutiny has heightened the focus on flow instrumentation in industrial process, manufacturing, commercial fluid, building automation and precision engineering applications where flow measurement and control are critical.
