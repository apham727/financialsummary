The amount of revenue recognized in the three- and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2018 that was included in the opening contract liability balance was $0.3 million and $0.9 million, respectively. The difference between the opening and closing balances of the Company's contract liabilities was the result of a timing difference between the Company's performance and the customers' prepayments. The increased receivables balance was due to higher sales at the end of the third quarter of 2018 compared to the fourth quarter of 2017, receivables balances are generally lower at year-end than at other times of the year.
The Company relies on single suppliers for most brass castings, certain resins and electronic subassemblies in several of its product lines. The Company believes these items would be available from other sources, but that the loss of certain suppliers would result in a higher cost of materials, delivery delays, short-term increases in inventory and higher quality control costs in the short term. The Company attempts to mitigate these risks by working closely with key suppliers, purchasing minimal amounts from alternative suppliers and by purchasing business interruption insurance where appropriate.
 Revenue from services transferred to customers over time accounted for 3.1% and 2.8% of sales of net sales for the three- and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2018, respectively.

The Company's performance obligations are satisfied at a point in time or over time as work progresses. Revenue from products and services transferred to customers at a single point in time accounted for 96.9% and 97.2% of net sales for the three- and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2018, respectively. The majority of the Company's revenue recognized at a point in time is for the sale of municipal and flow instrumentation products. Revenue from these contracts is recognized when the customer is able to direct the use of and obtain substantially all of the benefits from the product which generally coincides with title transfer during the shipping process.
The provision for income taxes as a percentage of earnings before income taxes for the third quarter of 2018 was 21.9% compared to 34.5% in the third quarter of 2017. The provision for income taxes as a percentage of earnings before income taxes for the first three quarters of 2018 was 22.2% compared to 34.8% for the first three quarters of 2017. Interim provisions are tied to an estimate of the overall annual rate which can vary due to state taxes and the relationship of foreign and domestic earnings. These items cause variations between periods. The decrease between years was due almost entirely to the lower Federal tax rate which was a result of U.S. tax reform that was enacted in December 2017. For the nine months ended September 30, 2018 and 2017, the Company recognized discrete net tax benefits related to pension plan contributions and termination costs (2018 only) as well as the excess tax benefits from stock-based compensation of $6.0 million and $0.2 million, respectively. 
The Company maintains a non-contributory defined benefit pension plan that covers substantially all U.S. employees who were employed at December 31, 2011. After that date, no further benefits are being accrued in this plan. For the frozen pension plan, benefits are based primarily on years of service and, for certain individuals, levels of compensation. The Company finalized the termination of the pension plan in the third quarter of 2018. In connection with the Company's activities to terminate the plan, lump-sum distributions were made in the second quarter of 2018 to individuals who elected lump sum distributions, including rolling over their accounts or transferring them to a qualified Company plan. In the third quarter of 2018, purchases of annuity contracts were made to settle obligations for the remaining participants. As a result, the Company recorded pre-tax settlement charges of $8.2 million and $11.7 million during the second and third quarters of 2018, respectively.
The Company also has contracts that include both the sale and installation of flow meters as performance obligations. In those cases, the Company records revenue for installed flow meters at the point in time when the flow meters have been accepted by the customer. The customer cannot control the use of and obtain substantially all of the benefits from the equipment until the customer has accepted the installed product. Therefore, for both the flow meter and the related installation, the Company has concluded that control is transferred to the customer upon customer acceptance of the installed flow meter. In addition, the Company has a variety of ancillary revenue streams which are minor. The types and composition of the Company's revenue streams did not materially change during the three- and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2018.Flow instrumentation products represented 23% of sales for the nine months ended September 30, 2018 compared to 24% for the first nine months of 2017. These sales increased $1.5 million, or 2%, to $74.3 million for the first nine months in 2018 compared to $72.8 million in the same period last year due to higher sales into the oil and gas market as well as other targeted markets.

Municipal water sales represented 77% of sales for the first nine months of 2018 compared to 76% for the first nine months of 2017. These sales increased $22.0 million, or 9%, to $255.0 million in the first nine months of 2018 from $233.0 million in 2017 and were driven by pricing actions, increased domestic volumes of newer meter technologies and related radios as well as higher service revenue.
The Company’s net sales for the three months ended September 30, 2018 increased $10.6 million, or 11%, to $110.6 million compared to $100.0 million during the same period in 2017.

These sales increased $11.8 million, or 16%, to $86.5 million in the third quarter of 2018 from $74.7 million in the third quarter of 2017.

 The Company’s net sales for the nine months ended September 30, 2018 increased $23.5 million, or 8%, to $329.3 million compared to $305.8 million during the same period in 2017.
Critical to the water metering ecosystem is information and analytics. The Company’s BEACON AMA Managed Solution is the latest in metering technology. BEACON AMA combines the BEACON analytical software suite with proven ORION technologies using two-way fixed and cellular networks in a managed solution, improving utilities’ visibility of their water consumption and eliminating the need for costly utility-managed infrastructure.
As the industry continues to evolve, the Company has been vigilant in anticipating and exceeding customer expectations. In 2011, the Company introduced AMA as a hardware and software solution for water and gas utilities, and then in early 2014 launched its new BEACON AMA system, as a managed solution, which it believes will help maintain the Company's position as a market leader. Since its inception, sales of BEACON AMA have continued to grow with large cities and private water utilities selecting BEACON AMA and the Company’s industry-leading water meters.
