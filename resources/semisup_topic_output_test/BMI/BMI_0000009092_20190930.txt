Revenue from services transferred to customers over time accounted for 3.6% and 3.1% of net sales for the three-month periods ended September 30, 2019 and 2018, respectively. Revenue from services transferred to customers over time accounted for 3.6% and 2.8% of net sales for the nine-month periods ended September 30, 2019 and 2018, respectively. The majority of the Company's revenue that is recognized over time relates to the BEACON® AMA software as a service, but also includes training, installation and other revenues. 
The Company's performance obligations are satisfied at a point in time or over time as work progresses. Revenue from products and services transferred to customers at a single point in time accounted for 96.4% and 96.9% of net sales for the three-month periods ended September 30, 2019 and 2018, respectively. Revenue from products and services transferred to customers at a single point in time accounted for 96.4% and 97.2% of net sales for the nine-month periods ended September 30, 2019 and 2018, respectively. The majority of the Company's revenue recognized at a point in time is for the sale of municipal and flow instrumentation products. Revenue from these contracts is recognized when the customer is able to direct the use of and obtain substantially all of the benefits from the product which generally coincides with title transfer during the shipping process. 
In the normal course of business, the Company is named in legal proceedings. There are currently no material legal proceedings pending with respect to the Company. 
In the first quarter of 2019, the Company made a contingent payment of $1.0 million related to the May 1, 2017 acquisition of 100% of the outstanding common stock of D-Flow Technology AB (“D-Flow”). There is an additional $2.0 million of contingent payments related to the D-Flow acquisition that is anticipated to be made in the next twelve months which is recorded in payables on the Company’s Consolidated Condensed Balance Sheet at September 30, 2019. 
On April 2, 2018, the Company acquired 100% of the outstanding stock of Innovative Metering Solutions, Inc. (IMS) of Odessa, Florida, which was one of the Company's distributors serving Florida. Acquisitions are accounted for under the purchase method, and accordingly, the results of operations were included in the Company's financial statements from the date of acquisition. The IMS acquisition did not have a material impact on the Company's consolidated financial statements or the notes thereto. 
Contract liabilities are included in payables and other long-term liabilities on the Company’s consolidated condensed balance sheet. The balance of contract assets was immaterial as the Company did not have a significant amount of uninvoiced receivables in the three and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2019 and twelve-month period ended December 31, 2018.  
The Company performs its obligations under a contract by shipping products or performing services in exchange for consideration. The Company typically invoices its customers as soon as control of an asset is transferred and a receivable to the Company is established. The Company, however, recognizes a contract liability when a customer prepays for goods or services and the Company has not transferred control of the goods or services. 
The total purchase consideration was approximately $12.0 million, which included $7.7 million in cash, a $0.3 million working capital adjustment, a balance sheet holdback of $0.7 million and settlement of $3.3 million of pre-existing Company receivables. The working capital adjustment was settled in the second quarter of 2018 and the balance sheet holdback was paid in the second quarter of 2019. The Company's allocation of the purchase price at March 31, 2019 included $3.8 million of receivables, $0.8 million of inventories, $0.1 million of machinery and equipment, $3.6 million of intangibles and $3.7 million of goodwill. The intangible assets acquired are customer relationships with an estimated average useful life of 10 years. The allocation of the purchase price to the assets acquired was based upon the estimated fair values at the date of acquisition. As of March 31, 2019, the Company had completed its analysis for estimating the fair value of the assets acquired with no additional adjustments.  The Company’s net sales for the three months ended September 30, 2019 were $108.6 million compared to $110.6 million during the same period in 2018. Sales into the municipal water market were $84.3 million, a decrease of 2.6% from the prior year’s $86.5 million. The sales decline resulted from a prior year municipal water order in the Middle East which did not repeat. In the domestic municipal water market (United States, Latin America and Canada), sales grew 1.9% attributable to higher sales of advanced technology products including ORION Cellular LTE-M endpoints and newly launched three and four-inch commercial E-Series® Ultrasonic water meters. SaaS revenue associated with data collection and software analytics also increased. Sales of products into the global flow instrumentation end markets were $24.3 million, 1.0% higher than the prior year’s $24.1 million.  
Capital expenditures for the first nine months of 2019 were $5.6 million compared to $7.2 million in the first nine months of 2018. 
The Company’s net sales for the nine months ended September 30, 2019 were $317.1 million, a decrease of 3.7% from the comparable prior year’s sales of $329.3 million. Sales into the municipal water market were $245.1 million, a decline 3.9% from the prior year’s $255.0 million. Residential volumes in both the US and international markets declined, while commercial sales were essentially flat. Overall, customers deferred orders in order to obtain the latest versions of newer technology radios and meters which are in advanced testing stages in the first half of 2019. The Company did benefit from continued positive sales mix reflecting a higher percentage of meters with radios, ultrasonic meters and SaaS revenue associated with data collection and software analytics. Sales of products into the global flow instrumentations end markets were $72.0 million, approximately 3.1% lower than the prior year’s $74.3 million. The majority of the decline was due lower general industrial demand across the diverse end markets served, as well as unfavorable foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations year-over-year. 
Cash provided by operations in the first nine months of 2019 was $61.1 million compared to $39.9 million in the same period of 2018. The increase is due primarily to effective working capital management. 
Overall, PWC declined $10.8 million compared to the previous calendar year end. Receivables at September 30, 2019 declined $4.9 million due to both lower sales volumes as well as improved collection efforts. Inventories increased modestly at September 30, 2019 with higher backlog, while Payables at September 30, 2019 were $9.9 million higher than year-end due to the timing of payments and focused payment terms extensions.

Short-term debt decreased $13.5 million to $4.4 million at September 30, 2019 from $18.1 million at December 31, 2018 due to the strong cash flow from operations, partially offset by the payment of dividends. At the end of the third quarter of 2019, the Company is in a net cash (cash less short-term debt) position of $33.4 million. 
As a result of the above-mentioned items, net earnings for the three months ended September 30, 2019 were $12.7 million, or $0.44 per diluted share, compared to $2.9 million, or $0.10 per diluted share, for the same period in 2018.
