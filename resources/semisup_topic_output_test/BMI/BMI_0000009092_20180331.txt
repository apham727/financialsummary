The Company relies on single suppliers for most brass castings and certain resin and electronic subassemblies in several of its product lines. The Company believes these items would be available from other sources, but that the loss of certain suppliers would result in a higher cost of materials, delivery delays, short-term increases in inventory and higher quality control costs in the short term. The Company attempts to mitigate these risks by working closely with key suppliers, purchasing minimal amounts from alternative suppliers and by purchasing business interruption insurance where appropriate.
The amount of revenue recognized in the period that was included in the opening contract liability balance was $0.3 million. The difference between the opening and closing balances of the Company's contract liabilities was the result of a timing difference between the Company's performance and the customers' prepayments. The increased receivables balance was due to higher sales in the first quarter of 2018 compared to the fourth quarter of 2017. Generally, receivables balances are lower at year-end than at other times of the year.
The Company's performance obligations are satisfied at a point in time or over time as work progresses. Revenue from products and services transferred to customers at a single point in time accounted for 97.4% of net sales for the three-month period ended March 31, 2018. The majority of the Company's revenue recognized at a point in time is for the sale of municipal and flow instrumentation products. Revenue from these contracts is recognized when the customer is able to direct the use of and obtain substantially all of the benefits from the product which generally coincides with title transfer during the shipping process.
In the normal course of business, the Company is named in legal proceedings. There are currently no material legal proceedings pending with respect to the Company. 
In the opinion of management, the accompanying unaudited consolidated condensed financial statements of Badger Meter, Inc. (the “Company” or “Badger Meter”) contain all adjustments (consisting only of normal recurring accruals except as otherwise discussed) necessary to present fairly the Company’s consolidated condensed financial position at March 31, 2018, results of operations for the three-month periods ended March 31, 2018 and 2017, comprehensive income for the three-month periods ended March 31, 2018 and 2017, and cash flows for the three-month periods ended March 31, 2018 and 2017. The results of operations for any interim period are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for the full year.
The provision for income taxes as a percentage of earnings before income taxes for the first quarter of 2018 was 22.2% compared to 34.2% in the first quarter of 2017.  Interim provisions are tied to an estimate of the overall annual rate which can vary due to state taxes and the relationship of foreign and domestic earnings. These items cause variations between periods. The decrease between years was due almost entirely to the lower Federal tax rate, which declined from 35% in 2017 to 21% in 2018 as a result of U.S. tax reform that was enacted in December 2017. For the three months ended March 31, 2018 and 2017, the Company recognized a discrete tax benefit related to the excess tax benefits from stock-based compensation of $0.3 million and $0.2 million, respectively. 
The Company also has contracts that include both the sale and installation of flow meters as performance obligations. In those cases, the Company records revenue for installed flow meters at the point in time when the flow meters have been accepted by the customer. The customer cannot control the use of and obtain substantially all of the benefits from the equipment until the customer has accepted the installed product. Therefore, for both the flow meter and the related installation, the Company has concluded that control is transferred to the customer upon customer acceptance of the installed flow meters. In addition, the Company has a variety of ancillary revenue streams which are minor. The types and composition of the Company's revenue streams did not materially change during the three-month period ended March 31, 2018 from year end 2017.
On April 2, 2018, the Company acquired 100% of the outstanding stock of Innovative Metering Solutions, Inc. ("IMS") of Odessa, Florida, which was one of the Company's distributors serving Florida. The purchase consideration was approximately $8.5 million. The IMS acquisition will be accounted for under the purchase method, and accordingly, the results of operations will be included in the Company's financial statements from the date of acquisition. The acquisition will not have a material impact on the Company's consolidated financial statements or the notes thereto.
Certain customers may receive cash-based incentives or credits, which are accounted for as variable consideration. Variable consideration in contracts for the three months ended March 31, 2018 was insignificant.
Revenue for sales of products and services is derived from contracts with customers. The products and services promised in contracts include the sale of municipal and flow instrumentation products, such as flow meters and radios, software access and other ancillary services. Contracts with each customer generally state the terms of the sale, including the description, quantity and price of each product or service. Payment terms are stated in the contract. Since the customer typically agrees to a stated rate and price in the contract that does not vary over the life of the contract, the majority of the Company's contracts do not contain variable consideration. The Company establishes a provision for estimated warranty and returns as well as certain after sale costs as discussed in Note 2 "Additional Financial Information Disclosures."  Flow instrumentation products represented 23.3% of sales for the three months ended March 31, 2018 compared to 22.7% during the same period in 2017. These sales increased $1.4 million, or 6.1%, to $24.5 million from $23.1 million in the same 
period last year. The increase was due to the continuing rebound in the oil and gas market and broadening distribution channels in industrial markets served. 
The Company’s net sales for the three months ended March 31, 2018 increased $3.4 million, or 3.3%, to $105.0 million compared to $101.6 million during the same period in 2017.
Selling, engineering and administration expenses for the three months ended March 31, 2018 increased $1.7 million, or 6.8%, to $26.8 from $25.1 million in the first quarter of 2017. The main reasons for the increase were additional staff associated with the 2017 acquisitions, which occurred after the first quarter of that year, and normal inflationary increases.
The main sources of liquidity for the Company are cash from operations and borrowing capacity. Cash provided by operations was $6.8 million for the first three months of 2018 compared to $12.4 million through the first three months of 2017. Last year’s amount was favorably impacted by a decrease in inventory balances which did not recur this year. These, along with lower net income, were the primary reasons for the decrease in cash provided from operations.
Net property, plant and equipment at March 31, 2018 decreased slightly from $93.6 million at December 31, 2017 to $93.5 million at March 31, 2018. This was the net effect of depreciation expense, offset somewhat by $3.0 million of capital expenditures in the first three months of 2018.
Critical to the water metering ecosystem is information and analytics. The Company’s BEACON AMA Managed Solution is the latest in metering technology. BEACON AMA combines the BEACON analytical software suite with proven ORION technologies using two-way fixed and cellular networks in a managed solution, improving utilities’ visibility of their water consumption and eliminating the need for costly utility-managed infrastructure.
As the industry continues to evolve, the Company has been vigilant in anticipating and exceeding customer expectations. In 2011, the Company introduced AMA as a hardware and software solution for water and gas utilities, and then in early 2014 launched its new BEACON AMA system, as a managed solution, which it believes will help maintain the Company's position as a market leader. Since its inception, sales of BEACON AMA have continued to grow with large cities and private water utilities selecting BEACON AMA and the Company’s industry-leading water meters.
As a result of the above-mentioned items, net earnings for the three months ended March 31, 2018 were $7.5 million, or $0.26 per diluted share, compared to $8.7 million, or $0.30 per diluted share, for the same period in 2017.
