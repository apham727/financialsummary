point in time is for the sale of municipal and flow instrumentation products. Revenue from these contracts is recognized when the customer is able to direct the use of and obtain substantially all of the benefits from the product which generally coincides with title transfer during the shipping process. 
On April 2, 2018, the Company acquired 100% of the outstanding stock of Innovative Metering Solutions, Inc. ("IMS") of Odessa, Florida, which was one of the Company's distributors serving Florida.

The Company performs its obligations under a contract by shipping products or performing services in exchange for consideration. The Company typically invoices its customers as soon as control of an asset is transferred and a receivable to the Company is established. The Company, however, recognizes a contract liability when a customer prepays for goods or services and the Company has not transferred control of the goods or services. 
A performance obligation is a promise in a contract to transfer a distinct good or service to the customer, and is the unit of measurement in Topic 606. At contract inception, the Company assesses the products and services promised in its contracts with customers. The Company then identifies performance obligations to transfer distinct products or services to the customer. In order to identify performance obligations, the Company considers all of the products or services promised in the contract regardless of whether they are explicitly stated or are implied by customary business practices. 
The Company disclosed in its financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2018 that it estimated it would pay $0.4 million in other postretirement benefits in 2019 based on actuarial estimates. As of March 31, 2019, $52,000 of such benefits have been paid. The Company continues to believe that its estimated payments for the full year are reasonable. However, such estimates contain inherent uncertainties because cash payments can vary significantly depending on the timing of postretirement medical claims and the collection of the retirees’ portion of certain costs. The amount of benefits paid in calendar year 2019 will not impact the expense for postretirement benefits for 2019. 
The total purchase consideration was approximately $12.0 million, which included $7.7 million in cash, a $0.3 million working capital adjustment, a balance sheet holdback of $0.7 million and settlement of $3.3 million of pre-existing Company receivables. The working capital adjustment was settled in the second quarter of 2018 and the balance sheet holdback is recorded in payables on the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheet as it is anticipated to be paid in the next twelve months. The Company's allocation of the purchase price at March 31, 2019 included $3.8 million of receivables, $0.8 million of inventories, $0.1 million of machinery and equipment, $3.6 million of intangibles and $3.7 million of goodwill. The intangible assets acquired are customer relationships with an estimated average useful life of 10 years. The allocation of the purchase price to the assets acquired was based upon the estimated fair values at the date of acquisition. As of March 31, 2019, the Company had completed its analysis for estimating the fair value of the assets acquired with no additional adjustments.  Capital expenditures for the first three months of 2019 were $2.2 million compared to $3.0 million in the first three months of 2018. 
Overall, PWC declined $2.0 million compared to the prior quarter on flat sales activity. Receivables at March 31, 2019 were $68.1 million compared to $66.3 million at the end of 2018. The increase was due to a modest increase in days sales outstanding associated with international receivables due to their regionally higher payment terms. Inventories at March 31, 2019 were $80.6 million, in line with the $80.8 million at December 31, 2018. Payables at March 31, 2019 were $26.0 million, up from $22.5 million at the end of 2018 due to the timing of payments.

The industries served by the Company’s flow instrumentation products face accelerating demands to contain costs, reduce product variability, and meet ever-changing safety, regulatory and sustainability requirements. To address these challenges, customers must reap more value from every component in their systems. This system-wide scrutiny has heightened the focus on flow instrumentation in industrial process, manufacturing, commercial fluid, building automation and precision engineering applications where flow measurement and control are critical. 
Critical to the water metering ecosystem is information and analytics. The Company’s BEACON Advanced Metering Analytics (AMA) software suite improves the utilities’ visibility of their water and water usage. BEACON AMA is a secure, cloud-hosted software suite that includes a customizable dashboard, and has the ability to establish alerts for specific conditions. It also allows for consumer engagement tools that permit end water users (such as homeowners) to view and manage their water usage activity. Benefits to the utility include improved customer service, increased visibility through faster leak detection, the ability to promote and quantify the effects of its water conservation efforts, and easier compliance reporting. 
The Company’s net sales and corresponding net earnings depend on unit volume and product mix, with the Company generally earning higher average selling prices and margins on meters equipped with radio technology, and higher margins on ultrasonic compared to mechanical meters. The Company’s proprietary radio products (i.e. ORION) generally result in higher margins than the remarketed, non-proprietary technology products. The Company also sells registers and endpoints separately to customers who wish to upgrade their existing meters in the field.
