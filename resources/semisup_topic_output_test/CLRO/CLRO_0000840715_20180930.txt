Net loss incurred on valuation of inventory at lower of cost or market value and write-off of obsolete inventory during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2018 was $45 and $471, respectively. During the three months and nine months ended September 30, 2017 there was no net loss incurred on valuation of inventory at lower of cost or market value and write-off of obsolete inventory. 
Prior to our change in accounting policy, revenue from product sales to distributors was not recognized until the return privilege had expired or until it can be determined with reasonable certainty that the return privilege had expired, which approximated when the product was sold-through to customers of our distributors (dealers, system integrators, value-added resellers, and end-users), rather than when the product was initially shipped to a distributor. At each quarter-end, we evaluated the inventory in the distribution channel through information provided by our distributors. The level of inventory in the channel fluctuated up or down each quarter based upon our distributors’ individual operations. Accordingly, each quarter-end deferral of revenue and associated cost of goods sold were calculated and recorded based upon the actual channel inventory reported at quarter-end. Further, with respect to distributors and other channel partners not reporting the channel inventory, the revenue and associated cost of goods sold were deferred until we received payment for the product sales made to such distributors or channel partners.

On March 1, 2017, the Board of Directors of the Company renewed and extended the repurchase program for up to an additional $10,000 of common stock over the next twelve months. In connection with the repurchase extension authorization, the Company was authorized to complete the repurchase through open market transactions or through an accelerated share repurchase program, in each case to be executed at management’s discretion based on business and market conditions, stock price, trading restrictions, acquisition activity and other factors. The transactions effectuated to date occurred in open market purchases. 
Sales agreements with customers are renewable periodically and contain terms and conditions with respect to payment, delivery, warranty and supply, but typically do not require mandatory purchase commitments. In the absence of a sales agreement, the Company’s standard terms and conditions at the time of acceptance of purchase orders apply. The Company considers the customer purchase orders, governed by sales agreements or the Company’s standard terms and conditions, to be the contract with the customer. The Company evaluates certain factors including the customer’s ability to pay (or credit risk). Overall revenue declined in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2018 when compared to the three months and nine months ended September 30, 2017, with declines seen in all product categories. Our gross profit margin decreased to 45% during the three months ended September 30, 2018 from 62% for the three months ended September 30, 2017. Gross profit margin decreased primarily due to an increase in inventory obsolescence costs, a decline in licensing revenues and reduced overhead absorption into inventory as we continue to reduce our net spend on inventory. Our gross profit margin decreased to 49% during the nine months ended September 30, 2018 from 59% for the nine months ended September 30, 2017. Gross profit margin decrease was primarily due to an increase in inventory obsolescence costs, a decline in licensing revenues, and reduced overhead absorption into inventory. The proportion of overhead costs absorbed into inventory has declined due to a sharp decline in our inventory purchasing activity causing increased amounts of overhead costs to be expensed.

Our strength in the professional audio visual space is largely due to our industry leading conferencing technologies and the full suite of professional microphone products, especially Beamforming Microphone Arrays. Despite our strong leadership position in the professional audio communications products market, we face challenges to revenue growth due to the infringement of our patents by competitors, the limited size of the market and pricing pressures from new competitors attracted to the commercial market. 
Our revenue decreased by $3.9 million, or 37%, to $6.7 million in 2018-Q3 compared to $10.6 million in 2017-Q3. All product categories witnessed revenue declines with revenue declines of 31%, 28% and 55% for professional audio conferencing, unified communication end points and video products, respectively. The decline in revenue from professional audio conferencing products was mostly due to slower adoption of our Converge Pro 2 platform, largely caused by our competitors’ product offering that we believe directly infringes our strategic patents and due to a decline in licensing revenue. The share of professional audio communications products (which includes microphone products but not premium products) in our product mix increased from 66% in 2017-Q3 to 72% in 2018-Q3. Share of video products in the revenue during 2018-Q3 decreased from 24% in 2017-Q3 to 17% in 2018-Q3. Share of UC end points in the revenue increased from 10% in 2017-Q3 to 12% in 2018-Q3. During 2018-Q3, revenue declined across all regions except Canada and parts of Europe. The revenue declines for Asia Pacific including Middle East, Europe and Africa, and Americas were 53%, 13% and 30%, respectively. 
We derive most of our revenue from professional audio conferencing products by promoting our products in the professional audio-visual channel. We have extended our total addressable market from installed audio conferencing market to adjacent complementary markets – microphones, video collaboration and networked audio and video streaming. We have achieved this through strategic technological acquisitions as well as by internal product development. 
During the nine months ended September 30, 2018, seven more patents related to video synchronization, speech technology, integrated microphone array and ceiling or wall tile, echo cancellation with beamforming microphone array, audio distribution over local area networks, and USB to Bluetooth audio bridging were issued to us. During the nine months ended September 30, 2018, we continued our serious litigation efforts to stop infringement of two of our strategic patents. We introduced a new ceiling microphone array product line and made improvements to our VIEW Pro and Converge Pro 2 product lines. We also launched many new products including Collaborate Space, Converge Amplifier and wireless microphone systems in 537-563 MHz range at our industry’s largest trade show in North America. We have also been focusing on company-wide cost cutting programs and speeding up product development that we believe will enable us to surpass our competitors. 
The audio-visual products market is characterized by intense competition and rapidly evolving technology. Our competitors vary within each product category. The adoption of Beamforming Microphone Array 2, along with our Converge Pro 2, our new platform for professional audio conferencing, remains challenged in large part because of our competitors’ product offering that directly infringes our strategic patents. The patent infringement also has had a material adverse effect on revenue from ClearOne’s other products like wireless microphones, ceiling microphones and video products. To address the material weakness, management is working with our third party internal controls consultant to assist with the implementation of a remediation plan which will supplement the existing controls. The remediation plan will include an assessment of personnel levels and responsibilities, additional training of financial reporting personnel and ability to handle new requirements and projects on a timely basis with respect to the preparation of the consolidated financial statements and public company reporting requirements and timelines. The material weakness will be fully remediated when, in the opinion of management, the control processes have been operating for a sufficient period of time to provide reasonable assurance as to their effectiveness. The remediation and ultimate resolution of the material weakness will be reviewed with the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors. There have been no material developments in the legal proceedings described in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2017.
