Business Solutions segment revenue increased $6.0 million to $55.2 million. The increase was mainly related to higher hardware and software sales coupled with revenue from new services provided to Popular and the Government of Puerto Rico. Adjusted EBITDA increased $1.1 million to $24.3 million when compared with the prior year as a result of the higher revenues, partially offset by higher cost of sales and operating expenses.
Depreciation and amortization expense amounted to $33.5 million, an increase of $1.9 million when compared with the prior year. The increase is due to the same reasons explained above for the quarter.
Selling, general and administrative expenses in the six months ended June 30, 2019 decreased by $1.1 million or 3% to $30.2 million when compared with the same period in 2018. The decrease is mainly driven by lower professional services as explained above for the quarter.
Merchant acquiring revenues increased $3.4 million to $52.8 million when compared with the prior year period, driven by the same reasons above explained for the quarter coupled with electronic benefit disaster relief recovery funding that ended in March 2019. Increases in transactional fees contributed to higher net spreads versus the same period in the previous year, while higher non-transactional fees also helped to drive the year-over-year revenue increase. Adjusted EBITDA increased $0.7 million reflecting the increased revenues, partially offset by higher transaction processing charges and a lower average ticket.
Net cash provided by operating activities for the six months ended June 30, 2019 was $76.0 million compared with cash provided by operating activities of $76.9 million for the corresponding 2018 period. The $0.9 million decrease in cash provided by operating activities is primarily driven by more cash used to pay down accounts payable, accrued liabilities, and income taxes, partially offset by higher net income. 
Non-operating expenses increased by $1.0 million to $14.9 million when compared with the prior year period. The increase is almost entirely related to a decrease in Other income, net of $1.6 million due to an increase in foreign exchange losses.
Non-operating expenses increased by $0.7 million to $8.1 million when compared with the prior year period. The increase is mainly related to a $1.0 million decrease in Other income, net due to higher foreign exchange losses relative to the same quarter in 2018.
Selling, general and administrative expenses in the second quarter of 2019 decreased by $2.8 million or 16% when compared with the same quarter in 2018. The decrease is primarily related to lower professional fees as the prior year included fees in connection with due diligence for a potential transaction that the Company decided not to pursue.
Total revenues for the six months ended June 30, 2019 amounted to $241.4 million, an increase of $17.8 million or 8%. Revenue increase in the first half of 2019 reflected growth from elevated sales volumes in Puerto Rico, higher core banking transactions and an increase in fees generated by network services related to new managed services projects. Additionally, revenue growth was impacted by one-time revenue related to an electronic benefits contract of approximately $2.7 million and revenue from hardware sales and the completion of several projects of approximately $2.5 million. 
Total revenues in the second quarter of 2019 increased by $9.2 million or 8% to $122.5 million when compared with the prior year period. Revenue increase in the quarter was primarily driven by increased volumes from ATH debit network and benefits from value added solutions coupled with other pricing actions. In addition, there was an increase in core banking transactions and an increase in network services related to new managed services projects. The quarter also benefited from revenue of approximately $2.5 million from completed special projects and hardware sales. 
Cost of revenues amounted to $52.6 million, an increase of $3.5 million or 7% when compared with the prior year period. The increase is primarily related to cost of sales associated with the increased hardware sales, coupled with higher professional fees and increased provisions. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in salaries and compensation mainly driven by deferred salaries in connection with software developments. 
4)Represents operating depreciation and amortization expense, which excludes amounts generated as a result of merger and acquisition activity. 
Our payment businesses generally experience moderate increased activity during the traditional holiday shopping periods and around other nationally recognized holidays, which follow consumer spending patterns.We issued floating-rate debt which is subject to fluctuations in interest rates. Our secured credit facilities accrue interest at variable rates and only the 2024 Term B is subject to a floor or a minimum rate. A 100 basis point increase in interest rates over our floor(s) on our debt balances outstanding as of June 30, 2019, under the secured credit facilities, would increase our annual interest expense by approximately $3.4 million. The impact on future interest expense as a result of future changes in interest rates will depend largely on the gross amount of our borrowings at that time.Item 5. Other InformationItem 1.
