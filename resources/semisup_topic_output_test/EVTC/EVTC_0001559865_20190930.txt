Business Solutions segment revenue increased $4.1 million to $52.9 million. Revenue growth in the segment was driven by new services for both Popular and the Government of Puerto Rico and other projects completed in the quarter representing revenue of $2.0 million. Adjusted EBITDA increased $3.3 million to $25.1 million when compared with the prior year as a result of the higher revenues partially offset by an increase in operating expenses.
Depreciation and amortization expense amounted to $50.4 million, an increase of $3.1 million when compared with the prior year. The increase is due to the same reasons explained above for the quarter.
Non-operating expenses increased by $1.3 million to $21.2 million when compared with the prior year period. The increase is driven by a decrease in Other income (expenses) of $2.5 million due to an increase in foreign exchange losses, partially offset by a decrease in interest expense as a result of improved rates from the debt refinancing completed in the fourth quarter of the prior year.
Merchant acquiring revenues increased $5.4 million to $79.2 million when compared with the prior year period, driven by the same reasons above explained for the quarter coupled with electronic benefit disaster relief recovery funding that ended in March 2019. Increases in transactional fees contributed to higher net spreads versus the same period in the previous year. Adjusted EBITDA increased $1.0 million reflecting the increased revenues, partially offset by higher transaction processing charges and a lower average ticket.
Non-operating expenses increased by $0.3 million to $6.3 million when compared with the prior year period. The increase is mainly related to a $0.9 million decrease in Other income (expenses) due to higher foreign exchange losses relative to the same quarter in 2018.
Total revenues in the third quarter of 2019 increased by $6.8 million or 6% to $118.8 million when compared with the prior year period. Revenue increase in the quarter reflected growth across all segments and included benefits from value added solutions, new managed services and other pricing actions. Additionally, increased revenue was driven by the completion of projects for approximately $2.0 million.
Selling, general and administrative expenses in the nine months ended September 30, 2019 decreased by $0.3 million or 1% to $45.4 million when compared with the same period in 2018. The decrease is mainly driven by lower professional services as the prior year included fees in connection with due diligence for a potential transaction that the Company decided not to pursue, almost entirely offset by an increase in salaries and compensation.
Income tax expense amounted to $10.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2019, a decrease of $0.3 million when compared with the prior year period. The effective tax rate for the period was 11.3% compared with 13.5% in the prior year. The decrease in the effective tax rate is a result of a decrease in Puerto Rico taxes for the same reasons explained above for the quarter coupled with a discrete item in LATAM, partially offset by an increase in foreign taxes for intercompany transactions.

Our payment businesses generally experience moderate increased activity during the traditional holiday shopping periods and around other nationally recognized holidays, which follow consumer spending patterns.
Total revenues for the nine months ended September 30, 2019 amounted to $360.2 million, an increase of $24.6 million or 7%. Revenue benefited from the impact of a higher net spread driven by pricing actions, elevated sales volumes in Puerto Rico, higher core banking transactions and an increase in fees generated by network services related to new managed services projects. Additionally, revenue growth was impacted by one-time revenue related to an electronic benefits contract of approximately $2.7 million and revenue from hardware sales and the completion of several projects of approximately $4.5 million. 
Income tax expense amounted to $3.7 million, an increase of $0.4 million when compared with the prior year quarterly period. The effective tax rate for the quarter was 13.0%, compared with 12.5% in the 2018 period. The increase in effective tax rate is primarily driven by an increase in foreign taxes in connection with the increased intercompany transactions. This increase was partially offset by a decrease in Puerto Rico taxes due to a shift in fully taxable operations to partially taxable operations and a tax benefit recorded during the period related to a decrease in effective tax rate for certain activities.
Selling, general and administrative expenses in the third quarter of 2019 increased by $0.7 million or 5% when compared with the same quarter in 2018. The increase is primarily related to an increase in salaries and compensation as the prior year includes a significant reversal in share-based compensation expense in connection with a former executive's forfeiture for unvested RSUs, partially offset by lower professional fees and other operating expenses.Item 3.
