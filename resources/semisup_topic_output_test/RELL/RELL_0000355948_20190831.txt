Our fiscal quarter ends on the Saturday nearest the end of the quarter-ending month. The first three months of fiscal 2020 and fiscal 2019 both contained 13 weeks. 
We recorded an income tax provision of $0.2 million and $0.3 million for the first three months of fiscal 2020 and the first three months of fiscal 2019, respectively. The effective income tax rate during the first three months of fiscal 2020 was a tax provision of 53.0% as compared to a tax provision of 38.6% during the first three months of fiscal 2019. The difference in rate during the first three months of fiscal 2020 as compared to the first three months of fiscal 2019 reflects changes in our geographical distribution of income (loss). The 53.0% effective income tax rate differs from the federal statutory rate of 21% as a result of our geographical distribution of income (loss) and the movement of the valuation allowance against our U.S. state and federal net deferred tax assets.
