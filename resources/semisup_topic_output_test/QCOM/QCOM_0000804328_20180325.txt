other technology, including 3G (third generation) and 4G (fourth generation) technology, were recorded in both the QCT and QTL segments.
Reclassifications from accumulated other comprehensive income related to available-for-sale securities were negligible in both the three and six months ended March 25, 2018 and $35 million and $48 million in the three and six months ended March 26, 2017, respectively, and were recorded in investment and other income, net (Note 2). 
The Company evaluates the performance of its segments based on earnings (loss) before income taxes (EBT). In fiscal 2018, all of the costs related to pre-commercial research and development of 5G (fifth generation) technology, of which $115 million and $216 million was recorded in the three and six months ended March 25, 2018, respectively, are included in unallocated corporate research and development expenses, whereas similar costs related to the research and development of 
The Company believes Compal’s, Foxconn’s, Pegatron’s and Wistron’s claims in the above matter are without merit.
The Company believes Apple’s claims in the above matters are without merit.
Other expenses in the three months ended March 26, 2017 consisted of $53 million in foreign currency losses related to the fine imposed by the Korea Fair Trade Commission (KFTC), which was accrued in the first quarter of fiscal 2017, and $25 million in restructuring and restructuring-related charges related to the Company’s Strategic Realignment Plan. Other 
expenses in the six months ended March 26, 2017 consisted of a $921 million charge related to the KFTC fine, including related foreign currency losses, and $33 million in restructuring and restructuring-related charges related to the Company’s Strategic Realignment Plan.
The Company believes Apple’s counterclaims and invalidation requests in the above matters are without merit.The increases in equipment and services revenues in the second quarter and first six months of fiscal 2018 were primarily due to increases in QCT and QSI revenues. The decreases in licensing revenues in the second quarter and first six months of fiscal 2018 were primarily due to decreases in QTL revenues, partially offset by the reduction to licensing revenues of $974 million recorded in the second quarter of fiscal 2017 related to the BlackBerry arbitration decision.
QCT EBT as a percentage of revenues in the second quarter and first six months of fiscal 2018 increased primarily due to increases in gross margin percentage and the favorable impact of higher revenues relative to operating expenses. The increases in QCT gross margin percentage were primarily due to lower average unit costs and favorable product mix, partially offset by lower average selling prices.
Selling, general and administrative expenses included $145 million and $250 million in the second quarter and first six months of fiscal 2018, respectively, related to litigation costs, an increase of $102 million and $171 million, respectively. The remaining dollar increases in selling, general and administrative expenses in the second quarter and first six months of fiscal 2018 were primarily attributable to increases of $77 million in each period in other professional fees and $63 million and $65 million, respectively, in costs related to other legal matters, all of which were primarily driven by Broadcom’s withdrawn takeover proposal, and $14 million and $38 million, respectively, in employee-related expenses, which included our RF360 Holdings joint venture. The dollar increase in selling, general and administrative expenses in the first six months of fiscal 2018 was also attributable to increases of $45 million in bad debt expenses and $35 million in marketing expenses. 
The dollar increases in research and development expenses in the second quarter and first six months of fiscal 2018 were primarily attributable to increases of $19 million and $160 million, respectively, in costs related to the development of integrated circuit technologies, including 5G technology and radio frequency front-end (RFFE) technologies from our RF360 Holdings joint venture, which was formed in the second quarter of fiscal 2017. The increase in research and development expenses in the first six months of fiscal 2018 was partially offset by a $30 million impairment charge on certain intangible assets recorded in the first quarter of fiscal 2017.
QTL EBT as a percentage of revenues in the second quarter and first six months of fiscal 2018 decreased primarily due decreases in QTL revenues and increases in selling, general and administrative expenses resulting from higher litigation costs. QTL revenues and EBT also continued to be impacted negatively by units that we believe are not being reported by 
QTL Segment. QTL results in the second quarter and first six months of fiscal 2018 were negatively impacted by our continued dispute with Apple and its contract manufacturers (who are Qualcomm licensees), as well as the previously disclosed dispute with another licensee. We did not record any revenues in the first six months of fiscal 2018 for royalties due on sales of Apple’s or the other licensee’s products. Royalty revenues related to the products of Apple’s contract manufacturers and the other licensee in dispute were approximately $970 million and $1.7 billion in the second quarter and first six months of fiscal 2017, respectively. The decreases in QTL revenues in the second quarter and first six months of fiscal 2018 were also attributable to lower royalty revenues recognized related to devices sold in prior periods. Excluding the impact of these items, QTL revenues in the second quarter and first six months of fiscal 2018 increased primarily due to increases in revenues per reported unit. QTL revenues for the first six months of fiscal 2018 were also positively impacted by an increase in reported sales of CDMA-based products (including multi-mode products that also implement OFDMA).
Our growth increasingly depends on our ability to extend our technologies, products and services into new and expanded product areas, such as RFFE, and adjacent industry segments outside of traditional cellular industries, such as automotive, IoT and networking, among others. Our research, development and other investments in these new and expanded product areas and industry segments, and related technologies, products and services, as well as in our existing technologies, products and services and new technologies, such as 5G, may not generate operating income or contribute to future results of operations that meet our expectations.
QCT accounts receivable decreased by 14% in the first six months of fiscal 2018 from $1.81 billion to $1.56 billion, primarily due to a 16% decline in revenues in the second quarter of fiscal 2018 compared to the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017, partially offset by the timing of integrated circuit shipments. QCT inventories decreased by 12% in the first six months of fiscal 2018 from $2.02 billion to $1.77 billion primarily due to a decrease in the overall quantity of units on hand.
•continue to develop brand recognition to effectively compete against better known companies in computing and other consumer driven segments and to deepen our presence in significant emerging regions.
•We continue to invest significant resources toward advancements primarily in support of 4G- and 5G-based technologies as well as other technologies to extend the demand for our products and generate new or expanded licensing opportunities, including within adjacent industry segments outside traditional cellular industries, such as automotive, the Internet of Things (IoT) and networking.
