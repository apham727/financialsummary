The Company believes Apple’s (as well as Compal’s, Foxconn’s, Pegatron’s and Wistron’s) claims in the above matters are without merit.
Reclassifications from accumulated other comprehensive income related to available-for-sale securities were negligible in each the three and nine months ended June 24, 2018 and $71 million and $118 million in the three and nine months ended June 25, 2017, respectively, and were recorded in investment and other income, net (Note 2).

The increase in equipment and services revenues in the first nine months of fiscal 2018 was primarily due to an increase in QCT revenues. The increase in licensing revenues in the third quarter of fiscal 2018 was primarily due to an increase in QTL revenues. The decrease in licensing revenues in the first nine months of fiscal 2018 was primarily due to a decrease in QTL revenues, partially offset by the reduction to revenues of $962 million recorded in the first nine months of fiscal 2017 related to the BlackBerry arbitration decision.
The increases in QCT equipment and services revenues in the third quarter and first nine months of fiscal 2018 were primarily due to increases in RFFE product revenues of $75 million and $823 million, respectively, primarily driven by revenues from our RF360 Holdings joint venture, which was formed in the second quarter of fiscal 2017, and reflected the impact of eliminating a one-month reporting lag in the third quarter of fiscal 2018, and increases of $166 million and $559 million, respectively, primarily related to higher MSM and accompanying unit shipments driven primarily by higher demand from OEMs in China, partially offset by a decline in share at Apple. The increase in QCT revenues in the third quarter of fiscal 2018 was partially offset by decreases of $178 million resulting from lower average selling prices and unfavorable product mix and $31 million in connectivity product revenues. The increase in QCT revenues in the first nine months of fiscal 2018 was partially offset by decreases of $422 million resulting from the net impact of lower average selling prices and favorable product mix and $131 million in connectivity product revenues.
QCT EBT as a percentage of revenues in the third quarter of fiscal 2018 increased primarily due to net gains on foreign currency transactions related to our RF360 Holdings joint venture, partially offset by a decrease in gross margin percentage. The decrease in gross margin percentage was primarily due to unfavorable product mix and lower average selling prices, partially offset by lower average unit costs. QCT EBT as a percentage of revenues in first nine months of fiscal 2018 increased primarily due to an increase in gross margin percentage and the favorable impact of higher revenues relative to operating expenses. The increase in gross margin percentage was primarily due to lower average unit costs, partially offset by lower average selling prices.
The dollar increases in research and development expenses in the third quarter and first nine months fiscal 2018 were primarily attributable to increases, which are net of cost decreases driven by actions taken under our Cost Plan, of $31 million and $192 million, respectively, in costs related to the development of integrated circuit technologies, including 5G technology and RFFE technologies from our RF360 Holdings joint venture, which was formed in the second quarter of fiscal 2017. The dollar increase in the first nine months of fiscal 2018 was partially offset by a $30 million impairment charge on certain intangible assets recorded in the first quarter of fiscal 2017.
QTL EBT as a percentage of revenues in the third quarter and first nine months of fiscal 2018 decreased primarily due to increases in selling, general and administrative expenses resulting from higher litigation costs. The decrease in QTL EBT as a percentage of revenues was partially offset in the third quarter of fiscal 2018 by higher QTL revenues. The decrease in QTL EBT as a percentage of revenues in the first nine months of fiscal 2018 was also attributable to lower QTL revenues. QTL revenues and EBT also continued to be impacted negatively by units that we believe are not being reported by certain other licensees and sales of certain unlicensed products. While we have reached agreements with many licensees, negotiations with certain other licensees and unlicensed companies are ongoing, particularly in emerging regions, including China, and additional litigation may become necessary if negotiations fail to resolve the relevant issues.
Selling, general and administrative expenses included $162 million and $413 million in the third quarter and first nine months of fiscal 2018, respectively, related to litigation costs, an increase of $102 million and $275 million, respectively.

Excluding the increase in litigation costs, selling, general and administrative expenses increased by $105 million in the first nine months of fiscal 2018 primarily due to increases of $118 million in professional fees and costs related to other legal matters, which was primarily driven by Broadcom’s withdrawn takeover proposal and $45 million in bad debt expense, partially offset by decreases of $45 million in share-based compensation expense, primarily due to an increase in forfeitures and actions take under our Cost Plan, and $16 million in amortization of intangible assets. 
Our growth increasingly depends on our ability to extend our technologies, products and services into new and expanded product areas, such as RFFE, and adjacent industry segments outside of traditional cellular industries, such as automotive, IoT and networking, among others. Our research, development and other investments in these new and expanded product areas and industry segments, and related technologies, products and services, as well as in our existing technologies, products and services and new technologies, such as 5G, may not generate operating income or contribute to future results of operations that meet our expectations.
the first nine months of fiscal 2017. Additionally, QTL revenues in the third quarter and first nine months of fiscal 2018 were negatively impacted by lower royalty revenues recognized related to devices sold in prior periods from certain other licensees. Excluding the impact of these items, QTL revenues in the third quarter of fiscal 2018 decreased primarily due to a decrease in reported sales of CDMA-based products (including multi-mode products that also implement OFDMA) and revenues per reported unit, while QTL revenues in the first nine months of fiscal 2018 increased primarily due to increases in reported sales of CDMA-based products (including multi-mode products that also implement OFDMA) and revenues per reported unit.
•continue to develop brand recognition to effectively compete against better known companies in computing and other consumer driven segments and to deepen our presence in significant emerging regions.
QTL Segment. QTL results in the third quarter and first nine months of fiscal 2018 were negatively impacted by our continued dispute with Apple and its contract manufacturers (who are Qualcomm licensees). We did not record any revenues in the first nine months of fiscal 2018 for royalties due on sales of Apple’s products. QTL revenues in the third quarter of fiscal 2018 included $500 million paid under an interim agreement with the other licensee in dispute. This represents a partial payment for royalties due after the second quarter of fiscal 2017 by that other licensee while negotiations continue, and it does not reflect the full amount of royalties due under the underlying license agreement. We did not record any revenues in the third quarter of fiscal 2017 for royalties due on the sales of Apple’s and the other licensee’s products. Royalty revenues related to the products of Apple’s contract manufacturers and the other licensee in dispute were approximately $1.7 billion in
