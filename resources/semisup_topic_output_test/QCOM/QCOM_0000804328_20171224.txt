Other Income, Costs and Expenses. Other expenses in the three months ended December 24, 2017 was comprised of the $1.2 billion charge related to the European Commission (EC) fine (Note 6). Other expenses in the three months ended 
Unallocated other expenses in the three months ended December 24, 2017 were comprised of the EC fine (Note 6). Unallocated other expenses in the three months ended December 25, 2016 were comprised primarily of the KFTC fine (Note 6).
The Company evaluates the performance of its segments based on earnings (loss) before income taxes (EBT). In fiscal 2018, all of the costs related to pre-commercial research and development of 5G (fifth generation) technology, of which $100 million was recorded in the three months ended December 24, 2017, are included in unallocated corporate research and development expenses, whereas similar costs related to the research and development of other technology, including 3G (third generation) and 4G (fourth generation) technology, were recorded in both the QCT and QTL segments.
applicable in fiscal 2019, resulting in a reduction to non-current deferred tax assets of $562 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2018. 
The Company believes Apple’s claims in the above matters are without merit.
The Company believes Compal’s, Foxconn’s, Pegatron’s and Wistron’s claims in the above matter are without merit.
Unrecognized tax benefits were $342 million and $372 million at December 24, 2017 and September 24, 2017, respectively. The Company believes that it is reasonably possible that the total amounts of unrecognized tax benefits at December 24, 2017 may increase or decrease in the next 12 months.QCT EBT as a percentage of revenues increased primarily due to an increase in gross margin percentage and the favorable impact of higher revenues relative to operating expenses. The increase in QCT gross margin percentage was primarily due to lower average unit costs and favorable product mix, partially offset by lower average selling prices.
The dollar increase in research and development expenses was primarily attributable to an increase of $141 million in costs related to the development of integrated circuit technologies, including 5G technology and radio frequency front-end (RFFE) technologies from our RF360 Holdings joint venture, which was formed in the second quarter of fiscal 2017, and related software products, partially offset by a $30 million impairment charge on certain intangible assets recorded in the first quarter of fiscal 2017. 
Our growth increasingly depends on our ability to extend our technologies, products and services into new and expanded product areas, such as RFFE, and adjacent industry segments outside of traditional cellular industries, such as automotive, IoT and networking, among others. Our research, development and other investments in these new and expanded product areas and industry segments, and related technologies, products and services, as well as in our existing technologies, products and services and new technologies, such as 5G, may not generate operating income or contribute to future results of operations that meet our expectations.
The increase in equipment and services revenues was primarily due to an increase in QCT revenues. The decrease in licensing revenues was primarily due to a decrease in QTL revenues.
The dollar increase in selling, general and administrative expenses was primarily attributable to increases of $60 million in costs related to litigation and other legal matters, primarily related to our licensing business, $45 million in bad debt expenses, $22 million in marketing expenses and $18 million in employee-related expenses, which included our RF360 Holdings joint venture. 
•We continue to invest significant resources toward advancements primarily in support of 4G- and 5G-based technologies as well as other technologies to extend the demand for our products and generate new or expanded licensing opportunities, including within adjacent industry segments outside traditional cellular industries, such as automotive, the Internet of Things (IoT) and networking.
Our revenues depend on commercial network deployments, expansions and upgrades of CDMA, OFDMA and other communications technologies; our customers’ and licensees’ sales of products and services based on these technologies; and customers’ demand for our products and services.
Our proposed acquisition of NXP Semiconductors N.V. involves a number of risks, including, among others, the risk that we fail to complete the acquisition, in a timely manner or at all, regulatory risks, risks associated with our use of a significant portion of our cash and our taking on significant indebtedness, other financial risks, integration risks, and risk associated with the reactions of customers, suppliers and employees.
One of our largest customers purchases our Mobile Data Modem (MDM) products, which do not include our integrated application processor technology and which have lower revenue and margin contributions than our combined modem and application processor products. To the extent such customer takes device share from our other customers who purchase our integrated modem and application processor products, our revenues and margins may be negatively impacted. 
In particular, our future growth significantly depends on new and expanded product areas, such as RFFE, and adjacent industry segments, such as automotive, IoT (including the connected home, smart cities, wearables, voice and music and robotics), data center, networking, computing and machine learning, among others; our ability to develop leading and cost-effective technologies, products and services for new and expanded product areas and adjacent industry segments; and third parties incorporating our technology, products and services into devices used in these product areas and industry segments. Accordingly, we intend to continue to make substantial investments in these new and expanded product areas and adjacent industry segments, and in developing new products, services and technologies for these product areas and industry segments.
Other expenses in the first quarter of fiscal 2018 consisted of a $1.2 billion charge related to the European Commission fine. Other expenses in the first quarter of fiscal 2017 consisted of a $868 million charge related to the Korea Fair Trade Commission (KFTC) fine and $8 million in restructuring and restructuring-related charges related to our Strategic Realignment Plan.
