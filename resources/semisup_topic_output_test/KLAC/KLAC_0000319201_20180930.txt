The threat of terrorism targeted at, or acts of war in, the regions of the world in which we do business increases the uncertainty in our markets.
There are risks associated with our receipt of government funding for research and development.
The results of operations for the three months ended September 30, 2018 are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for any other interim period or for the full fiscal year ending June 30, 2019.
Success in the semiconductor equipment industry depends, in part, on continual improvement of existing technologies and rapid innovation of new solutions.
There can be no assurance regarding the outcome of future legal proceedings, claims or investigations.
Our global operations are dependent upon certain information systems, including telecommunications, the internet, our corporate intranet, network communications, email and various computer hardware and software applications.
In addition, our business is international in nature, with our sales, service and administrative personnel and our customers located in numerous countries throughout the world.
Some of our competitors are diversified companies with greater financial resources and more extensive research, engineering, manufacturing, marketing, and customer service and support capabilities than we possess.
In addition, many of these outsourced service providers, including certain hosted software applications that we use for confidential data storage, employ cloud computing technology for such storage.
We outsource a number of services to third-party service providers, which decreases our control over the performance of these functions.
The markets for semiconductors, and therefore our business, are ultimately driven by the global demand for electronic devices by consumers and businesses.Our gross margin increased to 65.1% for three months ended September 30, 2018 from 64.7% during the three months ended June 30, 2018 and 63.5% during the three months ended September 30, 2017, respectively.
During the three months ended September 30, 2018, revenues for our process control equipment had a modest increase compared to the three months ended June 30, 2018.The threat of terrorism targeted at, or acts of war in, the regions of the world in which we do business increases the uncertainty in our markets.
Acquisitions are an important element of our strategy but, because of the uncertainties involved, we may not find suitable acquisition candidates and we may not be able to successfully integrate and manage acquired businesses.
The strength of our competitive positions in many of our existing markets is largely due to our leading technology, which is the result of continuing significant investments in product research and development.
Success in the semiconductor equipment industry depends, in part, on continual improvement of existing technologies and rapid innovation of new solutions.
There can be no assurance regarding the outcome of future legal proceedings, claims or investigations.
