We believe much of the future growth of our business and the success of our DM strategy will rest on our ability to continue to expand into newer markets for our products and services.
Products that we plan to market in the future are in various stages of development.
Our DM strategy is also increasingly focused on the delivery of our products through cloud-based deployments.
Our growth and the success of our DM strategy depend upon our ability to develop and sell new products or suites of products, including the development and sale of our cloud-based product offerings.
We also expect to grow our business by delivering our DM solutions through additional distribution channels.
