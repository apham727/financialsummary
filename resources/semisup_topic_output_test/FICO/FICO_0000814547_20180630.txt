We expect that part of the growth that we seek to achieve through our DM strategy will be derived from the sale of DM products and service solutions in industries and markets we do not currently serve. We also expect to grow our business by delivering our DM solutions through additional distribution channels. If we fail to penetrate these industries and markets to the degree we anticipate utilizing our DM strategy, or if we fail to develop additional distribution channels, we may not be able to grow our business, growth may occur more slowly than we anticipate, or our revenues and profits may decline.

Cost of revenues reflects our amortization of completed technology and selling, general and administrative expenses reflects our amortization of other intangible assets. Intangible assets, gross were $111.7 million and $114.5 million as of June 30, 2018 and September 30, 2017, respectively.
We continue to expand the pursuit of our business objective to become a leader in helping businesses automate and improve decisions across their enterprises, an approach that we commonly refer to as Decision Management, or “DM.” Our DM strategy is designed to enable us to increase our business by selling multiple products to clients, as well as to enable the development of custom client solutions that may lead to opportunities to develop new proprietary scores or other new proprietary products. Our DM strategy is also increasingly focused on the delivery of our products through cloud-based deployments. The market may be unreceptive to our general DM business approach, including being unreceptive to purchasing multiple products from us, unreceptive to our customized solutions, or unreceptive to our cloud-based offerings. As we continue to pursue our DM strategy, we may experience volatility in our revenues and operating results caused by various factors, including differences in revenue recognition treatment between our cloud-based offerings and on-premises software licenses, the timing of investments and other expenditures necessary to develop and operate our cloud-based offerings, and the adoption of new sales and delivery methods. If our DM strategy is not successful, we may not be able to grow our business, growth may occur more slowly than we anticipate, or our revenues and profits may decline.
We have a significant share of the available market in portions of our Scores segment and for certain services in our Applications segment, specifically, the markets for account management services at credit card processors and credit card fraud detection software. To increase our revenues, we must enhance and improve existing products and continue to introduce new products and new versions of existing products that keep pace with technological developments, satisfy increasingly sophisticated customer requirements and achieve market acceptance. We believe much of the future growth of our business and the success of our DM strategy will rest on our ability to continue to expand into newer markets for our products and services. Such areas are relatively new to our product development and sales and marketing personnel. Products that we plan to market in the future are in various stages of development. We cannot assure you that the marketplace will accept these products. If our current or potential customers are not willing to switch to or adopt our new products and services, either as a result of the quality of these products and services or due to other factors, such as economic conditions, our revenues will decrease.
We will continue to rely upon proprietary technology rights, and if we are unable to protect them, our business could be harmed.The year-to-date period over period $48.7 million increase in Scores segment operating income was attributable to a $55.6 million increase in segment revenue, partially offset by a $6.9 million increase in segment operating expenses. Segment operating income as a percentage of segment revenue for Scores increased to 81% from 78%, mainly due to an increase in sales of our higher-margin score products.
The quarter over quarter $20.2 million increase in Scores segment operating income was due to a $22.6 million increase in segment revenue, partially offset by a $2.4 million increase in segment operating expenses. Segment operating income as a percentage of segment revenue for Scores increased to 82% from 80% mainly due to an increase in sales of our higher-margin score products.
The year-to-date period over period $4.6 million increase in Applications segment operating income was due to a $26.8 million increase in segment revenue, partially offset by a $22.2 million increase in segment operating expenses. Segment operating income as a percentage of segment revenue for Applications was 26%, materially consistent with the nine months ended June 30, 2017.
The quarter over quarter $4.0 million decrease in Applications segment operating income was due to an $11.9 million increase in segment operating expenses, partially offset by a $7.9 million increase in segment revenue. Segment operating income as a percentage of segment revenue for Applications decreased to 24% from 29% mainly due to an increase in personnel cost and an increase in facilities and infrastructure cost, both driven by increased resource requirement due to expansion in our cloud infrastructure operations, which was partially offset by an increase in sales of our higher-margin software products.
We continue to drive growth in our Scores segment. Scores revenue increased 32% to $92.1 million during the quarter ended June 30, 2018 from $69.5 million during the quarter ended June 30, 2017, and 29% to $249.9 million during the nine months ended June 30, 2018 from $194.3 million during the nine months ended June 30, 2017. Scores operating income increased 36% to $75.7 million during the quarter ended June 30, 2018 from $55.5 million during the quarter ended June 30, 2017, and 32% to $201.3 million during the nine months ended June 30, 2018 from $152.5 million during the nine months ended June 30, 2017. For our Applications and Decision Management Software segments, our cloud business continues to grow both in the absolute dollar value and as a percentage of revenues as we pursue our cloud-first strategy. During the quarter ended June 30, 2018, cloud revenues accounted for $58.1 million, or 35% of non-Scores revenues, compared to $51.2 million, or 32% during the quarter ended June 30, 2017. During the nine months ended June 30, 2018, cloud revenues accounted for $177.6 million, or 35% of non-Scores revenues, compared to $151.1 million, or 31% during the nine months ended June 30, 2017.We expect that part of the growth that we seek to achieve through our DM strategy will be derived from the sale of DM products and service solutions in industries and markets we do not currently serve.
