We expect that part of the growth that we seek to achieve through our DM strategy will be derived from the sale of DM products and service solutions in industries and markets we do not currently serve. We also expect to grow our business by delivering our DM solutions through additional distribution channels. If we fail to penetrate these industries and markets to the degree we anticipate utilizing our DM strategy, or if we fail to develop additional distribution channels, we may not be able to grow our business, growth may occur more slowly than we anticipate, or our revenues and profits may decline.

We continue to expand the pursuit of our business objective to become a leader in helping businesses automate and improve decisions across their enterprises, an approach that we commonly refer to as Decision Management, or “DM.” Our DM strategy is designed to enable us to increase our business by selling multiple products to clients, as well as to enable the development of custom client solutions that may lead to opportunities to develop new proprietary scores or other new proprietary products. Our DM strategy is also increasingly focused on the delivery of our products through cloud-based deployments. The market may be unreceptive to our general DM business approach, including being unreceptive to purchasing multiple products from us, unreceptive to our customized solutions, or unreceptive to our cloud-based offerings. As we continue to pursue our DM strategy, we may experience volatility in our revenues and operating results caused by various factors, including differences in revenue recognition treatment between our cloud-based offerings and on-premise software licenses, the timing of investments and other expenditures necessary to develop and operate our cloud-based offerings, and the adoption of new sales and delivery methods. If our DM strategy is not successful, we may not be able to grow our business, growth may occur more slowly than we anticipate, or our revenues and profits may decline.
We have a significant share of the available market in portions of our Scores segment and for certain services in our Applications segment, specifically, the markets for account management services at payment card processors and payment card fraud detection software. To increase our revenues, we must enhance and improve existing products and continue to introduce new products and new versions of existing products that keep pace with technological developments, satisfy increasingly sophisticated customer requirements and achieve market acceptance. We believe much of the future growth of our business and the success of our DM strategy will rest on our ability to continue to expand into newer markets for our products and services. Such areas are relatively new to our product development and sales and marketing personnel. Products that we plan to market in the future are in various stages of development. We cannot assure you that the marketplace will accept these products. If our current or potential customers are not willing to switch to or adopt our new products and services, either as a result of the quality of these products and services or due to other factors, such as economic conditions, our revenues will decrease.
We will continue to rely upon proprietary technology rights, and if we are unable to protect them, our business could be harmed.
Protection from system interruptions is important to our business. If we experience system interruptions, it could harm our business.
Systems or network interruptions, including interruptions experienced in connection with our cloud-based and other product offerings, could delay and disrupt our ability to develop, deliver or maintain our products and services, causing harm to our business and reputation and resulting in loss of customers or revenue. These interruptions can include software or hardware malfunctions, communication failures, outages or other failures of third party environments or service providers, fires, floods, earthquakes, power losses, equipment failures and other events beyond our control.The year-to-date period over period $37.2 million increase in Scores segment operating income was attributable to a $34.5 million increase in segment revenue and a $2.7 million decrease in segment operating expenses. Segment operating income as a percentage of segment revenue for Scores increased to 84% from 79%, mainly due to an increase in sales of our higher-margin score products.
The quarter over quarter $17.5 million increase in Scores segment operating income was due to a $17.3 million increase in segment revenue and a $0.2 million decrease in segment operating expenses. Segment operating income as a percentage of segment revenue for Scores increased to 85% from 81% mainly due to an increase in sales of our higher-margin score products.

The year-to-date period over period $6.4 million decrease in Applications segment operating income was due to a $9.2 million increase in segment operating expenses, partially offset by a $2.8 million increase in segment revenue. Segment operating income as a percentage of segment revenue for Applications decreased to 24% from 27% mainly due to an increase in labor and personnel costs.
Amortization expense was $3.0 million during the six months ended March 31, 2019 versus $3.5 million during the six months ended March 31, 2018.
