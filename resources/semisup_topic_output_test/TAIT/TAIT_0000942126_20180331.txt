Distribution Components - Our name brand electronic components. 
In the following table, revenue is disaggregated by primary geographical market, major product line, and timing of revenue recognition. 
In 1989, we were formed and incorporated in California. We maintain a majority-owned subsidiary in Mexico (since 1998) and two divisions in each of Taiwan (since 1998) and China (since 2005). Our Mexico location closed all operations in May 2013 (final closure is pending sale of our local 15,000 sq. ft. office and warehouse facility) and our Taiwan and China locations are for supporting overseas customers, inventory sourcing, purchases and coordinating the manufacture of our products. Our China location also serves as the engineering designs support center responsible for arranging pre-production scheduling and mass production runs with joint venture partners for our projects, making component datasheets and test specifications, preparing samples, monitoring quality of shipments and performing failure analysis reports. 
We made payments to K.S. Best International Co. Ltd., a company controlled by the brother of our Chief Executive Officer of approximately $6,000 for both of the quarters ended March 31, 2018 and 2017. These payments were for professional fees related to the operational management of our Taiwan office. In addition, we also made payments of approximately $6,000 and $14,000 for the quarters ended March 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively, for interest expense on our credit facility from K.S. Best International Co. Ltd. See Note 4. 
Outstanding commitments to purchase inventory from suppliers aggregated $1,250,000 as of March 31, 2018. 
The unaudited condensed consolidated interim financial statements include the accounts of the Company and all wholly owned divisions, including its 60% majority-owned subsidiary, Taitron Components Mexico, S.A. de C.V. All significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. 
On January 1, 2018, we adopted Topic 606 (ASU 2014-09) applying the modified retrospective method. The primary impact of adoption relates to additional disclosures and presentation of revenue by primary geographical market, major product line and the timing of revenue recognition. 
Our $193,000 investment in securities as of March 31, 2018 relates to our ownership of 1,322,552 common shares of Zowie Technology Corporation (New Taipei City, Taiwan), a supplier of electronic component products. Our investment relates to approximately 8.9% of their total outstanding shares although we do not have significant influence or control. This investment is accounted for under the cost method basis of accounting. Net income was $59,000 for the first quarter of 2018 versus $299,000 in the comparable period for 2017, a decrease of $240,000 resulting from the decrease in net sales. 
Gross profit for the first quarter of 2018 was $654,000 versus $873,000 in the comparable period for 2018, and gross margin percentage of net sales was 39.2% in the first quarter of 2018 versus 40.3% in the comparable period for 2017. 
Net sales in the first quarter of 2018 totaled $1,655,000 versus $2,167,000 in the comparable period for 2017, a decrease of $512,000 or 23.6% over the same period last year. The decrease was primarily due material shortages, longer production lead times and lower valued per unit products shipped. 
Selling, general and administrative expenses in the first quarter of 2018 totaled $560,000 versus $540,000 in the comparable period for 2017. The increase was primarily due to professional fees incurred for engineering services for our products. 
Other income, net of other expense, in the first quarter of 2018 was $48,000 versus $29,000 in the comparable period for 2017. Other income was primarily derived from the rental income of excess space at our headquarters’ facility in Valencia, CA. 
Cash flows provided by operating activities were $493,000 as opposed to $366,000 used for in the three months ended March 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. The increase of $859,000 in cash flows provided by operations compared with the prior period resulted from changes in operating assets and liabilities, primarily from inventory, accounts payables and accounts receivables compared to the prior period. 
Cash flows used in financing activities were $139,000 and $138,000 for the three months ended March 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. 
Revenue Recognition – Revenue is recognized upon shipment of the products, which is when legal transfer of title occurs and control of the product is transferred to the customer. Reserves for sales allowances and customer returns are established based upon historical experience and our estimates of future returns. Sales returns for the three months ended March 31, 2018 and 2017 were $2,000 and $111,000, respectively. The allowance for sales returns and doubtful accounts at March 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017 aggregated $42,000 and $40,000, respectively. Item 6. Exhibits.
