ODM Components - Our private labeled electronic components. 
In 1989, we were formed and incorporated in California. We maintain a majority-owned subsidiary in Mexico (since 1998) and two divisions in each of Taiwan (since 1997) and China (since 2005). Our Mexico location closed all operations in May 2013 (final closure is pending sale of our local 15,000 sq. ft. office and warehouse facility) and our Taiwan and China locations are for supporting overseas customers, inventory sourcing, purchases and coordinating the manufacture of our products. Our China location also serves as the engineering design support center responsible for arranging pre-production scheduling and mass production runs with joint venture partners for our projects, making component datasheets and test specifications, preparing samples, monitoring quality of shipments and performing failure analysis reports. 
Outstanding commitments to purchase inventory from suppliers aggregated $2,040,000 as of March 31, 2019. 
The unaudited condensed consolidated interim financial statements include the accounts of the Company and all wholly owned divisions, including its 60% majority-owned subsidiary, Taitron Components Mexico, S.A. de C.V. All significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. Net income was $184,000 for the first quarter of 2019 versus $59,000 in the comparable period for 2018, an increase of $125,000 resulting from the reasons discussed above. 
Gross profit for the first quarter of 2019 was $683,000 versus $654,000 in the comparable period for 2018, and gross margin percentage of net sales was 49.4% in the first quarter of 2019 versus 39.5% in the comparable period for 2018. The approximately 10% gross profit increase was driven by an increase of ODM project sales unit pricing contributing approximately 5% and shipments of new higher gross margin ODM products which contributed approximately 4% of the increase. 
Net sales in the first quarter of 2019 totaled $1,384,000 versus $1,655,000 in the comparable period for 2018, a decrease of $271,000 or 16.4% over the same period last year. The decrease was primarily driven by a decrease of ODM project sales volume. 
Other income, net of other expense, in the first quarter of 2019 was $25,000 versus $48,000 in the comparable period for 2018. Other income was primarily derived from the rental income of excess office space at our headquarters in Valencia, CA. 
Selling, general and administrative expenses in the first quarter of 2019 totaled $530,000 versus $560,000 in the comparable period for 2018. The $30,000 decrease was primarily driven by the decreases of $15,000 in professional services and $9,000 in commissions paid to our independent sales representatives. 
Cash flows used for financing activities were $95,000 and $139,000 for the three months ended March 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. The decrease of $44,000 compared with the prior period was primarily due to $76,000 of stock options exercised and partially offset by $32,000 of increased cash dividend payments. The increase to our cash dividends was based upon our November 2, 2018 announcement that our quarterly cash dividends increased by 20% from $0.025 per share to $0.03 per share. 
Revenue Recognition â€“ Revenue is recognized upon shipment of the products, which is when legal transfer of title occurs and control of the product is transferred to the customer. Reserves for sales allowances and customer returns are established based upon historical experience and our estimates of future returns. Sales returns for the three months ended March 31, 2019 and 2018 were $3,000 and $2,000, respectively. The allowance for sales returns and doubtful accounts at March 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018 aggregated $39,000 and $38,000, respectively. 
Income tax provision was $1,000 for the first quarter of 2019 versus $2,000 in 2018, as we do not expect significant taxable income for the year ending December 31, 2019. Item 6. Exhibits.
