ODM Components - Our private labeled electronic components. 
In 1989, we were formed and incorporated in California. We maintain a majority-owned subsidiary in Mexico (since 1998) and two divisions in each of Taiwan (since 1998) and China (since 2005). Our Mexico location closed all operations in May 2013 (final closure is pending sale of our local 15,000 sq. ft. office and warehouse facility) and our Taiwan and China locations are for supporting overseas customers, inventory sourcing, purchases and coordinating the manufacture of our products. Our China location also serves as the engineering design support center responsible for arranging pre-production scheduling and mass production runs with joint venture partners for our projects, making component datasheets and test specifications, preparing samples, monitoring quality of shipments and performing failure analysis reports. 
Shipping and handling costs associated with outbound freight after control over a product has transferred to a customer are accounted for as a fulfillment costs and are included in cost of products sold.

Selling, general and administrative expenses in the third quarter of 2018 totaled $544,000 versus $534,000 in the comparable period for 2017. The increase was driven by increased professional fees incurred for engineering services for our products.
