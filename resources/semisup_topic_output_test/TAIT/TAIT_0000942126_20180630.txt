ODM Components - Our private labeled electronic components. 
In 1989, we were formed and incorporated in California. We maintain a majority-owned subsidiary in Mexico (since 1998) and two divisions in each of Taiwan (since 1998) and China (since 2005). Our Mexico location closed all operations in May 2013 (final closure is pending sale of our local 15,000 sq. ft. office and warehouse facility) and our Taiwan and China locations are for supporting overseas customers, inventory sourcing, purchases and coordinating the manufacture of our products. Our China location also serves as the engineering designs support center responsible for arranging pre-production scheduling and mass production runs with joint venture partners for our projects, making component datasheets and test specifications, preparing samples, monitoring quality of shipments and performing failure analysis reports.
