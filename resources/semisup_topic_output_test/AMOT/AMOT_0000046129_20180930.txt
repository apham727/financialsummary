Item 6. Exhibits Operating cash flow decreased for the nine months ended September 30, 2018 compared to 2017. The cash generated by the increase in net income in 2018 is offset by increases in working capital needs due to the Maval OE Steering business acquisition and significant organic growth. 
We remain focused on executing our strategy for growth while streamlining the organization and emphasizing continuous improvement in quality, delivery, cost and innovation as we drive the One Allied approach and expand our value proposition for our customers. Solid strides continue to be made with our multi-product, fully integrated solutions that are leading to increased business. Also, we continue to build a pipeline of exciting market-based application opportunities. Sales cycles are long and the time from being selected for the solution development to full rate production can be longer, yet we believe we are building a scalable foundation which can deliver strong returns on those investments. 
Sales to U.S. customers were 55% of total sales for the third quarter 2018 compared with 53% for the same period last year, with the balance of sales to customers primarily in Europe, Canada and Asia. The overall increase in revenue was due to an 24% volume increase and a 1% unfavorable currency impact.

The significant cash used in investing activities in 2018 reflects the acquisition the Maval OE Steering business during the first quarter. Also, during the nine months ended September 30, 2018, purchases of property and equipment were $10,581 compared to $4,220 for the nine months ended September 30, 2017. Capital expenditures are expected to increase for the remainder of 2018 to support our new contract wins along with our continued IT infrastructure enhancements. The Company expects to invest between $13 million and $16 million in capital expenditures during 2018. 
The change in cash used in financing activities reflects the 2018 use of the revolver to partially finance the acquisition of the Maval OE Steering business. During the second and third quarters of 2018, we also utilized our foreign revolver to make $3,000 of capital investment into our Changzhou operation funding expansion and future capital spending in support of recently announced contract wins. During the nine months ended September 30, 2018, we made net borrowings of $9,308 from our Revolving Facility obligation compared to net payments of $9,214 for the same period in 2017.
