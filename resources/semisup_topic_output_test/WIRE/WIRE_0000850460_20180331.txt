In the first quarter of 2018, LIFO adjustments were recorded, increasing cost of sales by $2.0 million, versus LIFO adjustments increasing cost of sales by $4.4 million in the first quarter of 2017. During the first quarter of 2018, the Company liquidated a portion of the LIFO inventory layer in the aluminum wire pool established in prior years. This liquidation had an insignificant effect on the net income of the Company. During the first quarter of 2017, the Company did not liquidate any LIFO inventory layers established in prior years. 
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost, determined by the last-in, first-out (LIFO) method, or market.
LIFO pools are established at the end of each fiscal year. During the first three quarters of every year, LIFO calculations are based on the inventory levels and costs at that time. Accordingly, interim LIFO balances will fluctuate depending on those inventory levels and costs.
The majority of our revenue is derived by fulfilling customer orders for the purchase of our products, which include electrical building wire and cable. We recognize revenue at the point in time that control of the ordered product(s) is transferred to the customer, which is typically upon shipment to the customer from our manufacturing facilities and based on agreed upon shipping terms on the related purchase order. Amounts billed and due from our customers are classified as accounts receivables on the balance sheet and require payment on a short-term basis through standard payment terms.

For information on the Company’s legal proceedings, see Note 8 to the Company’s consolidated financial statements included in Item 1 to this report and incorporated herein by reference.Cost of goods sold was $253.9 million, or 87.1% of net sales, in the first quarter of 2018, compared to $240.2 million, or 86.0% of net sales, in the first quarter of 2017. Gross profit decreased to $37.5 million, or 12.9% of net sales, in the first quarter of 2018 versus $39.2 million, or 14.0% of net sales, in the first quarter of 2017.
Cash used in operating activities was $8.0 million in the first three months of 2018 compared to $4.4 million in the first three months of 2017. The following changes in components of cash flow from operations were notable. The Company had net income of $11.4 million in the first three months of 2018 compared to net income of $13.6 million in the first three months of 2017. Accounts receivable increased $19.6 million in the first three months of 2018 compared to increasing $26.7 million in the first three months of 2017, resulting in a negative change in cash flow of $7.1 million in the first three months of 2018 versus the first three months of 2017. Accounts receivable generally fluctuate in proportion to dollar sales and, to a lesser extent, are affected by the timing of when sales occur during a given quarter. With an average of 60 to 75 days of sales outstanding, quarters in which sales are more back-end loaded will have higher accounts receivable balances outstanding at quarter-end. Inventory value increased in the first three months of 2018 and 2017, using cash of $2.1 million and $2.4 million in the first three months of 2018 and 2017. Trade accounts payable and accrued liabilities used cash of $6.6 million in 2018 versus a $9.2 million source of cash in 2017, resulting in a negative change in cash flow of $15.8 million. In the first three months of 2018, changes in current and deferred taxes provided cash of $3.6 million versus using cash of $2.4 million in the first three months of 2017. These changes in cash flow were the primary drivers of the $3.5 million increase in cash used in operations in the first three months of 2018 compared to the first three months of 2017.
Total raw materials cost, including the LIFO adjustment, increased to 76.5% of net sales in the first quarter of 2018, from 73.9% of net sales in the first quarter of 2017. Lower overhead costs as a percentage of net sales somewhat offset this increase in total raw materials cost as a percentage of net sales. Overheads contained some fixed and semi-fixed components which will fluctuate as a percentage of sales when sales dollars vary.
Cash used in investing activities increased to $7.5 million in the first three months of 2018 from $4.6 million in the first three months of 2017, due to higher capital expenditures on plant and equipment. Cash used in financing activities consisted of $0.4 
Encore believes it is a low-cost manufacturer of electrical building wire and cable. The Company is a significant supplier of building wire for interior electrical wiring in commercial and industrial buildings, homes, apartments, and manufactured housing.
Net sales were $291.4 million in the first quarter of 2018 compared to $279.4 million in the first quarter of 2017. This 4.3% increase in net sales is primarily the result of a 6.4% increase in copper wire sales, driven by a 15.6% increase in the average selling price of copper wire offset by a 7.9% decrease in copper wire unit volume shipped. Unit volume is measured in pounds of copper contained in the wire shipped during the period. Fluctuations in sales prices are primarily a result of changing copper and other raw material prices and product price competition. The average cost per pound of raw copper purchased increased 18.3% in the first quarter of 2018 compared to the first quarter of 2017 and was the principal driver of the increased average sales price of copper wire. Unit volume decreased in the first quarter of 2018 compared to the first quarter of 2017 primarily due to particularly rough winter weather that slowed construction and impacted our volumes, particularly in January.
million of cash dividends paid, partially offset by $0.3 million of proceeds from exercised stock options. These changes in cash flow were the primary drivers of the $0.1 million of cash used in financing activities for the first three months of 2018 versus $0.2 million used in the first three months of 2017. As of March 31, 2018, the balance on the Company’s revolving line of credit remained at zero. The Company’s cash balance was $107.8 million at March 31, 2018 versus $86.5 million at March 31, 2017.Item 1. Legal Proceedings.
