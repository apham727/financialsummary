Inventories are stated at the lower of cost, determined by the last-in, first-out (LIFO) method, or market.
LIFO pools are established at the end of each fiscal year. During the first three quarters of every year, LIFO calculations are based on the inventory levels and costs at that time. Accordingly, interim LIFO balances will fluctuate depending on those inventory levels and costs.

The following are those ASUs that are relevant to the Company.Selling expenses for the first six months of 2019 increased to $33.7 million, or 5.2% of net sales, compared to $32.9 million, or
Cost of goods sold increased to $564.3 million in the first six months of 2019, compared to $546.2 million in the first six months of 2018. Gross profit increased to $87.2 million, or 13.4% of net sales, in the first six months of 2019 versus $82.0 million, or 13.1% of net sales, in the first six months of 2018.
Cost of goods sold was $291.0 million, or 86.4% of net sales, in the second quarter of 2019, compared to $292.3 million, or 86.8% of net sales, in the second quarter of 2018. Gross profit increased to $45.9 million, or 13.6% of net sales, in the second quarter of 2019 from $44.5 million, or 13.2% of net sales, in the second quarter of 2018.
Cash provided by operating activities was $27.9 million in the first six months of 2019 compared to $6.0 million of cash used in the first six months of 2018. The following changes in components of cash flow from operations were notable. The Company had net income of $31.2 million in the first six months of 2019 compared to net income of $29.4 million in the first six months of 2018. Accounts receivable increased $20.6 million in the first six months of 2019 and $29.5 million in the first six months of 2018, resulting in a positive change in cash flow of $8.9 million in the first six months of 2019 versus the first six months of 2018. Accounts receivable generally fluctuate in proportion to dollar sales and, to a lesser extent, are affected by the timing of when sales occur during a given quarter. With an average of 60 to 75 days of sales outstanding, quarters in which sales are more back-end loaded will have higher accounts receivable balances outstanding at quarter-end. Inventory value decreased $6.3 million in the first six months of 2019 compared to increasing $4.5 million in the first six months 2018 producing a positive swing in cash flow of $10.8 million in 2019 versus 2018. Trade accounts payable and accrued liabilities provided cash of $2.3 million in the first six months of 2019 versus using $9.6 million in the first six months of 2018, resulting in a positive change in cash flow of $11.9 million. In the first six months of 2019, changes in current and deferred taxes used cash of $1.1 million versus a $1.3 million use of cash in the first six months of 2018. These changes in cash flow were the primary drivers of the $33.8 million increase in cash provided by operations in the first six months of 2019 compared to the first six months of 2018.

Net sales for the first six months of 2019 were $651.6 million compared to net sales of $628.2 million for the first six months of 2018. This 3.7% increase in net sales is primarily the result of a 2.8% increase in copper wire sales, driven by a 9.3% increase in copper wire unit volume shipped, partially offset by a 5.9% decrease in the average selling price of copper wire. Unit volume is measured in pounds of copper contained in the wire shipped during the period. Fluctuations in sales prices are primarily a result of changing copper and other raw material prices and product price competition. The average cost per pound of raw copper purchased decreased 9.1% in the first six months of 2019 compared to the first six months of 2018 and was the principal driver of the decreased average sales price of copper wire.
Net sales were $336.9 million in the second quarter of 2019 compared to $336.8 million in the second quarter of 2018. The virtually identical net sales dollars are primarily the result of a 5.6% increase in copper wire unit volume shipped, offset by a 6.1% decrease in the average selling price of copper wire. Unit volume is measured in pounds of copper contained in the wire shipped during the period. The 5.6% increase in unit volume shipped was primarily due to strong construction industry demand despite rough spring weather in certain areas that slowed construction and impacted volumes in the second quarter of 2019. Fluctuations in sales prices are primarily a result of changing copper and other raw material prices and product price competition. The average cost per pound of raw copper purchased decreased 8.7% in the second quarter of 2019 compared to the second quarter of 2018 and was the principal driver of the decreased average sales price of copper wire. 
The gross profit margin percentage increased primarily as a result of the 9.3% unit volume increase and an increase in the spread between the average price paid for a pound of raw copper and the average sale price for a pound of copper in the first six months of 2019 versus the first six months of 2018 due primarily to competitive industry pricing. Fluctuations in sales prices are primarily a result of changing copper raw material prices and product price competition. The copper spread increased 0.9% in the first six months of 2019 versus the first six months of 2018. The spread increased as a result of the 5.9% decrease in the average sales price per copper pound sold while the per pound cost of raw copper decreased 9.1%. In nominal dollars, the sales price decreased less than the cost of copper.Item 1. Legal Proceedings.
