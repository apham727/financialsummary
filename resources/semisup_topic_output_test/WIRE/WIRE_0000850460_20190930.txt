Inventories are stated at the lower of cost, determined by the last-in, first-out (LIFO) method, or market.
LIFO pools are established at the end of each fiscal year. During the first three quarters of every year, LIFO calculations are based on the inventory levels and costs at that time. Accordingly, interim LIFO balances will fluctuate depending on those inventory levels and costs.

Inventory value decreased $12.1 million in the first nine months of 2019 compared to increasing $3.6 million in the first nine months 2018 producing a positive swing in cash flow of $15.7 million in 2019 versus 2018.

Due primarily to decreases in copper costs and price and volume movements of other materials, a LIFO adjustment was recorded, decreasing cost of sales by $4.4 million during the third quarter of 2019. During the third quarter of 2018, a LIFO adjustment was recorded, decreasing cost of sales by $9.1 million.
Total raw materials cost, including the LIFO adjustment, increased to 74.3% of net sales in the third quarter of 2019, from 73.2% of net sales in the third quarter of 2018. Overhead costs increased to 12.3% of net sales in the third quarter of 2019, from 10.8% of net sales in the third quarter of 2018. Overheads contain some fixed and semi-fixed components which do not fluctuate as much as sales dollars fluctuate.
Net sales for the first nine months of 2019 were $972.7 million compared to net sales of $969.0 million for the first nine months of 2018. This 0.4% increase in net sales is the result of a 6.0% increase in copper wire unit volume shipped, offset by a 5.8% decrease in the average selling price of copper wire. Unit volume is measured in pounds of copper contained in the wire shipped during the period. Fluctuations in sales prices are primarily a result of changing copper and other raw material prices and product price competition. The average cost per pound of raw copper purchased decreased 7.3% in the first nine months of 2019 compared to the first nine months of 2018 and was a driver of the decreased average sales price of copper wire.
The gross profit margin percentage decreased primarily as a result of the decrease in the spread between the average price paid for a pound of raw copper and the average sale price for a pound of copper in the first nine months of 2019 versus the first nine months of 2018 due primarily to competitive industry pricing. Fluctuations in sales prices are primarily a result of changing copper raw material prices and product price competition. The copper spread decreased 2.8% in the first nine months of 2019 versus the first nine months of 2018. The spread decreased as a result of the 5.8% decrease in the average sales price per copper pound sold while the per pound cost of raw copper decreased 7.3%. In nominal dollars, the sales price decreased more than the cost of copper.Item 1. Legal Proceedings.
