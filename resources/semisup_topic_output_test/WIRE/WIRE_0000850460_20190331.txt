There have been no material changes to the Company’s risk factors as disclosed in Item 1A, “Risk Factors,” in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018.Cost of goods sold was $273.4 million, or 86.9% of net sales, in the first quarter of 2019, compared to $253.9 million, or 87.1% of net sales, in the first quarter of 2018. Gross profit increased to $41.3 million, or 13.1% of net sales, in the first quarter of 2019 from $37.5 million, or 12.9% of net sales, in the first quarter of 2018.
Cash provided by operating activities was $11.4 million in the first three months of 2019 compared to $8.0 million of cash used in the first three months of 2018. The following changes in components of cash flow from operations were notable. The Company had net income of $13.4 million in the first three months of 2019 compared to net income of $11.4 million in the first three months of 2018. Accounts receivable decreased $3.9 million in the first three months of 2019 compared to increasing $19.6 million in the first three months of 2018, resulting in a positive change in cash flow of $23.5 million in the first three months of 2019 versus the first three months of 2018. Accounts receivable generally fluctuate in proportion to dollar sales and, to a lesser extent, are affected by the timing of when sales occur during a given quarter. With an average of 60 to 75 days of sales outstanding, quarters in which sales are more back-end loaded will have higher accounts receivable balances outstanding at quarter-end. Inventory value decreased $0.8 million in the first three months of 2019 compared to increasing $2.1 million in the first three months 2018. Trade accounts payable and accrued liabilities used cash of $16.4 million in the first three months of 2019 versus $6.6 million in the first three months of 2018, resulting in a negative change in cash flow of $9.8 million. In the first three months of 2019, changes in current and deferred taxes provided cash of $4.0 million versus a $3.6 million source of cash in the first three months of 2018. These changes in cash flow were the primary drivers of the $19.4 million increase in cash provided by operations in the first three months of 2019 compared to the first three months of 2018.

Total raw materials cost, including the LIFO adjustment, decreased to 75.0% of net sales in the first quarter of 2019, from 76.5% of net sales in the first quarter of 2018. Increased overhead costs added to the increase in total cost of sales dollars and increased as a percent of net sales. Overheads contain some fixed and semi-fixed components which do not fluctuate as much as sales dollars fluctuate.
Net sales were $314.7 million in the first quarter of 2019 compared to $291.4 million in the first quarter of 2018. This 8.0% increase in net sales dollars is primarily the result of a 13.5% increase in copper wire unit volume shipped, offset somewhat by a 5.9% decrease in the average selling price of copper wire. Unit volume is measured in pounds of copper contained in the wire shipped during the period. The 13.5% increase in unit volume shipped was primarily due to particularly rough winter weather that slowed construction and impacted volumes in the first quarter of 2018, particularly in January. Fluctuations in sales prices are primarily a result of changing copper and other raw material prices and product price competition. The average cost per pound of raw copper purchased decreased 9.6% in the first quarter of 2019 compared to the first quarter of 2018 and was the principal driver of the decreased average sales price of copper wire. 
The increase in gross profit margin percentage was driven principally by the increase of the copper wire spread. The spread between the average price paid for a pound of raw copper and the average sales price for a pound of copper contained in finished wire increased 2.2% in the first quarter of 2019 versus the first quarter of 2018. The spread increased as a result of the average sales price per pound of copper sold decreasing 5.9% while the per pound cost of raw copper purchased decreased 9.6%. The percentage change on sales is on a higher nominal dollar amount than on purchases and, therefore, spreads change on a nominal dollar basis. The margin changes were due primarily to the competitive pricing environment in the industry. In aluminum wire, which represented 7.8% of our net sales in the first quarter of 2019, we continue to enforce our rights under the U.S. trade remedy laws. On April 8, 2019, the U.S. Commerce Department imposed preliminary countervailing duties on imports of aluminum wire from China at rates ranging from 11.57 to 164.16 percent. The final results of the U.S. Government’s ongoing antidumping and countervailing duty investigations are not expected until the end of the year.
