 Standard product warranty coverage which provides assurance that our products will conform to the contractually agreed-upon specifications for a limited period from the date of shipment is typically offered, while extended or separately-priced warranty coverage is typically not offered. The warranty claim is generally limited to a credit equal to the purchase price or a promise to repair or replace the product for a specified period of time at no additional charge. We estimate our warranty liability based on historical experience, product history, and current trends, and record warranty expense in cost of sales in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income.

 The following describes the significant changes in the amounts as presented on the accompanying Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets at March 31, 2018 as compared to December 31, 2017. Accounts receivable decreased $82.8 to $1,515.8 primarily due to lower sales in the first quarter of 2018 relative to the fourth quarter of 2017, which were partially offset by the effect of translation from exchange rate changes at March 31, 2018 compared to December 31, 2017 (“Translation”). Days sales outstanding at March 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017 were approximately 74 and 73 days, respectively. Inventories increased $59.9 to $1,166.8, primarily to support expected future sales levels, as well as the effect of Translation. Inventory days at March 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017 were 84 and 76 days, respectively. Other current assets increased $33.4 to $230.2 primarily due to the recording of contract assets of $21.9 in the first quarter of 2018 as a result of the adoption of ASC Topic 606 as well as an increases in other receivables. Property, plant and equipment, net, increased $22.5 to $839.3 primarily due to capital expenditures of $54.9 as well as Translation, partially offset by depreciation of $47.4. Goodwill increased $103.9 to $4,146.5 primarily as a result of goodwill recognized related to an acquisition in the Interconnect Products and Assemblies segment that closed in the first quarter of 2018, as well as Translation. Accounts payable decreased $77.4 to $798.2, primarily as a result of payments on outstanding payables, which more than offset purchasing activity. Payable days at March 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017 were approximately 57 and 60 days, respectively. Total accrued expenses, including accrued income taxes, decreased $66.1 to $636.6 primarily as a result of decreases in accrued wages and salaries and other employee-related compensation and benefits, partially offset by an increase in accrued income taxes. Accrued pension and postretirement benefit obligations decreased $81.5 to $190.5 primarily due to the Company’s voluntary cash contribution of approximately $81.0 in January 2018 to fully fund the Company’s U.S. Plans.  
 Interest expense for the first quarter of 2018 was $24.5 compared to $19.3 for the first quarter of 2017. The increase is primarily due to higher average interest rates associated with the Company’s commercial paper borrowings as well as the senior note issuances in April 2017, along with higher average debt levels used to fund the Company’s dividend and stock buyback programs.  
 The adoption of Topic 606 did not have a material impact on our condensed consolidated financial statements as of the adoption date and as of and for the three months ended March 31, 2018. Refer to Note 3 herein for further discussion regarding revenue recognition and related policies.  
 The Company’s primary sources of liquidity are internally generated cash flow, the Commercial Paper Program, the Revolving Credit Facility, and its cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments on hand. The Company believes that its cash, cash equivalents and short-term investment position on hand, ability to generate future cash flow from operations, availability under its credit facilities, and access to capital markets (including the recent issuances of both the 2020 Senior Notes and 2024 Senior Notes in April 2017) provide adequate liquidity to meet its obligations for the next twelve months and the foreseeable future, including the repayment of the $750.0 outstanding principal amount of 2.55% Senior Notes due January 2019 (the “2.55% Notes”).
