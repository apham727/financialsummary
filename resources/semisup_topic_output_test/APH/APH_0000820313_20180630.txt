 Selling, general and administrative expenses increased to $236.6 or 11.9% of net sales and $466.6 or 12.1% of net sales for the second quarter and first six months of 2018, respectively, compared to $212.4 or 12.7% of net sales and $414.2 or 12.8% of net sales for the second quarter and first six months of 2017, respectively. Administrative expenses represented approximately 4.8% and 4.9% of net sales for the second quarter and first six months of 2018, respectively, and represented approximately 4.9% of net sales for both the second quarter and first six months of 2017. Research and development expenses represented approximately 2.8% of net sales for both the second quarter and first six months of 2018, and represented 2.8% of net sales for both the second quarter and first six months of 2017. Selling and marketing expenses represented approximately 4.4% and 4.5% of net sales for the second quarter and first six months of 2018, respectively, and represented approximately 5.1% of net sales for both the second quarter and first six months of 2017.   
 Operating income was $408.2 or 20.6% of net sales and $785.1 or 20.4% of net sales for the second quarter and first six months of 2018, respectively, compared to $336.2 or 20.2% of net sales and $650.3 or 20.2% of net sales for the second quarter and first six months of 2017, respectively. Operating income for the second quarter and first six months of 2017 included $4.0 of acquisition-related expenses (separately presented in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income) related to external transaction costs incurred in the second quarter of 2017. These expenses had an impact on net income of $3.7 or $0.01 per share for the three and six months ended June 30, 2017. Excluding the effect of these acquisition-related expenses, Adjusted Operating Income and Adjusted Operating Margin, as defined in the “Non-GAAP Financial Measures” section below, were $340.2 or 20.4% of net sales and $654.3 or 20.3% of net sales for the three and six months ended June 30, 2017, respectively. The increase in the Adjusted Operating Margin for the three and six months ended June 30, 2018, compared to the same respective periods in 2017, was driven primarily by an increase in operating margin for the Interconnect Products and Assemblies segment. Operating income for the Interconnect Products and Assemblies segment for the second quarter and first six months of 2018 was $419.7 or 22.4% of net sales and $810.9 or 22.3% of net sales, respectively, compared to $348.4 or 22.3% of net sales and $672.4 or 22.2% of net sales for the second quarter and first six months of 2017, respectively. Operating income for the Cable Products and Solutions segment for the second quarter and first six months of 2018 was $14.7 or 13.2% of net sales and $26.0 or 12.5% of net sales, respectively, compared to $16.0 or 14.9% of net sales and $29.7 or 14.6% of net sales for the second quarter and first six months of 2017, respectively. The decrease in operating margin for the Cable Products and Solutions segment for the second quarter and first six months of 2018, compared to the same respective periods of 2017, was primarily driven by increases in certain commodity costs.  
 Geographically, sales in the United States in the second quarter of 2018 increased approximately 21% in U.S. dollars ($576.3 in 2018 versus $476.5 in 2017) and 15% organically, compared to the second quarter of 2017, and increased 18% in U.S. dollars ($1,103.3 in 2018 versus $934.3 in 2017) and 12% organically in the first six months of 2018, compared to the first six months of 2017. Foreign sales in the second quarter of 2018 increased approximately 18% in U.S. dollars ($1,405.1 in 2018 versus $1,190.0 in 2017), 15% in constant currencies and 12% organically, compared to the second quarter of 2017, and increased 20% in U.S. dollars ($2,745.0 in 2018 versus $2,292.3 in 2017), 16% in constant currencies and 13% organically in the first six months of 2018, compared to the first six months of 2017. The comparatively weaker U.S. dollar for the second quarter and first six months of 2018 had the effect of increasing sales by approximately $39.4 and $102.8, respectively, compared to the same respective periods in 2017.   
 Excluded from the computations above were anti-dilutive common shares of 1.5 million and 1.7 million for the three months ended June 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively, and 0.9 million and 1.0 million for the six months ended June 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively.  
 Net sales were $1,981.4 in the second quarter of 2018 compared to $1,666.5 in the second quarter of 2017, which represented an increase of 19% in U.S. dollars, 17% in constant currencies and 13% organically over the same respective prior period. Net sales were $3,848.3 in the first six months of 2018 compared to $3,226.6 in the first six months of 2017, which represented an increase of 19% in U.S. dollars, 16% in constant currencies and 12% organically over the same respective prior period. Net sales in the Interconnect Products and Assemblies segment (approximately 94% of net sales) in the second quarter of 2018 increased 20% in U.S. dollars, 17% in constant currencies and 13% organically, compared to the second quarter of 2017. Net sales in the Interconnect Products and Assemblies segment (approximately 95% of net sales) in the first six months of 2018 increased 20% in U.S. dollars, 17% in constant currencies and 13% organically, compared to the first six months of 2017. The sales growth in both periods was driven by increases in the industrial, automotive, mobile devices, information technology and data communications, military, mobile networks and 
commercial aerospace markets, arising primarily from organic growth along with contributions from the Company’s acquisitions. Net sales in the second quarter of 2018 in the Cable Products and Solutions segment (approximately 6% of net sales), which primarily serves the broadband market, increased 4% in U.S. dollars, 5% in constant currencies and 5% organically, compared to the second quarter of 2017. Net sales in the first six months of 2018 in the Cable Products and Solutions segment (approximately 5% of net sales) increased 2% in U.S. dollars, 2% in constant currencies and 2% organically in the first six months of 2018 compared to the same period in 2017.  
 The ability to generate cash from operating activities is one of the Company’s fundamental financial strengths. Cash flow provided by operating activities was $395.3 in the first six months of 2018 compared to $518.2 in the first six months of 2017. The decrease in cash flow provided by operating activities (“operating cash flow”) for the first six months of 2018 compared to the first six months of 2017 is primarily related to (i) the Company’s voluntary cash contribution of approximately $81.0 in the first quarter of 2018 to fully fund its U.S. defined benefit pension plans (“U.S. Plans”, and together with its foreign plans, the “Plans”), (ii) certain tax payments made during the first half of 2018 related to the Tax Act of approximately $54.0, including the first annual installment of the Transition Tax of approximately $18.0 and payments for foreign and state withholding and income taxes of approximately $36.0 related to foreign cash repatriated during the first half of 2018, along with (iii) a higher usage of cash related to other changes in working capital, all of which were partially offset by an increase in net income in the first six months of 2018.   
 The following describes the significant changes in the amounts as presented on the accompanying Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets at June 30, 2018 as compared to December 31, 2017. Accounts receivable increased $28.7 to $1,627.3, primarily due to higher sales in the second quarter of 2018 relative to the fourth quarter of 2017, which were partially offset by the effect of translation from exchange rate changes at June 30, 2018 compared to December 31, 2017 (“Translation”). Days sales outstanding at June 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017 were approximately 73 days. Inventories increased $52.9 to $1,159.8, primarily to support expected future sales levels, partially offset by Translation. Inventory days at June 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017 were 78 and 76 days, respectively. Other current assets increased $46.4 to $243.2, primarily due to the recording of contract assets of $25.5 as of June 30, 2018 as a result of the adoption of Topic 606 as well as an increase in other receivables. Property, plant and equipment, net, increased $71.4 to $888.2, primarily due to capital additions of $180.1, partially offset by depreciation of $95.9 and Translation. Goodwill increased $86.0 to $4,128.6, primarily as a result of goodwill recognized related to three acquisitions in the Interconnect Products and Assemblies segment that closed during the first six months of 2018, which was partially offset by Translation. Intangibles, net and other long-term assets decreased $16.4 to $472.1, primarily as a result of amortization related to the Company’s intangible assets. Accounts payable increased $27.5 to $903.1, primarily as a result of 
 In the past twelve months, the Company has completed several acquisitions, including three acquisitions which closed in the first six months of 2018, all in the Interconnect Products and Assemblies segment. The Company is in the process of completing its analyses of the fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed. The Company anticipates that the final assessments of values will not differ materially from the preliminary assessments. These acquisitions were not significant to the Company either individually or in the aggregate.   
   ·    Adjusted Operating Margin is defined as Adjusted Operating Income (as defined above) expressed as a percentage of Net sales (as reported in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income). 
 Standard product warranty coverage which provides assurance that our products will conform to the contractually agreed-upon specifications for a limited period from the date of shipment is typically offered, while extended or separately-priced warranty coverage is typically not offered. The warranty claim is generally limited to a credit equal to the purchase price or a promise to repair or replace the product for a specified period of time at no additional charge. We estimate our warranty liability based on historical experience, product history, and current trends, and record warranty expense in cost of sales in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income. Warranty liabilities and related warranty expense have not been and were not significant in the accompanying Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements as of and for the three and six months ended June 30, 2018.  
 Provision for income taxes for the second quarter and first six months of 2018 was at an effective tax rate of 24.7% and 24.5%, respectively. For the second quarter of 2018, the excess tax benefits resulting from stock option exercise activity had the impact of lowering the effective tax rate by approximately 80 basis points and increasing earnings per share by $0.01, and for the first six months of 2018, the excess tax benefits resulting from stock option exercise activity had the impact of lowering the effective tax rate by approximately 100 basis points and increasing earnings per share by $0.02. Provision for income taxes for the second quarter and first six months of 2017 was at an effective tax rate of 20.1% and 21.9%, respectively. For the second quarter of 2017, the excess tax benefits resulting from stock option exercise activity had the impact of lowering the effective tax rate by approximately 660 basis points and increasing earnings per share by $0.07, and for the first six months of 2017, the excess tax benefits resulting from stock option exercise activity had the impact of lowering the effective tax rate by approximately 470 basis points and increasing earnings per share by $0.09. Excluding the effect of these items, the Adjusted Effective Tax Rate, a non-GAAP financial measure defined in the “Non-GAAP Financial Measures” section below, for the three and six months ended June 30, 2018 was 25.5%, and for the three and six months ended June 30, 2017 was 26.5%, as reconciled in the tables below to the comparable effective tax rate based on GAAP results. Refer to Note 14 of the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for further information related to income taxes.  
 In the first six months of 2018, the components of working capital as presented on the accompanying Condensed Consolidated Statements of Cash Flow increased $185.5, excluding the impact of acquisitions and foreign currency translation, primarily due to an increase in inventories of $80.0, accounts receivable of $44.5 and other current assets of $29.8 and a decrease in accrued liabilities, including income taxes, of $44.8, partially offset by an increase in accounts payable of $13.6. In the first six months of 2017, the components of working capital as presented on the accompanying Condensed Consolidated Statements of Cash Flow increased $115.8, excluding the impact of acquisitions and foreign currency translation, primarily due to an increase in inventories and other current assets of $86.4 and $38.8, respectively, and a decrease in income taxes payable of $45.0, partially offset by an increase in accounts payable of $62.1.  
 Intangible assets are included in Intangibles, net and other long-term assets in the accompanying Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. The amortization expense for the three months ended June 30, 2018 and 2017 was approximately $11.9 and $12.0, respectively. The amortization expense for the six months ended June 30, 2018 and 2017 was approximately $23.8 and $24.0, respectively. As of June 30, 2018, amortization expense relating to the Company’s current intangible assets estimated for the remainder of 2018 is approximately $23.2 and for each of the next five fiscal years is approximately $42.9 in 2019, $37.2 in 2020, $32.5 in 2021, $24.9 in 2022 and $22.2 in 2023.  
 For the three months ended June 30, 2018 and 2017, stock option exercise activity had the impact of lowering our Provision for income taxes by approximately $3.0 and $21.2, respectively, and lowering our effective tax rate by approximately 80 basis points and 660 basis points, respectively, due to the recognition of excess tax benefits within Provision for income taxes in the accompanying Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income. For the six months ended June 30, 2018 and 2017, stock option exercise activity had the impact of lowering our Provision for income taxes by approximately $7.1 and $29.2, respectively, and lowering our effective tax rate by approximately 100 basis points and 470 basis points, respectively.  
 In addition to cash flow from operating activities, the Company also considers Free Cash Flow, a non-GAAP financial measure defined in the “Non-GAAP Financial Measures” section below, as a key metric in measuring the Company’s ability to generate cash. The following table reconciles Free Cash Flow to its most directly comparable U.S. GAAP financial measure for the six months ended June 30, 2018 and 2017. The decrease in Free Cash Flow is primarily related to the decrease in operating cash flow during the first six months of 2018, which was primarily driven by (i) the voluntary cash contribution to fully fund the U.S. Plans of approximately $81.0 in January 2018, (ii) certain tax payments made during the first half of 2018 related to the Tax Act of approximately $54.0, including the first annual installment of the Transition Tax of approximately $18.0 and payments for foreign and state withholding and income taxes of approximately $36.0 related to foreign cash repatriated during the first half of 2018, and (iii) a higher usage of cash related to other changes in working capital as discussed above, along with an increase in capital expenditures to support certain new customer programs.
