Selling, general and administrative expenses increased to $248.3 or 11.8% of net sales and $722.5 or 11.9% of net sales for the third quarter and first nine months of 2019, respectively, compared to $244.0 or 11.5% of net sales and $710.6 or 11.9% of net sales for the third quarter and first nine months of 2018, respectively. Administrative expenses represented approximately 4.8% and 4.7% of net sales for the third quarter and first nine months of 2019, respectively, and represented approximately 4.6% and 4.8% of net sales for the third quarter and first nine months of 2018, respectively. Research and development expenses represented approximately 2.8% and 2.9% of net sales for the third quarter and first nine months of 2019, respectively, and represented approximately 2.6% and 2.7% of net sales for the third quarter and first nine months of 2018, respectively. Selling and marketing expenses represented approximately 4.2% and 4.4% of net sales for the third quarter and first nine months of 2019, respectively, and represented approximately 4.2% and 4.4% of net sales for the third quarter and first nine months of 2018, respectively. 
organically, compared to the third quarter of 2018. Net sales in the Cable Products and Solutions segment (approximately 5% of net sales) in the first nine months of 2019 decreased 10% in U.S. dollars, 8% in constant currencies and 9% organically, compared to the first nine months of 2018. The decrease in net sales in the Cable Products and Solutions segment was primarily due to a reduction in demand at broadband service providers.
Geographically, sales in the United States in the third quarter of 2019 increased approximately 17% in U.S. dollars ($667.9 in 2019 versus $572.0 in 2018) and 5% organically, compared to the third quarter of 2018, and increased approximately 12% in U.S. dollars ($1,879.6 in 2019 versus $1,675.3 in 2018) and 4% organically in the first nine months of 2019, compared to the first nine months of 2018. Foreign sales in the third quarter of 2019 decreased approximately 8% in U.S. dollars ($1,432.7 in 2019 versus $1,557.0 in 2018), 7% in constant currencies and 10% organically, compared to the third quarter of 2018, and decreased approximately 2% in U.S. dollars ($4,194.8 in 2019 versus $4,302.0 in 2018) and 3% organically, while remaining flat in constant currencies in the first nine months of 2019, compared to the first nine months of 2018. The comparatively stronger U.S. dollar for the third quarter and first nine months of 2019 had the effect of decreasing sales by approximately $23.6 and $112.2, respectively, compared to the same respective periods in 2018. 
Operating income was $413.6 or 19.7% of net sales and $1,189.4 or 19.6% of net sales for the third quarter and first nine months of 2019, respectively, compared to $444.2 or 20.9% of net sales and $1,229.3 or 20.6% of net sales for the third quarter and first nine months of 2018, respectively. Operating income for the first nine months of 2019 included $25.4 of acquisition-related expenses (separately presented in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income) comprised of the amortization of $15.7 related to the value associated with acquired backlog from two acquisitions, as well as external transaction costs of $9.7. For the nine months ended September 30, 2019, these acquisition-related expenses had the effect of decreasing net income by $21.0 or $0.07 per share. Excluding the effect of these acquisition-related expenses, Adjusted Operating Income and Adjusted Operating Margin, as defined in the “Non-GAAP Financial Measures” section below, was $1,214.8 or 20.0% of net sales for the nine months ended September 30, 2019. Operating income for the Interconnect Products and Assemblies segment for the third quarter and first nine months of 2019 was $433.9 or 21.7% of net sales and $1,272.4 or 22.0% of net sales, respectively, compared to $458.1 or 22.7% and $1,268.9 or 22.4% of net sales for the third quarter and first nine months of 2018, respectively. The slight decrease in operating margin for the Interconnect Products and Assemblies segment for the third quarter and first nine months of 2019, compared to the same respective periods in 2018, was primarily driven by normal downside conversion related to the organic decline in sales as well as the impact of recent acquisitions which currently have, on average, a lower operating margin than the average of the Interconnect Products and Assemblies segment for such periods. Operating income for the Cable Products and Solutions segment for the third quarter and first nine months of 2019 was $10.2 or 10.2% of net sales and $29.3 or 10.3% of net sales, respectively, compared to $14.4 or 13.1% of net sales and $40.4 or 12.7% of net sales for the third quarter and first nine months of 2018, respectively. The decrease in operating margin for the Cable Products and Solutions segment for the third quarter and first nine months of 2019, compared to the same respective periods in 2018, was primarily driven by lower volumes and product mix.
Net sales were $2,100.6 in the third quarter of 2019 compared to $2,129.0 in the third quarter of 2018, which represented a decrease of 1% in U.S. dollars and 6% organically, and flat in constant currencies over the same respective prior year period. Net sales were $6,074.4 in the first nine months of 2019 compared to $5,977.3 in the first nine months of 2018, which represented an increase of 2% in U.S. dollars and 4% in constant currencies, while decreasing 1% organically over the same respective prior year period. Net sales in the Interconnect Products and Assemblies segment (approximately 95% of net sales) in the third quarter of 2019 decreased 1% in U.S. dollars and 6% organically, and were flat in constant currencies compared to the third quarter of 2018. The decline in sales for the third quarter of 2019 relative to the same period of 2018 was driven by moderations in mobile devices, information technology and data communications, broadband communications, and mobile networks markets, offset in part by growth in the military, commercial aerospace, industrial and automotive markets, including contributions from the Company’s acquisition program. Net sales in the Interconnect Products and Assemblies segment (approximately 95% of net sales) in the first nine months of 2019 increased 2% in U.S. dollars and 4% in constant currencies, while decreasing 1% organically, compared to the first nine months of 2018. The sales growth in the first nine months of 2019 relative to the same period of 2018 was driven by growth in the military, commercial aerospace, mobile networks, industrial and automotive markets, including contributions from the Company’s acquisition program, offset in part by moderations in the mobile devices, broadband communications, and information technology and data communications markets. Net sales in the Cable Products and Solutions segment (approximately 5% of net sales) in the third quarter of 2019, which primarily serves the broadband communications market, decreased 9% in U.S. dollars, 8% in constant currencies and 10% 
During the first nine months of 2019, the Company completed eight acquisitions (including SSI) for $891.2, net of cash acquired. All but one of the acquisitions are included in the Interconnect Products and Assemblies segment. The Company is in the process of completing its analyses of the fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed. The

For the three months ended September 30, 2019 and 2018, stock option exercise activity had the impact of lowering our Provision for income taxes by approximately $1.6 and $7.0, respectively, and lowering our effective tax rate by approximately 40 basis points and 170 basis points, respectively, due to the recognition of excess tax benefits within Provision for income taxes in the accompanying Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income. For the nine months ended September 30, 2019 and 2018, stock option exercise activity had the impact of lowering our Provision for income taxes by approximately $21.3 and $14.1, respectively, and lowering our effective tax rate by approximately 190 basis points and 120 basis points, respectively. In addition, during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2019, the loss on early extinguishment of debt also had the effect of increasing the effective tax rate by approximately 40 basis points and 10 basis points, respectively.
The following describes the significant changes in the amounts as presented on the accompanying Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets at September 30, 2019 as compared to December 31, 2018. Accounts receivable decreased $102.7 to $1,689.1, primarily due to lower sales as well as the effect of translation from exchange rate changes at September 30, 2019 compared to December 31, 2018 (“Translation”), partially offset by the impact of acquisitions. Days sales outstanding at September 30, 2019 and December 31, 2018 were approximately 72 and 73 days, respectively.  Inventories increased $39.7 to $1,273.5, primarily due to the impact of acquisitions, partially offset by lower inventory levels resulting from lower sales activity and Translation. Inventory days at September 30, 2019 and December 31, 2018 were 79 and 74 days, respectively. Property, plant and equipment, net, increased $89.4 to $965.2, primarily due to capital expenditures of $223.0 and the impact of acquisitions, partially offset by depreciation of $178.1 and Translation. Goodwill increased $646.8 to $4,750.0, primarily as a result of goodwill recognized related to acquisitions that closed during the first nine months of 2019, which was partially offset by Translation. Intangibles, net and other long-term assets increased $241.9 to $736.2, primarily due to (i) the adoption of the new lease standard (“Topic 842”) described in Note 15 of the accompanying Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements, which resulted in the recognition of $185.5 of operating lease right-of-use assets as of September 30, 2019 and (ii) the recognition of certain intangible assets related to the SSI acquisition and other 2019 acquisitions, partially offset by (iii) the amortization of $54.0 related to the Company’s intangible assets during the nine months ended September 30, 2019. Accounts payable decreased $59.8 to $830.7, primarily due to less purchasing activity resulting from lower sales activity and Translation, partially offset by the impact of acquisitions. Payable days at September 30, 2019 and December 31, 2018 were approximately 52 and 53 days, respectively. Total accrued expenses, including accrued income taxes, increased $91.7 to $888.2, primarily as a result of the adoption of Topic 842, which resulted in the recognition of $53.6 of current operating lease liabilities as of September 30, 2019, and the impact of acquisitions, partially offset by certain tax payments. Other long-term liabilities, including deferred taxes, increased $95.7 to $628.5, primarily as a result of the adoption of Topic 842, which resulted in the recognition of $132.9 of long-term operating lease liabilities as of September 30, 2019, partially offset by a decrease in deferred income tax liabilities.
Net income attributable to Amphenol Corporation and Net income per common share-Diluted (“Diluted EPS”) were $280.3 and $0.92, respectively, for the third quarter of 2019, compared to $316.6 and $1.01, respectively, for the third quarter of 2018. Excluding the effect of the excess tax benefits related to stock-based compensation and the refinancing-related costs associated with the early extinguishment of debt in the third quarter of 2019, Adjusted Net Income

closed during the period. The amortization expense for the three months ended September 30, 2019 and 2018 was approximately $13.6 and $11.6, respectively. The amortization expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2019 and 2018 was approximately $54.0 and $35.4, respectively. Amortization expense during the nine months ended September 30, 2019 includes $15.7 related to the amortization of acquired backlog, primarily associated with the SSI acquisition. As of September 30, 2019, amortization expense relating to the Company’s current intangible assets estimated for the remainder of 2019 is approximately $13.1 and for each of the next five fiscal years is approximately $48.4 in 2020, $43.8 in 2021, $36.6 in 2022, $33.9 in 2023 and $28.8 in 2024.
The Company’s primary sources of liquidity are internally generated cash flow, our cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments on hand, the Commercial Paper Programs, and the 2019 Revolving Credit Facility. The Company believes that its cash, cash equivalents and short-term investment position on hand, ability to generate future cash flow from operations, availability under its credit facilities, and access to capital markets (including the issuances of the 2029 Senior Notes in January 2019 and the 2030 Senior Notes in September 2019, discussed further within this Item 2) provide adequate liquidity to meet its obligations for at least the next twelve months.
In addition to cash flow from operating activities, the Company also considers Free Cash Flow, a non-GAAP financial measure defined in the “Non-GAAP Financial Measures” section below, as a key metric in measuring the Company’s ability to generate cash. The following table reconciles Free Cash Flow to its most directly comparable U.S. GAAP financial measure for the nine months ended September 30, 2019 and 2018. The increase in Free Cash Flow is driven by an increase in Operating Cash Flow, as described above.Item 5. Other InformationItem 1. Legal Proceedings
