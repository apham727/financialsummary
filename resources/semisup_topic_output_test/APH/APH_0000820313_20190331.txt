 Selling, general and administrative expenses increased to $235.1 or 12.0% of net sales for the first quarter of 2019, compared to $230.0 or 12.3% of net sales for the first quarter of 2018. Administrative expenses represented approximately 4.5% of net sales for the first quarter of 2019 and represented approximately 5.0% of net sales for the first quarter of 2018. Research and development expenses represented approximately 3.0% of net sales for the first quarter of 2019 and represented 2.8% of net sales for first quarter of 2018. Selling and marketing expenses represented approximately 4.5% of net sales for the first quarter of 2019 and represented approximately 4.5% of net sales for the first quarter of 2018.   
 Net sales were $1,958.5 in the first quarter of 2019 compared to $1,866.9 in the first quarter of 2018, which represented an increase of 5% in U.S. dollars, 8% in constant currencies and 5% organically over the same respective prior year period. Net sales in the Interconnect Products and Assemblies segment (approximately 95% of net sales) in the first quarter of 2019 increased 5% in U.S. dollars, 8% in constant currencies and 5% organically, compared to the first quarter of 2018. The sales growth was driven by increases in the information technology and data communications, industrial, military, commercial aerospace and mobile networks markets, arising primarily from organic growth along with contributions from the Company’s acquisitions, which was partially offset by a decrease in the mobile device market and a small decrease in the automotive market. Net sales in the Cable Products and Solutions segment (approximately 5% of net sales) in the first quarter of 2019, which primarily serves the broadband market, decreased 1% in U.S. dollars, while increasing 2% in constant currencies and 2% organically, compared to the first quarter of 2018.  
 Geographically, sales in the United States in the first quarter of 2019 increased approximately 10% in U.S. dollars ($578.9 in 2019 versus $527.0 in 2018) and 5% organically, compared to the first quarter of 2018. Foreign sales in the first quarter of 2019 increased approximately 3% in U.S. dollars ($1,379.6 in 2019 versus $1,339.9 in 2018), 6% in constant currencies and 4% organically, compared to the first quarter of 2018. The comparatively stronger U.S. dollar for the first quarter of 2019 had the effect of decreasing sales by approximately $46.6, compared to the same period in 2018.   
 Operating income was $376.2 or 19.2% of net sales for the first quarter of 2019, compared to $376.9 or 20.2% of net sales for the first quarter of 2018. Operating income for the first three months of 2019 included $16.5 of acquisition-related expenses (separately presented in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income) comprised of the amortization of $12.5 related to the value associated with acquired backlog from the SSI acquisition, as well as external transaction costs of $4.0. These expenses had the effect of decreasing net income by $13.2 or $0.04 per share for the three months ended March 31, 2019. Excluding the effect of these acquisition-related expenses, Adjusted Operating Income and Adjusted Operating Margin, as defined in the “Non-GAAP Financial Measures” section below, was $392.7 or 20.1% of net sales for the three months ended March 31, 2019. Operating income for the Interconnect Products and Assemblies segment for the first quarter of 2019 was $410.0 or 22.0% of net sales compared to $391.1 or 22.1% of net sales for the first quarter of 2018. Operating income for the Cable Products and Solutions segment for the first quarter of 2019 was $10.5 or 10.9% of net sales, compared to $11.3 or 11.7% of net sales for the first quarter of 2018. The decrease in operating margin for the Cable Products and Solutions segment for the first quarter of 2019, compared to the same respective period of 2018, was primarily driven by product mix.  
 Excluded from the computations above were anti-dilutive common shares of 6.3 million and nil for the three months ended March 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively.  
 Net cash used in investing activities was $475.1 in the first quarter of 2019, compared to $142.3 in the first quarter of 2018. In the first quarter of 2019, net cash used in investing activities was driven primarily by the use of $399.3 in cash to fund acquisitions, capital expenditures (net of disposals) of $70.2, and net purchases of short-term investments of $5.6. In the first quarter of 2018, net cash used in investing activities was driven primarily by the use of $99.5 in cash to fund acquisitions, along with capital expenditures (net of disposals) of $54.1, partially offset by net sales and maturities of short-term investments of $11.3.   
closed in January 2019. Days sales outstanding at March 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018 were approximately 78 and 73 days, respectively.  Inventories decreased $9.4 to $1,224.4, primarily due to lower inventory levels resulting from lower sales activity, partially offset by Translation and the impact of the SSI acquisition. Inventory days at March 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018 were 84 and 74 days, respectively. Property, plant and equipment, net, increased $56.2 to $932.0, primarily due to capital expenditures of $74.5 and the impact of the SSI acquisition, partially offset by depreciation of $59.4. Goodwill increased $336.7 to $4,439.9, primarily as a result of goodwill recognized related to the SSI acquisition, which was partially offset by Translation. Intangibles, net and other long-term assets increased $214.4 to $708.7, primarily due to (i) the adoption of the new lease standard (“Topic 842”) described in Note 15 of the accompanying Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements, which resulted in the recognition of $179.6 of operating lease right-of-use assets as of March 31, 2019 and (ii) the recognition of certain intangible assets related to the SSI acquisition, partially offset by (iii) the amortization of $24.8 related to the Company’s intangible assets. Accounts payable decreased $93.4 to $797.1, primarily due to less purchasing activity resulting from lower sales activity, partially offset by the impact from the SSI acquisition and Translation. Payable days at March 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018 were approximately 55 and 53 days, respectively. Total accrued expenses, including accrued income taxes, increased $49.6 to $846.1, primarily as a result of the adoption of Topic 842, which resulted in the recognition of $62.7 of current operating lease liabilities as of March 31, 2019, which was partially offset by certain tax payments. Other long-term liabilities increased $114.6 to $391.8, primarily as a result of the adoption of Topic 842, which resulted in the recognition of approximately $117.4 of long-term operating lease liabilities as of March 31, 2019.  
 In addition to cash flow from operating activities, the Company also considers Free Cash Flow, a non-GAAP financial measure defined in the “Non-GAAP Financial Measures” section below, as a key metric in measuring the Company’s ability to generate cash. The following table reconciles Free Cash Flow to its most directly comparable U.S. GAAP financial measure for the three months ended March 31, 2019 and 2018. The increase in Free Cash Flow is primarily driven by an increase in Operating Cash Flow, as described above, which was partially offset by an increase in capital expenditures to support certain new customer programs.  
 The increase in goodwill, net of foreign currency translation, during the first three months of 2019 is primarily due to the acquisition of SSI in January 2019, which is included in the Interconnect Products and Assemblies segment.  
 While the Company typically offers standard product warranty coverage which provides assurance that our products will conform to the contractually agreed-upon specifications for a limited period from the date of shipment, the Company’s warranty liabilities and related warranty expense have not been and were not material in the accompanying Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements as of March 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018, and for the three months ended March 31, 2019 and 2018.  
was primarily due to intangible assets acquired as a result of the SSI acquisition. The amortization expense for the three months ended March 31, 2019 and 2018 was approximately $24.8 and $11.9, respectively. The amortization expense during the first three months of 2019 includes $12.5 related to the amortization of acquired backlog. As of March 31, 2019, amortization expense relating to the Company’s current intangible assets estimated for the remainder of 2019 is approximately $35.1 and for each of the next five fiscal years is approximately $41.8 in 2020, $37.1 in 2021, $29.7 in 2022, $27.0 in 2023 and $23.9 in 2024.  
   ·    Adjusted Operating Margin is defined as Adjusted Operating Income (as defined above) expressed as a percentage of Net sales (as reported in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income). 
 The following describes the significant changes in the amounts as presented on the accompanying Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets at March 31, 2019 as compared to December 31, 2018. Accounts receivable decreased $129.9 to $1,661.9, primarily due to lower sales in the first quarter of 2019 relative to the fourth quarter of 2018, partially offset by the effect of translation from exchange rate changes at March 31, 2019 compared to December 31, 2018 (“Translation”) and the impact of the SSI acquisition in the Interconnect Products and Assemblies segment that
