 Selling, general and administrative expenses increased to $244.0 or 11.5% of net sales and $710.6 or 11.9% of net sales for the third quarter and first nine months of 2018, respectively, compared to $228.2 or 12.4% of net sales and $642.4 or 12.7% of net sales for the third quarter and first nine months of 2017, respectively. Administrative expenses represented approximately 4.6% and 4.8% of net sales for the third quarter and first nine months of 2018, respectively, and represented approximately 4.8% and 4.9% of net sales for the third quarter and first nine months of 2017, respectively. Research and development expenses represented approximately 2.6% and 2.7% of net sales for the third quarter and first nine months of 2018, respectively, and represented 2.8% of net sales for both the third quarter and first nine months of 2017. Selling and marketing expenses represented approximately 4.2% and 4.4% of net sales for the third quarter and first nine months of 2018, respectively, and represented approximately 4.8% and 5.0% of net sales for the third quarter and first nine months of 2017, respectively.   
 Operating income was $444.2 or 20.9% of net sales and $1,229.3 or 20.6% of net sales for the third quarter and first nine months of 2018, respectively, compared to $377.9 or 20.5% of net sales and $1,028.2 or 20.3% of net sales for the third quarter and first nine months of 2017, respectively. Operating income for the first nine months of 2017 included $4.0 of acquisition-related expenses (separately presented in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income) related to external transaction costs incurred in the second quarter of 2017. These expenses had an impact on net income of $3.7 or $0.01 per share for the nine months ended September 30, 2017. Excluding the effect of these acquisition-related expenses, Adjusted Operating Income and Adjusted Operating Margin, as defined in the “Non-GAAP Financial Measures” section below, was $1,032.2 or 20.4% of net sales for the nine months ended September 30, 2017. The increase in the Adjusted Operating Margin for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2018, compared to the same respective periods in 2017, was driven primarily by an increase in operating margin for the Interconnect Products and Assemblies segment. Operating income for the Interconnect Products and Assemblies segment for the third quarter and first nine months of 2018 was $458.1 or 22.7% of net sales and $1,268.9 or 22.4% of net sales, respectively, compared to $388.3 or 22.4% of net sales and $1,060.8 or 22.3% of net sales for the third quarter and first nine months of 2017, respectively. The increase in operating margin for the Interconnect Products and Assemblies segment for the third quarter and first nine months of 2018, compared to the same respective periods of 2017, resulted primarily from higher sales volumes combined with strong operating execution. Operating income for the Cable Products and Solutions segment for the third quarter and first nine months of 2018 was $14.4 or 13.1% of net sales and $40.4 or 12.7% of net sales, respectively, compared to $14.3 or 13.1% of net sales and $44.0 or 14.0% of net sales for the third quarter and first nine months of 2017, respectively. The decrease in operating margin for the Cable Products and Solutions segment for the first nine months of 2018, compared to the same respective period of 2017, was primarily driven by increases in certain commodity costs.  
 Geographically, sales in the United States in the third quarter of 2018 increased approximately 14% in U.S. dollars ($572.0 in 2018 versus $502.7 in 2017) and 12% organically, compared to the third quarter of 2017, and increased 17% in U.S. dollars ($1,675.3 in 2018 versus $1,437.1 in 2017) and 12% organically in the first nine months of 2018, compared to the first nine months of 2017. Foreign sales in the third quarter of 2018 increased approximately 16% in U.S. dollars ($1,557.0 in 2018 versus $1,338.1 in 2017), 17% in constant currencies and 16% organically, compared to the third quarter of 2017, and increased 19% in U.S. dollars ($4,302.0 in 2018 versus $3,630.3 in 2017), 16% in constant currencies and 14% organically in the first nine months of 2018, compared to the first nine months of 2017. The comparatively stronger U.S. dollar for the third quarter of 2018 had the effect of decreasing sales by approximately $15.6, compared to the same period in 2017. The comparatively weaker U.S. dollar for the first nine months of 2018 had the effect of increasing sales by approximately $87.2, compared to the same period in 2017.   
 Net sales were $2,129.0 in the third quarter of 2018 compared to $1,840.8 in the third quarter of 2017, which represented an increase of 16% in U.S. dollars, 17% in constant currencies and 15% organically over the same respective prior year period. Net sales were $5,977.3 in the first nine months of 2018 compared to $5,067.4 in the first nine months of 2017, which represented an increase of 18% in U.S. dollars, 16% in constant currencies and 13% organically over the same respective prior year period. Net sales in the Interconnect Products and Assemblies segment (approximately 95% of net sales) in the third quarter of 2018 increased 17% in U.S. dollars, 17% in constant currencies and 15% organically, compared to the third quarter of 2017 and in the first nine months of 2018 increased 19% in U.S. dollars, 17% in constant currencies and 14% organically, compared to the first nine months of 2017. The sales growth in both periods was driven by increases in the mobile devices, military, information technology and data communications, industrial, mobile networks, automotive and commercial aerospace markets, arising primarily from organic growth along with 
contributions from the Company’s acquisitions. Net sales in the Cable Products and Solutions segment (approximately 5% of net sales) in the third quarter of 2018, which primarily serves the broadband market, was flat in U.S. dollars, and increased 4% in constant currencies and 4% organically, compared to the third quarter of 2017 and in the first nine months of 2018 increased 2% in U.S. dollars, 3% in constant currencies and 3% organically, compared to the same period in 2017.  
 The ability to generate cash from operating activities is one of the Company’s fundamental financial strengths. Cash flow provided by operating activities was $734.5 in the first nine months of 2018 compared to $716.4 in the first nine months of 2017. The increase in cash flow provided by operating activities (“Operating Cash Flow”) for the first nine months of 2018 compared to the first nine months of 2017 is primarily related to an increase in net income in the first nine months of 2018 which was partially offset by (i) the Company’s voluntary cash contribution of approximately $81.0 in the first quarter of 2018 to fully fund its U.S. defined benefit pension plans (“U.S. Plans”, and together with its foreign plans, the “Plans”) and (ii) certain tax payments made during the first nine months of 2018 related to the Tax Act of approximately $61.0, including the first annual installment of the Transition Tax of approximately $18.0 in the second quarter of 2018 and payments for foreign and state withholding and income taxes of approximately $43.0 related to foreign cash repatriated during the first nine months of 2018.   
 Interest expense for the third quarter and first nine months of 2018 was $24.8 and $75.3, respectively, compared to $24.6 and $67.3 for the third quarter and first nine months of 2017, respectively. The increase in interest expense for the first nine months of 2018 is primarily due to higher average interest rates associated with the Company’s commercial paper borrowings as well as the senior note issuances in April 2017, along with higher average debt levels used to fund the Company’s dividend and stock buyback programs.  
 The following describes the significant changes in the amounts as presented on the accompanying Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets at September 30, 2018 as compared to December 31, 2017. Accounts receivable increased $139.0 to $1,737.6, primarily due to higher sales in the third quarter of 2018 relative to the fourth quarter of 2017, which were partially offset by the effect of translation from exchange rate changes at September 30, 2018 compared to December 31, 2017 (“Translation”). Days sales outstanding at September 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017 were approximately 73 days.  Inventories increased $138.6 to $1,245.5, primarily to support higher sales levels, partially offset by Translation. Inventory days at September 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017 were 78 and 76 days, respectively. Other current assets increased $81.8 to $278.6, primarily due to the increase in other receivables as well as the recording of contract assets of $27.9 as of September 30, 2018 as a result of the adoption of Topic 606. Property, plant and equipment, net, increased $69.6 to $886.4, primarily due to capital additions of $253.6, partially offset by depreciation of $155.3 and Translation. Goodwill increased $71.1 to $4,113.7, primarily as a result of goodwill recognized related to three acquisitions in the Interconnect Products and Assemblies segment that closed during the first nine months of 2018, which was partially offset by Translation. Intangibles, net and other long-term assets decreased $27.5 to $461.0, primarily as a result of amortization related to the Company’s intangible assets. Accounts payable increased $138.4 to $1,014.0, primarily as a result of increased purchasing activity due to higher sales levels, which was partially offset by payments on outstanding payables and Translation. Payable days at September 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017 were 
 In the past twelve months, the Company has completed several acquisitions, including three acquisitions which closed in the first nine months of 2018, all in the Interconnect Products and Assemblies segment. The Company is in the process of completing its analyses of the fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed. The Company anticipates that the final assessments of values will not differ materially from the preliminary assessments. These acquisitions were not material to the Company either individually or in the aggregate.   
   ·    Adjusted Operating Margin is defined as Adjusted Operating Income (as defined above) expressed as a percentage of Net sales (as reported in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income). 
 In addition to cash flow from operating activities, the Company also considers Free Cash Flow, a non-GAAP financial measure defined in the “Non-GAAP Financial Measures” section below, as a key metric in measuring the Company’s ability to generate cash. The following table reconciles Free Cash Flow to its most directly comparable U.S. GAAP financial measure for the nine months ended September 30, 2018 and 2017. The decrease in Free Cash Flow is primarily driven by an increase in capital expenditures to support certain new customer programs, which was partially offset by an increase in operating cash flow, as described above.

 Net cash used in financing activities was $1,068.6 in the first nine months of 2018, compared to $47.7 in the first nine months of 2017. For the first nine months of 2018, cash used in financing activities was driven primarily by repurchases of the Company’s common stock of $680.2, net repayments of commercial paper and other debt of $308.8, dividend payments of $184.4, and purchases of and distributions to noncontrolling interests of $17.9, partially offset by cash proceeds from the exercise of stock options of $123.0. For the first nine months of 2017, cash used in financing activities was driven primarily by repurchases of the Company’s common stock of $555.6, the repayment of the 1.55% Senior Notes in September 2017 of $375.0, dividend payments of $147.1, purchases of and distributions to noncontrolling interests of $22.1, and payments of costs related to the issuances of two senior notes of $5.2, partially 
 The Company’s primary sources of liquidity are internally generated cash flow, the Commercial Paper Programs, the Revolving Credit Facility, and its cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments on hand. The Company believes that its cash, cash equivalents and short-term investment position on hand, ability to generate future cash flow from operations, availability under its credit facilities, and access to capital markets (including the issuance of the new 2028 
 Standard product warranty coverage which provides assurance that our products will conform to the contractually agreed-upon specifications for a limited period from the date of shipment is typically offered, while extended or separately-priced warranty coverage is typically not offered. The warranty claim is generally limited to a credit equal to the purchase price or a promise to repair or replace the product for a specified period of time at no additional charge. We estimate our warranty liability based on historical experience, product history, and current trends, and record warranty expense in cost of sales in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income. Warranty liabilities and related warranty expense have not been and were not significant in the accompanying Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements as of and for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2018.
