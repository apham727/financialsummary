Selling, general and administrative expenses increased to $239.2 or 11.9% of net sales and $474.3 or 11.9% of net sales for the second quarter and first six months of 2019, respectively, compared to $236.6 or 11.9% of net sales and $466.6 or 12.1% of net sales for the second quarter and first six months of 2018, respectively. Administrative expenses represented approximately 4.6% of net sales for both the second quarter and first six months of 2019, and represented approximately 4.8% and 4.9% of net sales for the second quarter and first six months of 2018, respectively. Research and development expenses represented approximately 2.9% of net sales for both the second quarter and first six months of 2019, and represented approximately 2.8% of net sales for both the second quarter and first six months of 2018. Selling and marketing expenses represented approximately 4.4% of net sales for both the second quarter and first six months of 2019, and represented approximately 4.4% and 4.5% of net sales for the second quarter and first six months of 2018, respectively. 
Geographically, sales in the United States in the second quarter of 2019 increased approximately 10% in U.S. dollars ($632.8 in 2019 versus $576.3 in 2018) with flat organic growth, compared to the second quarter of 2018, and increased approximately 10% in U.S. dollars ($1,211.7 in 2019 versus $1,103.3 in 2018) and 3% organically in the first six months of 2019, compared to the first six months of 2018. Foreign sales in the second quarter of 2019 decreased approximately 2% in U.S. dollars ($1,382.5 in 2019 versus $1,405.1 in 2018) and 2% organically, while increasing 1% in constant currencies, compared to the second quarter of 2018, and increased approximately 1% in U.S. dollars ($2,762.1 in 2019 versus $2,745.0 in 2018), 4% in constant currencies and 1% organically in the first six months of 2019, compared to the first six months of 2018. The comparatively stronger U.S. dollar for the second quarter and first six months of 2019 had the effect of decreasing sales by approximately $41.9 and $88.6, respectively, compared to the same respective periods in 2018. 
19% in U.S. dollars, 17% in constant currencies and 18% organically, compared to the second quarter of 2018. Net sales in the Cable Products and Solutions segment (approximately 5% of net sales) in the first six months of 2019 decreased 11% in U.S. dollars, 8% in constant currencies and 8% organically, compared to the first six months of 2018. The decrease in net sales in the Cable Products and Solutions segment was primarily due to a reduction in demand at broadband service providers.
Net sales were $2,015.3 in the second quarter of 2019 compared to $1,981.4 in the second quarter of 2018, which represented an increase of 2% in U.S. dollars and 4% in constant currencies, and a decrease of 1% organically over the same respective prior year period. Net sales were $3,973.8 in the first six months of 2019 compared to $3,848.3 in the first six months of 2018, which represented an increase of 3% in U.S. dollars, 6% in constant currencies and 2% organically over the same respective prior year period. Net sales in the Interconnect Products and Assemblies segment (approximately 96% of net sales) in the second quarter of 2019 increased 3% in U.S. dollars and 5% in constant currencies, with flat organic growth, compared to the second quarter of 2018. The sales growth in the second quarter of 2019 relative to the same period of 2018 was driven by contributions from the Company’s acquisition program, with growth in the military, commercial aerospace, mobile networks and mobile devices markets, offset in part by moderations in the broadband, industrial, and information technology and data communications markets. Net sales in the Interconnect Products and Assemblies segment (approximately 95% of net sales) in the first six months of 2019 increased 4% in U.S. dollars, 6% in constant currencies and 2% organically, compared to the first six months of 2018. The sales growth for the first six months of 2019 relative to the same period of 2018 was driven by growth in the military, commercial aerospace, mobile networks, information technology and data communications, and industrial markets including contributions from the Company’s acquisition program, offset in part by moderations in the broadband, mobile devices and automotive markets. Net sales in the Cable Products and Solutions segment (approximately 4% of net sales) in the second quarter of 2019, which primarily serves the broadband market, decreased 
Operating income was $399.5 or 19.8% of net sales and $775.7 or 19.5% of net sales for the second quarter and first six months of 2019, respectively, compared to $408.2 or 20.6% of net sales and $785.1 or 20.4% of net sales for the second quarter and first six months of 2018, respectively. Operating income for the second quarter of 2019 included $8.9 of acquisition-related expenses (separately presented in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income) comprised primarily of external transaction costs of $5.7, as well as the amortization of $3.2 related to the value associated with acquired backlog from an acquisition which closed in the second quarter of 2019. Operating income for the first six months of 2019 included $25.4 of acquisition-related expenses (separately presented in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income) comprised of the amortization of $15.7 related to the value associated with acquired backlog from two acquisitions, as well as external transaction costs of $9.7. For the three and six months ended June 30, 2019, these acquisition-related expenses had the effect of decreasing net income by $7.8 or $0.03 per share and $21.0 or $0.07 per share, respectively. Excluding the effect of these acquisition-related expenses, Adjusted Operating Income and Adjusted Operating Margin, as defined in the “Non-GAAP Financial Measures” section below, was $408.4 or 20.3% of net sales and $801.1 or 20.2% of net sales for the three and six months ended June 30, 2019, respectively. Operating income for the Interconnect Products and Assemblies segment for the second quarter and first six months of 2019 was $428.4 or 22.2% of net sales and $838.5 or 22.1% of net sales, respectively, compared to $419.7 or 22.4% and $810.9 or 22.3% of net sales for the second quarter and first six months of 2018, respectively. The slight decrease in operating margin for the Interconnect Products and Assemblies segment for the second quarter and first six months of 2019, compared to the same respective periods in 2018, was primarily driven by the impact of recent acquisitions which currently have, on average, a lower operating margin than the average of the Interconnect Products and Assemblies segment for such periods. Operating income for the Cable Products and Solutions segment for the second quarter and first six months of 2019 was $8.7 or 9.7% of net sales and $19.1 or 10.3% of net sales, respectively, compared to $14.7 or 13.2% of net sales and $26.0 or 12.5% of net sales for the second quarter and first six months of 2018, respectively. The decrease in operating margin for the Cable Products and Solutions segment for the second quarter and first six months of 2019, compared to the same respective periods in 2018, was primarily driven by lower volumes and product mix.
Excluded from the computations above were anti-dilutive common shares of 7.7 million and 1.5 million for the three months ended June 30, 2019 and 2018, respectively. Excluded from the computations above were anti-dilutive common shares of 7.1 million and 0.9 million for the six months ended June 30, 2019 and 2018, respectively.
The ability to generate cash from operating activities is one of the Company’s fundamental financial strengths. Cash flow provided by operating activities was $666.0 in the first six months of 2019 compared to $395.3 in the first six months of 2018.  The increase in cash flow provided by operating activities (“Operating Cash Flow”) for the first six months of 2019 compared to the first six months of 2018 is primarily related to a lower usage of cash related to the change in working capital. In addition, Operating Cash Flow for the first six months of 2018 included the Company’s voluntary cash contribution of approximately $81.0 during that period to fund its U.S. defined benefit pension plans (“U.S. Plans”, and together with its foreign plans, the “Plans”), while no such voluntary cash contributions to the U.S. Plans were made in the first six months of 2019. 
six months of 2018. Excluding the effect of the excess tax benefits related to stock-based compensation and acquisition-related expenses discussed above, Adjusted Net Income attributable to Amphenol Corporation and Adjusted Diluted EPS were $557.3 and $1.81, respectively, for the first six months of 2019, compared to $543.3 and $1.73, respectively, for the first six months of 2018.
Intangible assets are included in Intangibles, net and other long-term assets in the accompanying Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. The increase in the carrying amounts of intangible assets during the first six months of 2019 was primarily due to intangible assets acquired as a result of the SSI acquisition, along with the other acquisitions closed during the period. The amortization expense for the three months ended June 30, 2019 and 2018 was approximately $15.6 and $11.9, respectively. The amortization expense for the six months ended June 30, 2019 and 2018 was approximately $40.4 and $23.8, respectively. Amortization expense during the three and six months ended June 30, 2019 includes $3.2 and $15.7, respectively, related to the amortization of acquired backlog, primarily related to the SSI acquisition. As of June 30, 2019, amortization expense relating to the Company’s current intangible assets estimated for the remainder of 2019 is approximately $25.6 and for each of the next five fiscal years is approximately $46.8 in 2020, $42.1 in 2021, $34.8 in 2022, $32.0 in 2023 and $28.5 in 2024.
resulting from lower sales activity. Inventory days at June 30, 2019 and December 31, 2018 were 83 and 74 days, respectively. Property, plant and equipment, net, increased $94.2 to $970.0, primarily due to capital expenditures of $149.9 and the impact of acquisitions, partially offset by depreciation of $120.5. Goodwill increased $602.9 to $4,706.1, primarily as a result of goodwill recognized related to acquisitions that closed during the first six months of 2019, which was partially offset by Translation. Intangibles, net and other long-term assets increased $241.5 to $735.8, primarily due to (i) the adoption of the new lease standard (“Topic 842”) described in Note 15 of the accompanying Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements, which resulted in the recognition of $178.9 of operating lease right-of-use assets as of June 30, 2019 and (ii) the recognition of certain intangible assets related to the SSI acquisition and other 2019 acquisitions, partially offset by (iii) the amortization of $40.4 related to the Company’s intangible assets during the six months ended June 30, 2019. Accounts payable decreased $75.9 to $814.6, primarily due to less purchasing activity resulting from lower sales activity, partially offset by the impact of acquisitions as well as Translation. Payable days at June 30, 2019 and December 31, 2018 were approximately 53 days. Total accrued expenses, including accrued income taxes, increased $38.7 to $835.2, primarily as a result of the adoption of Topic 842, which resulted in the recognition of $58.6 of current operating lease liabilities as of June 30, 2019, and the impact of acquisitions, partially offset by certain tax payments. Other long-term liabilities increased $90.9 to $623.7, primarily as a result of the adoption of Topic 842, which resulted in the recognition of approximately $121.7 of long-term operating lease liabilities as of June 30, 2019, partially offset by a decrease in deferred income tax liabilities.
During the first six months of 2019, the Company completed five acquisitions (including SSI) for $756.2, net of cash acquired. All but one of the acquisitions are included in the Interconnect Products and Assemblies segment. The Company is in the process of completing its analyses of the fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed. The Company anticipates that the final assessments of values will not differ materially from the preliminary assessments. These acquisitions were not material to the Company either individually or in the aggregate. 
●Adjusted Operating Margin is defined as Adjusted Operating Income (as defined above) expressed as a percentage of Net sales (as reported in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income).
The following describes the significant changes in the amounts as presented on the accompanying Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets at June 30, 2019 as compared to December 31, 2018. Accounts receivable decreased $106.8 to $1,685.0, primarily due to lower sales, partially offset by the impact of acquisitions, as well as the effect of translation from exchange rate changes at June 30, 2019 compared to December 31, 2018 (“Translation”). Days sales outstanding at June 30, 2019 and December 31, 2018 were approximately 75 and 73 days, respectively.  Inventories increased $41.5 to $1,275.3, primarily due to the impact of acquisitions, partially offset by lower inventory levels

The Company is cooperating with the request. The inquiry remains in the early stages and the Company is unable to estimate the timing or outcome of the matter.
In addition to cash flow from operating activities, the Company also considers Free Cash Flow, a non-GAAP financial measure defined in the “Non-GAAP Financial Measures” section below, as a key metric in measuring the Company’s ability to generate cash. The following table reconciles Free Cash Flow to its most directly comparable U.S. GAAP financial measure for the six months ended June 30, 2019 and 2018. The increase in Free Cash Flow is driven by an increase in Operating Cash Flow, as described above.Item 5. Other InformationItem 1. Legal Proceedings
