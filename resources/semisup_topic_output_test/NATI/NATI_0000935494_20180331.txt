Software development costs capitalized for the three month periods ended March 31, 2018 and 2017 were $8.0 million and $12.0 million, respectively, and related amortization expense was $6.2 million and $5.3 million, respectively. Capitalized software development costs for the three month periods ended March 31, 2018 and 2017 included costs related to stock based compensation of $0.3 million and $0.4 million, respectively. 
There can be no assurance that we will be able to compete successfully in the future. 
We Make Significant Investments in New Products that May Not Be Successful or Achieve Expected Returns. We plan to continue to make significant investments in research, development, and marketing for new and existing products and technologies. For example, in 2017 we launched LabVIEW NXG, the most recent version of our flagship software application. We have made and expect to make significant investments in software development related to the new and enhanced features of this product. These investments involve a number of risks as the commercial success of such efforts depend on many factors, including our ability to anticipate and respond to innovation, achieve the desired technological fit, and be effective with our marketing and distribution efforts. If our existing or potential customers do not perceive our latest product offerings as providing significant new functionality or value, or if we are late to market with a new product or technology, we may not achieve our expected return on 
Our earnings in Hungary are subject to a statutory tax rate of 9%. In addition, our research and development activities in Hungary benefit from a tax law in Hungary that provides for an enhanced deduction for qualified research and development expenses. The tax position of our Hungarian operations resulted in income tax benefits of $1.7 million and $2.9 million for the three month periods ended March 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively.
We Operate in Intensely Competitive Markets. The markets in which we operate are characterized by intense competition from numerous competitors, some of which are divisions of large corporations having far greater resources than we have, and we may face further competition from new market entrants in the future. A key competitor is Keysight Technologies Inc. (“Keysight”) which was part of Agilent until November 2014. Keysight offers hardware and software products that provide solutions that directly compete with our virtual instrumentation products including its own line of PXI based hardware. Keysight is aggressively advertising and marketing products that are competitive with our products. Because of Keysight’s strong position in the instrumentation business, changes in its marketing strategy or product offerings could have a material adverse effect on our operating results. 
Moreover, there can be no assurance that our international sales will continue at existing levels or grow in accordance with our efforts to increase foreign market penetration.

Since the first quarter of 2017, we have been taking steps to reduce our overall employee headcount in an effort to minimize job duplication or evaluate where we should shift and centralize activities, improve efficiencies, and rebalance our resources on higher return activities. The timing and scope of our headcount reductions will vary. 
We have operations in over 50 countries. Sales outside of the Americas accounted for approximately 62% and 61% of our net sales during the three months ended March 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. Our activities expose us to a variety of market risks, including the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates. These financial risks are monitored and managed by us as an integral part of our overall risk management program. 
As of March 31, 2018, we had no outstanding borrowings under this line of credit. During the three month periods ended March 31, 2018 and March 31, 2017, we incurred interest expense related to our outstanding borrowings of $0 and $178,000, respectively. As of March 31, 2018 and March 31, 2017, the weighted-average interest rate on the revolving line of credit was 3% and 1.6%, respectively. These charges are included in “Other income (loss), net” in our Consolidated Statements of Income.Operating Income. For the three month periods ended March 31, 2018 and 2017, operating income was $28 million and $22 million, respectively, an increase of 26%. As a percentage of net sales, operating income was 9.0% and 7.4% for the three month periods ended March 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. The increases in operating income in absolute dollars for the three month period ended March 31, 2018, compared to the three month period ended March 31, 2017, are attributable to the factors discussed in Net Sales, Gross Profit and Operating Expenses above.
◦Inventory increased by $9 million to $193 million at March 31, 2018, from $185 million at December 31, 2017. Inventory turns were 1.6 and 1.7 at March 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017, respectively. The increase in inventory was primarily attributable to an increase in raw materials.
During the three month period ending March 31, 2018, the year over year increase in operating expenses was primarily the result of the year over year change in exchange rates and a decrease in the capitalization of software development costs. The change in exchange rates had the effect of increasing our operating expenses by $6 million. Additionally, we capitalized $8 million of software development costs in the three month period ended March 31, 2018, compared to $12 million in the three month period ended March 31, 2017, which had the effect of increasing our operating expenses by $4 million. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in costs related to travel, marketing and outside services of $1.6 million compared to the three month period ending March 31, 2017.
