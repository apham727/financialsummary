The Company operates in a single business segment, industrial instrumentation.
The FieldServer family of products works with the SMC Cloud portal; a cloud-based service that registers and manages FieldServer products, provides secure remote access to the local web-based applications that run on FieldServer products, and integrates with third-party applications over REST APIs.
The driver development involves further research after receipt of order, preparation of a scope document to be approved by the customer and then engineering time to write, test and release the driver program.
No customer made up more than 10% of net sales for each of the three or the nine-month periods ended September 30, 2018 and September 30, 2017.
The SMC Cloud portal is a proprietary, secure, and scalable Software-as-a-Service product and is developed and deployed using the same core technologies and providers that are used by many of the world’s leading web sites and Internet-based services.
Revenue recognition occurs only when the service activity is completed.
Gas detection and environment control services consist of field service orders (technical support) and training, which are provided separately from product orders.
The creditworthiness of customers is assessed prior to the Company accepting a customer’s first order.For the nine-month periods ended September 30, 2018 and 2017, selling and marketing expenses were approximately $4,220,000, or 25% of net sales, and approximately 3,841,000, or 26% of net sales, respectively.
