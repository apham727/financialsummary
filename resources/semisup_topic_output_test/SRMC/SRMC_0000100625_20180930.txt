FieldServer services consist of orders for custom development of protocol drivers. Generally, customers place orders for FieldServer products concurrently with their order for protocol drivers. However, if custom development of the protocol driver is required, the product order is not processed until development of the protocol driver is complete. The driver development involves further research after receipt of order, preparation of a scope document to be approved by the customer and then engineering time to write, test and release the driver program. When development of the driver is complete the customer is notified and can proceed with a FieldServer product. Revenues for protocol driver development are recognized at a point in time when the control of the product is transferred to the customer generally occurring upon shipment or delivery of the related product that includes the developed protocol drivers (as noted in FieldServer Products above). 
The Company’s FieldServer family of protocol gateways, routers, and network explorers targets facility automation requirements, and is used by original equipment manufacturers (“OEMs”) and system integrators to enable local and remote monitoring and control of assets and facilities. The FieldServer family of products works with the SMC Cloud portal; a cloud-based service that registers and manages FieldServer products, provides secure remote access to the local web-based applications that run on FieldServer products, and integrates with third-party applications over REST APIs. With more than 200,000 installed gateways supporting over 140 protocols such as BACnet, LonWorks, MODBUS, and XML in commercial and industrial facilities, FieldServer is the industry’s leading multi-protocol gateway brand and is delivered in a variety of form factors appropriate to the asset being interfaced. The intellectual property in FieldServer products is embodied in the proprietary embedded software that runs on a variety of customized hardware platforms with different connectivity options such as Serial, Ethernet, Wi-Fi, or cellular. In addition to bridging data protocols between various assets or devices within a facility, the embedded software includes value-added “fog” or “local application” software for monitoring, logging, alarming, and trending local field data. Additionally, the embedded software enables the assets or devices in the facility to securely connect to third-party clouds and to the Company’s own SMC Cloud portal. The SMC Cloud portal is a proprietary, secure, and scalable Software-as-a-Service product and is developed and deployed using the same core technologies and providers that are used by many of the world’s leading web sites and Internet-based services. 
The Company’s solutions are also sold to telecommunication companies and their suppliers to manage environmental and security conditions such as temperature, gas, and smoke in remote structures such as local DSL distribution nodes and buildings at cell tower sites. 
The Company’s revenues are derived from the sale of FieldServer products, FieldServer products services, Gas Detection and Environment Control products, and Gas Detection and Environment Control products services. The Company accounts for a contract with a customer when there’s approval and commitment from both parties, the rights of the parties are identified, payment terms are identified, the contract has commercial substance and collectability of consideration is probable. 
No options were exercised in the three and nine-month period ended September 30, 2018. During the same periods, 10,000 and 11,000 options expired, respectively. In the nine-month periods ended September 30, 2017, 10,002 shares of common stock were issued as a result of stock option exercises. During the same periods, 1,103,000 and 1,106,000 options expired, respectively. 
No customers made up more than 10% of accounts receivable at September 30, 2018 but one customer made up more than 10% of accounts receivable at December 31, 2017. No customer made up more than 10% of net sales for each of the three or the nine-month periods ended September 30, 2018 and September 30, 2017. 
Discounts are applied at time of order entry and sales are processed at net pricing. No allowances are offered to customers. For the three-month period ended September 30, 2018, sales of our instrumentation products, including fire and gas detection, military sales and environment controllers, were approximately $2,813,000 compared to approximately $2,536,000 in the three-month period ended September 30, 2017, representing an 11% increase. For the nine-month period ended September 30, 2018, sales of our instrumentation products were approximately $8,116,000 compared to approximately $6,906,000 in the same period in 2017 representing an 18% increase. 
Selling and marketing expenses, which consist primarily of salaries, commissions and promotional expenses were approximately $1,490,000, or 25% of net sales for the three-month period ended September 30, 2018, compared to approximately $1,225,000, or 24% of net sales, in the comparable period in the prior year. For the nine-month periods ended September 30, 2018 and 2017, selling and marketing expenses were approximately $4,220,000, or 25% of net sales, and approximately 3,841,000, or 26% of net sales, respectively. The increase in our selling expenses in the three and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2018 compared to the same period in the prior year are primarily attributed to the addition of resources. 
In the three-month period ended September 30, 2018, sales of FieldServer products were approximately $3,181,000 compared to approximately $2,641,000 in the same period in 2017, representing a 20% increase. In the nine-month period ended September 30, 2018, sales of our FieldServer products were approximately $8,580,000, compared to approximately $7,634,000 in sales reported in the same period in 2017, representing a 12% increase. 
General and administrative expenses, which consist primarily of salaries, building rent, insurance expenses, information technology expenses and fees for professional services, were approximately $1,014,000, or 17% of net sales, for the three-month period ended September 30, 2018 compared to approximately $743,000, or 14% of net sales, in the three-month period ended September 30, 2017. For the nine-month periods ended September 30, 2018 and September 2017, general and administrative expenses were approximately $2,917,000, or 17% of net sales, and approximately $2,356,000, or 16% of net sales, respectively. General and administrative expenses have increased 36% in the three-month period and increased 24% in the nine-month reporting periods ended September 30, 2018 compared to the same periods in 2017, primarily due to increased salary expenses and outsourced professionals. 
In the three-month period ended September 30, 2018, our income from operations was approximately $321,000 compared to income from operations of approximately $369,000 for the three-month period ended September 30, 2017. In the nine-month period ended September 30, 2018, our income from operations was approximately $498,000 compared to a loss from operations of approximately $447,000 in the nine-month period ended September 30, 2017. The loss in the nine-month period of 2017 was due to non-recurring expenses. 
FieldServer sales include both box products and original equipment manufacturer (“OEM”) modules. Box products provide a platform for delivery and operation of our software for integration with building automation systems and are generally sold to building automation integrators. Strong increases in OEM sales offset lower sales of box products.

Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or estimated market, with cost being determined on the first-in, first-out method. We use an Enterprise Requirements Planning (“ERP”) software system which provides data upon which management relies to determine inventory trends and identify excesses. The carrying value of inventory is reduced to market for slow moving and obsolete items based on historical experience and current product demand. We evaluate the carrying value of inventory quarterly. The adequacy of carrying amounts is dependent upon management’s ability to forecast demands accurately, manage product changes efficiently, and interpret the data provided by the ERP system.
