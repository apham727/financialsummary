Amortization expense is recorded in cost of revenue in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations. For the three months ended June 30, 2018 and 2017, amortization expense totaled $0.2 million and $0.5 million, respectively. For the six months ended June 30, 2018 and 2017, amortization expense totaled $0.4 million and $1.0 million, respectively. 
We intend to continue to expand our operations, which may strain our resources and increase our operating expenses. 
Industry consolidation may lead to increased competition and may harm our operating results. 
As of June 30, 2018, none of the operating metrics have been achieved. 
      •   changes in revenue mix between end market segments (i.e. consumer, computing and storage, industrial, automotive and communications);    
The analog and mixed-signal semiconductor industry is highly competitive, and we expect competitive pressures to continue. Our ability to compete effectively and to expand our business will depend on our ability to continue to recruit applications and design talent, our ability to introduce new products, and our ability to maintain the rate at which we introduce these new products. We compete with domestic and non-domestic semiconductor companies, many of which have substantially greater financial and other resources with which to pursue engineering, manufacturing, marketing, and distribution of their products. We are in direct and active competition, with respect to one or more of our product lines, with many manufacturers of such products, of varying size and financial strength. The number of our competitors has grown due to the expansion of the market segments in which we participate.  
We depend on a limited number of customers, including distributors, for a significant percentage of our revenue. 
    •   higher than anticipated overhead and other costs of operation.    
Due to the nature of our business as a component supplier, we may have difficulty both in accurately predicting our future revenue and appropriately managing our expenses. 
Our customers generally have substantial technological capabilities and financial resources. Some customers have traditionally used these resources to develop their own products internally. The future prospects for our products in these markets are dependent in part upon our customers' acceptance of our products as an alternative to their internally developed products. Future sales prospects also are dependent upon acceptance of third-party sourcing for products as an alternative to in-house development. Customers may in the future continue to use internally developed components. They also may decide to develop or acquire components, technologies or products that are similar to, or that may be substituted for, our products. If our customers fail to accept our products as an alternative, if they develop or acquire the technology to develop such components internally rather than purchase our products, or if we are otherwise unable to develop or maintain strong relationships with them, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. Revenue from the consumer market for the three months ended June 30, 2018 increased $3.9 million, or 8.9%, from the same period in 2017. This increase was primarily driven by higher demand in home appliance and internet-of-things related products. Revenue from the computing and storage market increased $12.5 million, or 51.1%, from the same period in 2017. This increase was primarily driven by strength in the solid-state drive storage, cloud computing and high-performance notebook markets. Revenue from the automotive market increased $7.5 million, or 58.2%, from the same period in 2017. This increase was primarily driven by higher sales of products for infotainment, safety and connectivity applications. Revenue from the industrial market increased $4.1 million, or 27.2%, from the same period in 2017. This increase was primarily driven by higher sales in power source products. Revenue from the communications market decreased $0.4 million, or 2.5%, from the same period in 2017. This decrease was primarily driven by lower demand in wireless applications. 
Revenue from the consumer market for the six months ended June 30, 2018 increased $15.4 million, or 19.4%, from the same period in 2017. This increase was primarily driven by higher demand in home appliance, specialty lighting and internet-of-things related products. Revenue from the computing and storage market increased $22.8 million, or 50.7%, from the same period in 2017. This increase was primarily driven by strength in the solid-state drive storage, cloud computing and high-performance notebook markets. Revenue from the automotive market increased $12.9 million, or 51.2%, from the same period in 2017. This increase was primarily driven by higher sales of products for infotainment, safety and connectivity applications. Revenue from the industrial market increased $6.3 million, or 20.7%, from the same period in 2017. This increase was primarily driven by higher sales in power source, security and meter products. Revenue from the communications market decreased $1.1 million, or 3.4%, from the same period in 2017. This decrease was primarily driven by lower demand in wireless applications.

Our success depends on us investing significant amounts of resources into research and development. We expect to have to continue to invest heavily in research and development in the future in order to continue to innovate and introduce new products in a timely manner and increase our revenue and profitability. If we have to invest more resources in research and development than we anticipate, we could see an increase in our operating expenses which may negatively impact our operating results. Also, if we are unable to properly manage and effectively utilize our research and development resources, we could see material adverse effects on our business, financial condition and operating results.
