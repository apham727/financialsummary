We intend to continue to expand our operations, which may strain our resources and increase our operating expenses. 
Industry consolidation may lead to increased competition and may harm our operating results. 
The analog and mixed-signal semiconductor industry is highly competitive, and we expect competitive pressures to continue. Our ability to compete effectively and to expand our business will depend on our ability to continue to recruit applications and design talent, our ability to introduce new products, and our ability to maintain the rate at which we introduce these new products. We compete with domestic and non-domestic semiconductor companies, many of which have substantially greater financial and other resources with which to pursue engineering, manufacturing, marketing, and distribution of their products. We are in direct and active competition, with respect to one or more of our product lines, with many manufacturers of such products, of varying size and financial strength. The number of our competitors has grown due to the expansion of the market segments in which we participate.  
We depend on a limited number of customers, including distributors, for a significant percentage of our revenue. 
Due to the nature of our business as a component supplier, we may have difficulty both in accurately predicting our future revenue and appropriately managing our expenses. 
Our customers generally have substantial technological capabilities and financial resources. Some customers have traditionally used these resources to develop their own products internally. The future prospects for our products in these markets are dependent in part upon our customers' acceptance of our products as an alternative to their internally developed products. Future sales prospects also are dependent upon acceptance of third-party sourcing for products as an alternative to in-house development. Customers may in the future continue to use internally developed components. They also may decide to develop or acquire components, technologies or products that are similar to, or that may be substituted for, our products. If our customers fail to accept our products as an alternative, if they develop or acquire the technology to develop such components internally rather than purchase our products, or if we are otherwise unable to develop or maintain strong relationships with them, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. 
Historically, we have generated most of our revenue from a limited number of customers, including distributors. For example, sales to our largest distributor accounted for 23% and 21% of our total revenue for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2018, respectively. We continue to rely on a limited number of customers for a significant portion of our revenue. Because we rely on a limited number of customers for significant percentages of our revenue, a decrease in demand or significant pricing pressure for our products from any of our major customers for any reason (including due to competition, market conditions, catastrophic events or otherwise) could have a materially adverse impact on our financial conditions and results of operations. 
As of October 30, 2018, the first and the second operating metrics have been achieved and the determination of achievement was approved by the Compensation Committee. 
In addition, if new competitors, technological advances by existing competitors, our entry into new markets, or other competitive factors require us to invest significantly greater resources than anticipated in our research and development efforts, our operating expenses would increase. If we are required to invest significantly greater resources than anticipated in research and development efforts without a corresponding increase in revenue, our operating results could decline. Research and development expenses are likely to fluctuate from time to time to the extent we make periodic incremental investments in research and development and these investments may be independent of our level of revenue, which could negatively impact our financial results. In order to remain competitive, we anticipate that we will continue to devote substantial resources to research and development, and we expect these expenses to increase in absolute dollars in the foreseeable future due to the increased complexity and the greater number of products under development. 
Implementation of an enterprise resource planning (“ERP”) or other information technology systems could result in significant disruptions to our operations. 
As we develop new product lines, we must adapt to market conditions that are unfamiliar to us, such as competitors and distribution channels that are different from those we have known in the past. Some of our new product lines require us to re-equip our labs to test parameters we have not tested in the past. If we are unable to adapt rapidly to these new and additional conditions, we may not be able to successfully penetrate new markets. Revenue from the computing and storage market for the three months ended September 30, 2018 increased $18.6 million, or 64.2%, from the same period in 2017. This increase was primarily driven by strength in the solid-state drive storage, cloud computing and high-performance notebook markets. Revenue from the automotive market increased $6.9 million, or 53.9%, from the same period in 2017. This increase was primarily driven by higher sales of products for infotainment, safety and connectivity applications. Revenue from the industrial market increased $8.5 million, or 52.1%, from the same period in 2017. This increase was primarily driven by higher sales in power source, security and meter products. Revenue from the communications market increased $3.8 million, or 24.6%, from the same period in 2017. This increase was primarily driven by higher demand in networking applications. Revenue from the consumer market decreased $6.8 million, or 12.4%, from the same period in 2017. This decrease was primarily due to softness in demand for high volume consumer related products, particularly those sold in the greater China region. This decrease was partially offset by higher demand for products related to home appliance, specialty lighting and internet-of-things applications. 
Revenue from the computing and storage market for the nine months ended September 30, 2018 increased $41.5 million, or 56.0%, from the same period in 2017. This increase was primarily driven by strength in the solid-state drive storage, cloud computing and high-performance notebook markets. Revenue from the automotive market increased $19.8 million, or 52.1%, from the same period in 2017. This increase was primarily driven by higher sales of products for infotainment, safety and connectivity applications. Revenue from the industrial market increased $14.8 million, or 31.7%, from the same period in 2017. This increase was primarily driven by higher sales in power source, security and meter products. Revenue from the communications market increased $2.7 million, or 5.6%, from the same period in 2017. This increase was primarily driven by higher demand in networking applications. Revenue from the consumer market increased $8.6 million, or 6.4%, from the same period in 2017. This increase was primarily driven by higher demand for products related to home appliance, specialty lighting and internet-of-things applications, partially offset by softness in demand for high volume consumer related products, particularly those sold in the greater China region. We intend to continue to expand our operations, which may strain our resources and increase our operating expenses. 
Industry consolidation may lead to increased competition and may harm our operating results. 
In addition, we may be unable to identify or complete prospective acquisitions for various reasons, including competition from other companies in the semiconductor industry, the valuation expectations of acquisition candidates and applicable antitrust laws or related regulations. If we are unable to identify and complete acquisitions, we may not be able to successfully expand our business and product offerings. 
Our success depends on us investing significant amounts of resources into research and development. We expect to have to continue to invest heavily in research and development in the future in order to continue to innovate and introduce new products in a timely manner and increase our revenue and profitability. If we have to invest more resources in research and development than we anticipate, we could see an increase in our operating expenses which may negatively impact our operating results. Also, if we are unable to properly manage and effectively utilize our research and development resources, we could see material adverse effects on our business, financial condition and operating results.
