Amortization expense is recorded in cost of revenue in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations. For the three months ended  March 31, 2018 and 2017, amortization expense totaled $0.3 million and $0.5 million, respectively. 
We intend to continue to expand our operations, which may strain our resources and increase our operating expenses. 
Industry consolidation may lead to increased competition and may harm our operating results. 
    •   changes in revenue mix between end market segments (i.e. consumer, computing and storage, industrial, automotive and communications);    
Cash proceeds from the shares issued under the ESPP were $1.6 million and $1.4 million for the three months ended  March 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively.  
Cash proceeds from the release of PSUs with a purchase price feature totaled $7.8 million for the three months ended  March 31, 2018. There were no proceeds for the three months ended  March 31, 2017. 
The analog and mixed-signal semiconductor industry is highly competitive, and we expect competitive pressures to continue. Our ability to compete effectively and to expand our business will depend on our ability to continue to recruit applications and design talent, our ability to introduce new products, and our ability to maintain the rate at which we introduce these new products. We compete with domestic and non-domestic semiconductor companies, many of which have substantially greater financial and other resources with which to pursue engineering, manufacturing, marketing, and distribution of their products. We are in direct and active competition, with respect to one or more of our product lines, with many manufacturers of such products, of varying size and financial strength. The number of our competitors has grown due to the expansion of the market segments in which we participate.  
    •   higher than anticipated overhead and other costs of operation.    
We depend on a limited number of customers, including distributors, for a significant percentage of our revenue. 
Due to the nature of our business as a component supplier, we may have difficulty both in accurately predicting our future revenue and appropriately managing our expenses. Gross margin was 55.4% for the three months ended March 31, 2018, compared with 54.6% for the three months ended March 31, 2017. The increase in gross margin was primarily due to increased sales of higher margin products and lower amortization expense due to certain intangible assets being fully amortized, partially offset by higher inventory write-downs and warranty expenses as a percentage of revenue. 
Revenue for the three months ended March 31, 2018 was $129.2 million, an increase of $28.8 million, or 28.7%, from $100.4 million for the three months ended March 31, 2017. This increase was driven by higher sales in all of our end markets except for communications. Overall unit shipments increased by 18% due to higher market demand, and average sales prices increased by 8%.  We intend to continue to expand our operations, which may strain our resources and increase our operating expenses. 
Industry consolidation may lead to increased competition and may harm our operating results.

Our success depends on us investing significant amounts of resources into research and development. We expect to have to continue to invest heavily in research and development in the future in order to continue to innovate and introduce new products in a timely manner and increase our revenue and profitability. If we have to invest more resources in research and development than we anticipate, we could see an increase in our operating expenses which may negatively impact our operating results. Also, if we are unable to properly manage and effectively utilize our research and development resources, we could see material adverse effects on our business, financial condition and operating results.
