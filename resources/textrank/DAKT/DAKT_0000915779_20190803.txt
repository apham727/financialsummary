Fiscal 2020 will be a 53-week year; therefore, the quarter ended August 3, 2019 contains operating results for 14 weeks while the quarter ended July 28, 2018 contains operating results for 13 weeks.
There have been no material changes to our significant accounting policies and estimates as described in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended April 27, 2019, other than described in the Accounting Standards Adopted section below.
In February 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued Accounting Standards Update ("ASU") 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842), which sets out the principles for the recognition, measurement, presentation and disclosure of leases for both parties to a contract (that is, lessees and lessors).
ASU 2016-02 requires lessees to apply a dual approach, classifying leases as either finance or operating leases based on the principle of whether or not the lease is effectively a financed purchase of the leased asset by the lessee.
This classification will determine whether the lease expense is recognized based on an effective interest method or on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease.
A lessee is also required to record a right-of-use asset and a lease liability for all leases with a term greater than 12 months regardless of their classification.
ASU 2016-02 requires lessors to account for leases using an approach that is substantially equivalent to existing guidance for sales-type leases, direct financing leases and operating leases.
In July 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-10, Codification Improvements to Topic 842 (Leases) and ASU 2018-11, Leases (Topic 842), Targeted Improvements, which provide (i) narrow amendments to clarify how to apply certain aspects of the new lease standard, (ii) entities with an additional transition method to adopt the new standard, and (iii) lessors with a practical expedient for separating components of a contract.
We elected the "comparatives under Accounting Standards Codification ("ASC") 840 option" as a transitional method, which allows us to initially apply the new lease requirements at the effective date.
In addition, we have elected the short-term lease recognition whereby we will not recognize operating leases related assets or liabilities for leases with a lease term of less than one year.
As of April 28, 2019, we recognized a right of use asset for operating leases of $11,101 and a current and non-current lease liability for operating leases of $2,745 and $8,356, respectively.
The right of use operating assets are included in the "Investment in affiliates and other assets" line item, the current lease liabilities are included in the "Accrued expenses" line item, and the non-current lease liabilities are included in the "Other long-term obligations" line item in our condensed consolidated balance sheet.
The amendment requires an entity to perform its annual or interim goodwill impairment test by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount.
Our proportional share of the respective affiliates' earnings or losses is included in the "Other income (expense), net" line item in our condensed consolidated statements of operations.
For the three months ended August 3, 2019 and July 28, 2018, our share of the losses of our affiliates was $118 and $134, respectively.
Options outstanding to purchase 2,197 shares of common stock with a weighted average exercise price of $10.03 for the three months ended August 3, 2019 and 1,798 shares of common stock with a weighted average exercise price of $10.46 for the three months ended July 28, 2018 were not included in the computation of diluted earnings per share because the effects would be anti-dilutive.
Contract assets represent revenue recognized in excess of amounts billed and include unbilled receivables.
Unbilled receivables, which represent an unconditional right to payment subject only to the passage of time, are reclassified to accounts receivable when they are billed under the contract terms.
The changes in our contract assets and contract liabilities from April 27, 2019 to August 3, 2019 were due to the timing of billing schedules and revenue recognition, which can vary significantly depending on the contractual payment terms and the seasonality of the sports markets.
We had no material impairments of contract assets for the three months ended August 3, 2019.
During the three months ended August 3, 2019, we recognized revenue of $31,259 related to our contract liabilities as of April 27, 2019.
Marketable securities classified as available-for-sale are reported at fair value with unrealized gains or losses, net of tax, reported in accumulated other comprehensive loss in the condensed consolidated balance sheets.
In addition, as of August 3, 2019, we anticipate we will recover the entire amortized cost basis of such fixed income securities, and we have determined no other-than-temporary impairments associated with credit losses were required to be recognized.
The projected cash flows use many estimates including market conditions and expected market demand; our ability to grow or maintain market share and gross profit; and our expected expenditures for capital and operating expenses.
Accounts receivable are reported net of an allowance for doubtful accounts of $2,292 and $2,208 at August 3, 2019 and April 27, 2019, respectively.
Included in accounts receivable as of August 3, 2019 and April 27, 2019 was $828 and $440, respectively, of retainage on construction-type contracts, all of which is expected to be collected within one year.
The present value of these contracts and leases are recorded as a receivable as the revenue is recognized in accordance with GAAP, and profit is recognized to the extent the present value is in excess of cost.
The present value of long-term contracts and lease receivables, including accrued interest and current maturities, was $6,160 and $3,514 as of August 3, 2019 and April 27, 2019, respectively.
Contract and lease receivables bearing annual interest rates of 5.0 to 9.0 percent are due in varying annual installments through 2024.
These are all classified as operating leases and have initial lease terms ranging from one to five years.
Leases with an initial term of 12 months or less are not recorded on the balance sheet.
Right-of-use assets represent our right to use an underlying asset for the lease term, and lease liabilities represent our obligation to make lease payments arising from the lease.
Operating lease right-of-use assets and liabilities are recognized at commencement date based on the present value of lease payments over the lease term.
As our leases do not provide an implicit rate, we use the incremental borrowing rate based on the information available at commencement date in determining the present value of future lease payments.
The operating lease right-of-use asset includes any prepaid lease payments and initial direct costs and excludes any lease incentives and impairments.
Some of our leases include options to extend the term, which is only included in the right-of-use assets and lease liability calculation when it is reasonably certain that we will exercise that option.
Our operating leases also typically require payment of real estate taxes, insurance, and common area maintenance.
We calculate the provision for income taxes during interim reporting periods by applying an estimate of the annual effective tax rate for the full fiscal year to “ordinary” income or loss (pre-tax income or loss excluding unusual or infrequently occurring discrete items) for the reporting period.
For additional information, see our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended April 27, 2019 for the methods and assumptions used to estimate the fair value of each class of financial instrument.
We account for all derivatives in the condensed consolidated balance sheets within accounts receivable or accounts payable measured at fair value, and changes in fair values are recognized in earnings unless specific hedge accounting criteria are met for cash flow or net investment hedges.
As of August 3, 2019 and April 27, 2019, we had not designated any of our derivative instruments as accounting hedges, and thus we recorded the changes in fair value in the "Other income (expense), net" line item in the condensed consolidated statements of operations.
As of August 3, 2019, there was an asset and liability of $334 and $10, respectively, and as of April 27, 2019, there was an asset and liability of $91 and $4, respectively, representing the fair value of foreign currency exchange forward contracts, which were determined using Level 2 inputs from a third-party bank.

Our net sales and profitability historically have fluctuated due to the impact of uniquely configured orders, such as display systems for professional sports facilities, colleges and universities, and spectacular projects in the commercial area, as well as the seasonality of the sports market.
Uniquely configured orders can include several displays, controllers, and subcontracted structure builds, each of which can occur on varied schedules per the customer's needs.
Our third fiscal quarter tends to be a slower quarter because it includes two holidays, it is affected by sports seasonality, and generally less outdoor construction work occurs due to weather conditions.
•Increased demand for video systems in high schools as school districts realize the revenue generating potential of these displays compared to traditional scoreboards and these systems' ability to provide or enhance academic curriculum offerings for students.
Daktronics, Inc. operates on a 52- or 53-week fiscal year, with our fiscal year ending on the Saturday closest to April 30 of each year.
Within each fiscal year, each quarter is comprised of 13-week periods following the beginning of each fiscal year.
The fiscal year ended April 27, 2019 consisted of 52 weeks.

We had an increase in orders placed during the first quarter of fiscal 2020 related to new releases of our product offerings.
The increase in orders for the three months ended August 3, 2019 compared to the same period one year ago was primarily due to the timing of projects in the on-premise and OOH niches.
Orders increased for the three months ended August 3, 2019 compared to the same period one year ago due to an increase in the number of projects for professional sports, arenas, and college and universities venues.
Orders decreased for the three months ended August 3, 2019 compared to the same period one year ago due to variability in order timing and a decrease in large video projects compared to the same period last year.
Orders for the three months ended August 3, 2019 compared to the same period one year ago remained relatively flat.
Orders increased for the three months ended August 3, 2019 compared to the same period one year ago primarily due to general variations in the timing of large contracts and account-based order placements.
The product order backlog as of August 3, 2019 was $207 million as compared to $177 million as of July 28, 2018 and $202 million at the end of the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019.
Historically, our product order backlog varies due to the seasonality of our business, the timing of large projects, and customer delivery schedules for these orders.
The product order backlog as of August 3, 2019 increased in our Live Events, Transportation, and International business units from July 28, 2018 and decreased in our High School Park and Recreation business unit.
All areas of selling expenses were impacted as a result of the first quarter of fiscal 2020 including 14 weeks compared to the more common 13 weeks.
Selling expense in our Commercial, Live Events, and High School Park and Recreation business units increased in the first quarter of fiscal 2020 compared to the same quarter a year ago due to personnel related expenses.
Selling expense in our International business unit decreased in the first quarter of fiscal 2020 compared to the same quarter a year ago due to a decrease in third-party commissions.

All areas of operating expenses were impacted as a result of the first quarter of fiscal 2020 including 14 weeks compared to the more common 13 weeks.
General and administrative expenses in the first quarter of fiscal 2020 increased as compared to the same period one year ago primarily due to the additional week of operating results added to the first quarter of fiscal 2020.
The change in interest income, net for the first quarter of fiscal 2020 compared to the same period one year ago was primarily due to the change in investment levels caused by the volatility of working capital needs.
The changes in working capital, particularly changes in accounts receivable, accounts payable, inventory, and contract assets and liabilities, and the sports market seasonality can have a significant impact on the amount of net cash provided by operating activities largely due to the timing of payments and receipts.
During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019, we violated one of our bank covenants, but we received a waiver from our banking institution for the year ended April 27, 2019.
