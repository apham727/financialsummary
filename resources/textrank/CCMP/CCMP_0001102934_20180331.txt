In the opinion of management, these unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements include all adjustments, consisting of normal recurring adjustments, necessary for the fair statement of Cabot Microelectronics' financial position as of March 31, 2018, cash flows for the six months ended March 31, 2018 and March 31, 2017, and results of operations for the three and six months ended March 31, 2018 and March 31, 2017.
The results of operations for the three and six months ended March 31, 2018 may not be indicative of results to be expected for future periods, including the fiscal year ending September 30, 2018.
This Report on Form 10-Q does not contain all of the footnote disclosures from the annual financial statements and should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements and related notes thereto included in Cabot Microelectronics' Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2017.
Subsequent to the enactment of the Tax Act in the United States, the Company sold all of its non-U.S. available-for-sale securities prior to repatriating the funds to the U.S. The Company recognized a loss of $118 associated with the sale of these investments in the second quarter of fiscal 2018.
Fair value is defined as the price that would be received from the sale of an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date.
The Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") established a three-level hierarchy for disclosure based on the extent and level of judgment used to estimate fair value.
The following table presents financial instruments, other than long-term debt, that we measured at fair value on a recurring basis at March 31, 2018 and September 30, 2017.
The long-term investment was adjusted to $1,071 in the second quarter of fiscal 2018 to reflect its fair value as of March 31, 2018.
As a result of this sale of assets in March 2018, we received net proceeds of $3,249, of which $250 is held in escrow, and recorded a preliminary gain of $956 in other income in the Consolidated Statements of Income.
In the first quarter of fiscal 2018, we adopted ASU No. 2017-04 "Simplifying the Test for Goodwill Impairment." The provisions of this standard eliminate Step 2 from the goodwill impairment test, which required an entity to determine the fair value of its assets and liabilities at the impairment testing date of its goodwill and compare it to its carrying amount to determine a possible impairment loss.
Goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets are tested for impairment annually in the fourth quarter of the fiscal year or more frequently if indicators of potential impairment exist, using a fair-value-based approach.
This fee was recorded as a long-term asset at its present value and is being amortized into cost of goods sold on a straight-line basis through the expiration date of the agreement.
As discussed in Note 3, we recorded a long-term asset and a corresponding long-term liability of $1,071 representing the fair value of our SERP investments as of March 31, 2018.
In addition, all derivatives, whether designated in hedging relationships or not, are required to be recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheets at fair value on a gross basis.
For the quarter ended March 31, 2018, the change in the fair value of the forward contracts in the net investment hedge relationship of $2,966 was recorded in foreign currency translation adjustments within Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income.
We recorded a $52 unrealized loss and a $148 unrealized gain, net of tax, in accumulated comprehensive income during the three and six months ended March 31, 2018, respectively, for these interest rate swaps.
As of March 31, 2018, during the next 12 months, we expect approximately $413 to be reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive income into interest expense related to our interest rate swaps based on projected rates of the LIBOR forward curve as of March 31, 2018.
Refer to Note 18 of "Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements" in Item 8 of Part II of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2017, for additional information regarding commitments and contingencies.
For more information regarding these plans, refer to Note 18 of "Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements" included in Item 8 of Part II of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2017.
The before tax amounts reclassified from AOCI to net income during the six months ended March 31, 2018 and 2017, related to our cash flow hedges, were recorded as interest expense on our Consolidated Statements of Income.
For the six months ended March 31, 2018, we recorded $11,105 in currency translation gains, net of tax, primarily due to exchange rate fluctuations in the Japanese yen and Korean won versus the U.S. dollar, that are included in other comprehensive income, including a net loss of $5,789 related to our net investment hedge.
These gains and losses primarily relate to changes in the U.S. dollar value of assets and liabilities denominated in local currencies when these asset and liability amounts are translated at month-end exchange rates.
We record share-based compensation expense for all share-based awards, including stock option grants, and restricted stock, restricted stock unit and performance share unit ("PSU") awards, and employee stock purchase plan purchases.
As of December 2017, the provisions of new stock option grants and restricted stock unit awards state that except in certain circumstances including termination for cause, once an employee meets the retirement eligibility requirements, any remaining unvested share-based awards will continue to vest regardless of termination of service.
Applying the guidance in ASC 718 "Compensationâ€”Stock Compensation", we recorded $1,744 of related share-based compensation expense in the three months ended December 31, 2017.
For additional information regarding the estimation of fair value, refer to Note 13 of "Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements" included in Item 8 of Part II of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2017.
Our effective tax rate was 19.6% and 63.8% for the three and six months ended March 31, 2018, respectively, compared to a 20.8% and 20.5% effective income tax rate for the three and six months ended March 31, 2017.
The significant increase in our effective tax rate for the six months ended March 31, 2018 compared to the prior year is primarily driven by discrete adjustments related to recently enacted Tax Act in the United States.
Other factors that impacted the Company's effective tax rate for the three and six months ended March 31, 2018 were primarily related to benefits in excess of compensation cost from share based compensation recorded in the income statement (as opposed to equity prior to October 2017) and the absence of benefits of a tax holiday in South Korea, which expired as of October 2017.
Basic earnings per share (EPS) is calculated by dividing net income available to common stockholders by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during the period, excluding the effects of unvested restricted stock awards that have a right to receive non-forfeitable dividends, which are considered participating securities as prescribed by the two-class method under ASC 260 "Earnings per Share".
Pursuant to the adoption of ASU 2016-09 in the first quarter of fiscal 2018, the tax benefits associated with share-based compensation plans were recorded as a tax benefit in our Consolidated Statements of Income.
In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-09, "Revenue from Contracts with Customers" (Topic 606), an updated standard on revenue recognition.
ASU 2014-09 provides enhancements to how revenue is reported and improves comparability in the financial statements of companies reporting using IFRS and U.S. GAAP.
In August 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-14, "Deferral of Effective Date" (Topic 606).
In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-08, "Principal versus Agent Considerations (Reporting Revenue Gross versus Net)" (Topic 606).
In April 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-10, ASU No. 2016-11, and ASU 2016-12, and ASU 2017-13 issued in September 2017, all of which provide additional clarification of the original revenue standard.
We anticipate we will adopt the new revenue standard in the first quarter of fiscal 2019 using the modified retrospective approach to adoption, which will require us to record the cumulative effect of adopting the standard as an adjustment to the beginning balance of retained earnings.
The provisions of ASU 2015-11 require an entity to measure inventory at the lower of cost and net realizable value.
We adopted ASU 2015-11 effective October 1, 2017, and this pronouncement had no material effect on our financial statements.
In January 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-01, "Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities" (Subtopic 825-10).
The provision of ASU 2016-01 requires equity investments, other than those accounted for under the equity method of accounting or those that result in consolidation, to be measured at fair value with changes in fair value recognized in net income.
ASU 2016-01 simplifies the impairment assessment of equity securities by permitting a qualitative assessment each reporting period, and makes changes to presentation and disclosure of certain classes of financial assets and liabilities.
The provisions of ASU 2016-02 require a dual approach for lessee accounting under which a lessee would recognize a right-of-use asset and a corresponding lease liability.
The guidance also requires qualitative and specific quantitative disclosures to supplement the amounts recorded in the financial statements, to afford better understanding of an entity's leasing activities, including any significant judgments and estimates.
In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-05, "Effect of Derivative Contract Novations on Existing Hedge Accounting Relationships" (Topic 815).
The provisions of ASU 2016-05 provide clarification that a change in a counterparty of a derivative instrument that has been designated as a hedging instrument does not require dedesignation of that hedging relationship, provided that all other hedge accounting criteria is met.
In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-13, "Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments" (Topic 326).
The provisions of this standard require financial assets measured at amortized cost to be presented at the net amount expected to be collected.
ASU 2016-13 also provides that credit losses relating to available-for-sale debt securities should be recorded through an allowance for credit losses.
We do not believe the adoption of this standard will have a material effect on our financial statements as we currently do not have any of the cash receipts or payments discussed in this standard.
In October 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-16 "Intra-Entity Transfers of Assets Other Than Inventory" (Topic 740).
The provisions of this standard provide guidance on recognition of taxes related to intra-entity transfer of assets other than inventory when the transfer occurs.
The provisions of this standard provide further guidance related to ASU 2015-02, and provide guidance on consolidation in relation to VIEs and related parties.
We adopted ASU 2016-17 effective October 1, 2017, and this pronouncement had no material effect on our financial statements as we currently have no interest in any entities that may be considered VIE.
We adopted ASU 2017-01 effective October 1, 2017, and this pronouncement had no material effect on our financial statements.
The provisions of this standard eliminate Step 2 from the goodwill impairment test, which required an entity to determine the fair value of its assets and liabilities at the impairment testing date of its goodwill and compare it to its carrying amount to determine a possible impairment loss.
We adopted ASU 2017-04 effective October 1, 2017 and we will apply the new guidance in our annual test for goodwill impairment in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018.
In March 2017, the FASB issued ASU No. 2017-07 "Improving the Presentation of Net Period Pension Cost and Net Period Postretirement Benefit Cost" (Topic 715).
The provisions of ASU 2017-09 provide specific guidance about which changes to the term or conditions of a share-based payment require an entity to apply modification accounting.
The provisions of this standard amend the hedge accounting model in ASC 815 to expand an entity's ability to hedge nonfinancial and financial risk components, reduce complexity in fair value hedges of interest rate risk, eliminate the requirement to separately measure and report hedge ineffectiveness, and generally require the entire change in the fair value of a hedging instrument to be presented in the same income statement line as the hedged item.
In addition, in anticipation of the cash repatriation described above, the Company terminated its foreign exchange contracts in April 2018, which were used to protect the net investment of our South Korean subsidiary against potential adverse changes resulting from currency fluctuations in the Korean Won. Due to the continued appreciation of the Korean Won, we will recognize an additional loss of $690, net of tax, on our net investment hedge in the quarter ending June 30, 2018, which will be recorded in foreign currency translation adjustments within the Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income.

Gross profit for the first six months of fiscal 2018 was 52.7% of revenue, compared to 50.1% during the same period last year, which includes 90 and 100-basis points of adverse impact of NexPlanar amortization expense, comparatively.
The increase in cost of goods sold was primarily driven by a $3.4 million increase due to higher sales volume, a $2.3 million increase in fixed manufacturing costs, including higher incentive compensation expense, a $1.5 million increase due to foreign exchange fluctuations, and a $0.9 million increase in other variable manufacturing costs, including material costs.
Fixed manufacturing costs included $1.3 million of NexPlanar amortization expense compared to $1.2 million in same period of fiscal 2017.
The increase in gross profit as a percentage of revenue was primarily due to higher sales volume, a higher-valued product mix and lower variable production costs, partially offset by higher fixed manufacturing costs, including costs associated with incentive compensation expense.
General and administrative expenses were $17.8 million for the three months ended March 31, 2018, which represented an increase of 21.1%, or $3.1 million, from the three months ended March 31, 2017.
The increase was primarily due to higher staffing-related expenses of $1.5 million, including STIP costs, higher long-term incentive compensation expenses of $0.7 million, and higher information technology expenses of $0.6 million.
The increase was primarily due to $1.0 million gain on the sale of certain ESF assets in the second quarter of fiscal 2018 and higher interest income of $0.6 million resulting from higher investment balances and higher average interest rates, partially offset by higher foreign exchange loss of $0.4 million in the three months ended March 31, 2018 compared to the same period of fiscal 2017.

The increase in cost of goods sold was primarily driven by a $6.1 million increase due to higher sales volume, a $5.3 million increase in fixed manufacturing costs, including higher incentive compensation expense, and a $1.0 million increase due to foreign exchange fluctuations.
Fixed manufacturing costs included $2.5 million of NexPlanar amortization expense, compared to $2.4 million in same period of fiscal 2017.
The increase was primarily due to $1.0 million gain on the sale of certain ESF assets in the second quarter of fiscal 2018, and higher interest income of $1.2 million resulting from higher investment balances and higher average interest rates, partially offset by foreign exchange loss in the first six months ended March 31, 2018 compared to foreign exchange gain in the comparable period of fiscal 2017.
The increase in the effective tax rate during the first six months of fiscal 2018 was primarily due to the one-time unfavorable impact of the Tax Act that occurred in the first quarter of fiscal 2018 and the absence of benefits of a tax holiday in South Korea, which expired as of October 2017, partially offset by the benefit from stock option exercises beginning October 2017.
The decrease was primarily due to the one-time effect of the Tax Act of $32.9 million that occurred in the first quarter of fiscal 2018, partially offset by higher revenue and a higher gross profit margin.
Our cash provided by operating activities in the first six months of fiscal 2018 reflected net income of $26.7 million, $58.4 million in non-cash items, including $24.6 million related to the deemed repatriation transition tax of the Tax Act, and a $18.0 million decrease in cash flow due to a net increase in working capital.
The increase in cash flows from operating activities compared to the first six months of fiscal 2017 was primarily due to higher revenue and gross margin, and also reflected the non-cash impacts of the Tax Act, and changes in the timing and amount of accrued expense payments, including payments related to our STIP, and a higher accounts receivable balance at March 31, 2018, due to an increase in revenue.
In the first six months of fiscal 2018, cash flows used in investing activities were $5.9 million, representing $50.7 million in purchases of investments designated as available-for-sale securities under a managed investment arrangement that were offset by $50.5 million in proceeds upon the subsequent sale of these investments, property, plant and equipment additions of $8.8 million, and the sale of certain ESF assets of $3.0 million.

Our business is affected by economic and industry conditions and our revenue is primarily dependent upon semiconductor demand.
Historically, semiconductor demand has fluctuated due to economic and industry cycles and seasonal shifts in demand, which can affect our business, causing demand for our products to fluctuate.
Furthermore, competitive dynamics within the semiconductor industry may impact our business.
If the global economy or the semiconductor industry weakens, whether in general or as a result of specific factors, such as macroeconomic factors, or unpredictable events such as natural disasters or geopolitical events, we could experience material adverse impacts on our results of operations and financial condition.
Our success depends on our ability to keep pace with technological changes and advances in the semiconductor industry, and to adapt, improve and customize our products for advanced IC applications in response to evolving customer needs and industry trends.
Since its inception, the semiconductor industry has experienced technological changes and advances in the design, manufacture, performance and application of IC devices.
Our customers continually pursue lower cost of ownership and higher quality and performance of materials consumed in their manufacturing processes, including CMP slurries and pads, as a means to reduce costs, increase the yield in their manufacturing facilities, and achieve desired performance of the IC devices they produce.
Potential technology developments in the semiconductor industry, as well as our customers' efforts to reduce consumption of CMP consumables, including through use of smaller quantities, could render our products less important to the IC device manufacturing process.
Over the past several years, the semiconductor industry has been consolidating as the larger semiconductor manufacturers have generally grown faster than the smaller ones, through business gains, mergers and acquisitions, and strategic alliances.
Any deferral or significant reduction in the quantity or price of CMP consumables sold to these principal customers could seriously harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.
During the six months ended March 31, 2018, Samsung and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC), were our largest customers, accounting for approximately 18% and 13%, respectively, of our revenue.
Our supply chain includes the raw materials we use to manufacture our products, our production operations and the means by which we deliver our products to our customers.
Our business could be adversely affected by any problem or interruption in the supply of the key raw materials we use in our CMP slurries and pads, including raw materials that do not meet the stringent quality and consistency requirements of our customers, any problem or interruption that may occur during production or delivery of our products, such as weather-related problems, natural disasters, or geopolitical, trade, or labor-related issues, or any difficulty in producing sufficient quantities of our products to meet growing demand from our customers.
As business volume between China and the rest of the world continues to grow, there is risk that geopolitical, regulatory, trade and political matters could adversely affect business for companies like ours based on the complex relationships among China, the United States, and other countries in the Asia Pacific region, which could have a material adverse impact on our business.
In addition, there are risks that the Chinese government may, among other things, require the use of local suppliers, compel companies that do business in China to partner with local companies to conduct business, and, provide incentives to government-backed local customers to buy from local suppliers rather than companies like ours, all of which could adversely impact our business, including our results of operations.
