The results of operations for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2019 are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for the full year.
On November 6, 2019, we obtained a waiver from TD Bank for compliance with this financial covenant, which pertains to operating cash flow to total debt service (the “OCF”) at September 30, 2019 and amended the definition of interest expense to exclude fees paid on unused borrowings under the revolving credit line, which is used to calculate total debt service in the OCF.

The new standard requires lessees to apply a dual approach, classifying leases as either finance or operating leases based on the principle of whether or not the lease is effectively a financed purchase by the lessee.
This classification will determine whether lease expense is recognized based on an effective interest method or on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease, respectively.
A lessee is also required to record a right-of-use asset and a lease liability for all leases with a term of greater than 12 months regardless of their classification.
Leases with a term of 12 months or less will be accounted for based on existing guidance for operating leases.
If the lessor does not convey risks and rewards or control, the lease is treated as operating.
We have applied the practical expedient for short-term leases.
Upon adoption of ASC 842, we recorded a $3.7 million right-of-use asset and a $3.9 million lease liability.
Our leases are included in Right of use assets and Lease liabilities in our Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet.
Right of use assets represent our right to use an underlying asset for the lease term and lease liabilities represent our obligation to make lease payments arising from the lease.
Lease right of use assets and liabilities are recognized at the commencement date of the lease based on the present value of lease payments over the lease term.
Our leases have remaining lease terms of one year to eight years, some of which include options to extend.
The exercise of lease renewal options is at our sole discretion and our lease right of use assets and liabilities reflect only the options we are reasonably certain that we will exercise.
For the nine months ended September 30, 2019, we recorded an income tax benefit of $54 thousand at an effective tax rate of -4.3%, compared to an income tax provision during the nine months ended September 30, 2018 of $1.1 million at an effective tax rate of 19.2%.
The effective tax rate for the both the third quarter of 2019 and nine months ended September 30, 2019 was unusually low and a benefit as it included the foreign-derived intangible income (“FDII”) deduction under the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the “Tax Reform Act”) as well as near breakeven pre-tax income in the second and third quarters of 2019.
The FDII deduction was not included in the effective tax rate for the third quarter of 2018 or nine months ended September 30, 2018, as the interpretive guidance for the deduction was not yet released.
As of September 30, 2019, we do not, however, expect Brexit to have a material adverse impact on our consolidated results of operations as only 10% of our total revenues for both the three and nine months ended September 30, 2019 are attributable to our U.K. operations.

These decreases were partially offset by a 21% increase in terminal and hardware volume sales in our restaurant solutions market.

The term “disclosure controls and procedures,” as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act, means controls and other procedures of a company that are designed to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”).
Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to the company’s management, including its principal executive and principal financial officers, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.
Subsequently, our management, including our CEO and CFO, reevaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures and concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of December 31, 2018, March 31, 2019, and June 30, 2019, and continue to not be effective as of September 30, 2019 due to material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting as described below.
●  We did not design and maintain effective controls over user access within the Company’s ERP system, Oracle, to ensure appropriate segregation of duties and to adequately restrict user access to appropriate personnel.
●  We did not design and maintain effective controls over the completeness and accuracy of information included in key spreadsheets supporting our accounting records (the “Spreadsheet Control Weakness”).
●  To address the Spreadsheet Control Weakness, for each key spreadsheet using Oracle data, we plan to evaluate and determine (1) if a standard Oracle report exists containing the same information as the spreadsheet, and if so, we would utilize the standard Oracle report (without modification) instead of the spreadsheet to support our accounting records and (2) if a standard Oracle report cannot be used, we will implement a new key control whereby an employee performs a formal validation that the information from Oracle is completely and accurately transferred (automatically or manually) to a spreadsheet by verifying totals and other information on a test basis.

The United Kingdom’s anticipated withdrawal from the European Union may have a negative effect on global economic conditions, financial markets and our business, including our U.K. subsidiary.
The actual effects of Brexit, which may be negative for our business, will depend upon many factors, including, but not limited to, the final results of the Brexit negotiations and whether the U.K. departs the E.U. with or without a withdrawal agreement.
Material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting have been identified, and if we are unable to implement and maintain effective internal control over financial reporting, or our independent registered public accounting firm is unable to provide an unqualified report thereon, we could be materially adversely affected.
Material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting existed as of September 30, 2019 regarding our internal controls over user access to ensure appropriate segregation of duties and to adequately restrict user access to appropriate personnel.
As a result of these material weaknesses, management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was not effective as of December 31, 2018.
