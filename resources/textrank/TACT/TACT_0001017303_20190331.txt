Assets and liabilities of such subsidiary have been translated at the end of period exchange rates, and related revenues and expenses have been translated at the exchange rate as of the date the transaction was recognized, with the resulting translation gain or loss recorded in “Accumulated other comprehensive loss, net of tax”, in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets and Condensed Consolidated Statements of Changes in Shareholders’ Equity.
As of March 31, 2019, $199 thousand of the accrued product warranty liability were classified as current in "Accrued liabilities" in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets and the remaining $54 thousand was classified as non-current in "Other liabilities".
The computation of diluted earnings per share excludes the effect of the potential exercise of stock awards, including stock options and restricted stock units, when the average market price of the common stock is lower than the exercise price of the related stock award during the period.
These outstanding stock awards are not included in the computation of diluted earnings per share because the effect would be anti-dilutive.
For the three months ended March 31, 2019 and 2018, there were 540 thousand and 147 thousand, respectively, of potentially dilutive shares consisting of stock awards that were excluded from the calculation of earnings per diluted share.
For the three months ended March 31, 2019, our Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.09 per share, totaling $668 thousand, which was paid on March 15, 2019 to common shareholders of record at the close of business on February 20, 2019.
The new standard requires lessees to apply a dual approach, classifying leases as either finance or operating leases based on the principle of whether or not the lease is effectively a financed purchase by the lessee.
This classification will determine whether lease expense is recognized based on an effective interest method or on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease, respectively.
A lessee is also required to record a right-of-use asset and a lease liability for all leases with a term of greater than 12 months regardless of their classification.
Leases with a term of 12 months or less will be accounted for similar to existing guidance for operating leases today.
If the lessor does not convey risks and rewards or control, the lease is treated as operating.
Under this transition practical expedient, we did not reassess lease classification, embedded leases or initial direct costs.
We have applied the practical expedient for short-term leases.
We have lease agreements that include lease and non-lease components, and we have not elected the practical expedients to combine these components for any of our leases.
Upon adoption of ASC 842, we recorded a $3.7 million right-of-use asset and a $3.9 million lease liability.
We enter into lease agreements for the use of real estate space and certain other equipment under operating leases and we have no financing leases.
Our leases are included in Right of use assets and Lease liabilities in our Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet.
Right of use assets represent our right to use an underlying asset for the lease term and lease liabilities represent our obligation to make lease payments arising from the lease.
Lease right of use assets and liabilities are recognized at the commencement date of the lease based on the present value of lease payments over the lease term.
As most of our leases do not provide an implicit rate, the Company determines its incremental borrowing rate by using the rate of interest that the Company would have to pay to borrow on a collateralized basis over a similar term, an amount equal to the lease payments in a similar economic environment.
Our lease right of use assets exclude lease incentives.
Our leases have remaining lease terms of one to eight years, some of which include options to extend.
The exercise of lease renewal options is at our sole discretion and our lease right of use assets and liabilities reflect only the options we are reasonably certain that we will exercise.
Lease expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term.

TransAct is a global leader in developing and selling software-driven technology and printing solutions for high growth markets including restaurant solutions, point of sale (“POS”) automation and banking, casino and gaming, lottery, and oil and gas.
Net sales for the first quarter of 2019 decreased $0.7 million, or 6%, from the same period in 2018.
Printer, terminal and other hardware sales volume decreased 11% to approximately 28,000 units driven primarily by a 27% decrease in unit volume from the POS automation and banking market and a 5% decrease in unit volume in the casino and gaming market.
The average selling price of our printers, terminals and other hardware increased 4% for the first quarter of 2019 compared to the first quarter of 2018 due primarily to lower POS automation and banking sales, which sell at a lower price than our other products.
International sales for the first quarter of 2019 increased $0.5 million, or 23%, from the same period in 2018 primarily due to increased sales in the international casino and gaming market.
The decrease in domestic restaurant solutions revenue for the first quarter of 2019 compared to the first quarter of 2018 was driven largely by lower sales of our AccuDate 9700 terminal to our former U.S. distributor.
This decrease was partially offset by increased sales of our AccuDate XL2e terminal, which has since been rebranded to the BOHA!
Additionally, during the first quarter of 2019, we recognized our first sales of BOHA!
We expect sales of our restaurant solutions products to increase in 2019 compared to 2018 following the launch of our new BOHA!
The decrease in domestic POS automation and banking product revenue for the first quarter of 2019 compared to the first quarter of 2018 was primarily driven by a 24% decrease in domestic sales of our Ithaca® 9000 printer, as sales to McDonald’s decreased for the first quarter of 2019 compared to the same period in 2018.
We expect sales of our Ithaca® 9000 to McDonald’s to decrease in 2019 compared to 2018.
International casino and gaming product sales increased for the first quarter of 2019 compared to the first quarter of 2018 due to a 77% increase in sales of our thermal casino printers largely to customers in Asia.
This increase was partially offset by a 70% decline in international sales of our off-premise gaming printers to Europe, Australia and Asia.
Sales of our off-premise gaming printers are largely project-oriented and therefore may fluctuate significantly from quarter-to-quarter and year-to-year.
We expect domestic and international casino and gaming sales in 2019 to be relatively consistent with the sales levels achieved during 2018.
The increase in sales of Printrex printers for the first quarter of 2019 compared to the first quarter of 2018 resulted from higher domestic and international sales in the oil and gas market.
We expect total Printrex sales to increase slightly for 2019 compared to 2018, as we expect to benefit from a continued modest recovery in the oil and gas industry.
The increase in domestic revenue from TSG for the first quarter of 2019 as compared to the first quarter of 2018 was primarily due to an increase in label sales and increased service revenue related to our restaurant solutions products.
Sales of our restaurant solutions labels were five times higher on a growing installed base of AccuDate and BOHA!
Service revenue also increased 24% for the first quarter of 2019 compared to the first quarter of 2018.
Additionally, we had a 18% increase in sales of our legacy HP inkjet cartridges used in our banking printers.
These increases were offset by a 31% decrease in sales of lottery printer spare parts to IGT.
Based on our backlog of orders and contractual commitments for replacement parts, primarily from IGT, for our installed base of lottery printers, we expect TSG sales to decrease in 2019 compared to 2018.
Internationally, TSG revenue increased for the first quarter of 2019 compared to the first quarter of 2018 primarily due to a 102% increase in sales of replacement parts and accessories to international casino and gaming customers.
Gross profit is measured as revenue less cost of sales, which includes primarily the cost of all raw materials and component parts, direct labor, manufacturing overhead expenses, cost of finished products purchased directly from our contract manufacturers and expenses associated with installations of our EPICENTRALTM print system.
For the first quarter of 2019, gross profit increased $224 thousand, or 4%, despite a sales decrease of 6% for the first quarter in 2019 compared to the first quarter of 2018.
Our gross margin increased 480 basis points, increasing to 52.7% for the first quarter of 2019 compared to 47.9% for the first quarter of 2018.
The increased gross margin reflects a favorable shift in sales mix towards higher-value, technology driven solutions, as well as lower sales of POS printers, which carry lower margins than our other products.
We recorded net interest expense of $6 thousand for the first quarter of 2019 compared to $8 thousand for the first quarter of 2018.
The increase in other income was due to higher foreign currency exchange gains recorded by our U.K. subsidiary for the first quarter of 2019 compared to the first quarter of 2018.
We ended the first quarter of 2019 with $1.9 million in cash and cash equivalents, of which $0.5 million was held by our U.K. subsidiary, and no debt outstanding.
●  Accounts receivable decreased $1.2 million, or 15%, due to the collection of receivables for 2018 sales.
●  Inventory increased $1.5 million, or 12%, due to the buildup of inventory on hand to support future anticipated sales of BOHA!
●  Accounts payable decreased $1.3 million, or 36%, due primarily to inventory purchases made towards the end of the fourth quarter of 2018 that were subsequently paid in the first quarter of 2019.
●  Accounts receivable decreased $2.3 million, or 21%, due to the collection of past due receivables for 2017 sales made to our former international casino and gaming distributor.
●  Accounts payable decreased $0.7 million, or 19%, due primarily to higher inventory purchases made towards the end of the fourth quarter of 2017 compared to the first quarter of 2018 that were subsequently paid in the first quarter of 2018.
Our Board of Directors declared an increase to the quarterly cash dividend from $0.06 to $0.07 per share in May 2013, from $0.07 to $0.08 per share in May 2014, and from $0.08 to $0.09 per share in May 2017.
Dividends declared and paid on our common stock totaled $0.7 million or $0.09 per share in the first quarter of both 2019 and 2018.
Under the 2018 Stock Repurchase Program, we are authorized to repurchase up to $5 million of our outstanding shares of common stock from time to time in the open market at prevailing market prices based on market conditions, share price and other factors.
During the three months ended March 31, 2018, we repurchased 122,780 shares of our common stock for approximately $1.6 million at an average price per share of $12.72.
