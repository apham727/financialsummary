The computation of diluted earnings per share excludes the effect of the potential exercise of stock awards, including stock options and restricted stock units, when the average market price of the common stock is lower than the exercise price of the related stock award during the period.

For the three months ended June 30, 2018, dividends declared and paid totaled $663 thousand, or $0.09 per share.

The new standard requires lessees to apply a dual approach, classifying leases as either finance or operating leases based on the principle of whether or not the lease is effectively a financed purchase by the lessee.
This classification will determine whether lease expense is recognized based on an effective interest method or on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease, respectively.
A lessee is also required to record a right-of-use asset and a lease liability for all leases with a term of greater than 12 months regardless of their classification.
Leases with a term of 12 months or less will be accounted for based on existing guidance for operating leases.
We have applied the practical expedient for short-term leases.
Upon adoption of ASC 842, we recorded a $3.7 million right-of-use asset and a $3.9 million lease liability.
Our leases are included in Right of use assets and Lease liabilities in our Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet.
Right of use assets represent our right to use an underlying asset for the lease term and lease liabilities represent our obligation to make lease payments arising from the lease.
Lease right of use assets and liabilities are recognized at the commencement date of the lease based on the present value of lease payments over the lease term.
Our leases have remaining lease terms of one year to eight years, some of which include options to extend.
The exercise of lease renewal options is at our sole discretion and our lease right of use assets and liabilities reflect only the options we are reasonably certain that we will exercise.
For the six months ended June 30, 2019, we recorded an income tax provision of $89 thousand at an effective tax rate of 8.7%, compared to an income tax provision during the six months ended June 30, 2018 of $483 thousand at an effective tax rate of 20.4%.
The effective tax rate for the both the second quarter of 2019 and six months ended June 30, 2019 was lower as it included the foreign-derived intangible income (“FDII”) deduction under the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the “Tax Reform Act”) as well as near breakeven pre-tax income in the second quarter of 2019.
The FDII deduction was not included in the effective tax rate for the second quarter of 2018 or six months ended June 30, 2018 as the interpretive guidance for the deduction was not yet released.
As of June 30, 2019, we had $104 thousand of total gross unrecognized tax benefits that, if recognized, would favorably affect the effective income tax rate in any future periods.
We do not, however, expect Brexit to have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations as 15% and 10% of our total revenues for the three and six months ended June 30, 2019, respectively, are attributable to our U.K. operations.

The decrease in domestic sales of our casino and gaming products for the second quarter of 2019 compared to the second quarter of 2018 was due largely to lower sales of our off-premise gaming printers.
This decrease was partially offset by a slight increase in domestic sales of our thermal casino printer during the second quarter of 2019 compared to the second quarter of 2018.
Internationally, TSG revenue increased for the second quarter of 2019 compared to the second quarter of 2018 primarily due to a 50% increase in sales of replacement parts and accessories to international casino and gaming customers.
General and administrative expenses increased $80 thousand, or 4%, for the second quarter of 2019 compared to the second quarter of 2018 due primarily to higher professional and legal expenses.

The decrease in domestic restaurant solutions terminal sales in the first half of 2019 compared to the first half of 2018 was driven by lower sales of our AccuDate 9700 terminal to our former U.S. distributor and lower sales of our BOHA!
This decrease was partially offset by increased sales of our AccuDate Pro terminal.
International restaurant solutions sales increased during the first half of 2019 compared to the first half of 2018 due to increased sales of the AccuDate 9700 terminal through our Asian and European distributors.
The decrease in domestic POS automation and banking sales in the first half of 2019 compared to the first half of 2018 was primarily driven by a 24% decrease in domestic sales of our Ithaca® 9000 printer, as sales to McDonald’s decreased during the first half of 2019 compared to the same period in 2018.

The decrease in domestic sales of our casino and gaming products for the first half of 2019 compared to the first half of 2018 was due primarily to a 94% decrease in domestic sales of our off-premise gaming printers to an OEM, which we do not expect to reoccur in 2019.
Domestic casino and gaming sales also decreased, although to a lesser extent, due to a 3% decrease in domestic sales of our thermal casino printers driven primarily by industry-wide weakness and a 62% decrease in domestic EPICENTRAL™ software sales, as we had no new installations during the first half of 2019 compared to one new installation during the same period for 2018.
The decrease in international sales in the first six months of 2019 compared to the first six months of 2018 was due primarily to a 30% decline in international sales of our off-premise gaming printers to Europe, Australia and Asia.
Sales of our off-premise gaming printers are largely project-oriented and therefore may fluctuate significantly from quarter-to-quarter and year-to-year.
International Printrex sales increased due to a 44% increase in international sales of our oil and gas printers during the first half of 2019 compared to the first half of 2018.
The decrease in domestic revenue from TSG for the first half of 2019 as compared to the first half of 2018 was due primarily to 42% lower sales of replacement parts due to lower sales of lottery printer spare parts to IGT.

The increased gross margin reflects a favorable shift in sales mix towards higher-value, technology-driven solutions, as well as lower sales of POS printers and lottery printers, which carry lower margins than our other products.
Our operating income decreased $1.4 million, or 56%, during the first six months of 2019 compared to the first six months of 2018 due to a decrease in sales of 15% and a 3% increase in operating expenses, partially offset by a 390 basis point increase of gross margin during the first six months of 2019 compared to the first six months of 2018.
●  Accounts receivable decreased $1.7 million, or 21%, due to the collection of receivables for 2018 sales and lower sales volume in the second quarter of 2019.
●  Inventories increased $1.4 million, or 11%, due to the buildup of inventory on hand to support future anticipated sales of BOHA!
●  Accounts payable increased $0.3 million, or 8%, due to the timing of inventory purchases made during the second quarter of 2019.
●  Accounts receivable decreased $0.7 million, or 6%, due largely to the collection of past due receivables for 2017 sales made to our former international casino and gaming distributor.
●  Inventories increased $2.5 million, or 28%, due to the buildup of inventory on hand to support future anticipated sales in the casino and gaming and restaurant solutions markets.

In 2016, the United Kingdom voted to depart from the European Union, known as Brexit and subsequently notified the European Council of its intention to leave the E.U. and began to negotiate the terms of the future relationship between the U.K. and the E.U. upon exit.
We have taken certain actions in response to Brexit and in anticipation of E.U. legal requirements and the U.K.’s separation from the E.U. The potential impact from Brexit on us and on our results of operations is unclear.
The actual effects of Brexit will depend upon many factors, including the final results of the Brexit negotiations.
We do not, however, expect Brexit to have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations as 15% and 10% of our total revenues for the three and six months ended June 30, 2019, respectively, are attributable to our U.K. operations.
However, we cannot predict the direction Brexit-related matters may take or the impact on our European operations, including our U.K. subsidiary.
