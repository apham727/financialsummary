The December 31, 2017 Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet data was derived from audited financial statements, but does not include all disclosures required by U.S. GAAP.
Assets and liabilities of such subsidiary have been translated at the end of period exchange rates, and related revenues and expenses have been translated at the weighted average exchange rates with the resulting translation gain or loss recorded in "Accumulated other comprehensive loss, net of tax", in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets.
The computation of diluted earnings per share excludes the effect of the potential exercise of stock awards, including stock options and restricted stock units, when the average market price of the common stock is lower than the exercise price of the related stock award during the period.
ASU No. 2014-09," Revenue from Contracts with Customers" and its related amendments (collectively, ASC 606) are effective for reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, and interim periods therein.
In accordance with ASC 606, a performance obligation is a promise in a contract with a customer to transfer a distinct good or service to the customer.
Some of our contracts with customers contain a single performance obligation, while other contracts contain multiple performance obligations (most commonly when contracts include product and extended warranties).
A contract's transaction price is allocated to each distinct performance obligation and recognized as revenue when, or as, the performance obligation is satisfied.
When there are multiple performance obligations within a contract, we allocate the transaction price to each performance obligation based on its standalone selling price.
The transaction price is determined based on the consideration to which the Company will be entitled in exchange for transferring services to the customer.
To the extent the transaction price includes variable consideration, such as price protection, reserves for returns and other allowances, the Company estimates the amount of variable consideration that should be included in the transaction price utilizing either the "expected value" method or the "most likely amount" method depending on the nature of the variable consideration.
Variable consideration is included in the transaction price if, in the Company's judgment, it is probable that a significant future reversal of cumulative revenue under the contract will not occur.
The transaction price is recognized upon shipment of the order when control of the goods is transferred to the customer and at the time the performance obligation is fulfilled.
The transaction prices from EPICENTRAL™ software license and hardware are recognized upon installation and formal acceptance by the customer when control of the license is transferred to the customer.
For out-of-warranty repairs, the transaction price is recognized after completion of the repair work is completed and the printer or terminal is returned to the customer, as control of the product is transferred to the customer.
For our separately priced extended warranty and maintenance agreements (including free one-year maintenance received by the customers upon completion of EPICENTRAL™ installation) revenue is recognized over-time as the customer receives the benefit.
The transaction price from the maintenance services is recognized ratably over-time, using output methods, as control of the services is transferred to the customer.
For extended warranties, the transaction price is recognized ratably over the warranty period, using output methods, as control of the services is transferred to the customer.
In the cases where there is more than one performance obligation in a customer arrangement, the Company typically uses the "standalone selling price" method to determine the transaction price to allocate to each performance obligation.
The Company sells the performance obligations separately and has established standalone selling prices for its products and services.
To determine the standalone selling price for initial EPICENTRAL™ installations, the Company uses the adjusted market assessment approach.
The adoption of the ASC 606 did not require the Company to record an adjustment to retained earnings at January 1, 2018 and did not have an impact on the consolidated income statement during the first six months of 2018, basic or diluted earnings per share, consolidated statement of cash flows or consolidated balance sheet at June 30, 2018.
The Company applied the practical expedient for contracts with customers for a term of twelve months or less, in accordance with ASC 340-40-25-4, which allows TransAct to continue to expense sales commissions as incurred, since the expected amortization period of the cost to obtain a contract is less than 12 months.
Remaining performance obligations represents the transaction price of firm orders for which a good or service has not been delivered to our customer.
As of June 30, 2018, the aggregate amount of the transaction price allocated to remaining performance obligations was $6.0 million.
The Company expects to recognize revenue on $5.0 million of our remaining performance obligations within the next twelve months, with the balance of these remaining performance obligations recognized within the next 24 months.

Net sales for the second quarter of 2018 increased $1.2 million, or 8%, from the same period in 2017.
Printer and terminal sales volume increased 6% to approximately 39 thousand units driven primarily by an 81% increase in unit volume from the casino and gaming market and, to a lesser extent, a 14% increase in unit volume from the POS automation and banking market.
The average selling price of our printers and terminals increased 7% in the second quarter of 2018 compared to the second quarter of 2018 due primarily to lower lottery printer sales.
International sales for the second quarter of 2018 increased $2.3 million, or 221%, from the same period in 2017 due primarily to a 267% increase in sales in the international casino and gaming market.
The increase in domestic restaurant solutions terminal sales in the second quarter of 2018 compared to the second quarter of 2017 was driven by the initial shipments of the AccuDate XL to two existing customers in support of large-scale, multi-quarter rollouts of the terminal.
This increase was partially offset by decreased sales of our AccuDate 9700 terminal to our former U.S. distributor during the second quarter of 2018 compared to the second quarter of 2017.
We expect sales of our restaurant solutions terminals to continue to increase in 2018 compared to 2017 as we benefit from the strategic selling and marketing investments implemented during 2017.
The increase in both domestic and international POS automation and banking product revenue from the second quarter of 2017 was driven by an 21% increase in sales of our Ithaca® 9000 printer, as sales to McDonald's have returned to the near record levels experienced during 2017.
This increase was partially offset by 71% lower sales of our legacy banking and other POS printers for the second quarter of 2018 compared to the second quarter of 2017.
The increase in international sales in the second quarter of 2018 compared to the second quarter of 2017 was due to a 366% increase in sales of our thermal casino printers and a 153% increase in sales of our off-premise gaming printers in Europe, Australia and Asia.
We expect international sales of both our thermal casino printers and off-premise gaming printers to continue to increase in the second half of 2018, as we benefit from the transition to selling directly to slot machine manufacturers and end user casino and gaming customers in Europe.
The increase in sales of Printrex printers in the second quarter of 2018 compared to second quarter of 2017 resulted from a 84% increase in domestic and international sales of our oil and gas printers.
This increase was partially offset by 76% lower sales of our medical and mobile printers in the second quarter of 2018 compared to the second quarter of 2017.
We expect Printrex sales for the full year of 2018 to be higher than 2017, as we expect a continued modest recovery in the global oil and gas industry to more than offset lower expected sales of medical and mobile printers as we shift our focus to our higher value, technology-enabled restaurant solutions and casino and gaming products.
Internationally, TSG revenue increased due to a 98% increase in sales of replacement parts and accessories in the second quarter of 2018 compared to the second quarter of 2017.
Such expenses increased by $45 thousand, or 2%, in the second quarter of 2018 compared to the second quarter of 2017 due primarily to the hiring of additional sales staff in the U.K. to support our new direct selling model for the casino and gaming market in Europe.
This increase was partially offset by the retirement of our EVP, Sales and Marketing in December 2017, whose position was replaced by an existing employee of TransAct, as well as the elimination of commission expense to our former international casino and gaming distributor, Suzo-Happ.
We expect selling and marketing expenses to be higher in 2018 compared to 2017 due to the build-out of our internal sales infrastructure to sell directly to slot machine manufacturers and end user casino and gaming customers in Europe during 2018.
We expect general and administrative expenses in 2018 to be higher than 2017 due to increased recruiting expenses related to the expansion our restaurant solutions sales staff, sales staff for our European casino and gaming market, and engineering staff.
Our operating income increased $312 thousand, or 24%, in the second quarter of 2018 compared to the second quarter of 2017, and our operating margin increased to 11% of net sales largely due to higher gross profit resulting from an 8% increase in sales, as well as proportionately lower operating expenses as a percentage of net sales, in the second quarter of 2018 compared to the prior year period.
Printer sales volume decreased by 12% to approximately 70,000 units in the first half of 2018 driven primarily by an 81% decrease in unit volume from the lottery market and, to a lesser extent, a 10% decrease in the POS automation and banking market.
These decreases were partially offset by an increase in sales volume of 38% in the casino and gaming market and, to a lesser extent, a 32% increase in unit volume from the restaurant solutions market.
Although unit volume decreased in the first six months of 2018 primarily due to the decreased volume of lottery printers sold during the first half of 2018, which carry lower prices than our other products, the average selling price of our printers increased 11% during the first half of 2018 compared to the first half of 2017.
International sales increased $920 thousand, or 20%, primarily driven by 65% higher international sales in the casino and gaming market.
This increase was partially offset by a $1.1 million sales decrease in our international lottery market during the first half of 2018 compared to the first half of 2017.
The increase in domestic restaurant solutions terminal sales in the first half of 2018 compared to the first half of 2017 was primarily driven by increased sales of our AccuDate 9700 terminal during the first half of 2018 and the initial shipments of the AccuDate XL to two large corporate customers in support of a large-scale, multi-quarter rollouts of the terminal.
International restaurant solutions sales increased during the first half of 2018 compared to the first half of 2017 due to increased sales of the AccuDate 9700 for McDonald's through our Asian distributor.
The decrease in domestic POS automation and banking sales in the first half of 2018 compared to the first half of 2017 was primarily driven by a 72% decrease in sales of our legacy banking and other POS printers during the first half of 2018 as we continue to deemphasize these products.
Sales also decreased during the first half of 2018 compared to the first half of 2017 due to a 7% decline in sales of our Ithaca® 9000 printer due to lower sales to McDonald's in the first quarter of 2018, but which subsequently rebounded to prior year, near-record levels in the second quarter of 2018.
International sales increased due to higher sales of our Ithaca® 9000 printer to our Canadian distributor for McDonald's during the first half of 2018 compared to the first half of 2017.
The increase in international sales in the first half of 2018 compared to the first half of 2017 was due to a 118% increase of thermal casino printer sales and, to a lesser extent, a 13% increase in international sales of off-premise gaming printers.
The increase in domestic Printrex sales in the first half of 2018 compared to the first half of 2017 resulted from higher domestic sales in the oil and gas market due to a continued recovery in the oil and gas market.
This increase was partially offset by lower sales of domestic medical and mobile printers in the first half of 2018 compared to the first half of 2017 as we shift our focus away from the medical and mobile markets to our higher value, technology-enabled restaurant solutions and casino and gaming products.
Internationally, TSG revenue increased primarily due to a 57% increase in sales of replacement parts and accessories in the first half of 2018 compared to the first half of 2017.
Engineering, design and product development expenses increased $391 thousand, or 19%, in the first half of 2018 compared to the first half of 2017 due primarily to the hiring of additional engineering staff and increased expenses related to product development for the restaurant solutions and casino and gaming markets.
Our operating income decreased by $248 thousand, or 9%, during the first half of 2018 compared to the first half of 2017 primarily due to a 2% decrease in sales and a 6% increase in operating expenses, somewhat offset by a 220 basis point increase in gross margin in the first half of 2018 compared to the first half of 2017.
●  Inventories increased $2.5 million, or 28%, due to the buildup of inventory on hand to support future anticipated sales in the casino and gaming and restaurant solutions markets.
●  Accounts payable decreased $1.5 million, or 31%, due primarily to increased inventory purchases towards the end of the fourth quarter of 2016 and subsequently paid in the first half of 2017.
