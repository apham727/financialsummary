Acquisitions may also result in charges (such as acquisition-related expenses, write-offs, restructuring charges, or future impairment of goodwill), contingent liabilities, adverse tax consequences, additional share-based compensation expense and other charges that adversely affect our operating results.
Such obligations may have a material adverse impact on our results of operations and financial condition.
We may be unable to maintain average selling prices for our products as a result of increased pricing pressure in the future, which could adversely impact our operating results.
Our future operating results could suffer if any contractor were to experience financial, operational or production difficulties or situations when demand exceeds capacity, or if they were unable to maintain manufacturing yields, assembly and test yields and costs at approximately their current levels, or if the countries in which such contractors are located were to experience political upheaval or infrastructure disruption.
In any such event, we could experience an interruption in production, an increase in manufacturing and production costs or a decline in product reliability, and our business and operating results could be adversely affected.
Any future adverse conditions in the U.S. or global economies or in the U.S. or global credit markets could materially impact the operations of our distributors.
Any deterioration in the financial condition of our distributors or any disruption in the operations of our distributors could adversely impact the flow of our products to our end customers and adversely impact our results of operation.
We may be unable to timely design, develop and introduce competitive products, which could adversely impact our future operating results.
The materials, components and equipment necessary for their businesses could become more difficult to obtain for various reasons not limited to business interruptions of suppliers, consolidation in their supply chain due to mergers and acquisitions, or application of trade restrictions or tariffs that impair sourcing flexibility or increase costs.
Our reported financial results may be adversely affected by new accounting pronouncements or changes in existing accounting standards and practices, including ASC 606 which impacts our revenue recognition.
The financial failure of a large licensee, customer or distributor, an important supplier, or a group thereof, could have an adverse impact on our operating results and could result in our not being able to collect our accounts receivable balances, higher reserves for doubtful accounts, write-offs for accounts receivable, and higher operating costs as a percentage of net sales.
We have taken steps to mitigate the impact of these tariffs on our products; however, there remains a possibility of future tariffs imposed by the U.S., China or other countries that could have a material adverse effect on our products.
Future sales to U.S. government agencies or customers are also subject to uncertain government appropriations and national defense policies and priorities, including the constraints of the budgetary process, changes in the timing and potential spending priorities and the impact of any past or future government shutdowns, contract terminations or renegotiations, or future sequestrations.
Further delays, reductions in or terminations of government contracts or subcontracts, including those caused by any past or future shutdown of the U.S. federal government, could materially and adversely affect our operating results.
If the U.S. government fails to complete its annual budget process or to provide for a continuing resolution to fund government operations, another federal government shutdown may soon occur, during which time we may experience further delays and reductions in appropriations or reductions in or terminations of government contracts or subcontracts, which could materially and adversely affect our operating results.
While we generally function as a subcontractor in these type of transactions, further changes in U.S. government procurement regulations and practices, particularly surrounding initiatives to reduce costs, may adversely impact the contracting environment and our operating results.
Any failure to maintain compliance with these requirements may result in fines and penalties and loss of current or future business that may materially and adversely affect our operating results.
Nevertheless, in periods when the U.S. dollar significantly fluctuates in relation to the non-U.S. currencies in which we transact business, the value of our non-U.S. dollar transactions can have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.
Although our business has not been materially adversely impacted by recent changes in the value of the U.S. dollar, there can be no assurance as to the future impact that any weakness or strength in the U.S. dollar will have on our business or results of operations.
Any significant disruption to our systems or networks, including, but not limited to, new system implementations, computer viruses, security breaches, facility issues, natural disasters, terrorism, war, telecommunication failures or energy blackouts could have a material adverse impact on our operations, sales and operating results.
Any such loss of data by our third-party service providers could negatively impact our business, operations and financial results, as well as our relationship with our customers.
If we fail to remediate these significant deficiencies or to maintain proper and effective internal control over financial reporting in the future, our ability to produce accurate and timely financial statements could be impaired, which could harm our operating results, harm our ability to operate our business and reduce the trading price of our stock.
Our failure to comply with applicable regulations could result in fines, suspension of production, cessation of operations or future liabilities.
Such failure could also restrict our ability to ship certain products to certain countries, require us to modify our operations' logistics, or require us to incur other significant costs and expenses.
It may be difficult for us to timely comply with these laws and we may not have sufficient quantities of compliant products to meet customers' needs, thereby adversely impacting our sales and profitability.
In addition, we anticipate increased customer requirements to meet voluntary criteria related to the reduction or elimination of substances of high concern in our products, energy efficiency measures, and supplier practices associated with sourcing and manufacturing.
Our relationships with customers and suppliers may be adversely affected if we are unable to certify that our products are "conflict-free." We have incurred, and expect in the future to incur, additional costs associated with complying with these new disclosure requirements, such as costs related to determining the source of any conflict minerals used in our products.
In addition to local jurisdictions' trade regulations, our U.S.-manufactured products or products based on U.S. technology are subject to U.S. laws and regulations governing international trade, including, but not limited to the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, Export Administration Regulations (EAR), International Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR) and trade sanctions against embargoed countries and denied entities administered by the U.S. Department of the Treasury, Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC).
Any one or more of these sanctions or a change in laws or regulations could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
Currently, a majority of our revenue is generated from customers located outside the U.S., and a substantial portion of our assets, including employees, are located outside of the U.S. The adoption of the Act significantly changed the taxation of U.S.-based multinational corporations, by, among other things, reducing the U.S. corporate income tax rate, adopting elements of a territorial tax system, assessing a one-time transition tax on earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries that were previously tax deferred, and creating new taxes on certain foreign-sourced earnings.
A significant portion of our earnings are earned by our subsidiaries outside the U.S. Changes to the taxation of certain foreign earnings resulting from the Act, along with the state tax impact of these changes and potential future cash distributions, will likely have an adverse effect on our effective tax rate.
The foregoing items could have a material adverse effect on our business, cash flow, results of operations or financial conditions.
If we are unable to comply with the terms of those grants, we may not be able to receive or recognize grant benefits or we may be required to repay grant benefits previously paid to us and recognize related charges, which would adversely affect our operating results and financial position.
Climate change regulations and sustained adverse climate change pose regulatory and physical risks that could harm our results of operations or affect the way we conduct business.

Deferred income on shipments to distributors effectively represented the gross margin on the sale to the distributor; however, the amount of gross margin that we recognized in the subsequent periods was less than the deferred margin as a result of credits granted to distributors on specifically identified products and customers to allow the distributors to earn a competitive gross margin on the sale of our products to their end customers and price protection concessions related to market pricing conditions.
The effect of granting these credits established the net selling price to our distributors for the product and resulted in the net revenue recognized by us when the product was sold by the distributors to their end customers.
Total share-based compensation during the nine months ended December 31, 2018 was $127.5 million, of which $116.6 million was reflected in operating expenses and $10.9 million was reflected in cost of sales.
There was no charge to cost of sales for reduced production levels in each of the nine month periods ended December 31, 2018 and 2017.
Microcontrollers and associated application development systems accounted for approximately 52.2% and 55.2% of our net sales for the three and nine months ended December 31, 2018, respectively, compared to approximately 66.5% and 66.0% of our net sales for the three and nine months ended December 31, 2017, respectively.
Net sales of our microcontroller products increased 8.5% and 13.1% in the three and nine months ended December 31, 2018, respectively, compared to the three and nine months ended December 31, 2017.
Sales of our analog, interface, mixed signal and timing products accounted for approximately 28.8% and 28.6% of our net sales for the three and nine months ended December 31, 2018, respectively, compared to approximately 23.3% and 23.8% of our net sales for the three and nine months ended December 31, 2017, respectively.
The increases are due to our acquisition of Microsemi, whose analog, interface, mixed signal and timing product line accounted for a relatively higher percentage of its total net sales.
Net sales of our analog, interface, mixed signal and timing products increased 71.3% and 61.7% in the three and nine months ended December 31, 2018, respectively, compared to the three and nine months ended December 31, 2017.
Sales of our FPGA products accounted for approximately 7.1% and 5.1%, respectively, of our net sales in the three and nine months ended December 31, 2018.
Sales of our memory products accounted for approximately 3.2% and 3.5% of our net sales for the three and nine months ended December 31, 2018, respectively, compared to approximately 4.8% and 5.0% of our net sales for the three and nine months ended December 31, 2017, respectively.
Net sales of our memory products decreased 8.7% and 5.1% in the three and nine months ended December 31, 2018, respectively, compared to the three and nine months ended December 31, 2017.
Technology licensing accounted for approximately 3.2% and 2.7% of our net sales for the three and nine months ended December 31, 2018, respectively, compared to approximately 2.8% and 2.6% of our net sales for the three and nine months ended December 31, 2017, respectively.
Net sales related to our technology licensing increased 57.8% and 38.3% in the three and nine months ended December 31, 2018, respectively, compared to the three and nine months ended December 31, 2017.
Revenue from these services and products accounted for approximately 5.5% and 4.9% of our net sales for the three and nine months ended December 31, 2018, respectively, compared to approximately 2.6% of our net sales for each of the three and nine months ended December 31, 2017.
Net sales related to these services and products increased 191.6% and 150.1% in the three and nine months ended December 31, 2018 compared to the three and nine months ended December 31, 2017.
Distributors accounted for approximately 49.9% and 50.9% of our net sales in the three and nine months ended December 31, 2018 and approximately 53.7% and 54.2% of our net sales in the three and nine months ended December 31, 2017.
The decreases in these percentages in the periods ended December 31, 2018 compared to the periods ended December 31, 2017 are due to our acquisition of Microsemi, whose distributors accounted for a smaller portion of net sales than Microchip's historical business.
Sales to foreign customers accounted for approximately 80% and 81% of our total net sales in the three and nine months ended December 31, 2018 compared to approximately 85% of our total net sales in each of the three and nine months ended December 31, 2017.
Sales to customers in Asia have generally increased over time due to many of our customers transitioning their manufacturing operations to Asia and growth in demand from the emerging Asian market; however, sales to Asia as a percentage of our total net sales decreased in the three and nine months ended December 31, 2018 compared to the three and nine months ended December 31, 2017 due to our acquisition of Microsemi, whose sales to customers in Asia accounted for a smaller portion of their total net sales than Microchip's historical business, and to a lesser extent, trade restrictions and changes in tariffs.
Sales to customers in the Americas increased as a percentage of total sales in the three and nine months ended December 31, 2018 compared to the three and nine months ended December 31, 2017 due to our acquisition of Microsemi, which had more concentration in the aerospace and defense industry in the Americas.
•charges of approximately $86.0 million and $375.7 million, respectively, in the three and nine months ended December 31, 2018, related to the recognition of acquired inventory at fair value as a result of our acquisition of Microsemi which increased the value of our acquired inventory and subsequently increased our cost of sales and reduced our gross margins when the related revenue was recognized;
During the three and nine months ended December 31, 2017, our wafer fabrication facilities and assembly and test facilities operated at normal capacity levels.
The decreases in the percentage of assembly and test work that was performed internally in the three and nine months ended December 31, 2018 compared to the three and nine months ended December 31, 2017 were primarily due to our acquisition of Microsemi, which outsources substantially all of its assembly and test requirements.
Approximately 60% and 56% of our net sales came from products that were produced at outside wafer foundries in the three and nine months ended December 31, 2018, respectively, compared to 43% and 42% in the three and nine months ended December 31, 2017.
Selling, general and administrative expenses for the three months ended December 31, 2018 were $174.8 million, or 12.7% of net sales, compared to $109.1 million, or 11.0% of net sales, for the three months ended December 31, 2017.
Selling, general and administrative expenses for the nine months ended December 31, 2018 were $515.5 million, or 12.8% of net sales, compared to $337.6 million, or 11.3% of net sales, for the nine months ended December 31, 2017.
Selling, general and administrative expenses increased $65.7 million, or 60.2%, for the three months ended December 31, 2018 over the same period last year.
Selling, general and administrative expenses increased $177.9 million, or 52.7%, for the nine months ended December 31, 2018 over the same period last year.
The primary reasons for the increases in selling, general and administrative expenses were additional costs from our acquisition of Microsemi, including approximately $4.8 million and $36.3 million of acquisition-related legal and professional service expenses in the three and nine months ended December 31, 2018, respectively.
During the nine months ended December 31, 2018, we used a substantial portion of our cash to help finance the purchase price of our acquisition of Microsemi, which closed on May 29, 2018.
The decrease in cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments over this time period is primarily attributable to $1.74 billion in cash and $8.40 billion from additional debt to fund our acquisition of Microsemi and payoff Microsemi’s existing debt, partially offset by proceeds from new debt issuances of $4.99 billion, net borrowings of $3.33 billion on our Credit Facility and cash generated by operating activities.
We may increase our borrowings under our Credit Facility or seek additional equity or debt financing from time to time to maintain or expand our wafer fabrication and product assembly and test facilities, for cash dividends, for share repurchases or for acquisitions or other purposes.
