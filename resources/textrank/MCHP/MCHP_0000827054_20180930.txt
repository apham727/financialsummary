Acquisitions may also result in charges (such as acquisition-related expenses, write-offs, restructuring charges, or future impairment of goodwill), contingent liabilities, adverse tax consequences, additional share-based compensation expense and other charges that adversely affect our operating results.
Such obligations may have a material adverse impact on our results of operations and financial condition.
We may be unable to maintain average selling prices for our products as a result of increased pricing pressure in the future, which could adversely impact our operating results.
Our future operating results could suffer if any contractor were to experience financial, operational or production difficulties or situations when demand exceeds capacity, or if they were unable to maintain manufacturing yields, assembly and test yields and costs at approximately their current levels, or if the countries in which such contractors are located were to experience political upheaval or infrastructure disruption.
In any such event, we could experience an interruption in production, an increase in manufacturing and production costs or a decline in product reliability, and our business and operating results could be adversely affected.
If our licensees were to experience any disruption in supply from outside wafer foundries, this would reduce the revenue we receive in our technology licensing business and would harm our operating results.
Any deterioration in the financial condition of our distributors or any disruption in the operations of our distributors could adversely impact the flow of our products to our end customers and adversely impact our results of operation.
We may be unable to timely design, develop and introduce competitive products, which could adversely impact our future operating results.
The materials, components and equipment necessary for their businesses could become more difficult to obtain for various reasons not limited to business interruptions of suppliers, consolidation in their supply chain due to mergers and acquisitions, or application of trade restrictions or tariffs that impair sourcing flexibility or increase costs.
Our reported financial results may be adversely affected by new accounting pronouncements or changes in existing accounting standards and practices, including ASC 606 which impacts our revenue recognition.
The financial failure of a large licensee, customer or distributor, an important supplier, or a group thereof, could have an adverse impact on our operating results and could result in our not being able to collect our accounts receivable balances, higher reserves for doubtful accounts, write-offs for accounts receivable, and higher operating costs as a percentage of net sales.
Any failure to maintain compliance with these requirements may result in fines and penalties and loss of current or future business that may materially and adversely affect our operating results.
Nevertheless, in periods when the U.S. dollar significantly fluctuates in relation to the non-U.S. currencies in which we transact business, the value of our non-U.S. dollar transactions can have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.
Although our business has not been materially adversely impacted by recent changes in the value of the U.S. dollar, there can be no assurance as to the future impact that any weakness or strength in the U.S. dollar will have on our business or results of operations.
Any significant disruption to our systems or networks, including, but not limited to, new system implementations, computer viruses, security breaches, facility issues, natural disasters, terrorism, war, telecommunication failures or energy blackouts could have a material adverse impact on our operations, sales and operating results.
Such attacks or disruptions could have a material adverse impact on our business, operations and financial results.
Any such loss of data by our third-party service providers could negatively impact our business, operations and financial results, as well as our relationship with our customers.
If we fail to remediate these significant deficiencies or to maintain proper and effective internal control over financial reporting in the future, our ability to produce accurate and timely financial statements could be impaired, which could harm our operating results, harm our ability to operate our business and reduce the trading price of our stock.
Our failure to comply with applicable regulations could result in fines, suspension of production, cessation of operations or future liabilities.
Such failure could also restrict our ability to ship certain products to certain countries, require us to modify our operations' logistics, or require us to incur other significant costs and expenses.
It may be difficult for us to timely comply with these laws and we may not have sufficient quantities of compliant products to meet customers' needs, thereby adversely impacting our sales and profitability.
Some of our customers and potential customers are requiring that we implement operating practices that are more stringent than what is required by applicable laws with respect to workplace and labor requirements, the type of materials we use in our products, environmental matters or other items.
If we cannot certify that we are using conflict-free minerals, customers may demand that we change the sourcing of minerals and other materials used in the manufacture of our products, even if the costs for compliant minerals and materials significantly increases and availability is limited.
Our relationships with customers and suppliers may be adversely affected if we are unable to certify that our products are "conflict-free." We have incurred, and expect in the future to incur, additional costs associated with complying with these new disclosure requirements, such as costs related to determining the source of any conflict minerals used in our products.
Any one or more of these sanctions or a change in laws or regulations could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
There can be no assurance that the final determination of any of these or any future examinations will not have an adverse effect on our effective tax rates, financial position and results of operations.
Currently, a majority of our revenue is generated from customers located outside the U.S., and a substantial portion of our assets, including employees, are located outside of the U.S. Recently enacted U.S. tax legislation significantly changed the taxation of U.S.-based multinational corporations, by, among other things, reducing the U.S. corporate income tax rate, adopting elements of a territorial tax system, assessing a one-time transition tax on earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries that were previously tax deferred, and creating new taxes on certain foreign-sourced earnings.
A significant portion of our earnings are earned by our subsidiaries outside the U.S. Changes to the taxation of certain foreign earnings resulting from the newly enacted U.S. tax legislation, along with the state tax impact of these changes and potential future cash distributions, will likely have an adverse effect on our effective tax rate.
The foregoing items could have a material adverse effect on our business, cash flow, results of operations or financial conditions.
If we are unable to comply with the terms of those grants, we may not be able to receive or recognize grant benefits or we may be required to repay grant benefits previously paid to us and recognize related charges, which would adversely affect our operating results and financial position.
Climate change regulations and sustained adverse climate change pose regulatory and physical risks that could harm our results of operations or affect the way we conduct business.
These regulations could significantly increase our costs and restrict our manufacturing operations by virtue of requirements for new equipment.
The cost of complying, or of failing to comply, with these and other climate change and emissions regulations could have an adverse effect on our operating results.

Deferred income on shipments to distributors effectively represented the gross margin on the sale to the distributor; however, the amount of gross margin that we recognized in the subsequent periods was less than the deferred margin as a result of credits granted to distributors on specifically identified products and customers to allow the distributors to earn a competitive gross margin on the sale of our products to their end customers and price protection concessions related to market pricing conditions.
The effect of granting these credits established the net selling price to our distributors for the product and resulted in the net revenue recognized by us when the product was sold by the distributors to their end customers.
Total share-based compensation during the six months ended September 30, 2018 was $87.9 million, of which $80.4 million was reflected in operating expenses and $7.5 million was reflected in cost of sales.
There was no charge to cost of sales for reduced production levels in each of the six month periods ended September 30, 2018 and 2017.
The increases in net sales in the three and six months ended September 30, 2018 compared to the three and six months ended September 30, 2017 were due primarily to our acquisition of Microsemi.
The overall average selling price of our products increased significantly during the three and six months ended September 30, 2018 compared to the three and six months ended September 30, 2017 due to our acquisition of Microsemi, whose average selling price is higher than the average selling price of our historical business due to the types of products they offer and the types of customers and markets they serve.
Microcontrollers and associated application development systems accounted for approximately 54.3% and 56.7% of our net sales for the three and six months ended September 30, 2018, respectively, compared to approximately 65.9% and 65.5% of our net sales for the three and six months ended September 30, 2017, respectively.
The decrease is due to our acquisition of Microsemi, whose microcontroller product line accounted for a relatively lower percentage of its total net sales.
Net sales of our microcontroller products increased 17.0% and 15.4% in the three and six months ended September 30, 2018, respectively, compared to the three and six months ended September 30, 2017.
Sales of our analog, interface, mixed signal and timing products accounted for approximately 29.3% and 28.4% of our net sales for the three and six months ended September 30, 2018, respectively, compared to approximately 23.6% and 24.1% of our net sales for the three and six months ended September 30, 2017, respectively.
The increase is due to our acquisition of Microsemi, whose analog, interface, mixed signal and timing product line accounted for a relatively higher percentage of its total net sales.
Net sales of our analog, interface, mixed signal and timing products increased 75.3% and 57.1% in the three and six months ended September 30, 2018, respectively, compared to the three and six months ended September 30, 2017.
Sales of our memory products accounted for approximately 3.4% and 3.7% of our net sales for the three and six months ended September 30, 2018, respectively, compared to approximately 5.1% of our net sales for each of the three and six months ended September 30, 2017, respectively.

Net sales related to our technology licensing increased 48.1% and 27.8% in the three and six months ended September 30, 2018, respectively, compared to the three and six months ended September 30, 2017.
Revenue from these services and products accounted for approximately 5.4% and 4.6% of our net sales for the three and six months ended September 30, 2018, respectively, compared to approximately 2.9% and 2.7% of our net sales for the three and six months ended September 30, 2017, respectively.
Net sales related to these services and products increased 160.4% and 129.1% in the three and six months ended September 30, 2018 compared to the three and six months ended September 30, 2017.
The decreases in these percentages in the periods ended September 30, 2018 compared to the periods ended September 30, 2017 are due to our acquisition of Microsemi, whose distributors accounted for a smaller portion of net sales than Microchip's historical business.
Prior to our adoption of ASU 2014-09-Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606) on April 1, 2018, we did not believe that inventory holding patterns at our distributors materially impacted our net sales due to the fact that we recognized revenue based on when the distributor sold the product to their customer.
Sales to foreign customers accounted for approximately 80% and 82% of our total net sales in the three and six months ended September 30, 2018 compared to approximately 84% of our total net sales in each of the three and six months ended September 30, 2017.
Sales to customers in Asia have generally increased over time due to many of our customers transitioning their manufacturing operations to Asia and growth in demand from the emerging Asian market; however, sales to Asia as a percentage of our total net sales decreased in the three and six months ended September 30, 2018 compared to the three and six months ended September 30, 2017 due to our acquisition of Microsemi, whose sales to customers in Asia accounted for a smaller portion of their total net sales than Microchip's historical business.
Sales to customers in Americas increased as a percentage of total sales in the three and six months ended September 30, 2018 compared to the three and six months ended September 30, 2017 due to our acquisition of Microsemi, which had more concentration in the aerospace and defense industry in the Americas.
•charges of approximately $182.1 million and $289.7 million, respectively, in the three and six months ended September 30, 2018, related to the recognition of acquired inventory at fair value as a result of our acquisition of Microsemi which increased the value of our acquired inventory and subsequently increased our cost of sales and reduced our gross margins when the related revenue was recognized;
The decreases in the percentage of assembly and test work that was performed internally in the three and six months ended September 30, 2018 compared to the three and six months ended September 30, 2017 were primarily due to our acquisition of Microsemi, which outsources substantially all of its assembly and test requirements.
Approximately 58% and 54% of our net sales came from products that were produced at outside wafer foundries in the three and six months ended September 30, 2018, respectively, compared to 42% in each of the three and six months ended September 30, 2017.
Selling, general and administrative expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2018 were $176.6 million, or 12.3% of net sales, compared to $114.3 million, or 11.3% of net sales, for the three months ended September 30, 2017.
Selling, general and administrative expenses for the six months ended September 30, 2018 were $340.7 million, or 12.9% of net sales, compared to $228.6 million, or 11.5% of net sales, for the six months ended September 30, 2017.
The primary reasons for the increases in selling, general and administrative expenses were additional costs from our acquisition of Microsemi, including approximately $5.2 million and $31.6 million of acquisition-related legal and professional service expenses in the three and six months ended September 30, 2018, respectively.
The special charges and other, net incurred in the three and six months ended September 30, 2018 is comprised primarily of $12.1 million and $57.2 million, respectively, of employee separation costs related to the Microsemi acquisition and impairment losses of $1.5 million and $3.5 million, respectively.
The decrease in cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments over this time period is primarily attributable to $1.74 billion in cash and $8.40 billion from additional debt to fund our acquisition of Microsemi and payoff Microsemi’s existing debt, partially offset by proceeds from new debt issuances of $4.99 billion, net borrowings of $3.33 billion on our credit facility and cash generated by operating activities.
We may increase our borrowings under our Credit Facility or seek additional equity or debt financing from time to time to maintain or expand our wafer fabrication and product assembly and test facilities, for cash dividends, for share repurchases or for acquisitions or other purposes.
