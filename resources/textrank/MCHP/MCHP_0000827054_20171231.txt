Acquisitions may also result in charges (such as acquisition-related expenses, write-offs, restructuring charges, or future impairment of goodwill), contingent liabilities, adverse tax consequences, additional share-based compensation expense and other charges that adversely affect our operating results.
Such obligations may have a material adverse impact on our results of operations and financial condition.
We may be unable to maintain average selling prices for our products as a result of increased pricing pressure in the future, which could adversely impact our operating results.
Our future operating results could suffer if any contractor were to experience financial, operational or production difficulties or situations when demand exceeds capacity, or if they were unable to maintain manufacturing yields, assembly and test yields and costs at approximately their current levels, or if the countries in which such contractors are located were to experience political upheaval or infrastructure disruption.
In any such event, we could experience an interruption in production, an increase in manufacturing and production costs or a decline in product reliability, and our business and operating results could be adversely affected.
If our licensees were to experience any disruption in supply from outside wafer foundries, this would reduce the revenue we receive in our technology licensing business and would harm our operating results.
Any future adverse conditions in the U.S. or global economies or in the U.S. or global credit markets could materially impact the operations of our distributors.
Any deterioration in the financial condition of our distributors or any disruption in the operations of our distributors could adversely impact the flow of our products to our end customers and adversely impact our results of operation.
In addition, during an industry or economic downturn, it is possible there will be an oversupply of products and a decrease in demand for our products from our distributors, which could reduce our net sales in a given period and result in an increase in inventory returns.
We may be unable to timely design, develop and introduce competitive products, which could adversely impact our future operating results.
The financial failure of a large licensee, customer or distributor, an important supplier, or a group thereof, could have an adverse impact on our operating results and could result in our not being able to collect our accounts receivable balances, higher reserves for doubtful accounts, write-offs for accounts receivable, and higher operating costs as a percentage of net sales.
Nevertheless, in periods when the U.S. dollar significantly fluctuates in relation to the non-U.S. currencies in which we transact business, the value of our non-U.S. dollar transactions can have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.
Although our business has not been materially adversely impacted by recent changes in the value of the U.S. dollar, there can be no assurance as to the future impact that the strength of the U.S. dollar will have on our business or results of operations.
Any significant disruption to our systems or networks, including, but not limited to, new system implementations, computer viruses, security breaches, facility issues, natural disasters, terrorism, war, telecommunication failures or energy blackouts could have a material adverse impact on our operations, sales and operating results.
Any such loss of data by our third-party service providers could negatively impact our business, operations and financial results, as well as our relationship with our customers.
Our failure to comply with applicable regulations could result in fines, suspension of production, cessation of operations or future liabilities.
Such failure could also restrict our ability to ship certain products to certain countries, require us to modify our operations' logistics, or require us to incur other significant costs and expenses.
It may be difficult for us to timely comply with these laws and we may not have sufficient quantities of compliant products to meet customers' needs, thereby adversely impacting our sales and profitability.
In addition, we anticipate increased customer requirements to meet voluntary criteria related to the reduction or elimination of substances of high concern in our products, energy efficiency measures, and supplier practices associated with sourcing and manufacturing.
Some of our customers and potential customers are requiring that we implement operating practices that are more stringent than what is required by applicable laws with respect to workplace and labor requirements, the type of materials we use in our products, environmental matters or other items.
If we cannot certify that we are using conflict-free minerals, customers may demand that we change the sourcing of minerals and other materials used in the manufacture of our products, even if the costs for compliant minerals and materials significantly increases and availability is limited.
Our relationships with customers and suppliers may be adversely affected if we are unable to certify that our products are "conflict-free." We have incurred, and expect in the future to incur, additional costs associated with complying with these new disclosure requirements, such as costs related to determining the source of any conflict minerals used in our products.
In addition to local jurisdictions' trade regulations, our U.S.-manufactured products or products based on U.S. technology are subject to U.S. laws and regulations governing international trade, including, but not limited to the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, Export Administration Regulations (EAR), International Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR) and trade sanctions against embargoed countries and denied entities administered by the U.S. Department of the Treasury, Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC).
Any one or more of these sanctions or a change in laws or regulations could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
Currently, a majority of our revenue is generated from customers located outside the U.S., and a substantial portion of our assets, including employees, are located outside of the U.S. Recently enacted U.S. tax legislation will significantly change the taxation of U.S.-based multinational corporations, by, among other things, reducing the U.S. corporate income tax rate, adopting elements of a territorial tax system, assessing a one-time transition tax on earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries that were previously tax deferred, and creating new taxes on certain foreign-sourced earnings.
A significant portion of our earnings are earned by our subsidiaries outside the U.S. Changes to the taxation of certain foreign earnings resulting from the newly enacted U.S. tax legislation, along with the state tax impact of these changes and potential future cash distributions, will likely have an adverse effect on our effective tax rate.
The foregoing items could have a material adverse effect on our business, cash flow, results of operations or financial conditions.
If we are unable to comply with the terms of those grants, we may not be able to receive or recognize grant benefits or we may be required to repay grant benefits previously paid to us and recognize related charges, which would adversely affect our operating results and financial position.
Climate change regulations and sustained adverse climate change pose regulatory and physical risks that could harm our results of operations or affect the way we conduct business.
These regulations could significantly increase our costs and restrict our manufacturing operations by virtue of requirements for new equipment.
The cost of complying, or of failing to comply, with these and other climate change and emissions regulations could have an adverse effect on our operating results.

In connection with our acquisition of Atmel, we acquired certain distributor relationships where revenue was recognized upon shipment to the distributors based on certain contractual terms or prevailing business practices that resulted in the price not being fixed and determinable at such time.
Deferred income on shipments to distributors effectively represents the gross margin on the sale to the distributor; however, the amount of gross margin that we recognize in future periods could be less than the deferred margin as a result of credits granted to distributors on specifically identified products and customers to allow the distributors to earn a competitive gross margin on the sale of our products to their end customers and price protection concessions related to market pricing conditions.
The effect of granting these credits establishes the net selling price to our distributors for the product and results in the net revenue recognized by us when the product is sold by the distributors to their end customers.
Therefore, we do not reduce deferred income on shipments to distributors or accounts receivable by anticipated future concessions; rather, price concessions are typically recorded against deferred income on shipments to distributors and accounts receivable when incurred, which is generally at the time the distributor sells the product.
At December 31, 2017, we had approximately $472.7 million of deferred revenue and $137.0 million in deferred cost of sales recognized as $335.7 million of deferred income on shipments to distributors.
The deferred income on shipments to distributors that will ultimately be recognized in our income statement will be lower than the amount reflected on the balance sheet due to additional price credits to be granted to the distributors when the product is sold to their customers.
When we reduce the price of our products, it allows the distributor to claim a credit against its outstanding accounts receivable balances based on the new price of the inventory it has on hand as of the date of the price reduction.
In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-09-Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606) and in August 2015, the FASB subsequently issued ASU 2015-14 "Deferral of the Effective Date," which supersedes existing revenue recognition guidance pursuant to US GAAP and will no longer permit us to defer revenue on sales to distributors until the products are sold to the end customer.
After adoption, the effect of the new standard on our future consolidated financial statements will depend on the relative percentage of sales through distributors; the level of and changes in the amount of inventory held by distributors; the individual products and product types held in inventory by distributors; and our ability to accurately estimate pricing variability at the time of sale to the distributor.
Total share-based compensation during the nine months ended December 31, 2017 was $70.0 million, of which $59.4 million was reflected in operating expenses and $10.6 million was reflected in cost of sales.
There was no charge to cost of sales for reduced production levels in each of the three and nine month periods ended December 31, 2017 and 2016.
The decrease in net sales in the three months ended December 31, 2017 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2017 was primarily due to the impact of seasonality on our business.

•charges of approximately $12.0 million and $186.7 million in the three and nine months ended December 31, 2016, respectively, related to the recognition of acquired inventory at fair value as a result of our acquisitions which increased the value of our acquired inventory and subsequently increased our cost of sales and reduced our gross margins when the related revenue was recognized;
During the nine months ended December 31, 2017, we completed the sale of the decommissioned San Jose wafer fabrication facility and assets from our Micrel acquisition for proceeds of $10.0 million.
Approximately 43% and 42% of our net sales came from products that were produced at outside wafer foundries in the three and nine months ended December 31, 2017, respectively, and approximately 42% and 41% of our net sales came from products that were produced at outside wafer foundries in the three and nine months ended December 31, 2016, respectively.
Selling, general and administrative expenses for the three months ended December 31, 2017 were $109.1 million, or 11.0% of net sales, compared to $111.0 million, or 13.3% of net sales, for the three months ended December 31, 2016.
Selling, general and administrative expenses for the nine months ended December 31, 2017 were $337.6 million, or 11.3% of net sales, compared to $388.7 million, or 15.5% of net sales, for the nine months ended December 31, 2016.
We may increase our borrowings under our credit agreement or seek additional equity or debt financing from time to time to maintain or expand our wafer fabrication and product assembly and test facilities, for cash dividends, for share repurchases or for acquisitions or other purposes.
The timing and amount of any such financing requirements will depend on a number of factors, including our level of dividend payments, changes in tax laws and regulations regarding the repatriation of offshore cash (including the impact of the Act), demand for our products, changes in industry conditions, product mix, competitive factors and our ability to identify suitable acquisition candidates.
During the December 2017 quarter, we recognized a one-time transition tax on accumulated unrepatriated foreign earnings, estimated at $627.7 million, as a result of the recent U.S. tax reform of which we expect to result in future cash payments of approximately $300.0 million.
