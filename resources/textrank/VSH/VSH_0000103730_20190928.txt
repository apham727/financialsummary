Upon adoption at January 1, 2019, the Company recognized right of use assets of $91,462 and lease liabilities of $95,784 on the consolidated balance sheet.
The Company recognizes right of use assets and lease liabilities for leases greater than twelve months in duration based on the contract consideration for lease components through the term of the lease and the applicable discount rate.
The Company does not recognize right of use assets or lease liabilities for short-term leases and classifies the expense as short-term lease expense.
Variable lease payments not based on an index or rate are not included in the initial right of use asset and lease liability and are recognized when incurred as a component of lease expense in the statement of operations.
The Company paid $16,023 for its operating leases in the nine fiscal months ended September 28, 2019, which are included in operating cash flows on the consolidated condensed statement of cash flows.
The weighted-average remaining lease term for the Company's operating leases is 9.0 years and the weighted-average discount rate is 6.1% as of September 28, 2019.
The Company did not elect the practical expedient available in ASC Topic 842 to use hindsight in determining the lease term.
The Company’s repurchase of a portion of the outstanding convertible debentures in the first fiscal quarter of 2019 (see Note 7) slightly reduced the Company’s expected 2019 tax rate.
The New Credit Facility allows an unlimited amount of defined “Investments,” which include certain intercompany transactions and acquisitions, provided the Company's pro forma leverage ratio is equal to or less than 2.75 to 1.00.
The New Credit Facility also allows an unlimited amount of defined "Restricted Payments," which include cash dividends and share repurchases, provided the Company's pro forma leverage ratio is equal to or less than 2.50 to 1.00.
If the Company's pro forma leverage ratio is greater than 2.50 to 1.00, the New Credit Facility allows such payments up to $100,000 per annum (subject to a cap of $300,000 for the term of the facility, with up to $25,000 of any unused amount of the $100,000 per annum base available for use in the next succeeding calendar year).
The New Credit Facility continues to limit or restrict the Company and its subsidiaries, from, among other things, incurring indebtedness, incurring liens on its respective assets, making investments and acquisitions (assuming the Company’s pro forma leverage ratio is greater than 2.75 to 1.00), making asset sales, and paying cash dividends and making other restricted payments (assuming the Company's pro forma leverage ratio is greater than 2.50 to 1.00), and requires the Company to comply with other covenants, including the maintenance of specific financial ratios.
The quarterly cash dividend program of the Company results in adjustments to the conversion rate and effective conversion price for the convertible debt instruments effective as of the ex-dividend date of each cash dividend.
Interest is payable on the convertible debt instruments semi-annually at the cash coupon rate; however, the remaining debt discount is being amortized as additional non-cash interest expense using an effective annual interest rate equal to the Company’s estimated nonconvertible debt borrowing rate at the time of issuance.
The Company used cash to repurchase $960, $12,288 and $2,168 principal amounts of convertible senior debentures due 2040, due 2041, and due 2042, respectively, in the first fiscal quarter of 2019.
In accordance with the authoritative accounting guidance for convertible debentures, the aggregate repurchase payment of $22,695 was allocated between the liability ($7,311) and equity (including temporary equity, $15,384) components of the convertible debentures, using the Company's nonconvertible debt borrowing rate at the time of the repurchase.
As a result, the Company recognized a loss on extinguishment of convertible debentures of $1,307, including the write-off of a portion of unamortized debt issuance costs.
The Company determines compensation cost for restricted stock units (“RSUs”) and phantom stock units based on the grant-date fair value of the underlying common stock adjusted for expected dividends paid over the required vesting period for non-participating awards.
In periods that the convertible debt instruments are not convertible, the certain conditions which could trigger conversion of the debt instruments have been deemed to be non-substantive, and accordingly, the Company assumes the conversion of these instruments in its diluted earnings per share computation during periods in which they are dilutive.
At the direction of its Board of Directors, the Company intends, upon conversion, to repay the principal amounts of any of the convertible debt instruments in cash and settle any additional amounts in shares of Vishay common stock.
The Company estimates the fair value of its long-term debt using a combination of quoted market prices for similar financing arrangements and expected future payments discounted at risk-adjusted rates, which are considered Level 2 inputs.
At September 28, 2019 and December 31, 2018, the Company’s short-term investments were comprised of time deposits with financial institutions that have maturities that exceed 90 days from the date of acquisition; however they all mature within one year from the respective balance sheet dates.
The Company's short-term investments are accounted for as held-to-maturity debt instruments, at amortized cost, which approximates their fair value.
The Company estimates the fair value of its cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments using level 2 inputs.
Based on the current interest rates for similar investments with comparable credit risk and time to maturity, the fair value of the Company's cash, cash equivalents, and held-to-maturity short-term investments approximate the carrying amounts reported in the consolidated condensed balance sheets.
The Company’s financial instruments also include accounts receivable, short-term notes payable, and accounts payable.

During 2018 we repatriated approximately $724.0 million of cash to the U.S., net of taxes, and further simplified our balance sheet by refinancing some of our debt.
The new credit facility increases the aggregate commitment of revolving loans from $640 million to $750 million; provides us with the ability to request up to $300 million of incremental facilities, subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions, which could take the form of additional revolving commitments, incremental “term loan A” or “term loan B” facilities, or incremental equivalent debt; reduces the undrawn commitment fee while maintaining the same borrowing rates; and provides greater operating flexibility, including with respect to intercompany funding and other transactions, to enable us to continue to streamline our complex subsidiary structure.
We repatriated approximately $73.6 million and $115.2 million to the United States, and paid withholding and foreign taxes of approximately $20.5 million and $18.3 million during the second and third fiscal quarters of 2019, respectively.
We utilize several financial metrics, including net revenues, gross profit margin, segment operating income, end-of-period backlog, book-to-bill ratio, inventory turnover, change in average selling prices, net cash and short-term investments (debt), and free cash generation to evaluate the performance and assess the future direction of our business.
Net revenues for the fiscal quarter ended September 28, 2019 were $628.3 million, compared to $685.2 million and $781.0 million for the fiscal quarters ended June 29, 2019 and September 29, 2018, respectively.
The net earnings attributable to Vishay stockholders for the fiscal quarter ended September 28, 2019 were $30.0 million, or $0.21 per diluted share, compared to $44.5 million, or $0.31 per diluted share for the fiscal quarter ended June 29, 2019, and $77.9 million, or $0.51 per diluted share for the fiscal quarter ended September 29, 2018.
Although the term "free cash" is not defined in GAAP, each of the elements used to calculate free cash for the year-to-date period is presented as a line item on the face of our consolidated condensed statement of cash flows prepared in accordance with GAAP and the quarterly amounts are derived from the year-to-date GAAP statements as of the beginning and end of the respective quarter.
Our results for the fiscal quarters ended September 28, 2019, June 29, 2019, and September 29, 2018 and nine fiscal months ending September 28, 2019 and September 29, 2018 represent the effects of the normalization of demand that we began to experience in the fourth fiscal quarter of 2018 and has accelerated through the first nine fiscal months of 2019 as supply, in general, caught up with demand, and distributors significantly reduced their orders as they decrease their inventory.
Our free cash results were significantly impacted by the payment of cash taxes related to the cash repatriated to the U.S. in the second and third fiscal quarters of 2019 of $20.5 million and $18.3 million, respectively, and $92.1 million and $64.7 million in the second and third fiscal quarters of 2018, respectively, and the installment payments of the U.S. transition tax of $14.8 million and $14.4 million in the second fiscal quarters of 2019 and 2018, respectively.
For the fourth fiscal quarter of 2019, we anticipate revenues between $580 million and $620 million and gross margins of 23% to 24% at the exchange rates of the third fiscal quarter of 2019.
While the translation of revenues and expenses incurred in the local currency into U.S. dollars does not directly impact the statements of operations, the translation effectively increases or decreases the U.S. dollar equivalent of revenues generated and expenses incurred in those foreign currencies.
The dollar generally was stronger during the third fiscal quarter and first nine fiscal months of 2019 compared to the prior fiscal quarter and prior year periods, with the translation of foreign currency revenues and expenses into U.S. dollars decreasing reported revenues and expenses versus the prior fiscal quarter and prior year periods.
The cost of products sold for the third fiscal quarter and first nine fiscal months of 2019 have been favorably impacted compared to the prior fiscal quarter and prior year periods by local currency transactions of subsidiaries which use the U.S. dollar as their functional currency.
The decrease in demand resulted in decreased net revenues compared to the prior fiscal quarter and prior year periods.
Net revenues of the MOSFETs segment decreased slightly versus the prior fiscal quarter, significantly versus the prior year quarter, and moderately versus the prior year-to-date period.
The decrease versus the prior year-to-date period was partially offset by the significant increase in the first fiscal quarter versus the prior year.
The increase in net revenues versus the prior fiscal quarter and the prior year periods from European and American end customers were offset by the significant decrease from distributor customers in all regions.

The decrease in net revenues versus the prior fiscal quarter and prior year periods is primarily due to distribution customers.
The gross profit margin decreased versus the prior fiscal quarter and prior year quarter, but increased versus the prior year-to-date period.
The decrease versus the prior fiscal quarter and prior year fiscal quarter is primarily due to lower sales volume and increased metal and labor costs, partially offset by higher average selling prices and our cost reduction efforts.
Average selling prices increased slightly versus the prior fiscal quarter and the prior year periods.
For the fiscal quarter ended September 28, 2019, our effective tax rate was 31.5%, as compared to 36.9% and 38.4% for the fiscal quarters ended June 29, 2019 and September 29, 2018, respectively.

Income tax expense for the fiscal quarter and nine fiscal months ended September 29, 2018 includes additional tax expense of $13.5 million and $25.5 million, respectively, recognized as a result of additional analysis of the impact of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act completed in 2018.
We also recorded additional tax expense of $0.7 million and tax benefits of $7.0 million during the third fiscal quarter and nine fiscal months ended September 29, 2018, respectively, due to the remeasurement of the deferred tax liability related to our cash repatriation program.

Management uses a non-GAAP measure, "free cash," to evaluate our ability to fund acquisitions, repay debt, and otherwise enhance stockholder value through stock repurchases or dividends.
The payment of these cash taxes significantly impacted cash flows from operations and free cash for the year ended December 31, 2018 and nine fiscal months ended September 28, 2019.
In the second fiscal quarter of 2019, we entered into a new credit facility, which provides an aggregate commitment of $750 million of revolving loans available until June 5, 2024.
