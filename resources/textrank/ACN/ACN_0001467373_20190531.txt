As a result of this change, for the three and nine months ended May 31, 2018, both total revenues and cost of services 
The primary impacts included additional disclosure about the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from client contracts, including judgments and changes in estimates.
A performance obligation is a promise in a contract to transfer a distinct good or service to the client and is the unit of accounting in Topic 606.
A contract’s transaction price is allocated to each distinct performance obligation and recognized as revenue when, or as, the performance obligation is satisfied.
If a contract modification results in the addition of performance obligations priced at a standalone selling price or if the post-modification services are distinct from the services provided prior to the modification, the modification is accounted for separately.
Our revenues are derived from contracts for outsourcing services, technology integration consulting services and non-technology consulting services.
These contracts have different terms based on the scope, performance obligations and complexity of the engagement, which frequently require us to make judgments and estimates in recognizing revenues.
Revenues are generally recognized on outsourcing contracts over time because our clients benefit from the services as they are performed.
Revenues from unit-priced contracts are recognized as transactions are processed.
When contractual billings represent an amount that corresponds directly with the value provided to the client (e.g., time-and-materials contracts), revenues are recognized as amounts become billable in accordance with contract terms.
Revenues are generally recognized over time as our clients benefit from the services as they are performed, or the contract includes termination provisions enabling payment for performance completed to date.
When contractual billings represent an amount that corresponds directly with the value provided to the client (e.g. time-and-materials contracts), revenues are recognized as amounts become billable in accordance with contract terms.
Revenues from fixed-price contracts are generally recognized using costs incurred to date relative to total estimated costs at completion to measure progress toward satisfying our performance obligations.
For non-technology integration consulting contracts which do not qualify to recognize revenue over time, we recognize revenues at a point in time when we satisfy our performance obligations and the client obtains control of the promised good or service.
Estimates of total contract revenues and costs are continuously monitored over the life of our contracts, and recorded revenues and cost estimates are subject to revision as the contract progresses.
Adjustments in contract estimates related to performance obligations satisfied or partially satisfied in prior periods increased our revenues by approximately $16 million and decreased our revenues by approximately $13 million for the three and nine months ended May 31, 2019, respectively.
No adjustment on any one contract was material to our Consolidated Financial Statements for the three and nine months ended May 31, 2019.
The timing of revenue recognition, billings and cash collections results in Receivables, Contract assets, and Deferred revenues (Contract liabilities) on our Consolidated Balance Sheet.
When we bill or receive payments from our clients before revenue is recognized, we record Contract liabilities.
For some outsourcing contracts, we receive payments for transition or set-up activities, which are deferred and recognized as revenue as the services are provided.
Deferred transition costs were $685,605 and $690,868 as of May 31, 2019 and August 31, 2018, respectively, and are included in Deferred contract costs.
Revenues recognized during the three and nine months ended May 31, 2019 that were included in Deferred revenues as of February 28, 2019 and September 1, 2018 were $1.7 billion and $2.7 billion, respectively.
For a cash flow hedge, the effective portion of the change in estimated fair value of a hedging instrument is recorded in Accumulated other comprehensive loss as a separate component of Shareholders’ Equity and is reclassified into Cost of services in the Consolidated Income Statements during the period in which the hedged transaction is recognized.
For information related to derivatives designated as cash flow hedges that were reclassified into Cost of services during the three and nine months ended May 31, 2019 and 2018, as well as those expected to be reclassified into Cost of services in the next 12 months, see Note 4 (Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss) to these Consolidated Financial Statements.
Realized gains or losses and changes in the estimated fair value of foreign currency forward contracts that have not been designated as hedges were net losses of $10,319 and $88,247 for the three and nine months ended May 31, 2019, respectively, and net losses of $84,480 and $37,698 for the three and nine months ended May 31, 2018, respectively.
Gains and losses on these contracts are recorded in Other income (expense), net in the Consolidated Income Statements and are offset by gains and losses on the related hedged items.

Financial results “in local currency” are calculated by restating current period activity into U.S. dollars using the comparable prior year period’s foreign currency exchange rates.
If the U.S. dollar weakens against other currencies, resulting in favorable currency translation, our revenues, revenue growth and results of operations in U.S. dollars may be higher.
The U.S. dollar strengthened against various currencies during the three and nine months ended May 31, 2019 compared to the three and nine months ended May 31, 2018, resulting in unfavorable currency translation and U.S. dollar revenue growth that was approximately 5% and 4% lower, respectively, than our revenue growth in local currency.
Gross margin (Revenues less Cost of services as a percentage of Revenues) for the third quarter of fiscal 2019 was 31.8%, compared with 31.2% for the third quarter of fiscal 2018.
The increase in gross margin for the third quarter of fiscal 2019 was primarily due to lower labor costs as a percentage of revenues compared to the third quarter of fiscal 2018.
The increase in gross margin for the nine months ended May 31, 2019 was primarily due to lower non-payroll and labor costs as a percentage of revenues compared to the same period in fiscal 2018.

For the third quarter of fiscal 2019 compared to the same period in fiscal 2018, Sales and marketing costs as a percentage of revenues increased 40 basis points, primarily due to higher selling and other business development costs and General and administrative costs as a percentage of revenues increased 10 basis points.
For the nine months ended May 31, 2019 compared to the same period in fiscal 2018, Sales and marketing costs as a percentage of revenues were flat, and General and administrative costs as a percentage of revenues increased 20 basis points.

The effective tax rates for the three and nine months ended May 31, 2018 were 34.4% and 27.2%, respectively.
Absent these charges and $81 million of expense from a non-U.S. tax law change recorded during the third quarter of fiscal 2018, our effective tax rate for the three and nine months ended May 31, 2018 would have been 26.8% and 21.3%, respectively.
Operating expenses for the third quarter of fiscal 2019 increased $322 million, or 4%, over the third quarter of fiscal 2018, and decreased as a percentage of revenues to 84.5% from 84.7% during this period.
Cost of services for the third quarter of fiscal 2019 increased $208 million, or 3%, over the third quarter of fiscal 2018, and decreased as a percentage of revenues to 68.2% from 68.8% during this period.

The increase as a percentage of revenues was primarily due to higher selling and other business development costs compared to the same period in fiscal 2018.
•Financial Services operating income decreased as revenue growth was offset by higher operating expenses as a percentage of revenues.
•Products operating income was relatively flat year-over-year as revenue growth was offset by higher operating expenses as a percentage of revenues.
•Resources operating income increased primarily due to revenue growth and higher contract profitability.
The lower effective tax rate for the three months ended May 31, 2019 was primarily due to changes in prior year tax liabilities and the geographic distribution of earnings, partially offset by higher expense from the adoption of FASB ASU No. 2016-16.
The $0.33 increase in our diluted earnings per share included the impact of tax law changes, which decreased diluted earnings per share for the third quarter of fiscal 2018 by $0.19.
Excluding the impact of these changes, diluted earnings per share for the third quarter of fiscal 2019 increased $0.14 compared with the third quarter of fiscal 2018 due to an increase of $0.09 from higher revenues and operating results, $0.03 from a lower effective tax rate, $0.02 from lower weighted average shares outstanding and $0.01 from lower non-operating expense.

The effective tax rate for the nine months ended May 31, 2019 was 21.1%, compared with 27.2% for the nine months ended May 31, 2018.
Absent this charge, our effective tax rate for the nine months ended May 31, 2018 would have been 21.3%.
The lower effective tax rate for the nine months ended May 31, 2019 was primarily due to higher benefits from final determinations of prior year taxes, changes in the geographic distribution of earnings and adjustments to prior year tax liabilities.
