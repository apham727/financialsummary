On September 1, 2019, we adopted FASB ASU No. 2016-02, Leases, and related updates (“Topic 842”) using the effective date method.
The primary impact of adoption is the requirement for lessees to recognize assets and liabilities on the balance sheet for the rights and obligations created by both operating and finance leases.
We elected the package of practical expedients which does not require reassessment of prior conclusions related to identifying leases, lease classification or initial direct costs.
See Note 7 (Leases) to these Consolidated Financial Statements for further details.

See Note 1 (Basis of Presentation) to these Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on our adoption.
Lease assets and liabilities recognized at the lease commencement date are determined predominantly as the present value of the payments due over the lease term.
Effective September 1, 2019, when we are the lessee, all leases are recognized as lease liabilities and associated lease assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheet.
Lease assets represent our right to use an underlying asset for the lease term and may also include advance payments, initial direct costs or lease incentives.
Fixed and variable payments that depend upon an index or rate, such as the Consumer Price Index (CPI), are included in the recognition of lease assets and liabilities at the commencement-date rate.
Other variable payments, such as common area maintenance, property and other taxes, utilities and insurance that are based on the lessor’s cost, are recognized in the Consolidated Income Statement in the period incurred.
As of November 30, 2019, our operating leases had a weighted average remaining lease term of 7.4 years and a weighted average discount rate of 4.2%.
As of November 30, 2019, we have entered into operating leases that have not yet commenced with future lease payments of $430 million that are not reflected in the table above.
For a cash flow hedge, the effective portion of the change in estimated fair value of a hedging instrument is recorded in Accumulated other comprehensive loss as a separate component of Shareholders’ Equity and is reclassified into Cost of services in the Consolidated Income Statements during the period in which the hedged transaction is recognized.
For information related to derivatives designated as cash flow hedges that were reclassified into Cost of services during the three months ended November 30, 2019 and 2018, as well as those expected to be reclassified into Cost of services in the next 12 months, see Note 4 (Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss) to these Consolidated Financial Statements.
Realized gains or losses and changes in the estimated fair value of foreign currency forward contracts that have not been designated as hedges were net losses of $56,619 and $48,983 for the three months ended November 30, 2019 and 2018, respectively.
Gains and losses on these contracts are recorded in Other income (expense), net in the Consolidated Income Statements and are offset by gains and losses on the related hedged items.
Our effective tax rates for the three months ended November 30, 2019 and 2018 were 23.6% and 19.8%, respectively.
The effective tax rate for the three months ended November 30, 2019 was higher primarily due to lower benefits from final determinations of prior year taxes and the phased-in effects of US tax reform.

We use the term “in local currency” so that certain financial results may be viewed without the impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, thereby facilitating period-to-period comparisons of business performance.
Financial results “in local currency” are calculated by restating current period activity into U.S. dollars using the comparable prior year period’s foreign currency exchange rates.
•Our business depends on generating and maintaining ongoing, profitable client demand for our services and solutions, including through the adaptation and expansion of our services and solutions in response to ongoing changes in technology and offerings, and a significant reduction in such demand or an inability to respond to the evolving technological environment could materially affect our results of operations.
•Our results of operations could be materially adversely affected by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates.
As we are a global company, our revenues are denominated in multiple currencies and may be significantly affected by currency exchange rate fluctuations.
