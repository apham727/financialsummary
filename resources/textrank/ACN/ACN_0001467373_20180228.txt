The accompanying unaudited interim Consolidated Financial Statements of Accenture plc and its controlled subsidiary companies have been prepared pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) for quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and do not include all of the information and note disclosures required by U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“U.S. GAAP”) for complete financial statements.
We use the terms “Accenture,” “we” and “our” in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements to refer to Accenture plc and its subsidiaries.
These Consolidated Financial Statements should therefore be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes thereto for the fiscal year ended August 31, 2017 included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC on October 26, 2017.
For a cash flow hedge, the effective portion of the change in estimated fair value of a hedging instrument is recorded in Accumulated other comprehensive loss as a separate component of Shareholders’ Equity and is reclassified into Cost of services in the Consolidated Income Statements during the period in which the hedged transaction is recognized.
For information related to derivatives designated as cash flow hedges that were reclassified into Cost of services during the three and six months ended February 28, 2018 and 2017, as well as those expected to be reclassified into Cost of services in the next 12 months, see Note 3 (Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss) to these Consolidated Financial Statements.
Realized gains or losses and changes in the estimated fair value of foreign currency forward contracts that have not been designated as hedges were net gains of $56,316 and $46,783 for the three and six months ended February 28, 2018, respectively, and a net gain of $19,780 and a net loss of $118,313 for the three and six months ended February 28, 2017, respectively.

As of February 28, 2018 and August 31, 2017, we have reflected the fair value of $93,358 and $52,996, respectively, related to redeemable common stock and the intrinsic value of the options on redeemable common stock of these subsidiaries in Other accrued liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.
The Consolidated Financial Statements reflect the ownership interests in Accenture Holdings plc and Accenture Canada Holdings Inc. held by certain current and former members of Accenture Leadership as noncontrolling interests.
Prior to the merger, a 4% non-controlling ownership interest percentage was held by Accenture Holdings plc and Accenture Canada Holdings Inc. and subsequent to the merger, the non-controlling ownership percentage is less than 1% held by only Accenture Canada Holdings Inc. The information set forth under “Legal Contingencies” in Note 9 (Commitments and Contingencies) to our Consolidated Financial Statements under Part I, Item 1, “Financial Statements,” is incorporated herein by reference.

The U.S. dollar weakened against various currencies during the three and six months ended February 28, 2018 compared to the three and six months ended February 28, 2017, resulting in favorable currency translation and U.S. dollar revenue growth that was approximately 6% and 4% higher, respectively, than our revenue growth in local currency.
Assuming that exchange rates stay within recent ranges for the remainder of fiscal 2018, we estimate that our full fiscal 2018 revenue growth in U.S. dollars will be approximately 4.0% higher in U.S. dollars than our revenue growth in local currency.
Gross margin (Net revenues less Cost of services before reimbursable expenses as a percentage of net revenues) for the second quarter of fiscal 2018 was 29.7%, compared with 30.1% for the second quarter of fiscal 2017.
The decrease in gross margin for three and six months ended February 28, 2018 was principally due to lower consulting contract profitability as well as higher acquisition-related costs, partially offset by cost efficiencies.
Sales and marketing and General and administrative costs as a percentage of net revenues were 16.3% for the second quarter of fiscal 2018 and 16.4% for the six months ended February 28, 2018, compared with 16.4% for both the second quarter of fiscal 2017 and six months ended February 28, 2017.
For the three and six months ended February 28, 2018 compared to the same periods in fiscal 2017, Sales and marketing costs as a percentage of net revenues decreased 10 basis points and were flat, respectively, and General and administrative costs as a percentage of net revenues were flat and decreased 10 basis points, respectively.
In the second quarter of fiscal 2018, we recorded a $137 million charge associated with the enactment of the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the “Tax Act”).
Absent this charge, our effective tax rates for the three and six months ended February 28, 2018 would have been 15.1% and 18.0%, respectively.
Operating expenses for the second quarter of fiscal 2018 increased $1,162 million, or 15%, over the second quarter of fiscal 2017, and increased as a percentage of revenues to 87.3% from 87.0% during this period.
Operating expenses before reimbursable expenses for the second quarter of fiscal 2018 increased $1,124 million, or 16%, over the second quarter of fiscal 2017, and increased as a percentage of net revenues to 86.6% from 86.3% during this period.
Cost of services for the second quarter of fiscal 2018 increased $961 million, or 15%, over the second quarter of fiscal 2017, and increased as a percentage of revenues to 71.7% from 71.4% during this period.
Cost of services before reimbursable expenses for the second quarter of fiscal 2018 increased $924 million, or 16%, over the second quarter of fiscal 2017, and increased as a percentage of net revenues to 70.3% from 69.9% during this period.
Sales and marketing expense for the second quarter of fiscal 2018 increased $128 million, or 15%, over the second quarter of fiscal 2017, and decreased as a percentage of net revenues to 10.4% from 10.5% during this period.

Operating income for the second quarter of fiscal 2018 increased $144 million, or 13%, over the second quarter of fiscal 2017.
•Financial Services operating income increased primarily due to consulting revenue growth, partially offset by lower consulting contract profitability.
•Products operating income increased primarily due to revenue growth, partially offset by lower consulting contract profitability and higher sales and marketing costs as a percentage of net revenues.
•Resources operating income increased primarily due to revenue growth, partially offset by lower contract profitability.
For the second quarter of fiscal 2018, other expense increased $31 million over the second quarter of fiscal 2017, primarily due to higher net foreign exchange losses.

In the second quarter of fiscal 2018, we recorded a $137 million charge associated with the enactment of the Tax Act. Absent this charge, our effective tax rate for the second quarter of fiscal 2018 would have been 15.1%.
The effective tax rate for the three months ended February 28, 2018 benefited from lower expenses for adjustments to prior year tax liabilities in fiscal 2018, partially offset by lower benefits from final determinations of prior year U.S. taxes in fiscal 2018.
Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests for the second quarter of fiscal 2018 increased $7 million, or 15%, over the second quarter of fiscal 2017.
Diluted earnings per share were $1.37 for the second quarter of fiscal 2018, compared with $1.33 for the second quarter of fiscal 2017.
The $0.04 increase in our diluted earnings per share included the impact of the $137 million charge associated with the Tax Act, which decreased diluted earnings per share for the second quarter of fiscal 2018 by $0.21.
Excluding the impact of this charge, diluted earnings per share for the second quarter of fiscal 2018 increased $0.25 compared with the second quarter of fiscal 2017, due to increases of $0.17 from higher revenues and operating results, $0.10 from a lower effective tax rate and $0.01 from lower weighted average shares outstanding.
Sales and marketing expense for the six months ended February 28, 2018 increased $241 million, or 14%, over the six months ended February 28, 2017, and remained flat as a percentage of net revenues at 10.5% during this period.
General and administrative costs for the six months ended February 28, 2018 increased $128 million, or 13%, over the six months ended February 28, 2017, and decreased as a percentage of net revenues to 5.9% from 6.0% during this period.
