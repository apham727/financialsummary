The accompanying unaudited consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto for the year ended December 31, 2018, included in our annual report on Form 10-K, filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
In our opinion, the accompanying consolidated financial statements reflect all adjustments (consisting only of normal recurring items) considered necessary to present fairly our financial position at March 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018, the results of our operations and comprehensive income for the three months ended March 31, 2019 and 2018, and the cash flows for the three months ended March 31, 2019 and 2018.
Our operating results for the three months ended March 31, 2019 are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for the year ending December 31, 2019.
Upon adoption, we recognized lease liabilities of approximately $52 million, with corresponding ROU assets of the same amount, based on the present value of the remaining minimum rental payments under current leasing standards for our existing operating leases.
Additionally, we also reclassified approximately $19 million from "Property, plant and equipment, net" to "Operating lease right-of-use assets" related to prepaid leasehold land.
Additionally, in the first quarter of 2019, we granted performance-based restricted stock units to certain executives under our 2015 Equity Incentive Plan ("PRSUs").
The PRSU awards granted during the three months ended March 31, 2019 include a market condition as defined by ASC 718.
There were no other significant changes in our accounting policies during the three months ended March 31, 2019 compared to the significant accounting policies described in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018.
Stock-based compensation costs are based on the fair value on the date of grant for all restricted stock units ("RSUs") and on the date of enrollment for the employee stock purchase plan.
PRSUs are restricted stock unit awards that vest based on a market condition, currently our stockholder return relative to the total stockholder return of the constituents of the Russell 2000 Index at the end of a three-year performance period.
Up to 200% of the full target number of shares subject to each PRSU award are eligible to be earned after the completion of the three-year performance period based on our total stockholder return relative to the total stockholder return of the Russell 2000 Index at the end of the performance period.
Refer to Note 11 – Authorized shares of common and preferred stock and stock-based compensation plans for additional information on our equity-based compensation programs.
Operating leases are included in operating lease right-of-use ("ROU") assets and operating lease liabilities (current and non-current) on our consolidated balance sheet.
Operating lease ROU assets and operating lease liabilities are recognized based on their present value of the future minimum lease payments over the lease term at commencement date.
Additionally, for certain equipment leases, we apply a portfolio approach to effectively account for the operating lease ROU assets and liabilities.
Stock awards to acquire 67,100 shares and 0 shares for the three months ended March 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively, were excluded in the computations of diluted EPS because the effect of including the stock awards would have been anti-dilutive.
The primary purpose of our invoicing terms is to provide customers with simplified and predictable ways of purchasing our products and services, not to receive financing from our customers, such as invoicing at the beginning of a subscription term with a portion of the revenue recognized ratably over the contract period, or to provide customers with financing, such as multi-year on-premises licenses that are invoiced annually with revenue recognized upfront.
For the three months ended March 31, 2019, revenue recognized from performance obligations related to prior periods (for example, due to changes in transaction price) was not material.
For the three months ended March 31, 2019, amounts recognized related to unbilled receivables were not material.
Revenue expected to be recognized in any future period related to remaining performance obligations, excluding revenue pertaining to contracts that have an original expected duration of one year or less, and contracts where revenue is recognized as invoiced, was approximately $57 million as of March 31, 2019.
Total capitalized costs to obtain a contract were immaterial during the periods presented and are included in other long-term assets on our consolidated balance sheets.
We value our available-for-sale short-term investments based on pricing from third party pricing vendors, who may use quoted prices in active markets for identical assets (Level 1 inputs) or inputs other than quoted prices that are observable either directly or indirectly (Level 2 inputs) in determining fair value.
For those derivative instruments that are designated and qualify as hedging instruments, we designate the hedging instrument, based upon the exposure being hedged, as a fair value hedge, cash flow hedge, or a hedge of a net investment in a foreign operation.
Sales outside of the Americas accounted for approximately 61% and 62% of our net sales during the three months ended March 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively.
We purchase foreign currency forward contracts as hedges of forecasted sales that are denominated in foreign currencies and as hedges of foreign currency denominated financial assets or liabilities.
These contracts are entered into to help protect against the risk that the eventual dollar-net-cash inflows resulting from such sales or firm commitments will be adversely affected by changes in exchange rates.
These contracts are entered into to help protect against the risk that the eventual dollar-net-cash outflows resulting from foreign currency operating and cost of sales expenses will be adversely affected by changes in exchange rates.
We designate foreign currency forward contracts as cash flow hedges of forecasted net sales or forecasted expenses.
To help protect against the reduction in value caused by a fluctuation in foreign currency exchange rates of forecasted foreign currency cash flows resulting from international sales over the next one to three years, we have instituted a foreign currency cash flow hedging program.
For forward contracts, when the dollar strengthens significantly against the foreign currencies, the change in the present value of future foreign currency cash flows may be offset by the change in the fair value of the forward contracts designated as hedges.
For derivative instruments that are designated and qualify as a cash flow hedge, the gain or loss on the derivative is reported as a component of accumulated OCI and reclassified into earnings in the same line item (net sales, operating expenses, or cost of sales) associated with the forecasted transaction and in the same period or periods during which the hedged transaction affects earnings.
Hedge effectiveness of foreign currency forwards designated as cash flow hedges are measured by comparing the hedging instrument’s cumulative change in fair value from inception to maturity to the forecasted transaction’s terminal value.
At March 31, 2019, we expect to reclassify $7.3 million of gains on derivative instruments from accumulated OCI to net sales during the next twelve months when the hedged international sales occur, $(0.1) million of losses on derivative instruments from accumulated OCI to cost of sales during the next twelve months when the cost of sales are incurred and $(0.1) million of losses on derivative instruments from accumulated OCI to operating expenses during the next twelve months when the hedged operating expenses occur.
Other derivatives not designated as hedging instruments consist primarily of foreign currency forward contracts that we use to hedge our foreign denominated net receivable or net payable positions to help protect against the change in value caused by a fluctuation in foreign currency exchange rates.
The gain or loss on the derivatives as well as the offsetting gain or loss on the hedge item attributable to the hedged risk is recognized in current earnings under the line item “net foreign exchange gain (loss).” As of March 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018, we held foreign currency forward contracts that were not designated as hedging instruments with a notional amount of $42 million and $71 million, respectively.
The following tables present the fair value of derivative instruments on our Consolidated Balance Sheets at March 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018, respectively.

A change in these policies or interpretations could have a significant effect on our reported financial results and our internal controls over financial reporting, may retroactively affect previously reported results, could cause unexpected financial reporting fluctuations, and may require us to make costly changes to our operational processes and accounting systems.
In many foreign countries, particularly in those with developing economies, it is common to engage in business practices that are prohibited by U.S. regulations applicable to us such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. Although we have policies and procedures designed to ensure compliance with these laws, there can be no assurance that all of our employees, contractors and agents, including those based in or from countries where practices which violate such U.S. laws may be customary, will not take actions in violation of our policies.
Orders With a Value of Greater than One Million Dollars Expose Us to Significant Additional Business and Legal Risks that Could Have a Material Adverse Impact on our Business, Results of Operations and Financial Condition.
At times these orders include terms that impose critical delivery commitments and severe contractual liabilities if we fail to provide the required quantity of products at the required delivery times, impose product acceptance requirements and product performance evaluation requirements which create uncertainty with respect to the timing of our ability to recognize revenue from such orders, allow the customers to cancel or delay orders without liability, require us to develop specific product mitigation plans for product delivery constraints caused by unexpected or catastrophic situations to help assure quick production recovery, and that require most favored customer pricing, significant discounts, extended payment terms and volume rebates.
