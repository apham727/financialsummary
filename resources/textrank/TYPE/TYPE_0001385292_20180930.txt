We classify cloud-based subscriptions and other services, such as font related services, custom font design and post contract support as service revenue on our condensed consolidated statements of operations.
In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board, or FASB, and the International Accounting Standards Board jointly issued ASU 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606) (ASC 606), which outlines a comprehensive five-step revenue recognition model based on a principle that replaces virtually all existing revenue recognition rules under U.S. GAAP and which requires revenue to be recognized in a manner to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to a customer at an amount that reflects the consideration expected to be received in exchange for those goods or services.
ASU 2014-09 also provided the guidance in ASC Topic 340, Other Assets and Deferred CostsContracts with Customers (Subtopic 340-40), which includes criteria for the capitalization and amortization of certain contract acquisition and fulfillment costs.
We adopted the standard on January 1, 2018, and applied the modified retrospective method of adoption and have elected to apply the new standard only to contracts not completed at January 1, 2018, which represents contracts for which all (or substantially all) of the revenues have not been recognized under existing guidance as of the date of adoption.
Contract assets, short term are included in the accounts receivables, net of allowance for doubtful accounts in our condensed consolidated balance sheet.
These amounts are included in cost of revenue  license in the accompanying condensed consolidated statement of operations for the nine months ended September 30, 2018.
Under legacy GAAP, revenue related to our term licenses that were bundled with service-related performance obligations when vendor-specific objective evidence (VSOE) did not exist was required to be recognized ratably over the term of the agreement.
Under ASC 606, the Company allocates revenue to each performance obligation in the contract and each performance obligation is accounted for separately; the license revenue is recognized at the time of delivery and the service revenue is recognized over time based on their relative standalone selling prices.
ASC 606 requires certain incremental costs related to contract acquisition, such as sales commissions, and contract fulfillment costs to be capitalized and amortized over the expected period of benefit whereas the Company had previously recognized such expenses as incurred.
Please see Note 4 for the Companys policies related to revenue recognition and accounting for costs to obtain and fulfill a customer contract.
Custom font design services are generally not a separate distinct performance obligation and are sold with a license for the custom font, in which case revenue is recognized upon completion of the services and when the font is delivered and  
For our hosted offerings where we provide our customers the right to access our software without taking possession, revenue is recognized over the contract period on a time-elapsed basis, which is consistent with the transfer of service to the customer.
In instances where the timing of revenue recognition differs from the respective payment terms, we have considered whether such contracts include a significant financing component, subject to the applicable practical expedient.
We have determined our contracts generally do not include a significant financing component; however, the Company will continue to assess (1) the length of time between when the goods or services are delivered and expected payment, and (2) prevailing interest rates in the market to re-evaluate this conclusion.
OEM revenue primarily relates to licenses providing our customers the right to embed our fonts and technology in their products over a certain term.
Although significantly less than royalties from per-unit shipments and fixed fees from OEM customers, we also receive revenue from software application and operating systems vendors, who include our fonts and technology in their products and for font development.
Revenue from per-unit royalty contracts is estimated and recognized in the period that the royalty-bearing event or sale by our OEM customer occurs.
Certain OEM contracts may include customer support services and unspecified updates for our font technology that is a distinct stand-ready performance obligation and recognized ratably over the service period.
As discussed above, certain of our Creative Professional contracts have payment terms that differ from the timing of revenue recognition which requires us to assess whether the transaction price for those contracts include a significant financing component.
We have elected the practical expedient that permits an entity to not adjust for the effects of a significant financing component if we expect that at the contract inception, the period between when the entity transfers a promised good or service to a customer and when the customer pays for that good or service will be one year or less.
Revenue recognized during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2018 from amounts included in deferred revenue at the beginning of the period were approximately $7.2 million and $21.6 million, respectively.
Revenue recognized during both the three and nine months ended September 30, 2018 from performance obligations satisfied or partially satisfied in previous periods, mainly due to changes in the estimate of royalty revenues, was $7.9 million.
The contract modifications entered into during the nine months ended September 30, 2018 did not have a significant impact on the Companys contract assets or deferred revenue.
We capitalize incremental costs incurred to fulfill our contracts that (i) relate directly to the contract, (ii) are expected to generate resources that will be used to satisfy the Companys performance obligation under the contract, and (iii) are expected to be recovered through revenue generated under the contract.
In the three months ended September 30, 2018 and 2017, $3 thousand and $44 thousand, respectively, of stock based compensation was capitalized as part of internal software projects, and this amount is included in property and equipment, net in our condensed consolidated balance sheet.
