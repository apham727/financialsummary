We classify cloud-based subscriptions and other services, such as font related services, custom font design and post contract support as service revenue on our condensed consolidated statements of operations.
In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board, or FASB, and the International Accounting Standards Board jointly issued ASU 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606) (ASC 606), which outlines a comprehensive five-step revenue recognition model based on a principle that replaces virtually all existing revenue recognition rules under U.S. GAAP and which requires revenue to be recognized in a manner to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to a customer at an amount that reflects the consideration expected to be received in exchange for those goods or services.
ASU 2014-09 also provided the guidance in ASC Topic 340, Other Assets and Deferred CostsContracts with Customers (Subtopic 340-40), which includes criteria for the capitalization and amortization of certain contract acquisition and fulfillment costs.
We adopted the standard on January 1, 2018, and applied the modified retrospective method of adoption and have elected to apply the new standard only to contracts not completed at January 1, 2018, which represents contracts for which all (or substantially all) of the revenues have not been recognized under existing guidance as of the date of adoption.
These amounts are included in cost of revenue  license in the accompanying condensed consolidated statement of operations for the three and six months ended June 30, 2018.
   Under legacy GAAP, revenue related to our term licenses that were bundled with service-related performance obligations when vendor-specific objective evidence (VSOE) did not exist was required to be recognized ratably over the term of the agreement.
Under ASC 606, the Company allocates revenue to each performance obligation in the contract and each performance obligation is accounted for separately; the license revenue is recognized at the time of delivery and the service revenue is recognized over time based on their relative standalone selling prices.
We have a limited number of contracts in which we offered extended payment terms for term licenses to our customers, including cases in which the license is delivered in full at the beginning of the contract.
Under legacy GAAP, revenue was recognized when the payments became due, based upon the requirement that the fee be fixed or determinable.
However, under the new guidance, revenue related to such arrangements is accelerated, with revenue related to the license recognized at the time of delivery, less a financing component (interest income) to  
   Under legacy GAAP, we recognized royalty revenue when it was reported to us by the licensee, typically one quarter after royalty-bearing units were shipped, at which time the fee is fixed or determinable.
Please see Note 4 for the Companys policies related to revenue recognition and accounting for costs to obtain and fulfill a customer contract.
Our Creative Professional revenue is primarily derived from rights to use font licenses, custom font design services and hosted software as a service, or SaaS, offerings.
Custom font design services are generally not a separate distinct performance obligation and are sold with a license for the custom font, in which case revenue is recognized upon completion of the services and when the font is delivered and accepted by the customer.
For our hosted offerings where we provide our customers the right to access our software without taking possession, revenue is recognized over the contract period on a time-elapsed basis, which is consistent with the transfer of service to the customer.
An exception exists for certain contracts for our SaaS offerings or a limited number of multi-year term license agreements which have periodic payment terms, generally quarterly or annually, over the term of the contract.
In instances where the timing of revenue recognition differs from the respective payment terms, we have considered whether such contracts include a significant financing component, subject to the applicable practical expedient.
We have determined our contracts generally do not include a significant financing component; however, the Company will continue to assess (1) the length of time between when the goods or services are delivered and expected payment, and (2) prevailing interest rates in the market to re-evaluate this conclusion.
OEM revenue primarily relates to licenses providing our customers the right to embed our fonts and technology in their products over a certain term.
Although significantly less than royalties from per-unit shipments and fixed fees from OEM customers, we also receive revenue from software application and operating systems vendors, who include our fonts and technology in their products and for font development.
Revenue from per-unit royalty contracts is estimated and recognized in the period that the royalty-bearing event or sale by our OEM customer occurs.
Revenue from fixed fee licenses is generally recognized upfront at the point in time when the software embodying the font is shipped or made available to the customer.
Certain OEM contracts may include customer support services and unspecified updates for our font technology which is a distinct stand-ready performance obligation and recognized ratably over the service period.
As discussed above, certain of our Creative Professional contracts have payment terms that differ from the timing of revenue recognition which requires us to assess whether the transaction price for those contracts include a significant financing component.
Revenue recognized during the three and six months ended June 30, 2018 from amounts included in deferred revenue at the beginning of the period were approximately $7.6 million and $14.4 million, respectively.
Revenue recognized during both the three and six months ended June 30, 2018 from performance obligations satisfied or partially satisfied in previous periods, mainly due to changes in the estimate of royalty revenues, was $4.6 million.
The contract modifications entered into during the six months ended June 30, 2018 did not have a significant impact on the Companys contract assets or deferred revenue.
We capitalize incremental costs incurred to fulfill our contracts that (i) relate directly to the contract, (ii) are expected to generate resources that will be used to satisfy the Companys performance obligation under the contract, and (iii) are expected to be recovered through revenue generated under the contract.
In the three months ended June 30, 2018 and 2017, $7 thousand and $31 thousand, respectively, of stock based compensation was capitalized as part of internal software projects, and this amount is included in property and equipment, net in our condensed consolidated balance sheet.
In the six months ended June 30, 2018 and 2017, $21 thousand and $53 thousand, respectively, of stock based compensation was capitalized as part of internal software projects, and this amount is included in property and equipment, net in our condensed consolidated balance sheet.
For the three and six months ended June 30, 2018, $1.4 million of stock based compensation expense was reversed as a result of forfeitures of awards by employees included in the restructuring plan.
As of June 30, 2018, the Company had $34.0 million of unrecognized compensation expense related to employees and directors unvested stock option awards, restricted stock units and restricted stock awards that are expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 2.4 years.

   Foreign rate differential increased our effective rate 40.1% in the three months ended June 30, 2018, as compared to a decrease of 1.0% in the same period in 2017, due to changes in tax treatment of foreign earnings under The Act. These changes include significant new limitations on the ability to utilize foreign tax credits, and the effects of the new Global Intangible Low Taxed Income (GILTI) provisions.

Revenue from our printer imaging OEM customers decreased period over period partially due to lower revenue from customers under fixed fee contracts and partially due to $4.1 million of one-time payments recognized in the six months ended June 30, 2017 from the conversion of customers to fixed fee contracts from royalty bearing contracts.
Cost of revenue excluding amortization of acquired technology increased $3.5 million, or 18.4%, to $22.4 million in the six months ended June 30, 2018 as compared to $18.9 million in the six months ended June 30, 2017.
