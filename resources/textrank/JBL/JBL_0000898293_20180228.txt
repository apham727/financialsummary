The estimated fair values of the Companys publicly traded debt, including the 5.625%, 4.700% and 3.950% senior notes, were approximately $424.4 million, $517.5 million and $480.2 million, respectively, as of February 28, 2018.
The estimated fair value of the Companys private debt, the 4.900% senior notes, was approximately $306.5 million, as of February 28, 2018.
The Company regularly sells designated pools of trade accounts receivable under two asset-backed securitization programs and seven uncommitted trade accounts receivable sale programs (collectively referred to herein as the programs).
The Company does not record a servicing asset or liability on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets as the Company estimates that the fee it receives to service these receivables approximates the fair market compensation to provide the servicing activities.
Accordingly, the special purpose entities associated with these asset-backed securitization programs are included in the Companys Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements.
(3) Recorded initially at fair value as prepaid expenses and other current assets on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets and are valued using unobservable inputs (Level 3 inputs), primarily discounted cash flows, and due to their credit quality and short-term maturity the fair values approximated book values.
As of February 28, 2018 and August 31, 2017, the Company was in compliance with all covenants under the asset-backed securitization programs.
(1) The resulting losses on the sales of trade accounts receivable during the three months and six months ended February 28, 2018 and 2017 were not material and were recorded to other expense within the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations.
(1) There is no tax benefit (expense) related to the foreign currency translation adjustment components of AOCI, including reclassification adjustments, for the three months and six months ended February 28, 2018.
(2) $7.0 million of AOCI reclassified into earnings during the six months ended February 28, 2018 for derivative instruments was classified as a reduction of income tax expense.
(3) There is no tax benefit (expense) related to the available for sale securities components of AOCI, including reclassification adjustments, for the three months and six months ended February 28, 2018.
In addition to derivatives that are designated as hedging instruments and qualify for hedge accounting, the Company also enters into forward contracts to economically hedge transactional exposure associated with commitments arising from trade accounts receivable, trade accounts payable, fixed purchase obligations and intercompany transactions denominated in a currency other than the functional currency of the respective operating entity.
During the three months and six months ended February 28, 2018, the Company recognized $22.9 million and $32.7 million, respectively, in foreign currency losses, which were offset by $31.2 million and $51.0 million of gains, respectively, from related forward contracts.
During the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2016, the Company entered into forward interest rate swap transactions to hedge the fixed interest rate payments for an anticipated debt issuance, which was the issuance of the 3.950% Senior Notes.
The effective portion of the swaps is recorded in the Companys Consolidated Balance Sheets as a component of AOCI and is amortized to interest expense in the Companys Consolidated Statements of Operations through January 2028.
Changes in the fair value of the interest rate swap transactions are recorded in the Companys Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets as a component of AOCI.

During fiscal year 2017, the FASB issued a new accounting standard to simplify how an entity is required to test goodwill for impairment by eliminating the requirement to calculate the implied fair value of goodwill (i.e., Step 2 of the current goodwill impairment test) to measure a goodwill impairment charge.

(2) During the three months ended August 31, 2017, the decrease in days in accounts receivable from the prior sequential quarter was primarily due to the timing of sales and collections activity.
(3) During the three months ended February 28, 2018, the increase in days in inventory from the prior sequential quarter was primarily due to the increase in inventories to support expected sales levels in the third quarter of fiscal year 2018 along with overall increased demand.
(4) During the three months ended November 30, 2017 and August 31, 2017, the increase in days in accounts payable from the prior sequential quarter was primarily due to higher materials purchases during the quarter due to increased demand in the mobility business as well as the timing of purchases and cash payments from purchases during the quarter.
Net revenue increased 19.2% to $5.3 billion during the three months ended February 28, 2018, compared to $4.4 billion during the three months ended February 28, 2017.

Research and development expenses of $8.3 million (0.2% of net revenue) and $17.5 million (0.2% of net revenue) during the three months and six months ended February 28, 2018, respectively, compared to $7.1 million (0.2% of net revenue) and $14.7 million (0.2% of net revenue) during the three months and six months ended February 28, 2017, respectively, remained relatively consistent.
(1) Includes $2.1 million and $4.0 million recorded in the EMS segment, $3.3 million and $36.6 million recorded in the DMS segment and $0.0 million and $4.4 million of non-allocated charges for the three months ended February 28, 2018 and 2017, respectively.
Other expense increased to $10.5 million and $16.4 million for the three months and six months ended February 28, 2018, respectively, compared to $3.4 million and $8.1 million for the three months and six months ended February 28, 2017, respectively.

The effective tax rate of 47.6% for the six months ended February 28, 2018 increased from the effective tax rate of 40.3% for the six months ended February 28, 2017 primarily due to the $30.9 million of tax expense from the Tax Act impact driven primarily by the one-time mandatory deemed repatriation tax.
Management believes that the non-GAAP core financial measures set forth below are useful to facilitate evaluating the past and future performance of our ongoing manufacturing operations over multiple periods on a comparable basis by excluding the effects of the amortization of intangibles, stock-based compensation expense and related charges, restructuring and related charges, distressed customer charges, acquisition costs and certain purchase accounting adjustments, loss on disposal of subsidiaries, settlement of receivables and related charges, impairment of notes receivable and related charges, goodwill impairment charges, business interruption and impairment charges, net, other than temporary impairment on securities, income (loss) from discontinued operations, gain (loss) on sale of discontinued operations and certain other expenses, net of tax and certain deferred tax valuation allowance charges.
(2) Charges, net of insurance proceeds of $6.1 million and $16.4 million for the three months and six months ended February 28, 2018, respectively, relate to business interruptions and asset impairment costs associated with damage from Hurricane Maria, which impacted our operations in Cayey, Puerto Rico.
(3) Includes $30.9 million which is comprised of the provisional one-time mandatory deemed repatriation tax as required by the Tax Act and the provisional impact of the Tax Act to the re-measurement of U.S. deferred tax attributes for the three months and six months ended February 28, 2018, respectively.
As discussed in Note 12  Business Acquisitions to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements, we completed one acquisition during the six months ended February 28, 2018 which was accounted for as a business combination using the acquisition method of accounting.
We believe that our level of liquidity sources, which includes available borrowings under our revolving credit facilities, additional proceeds available under our asset-backed securitization programs and under our uncommitted trade accounts receivable sale programs, cash on hand, funds provided by operations and the access to the capital markets, will be adequate to fund our capital expenditures, the payment of any declared quarterly dividends, share repurchases, any potential acquisitions and our working capital requirements for the next 12 months.
During the three months and six months ended February 28, 2018, we sold $1.6 billion and $2.7 billion, respectively, of trade accounts receivable under these programs and we received cash proceeds of $1.6 billion and $2.7 billion, respectively.
Net cash provided by operating activities during the six months ended February 28, 2018 was primarily due to higher inventories, accounts receivable and prepaid expenses and other current assets, partially offset by higher accounts payable, accrued expenses and other liabilities.
The increase in prepaid expense and other current assets is primarily due to an increase in deferred purchase price receivables from an increase in receivables sold and the timing of cash collections, the increase in forward foreign exchange contract assets driven by hedging activity related to fluctuations of exchange rates and an increase in the value added tax receivables.
The increase in accounts payable, accrued expenses and other liabilities was primarily due to an increase in capital expenditures and materials purchases due to increased demand in the mobility business and the timing of purchases and cash payments.
