The accompanying unaudited consolidated financial statements of Preformed Line Products Company and subsidiaries (the “Company” or “PLPC”) have been prepared in accordance with United States of America (U.S.) generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) for interim financial information and with the instructions to Form 10-Q and Article 10 of Regulation S-X.
All revenue is recognized when the Company satisfies the performance obligations under the contract and control of the product is transferred to the customer, primarily based on shipping terms.
During the three months ended March 31, 2018 and 2017, the net change in LIFO inventories resulted in $.2 million and $.1 million of expense to Income before income taxes, respectively.
The Company anticipates contributing $.5 million of additional funding to the Plan during the second quarter of 2018.
The Company performs its annual impairment test for goodwill utilizing a discounted cash flow methodology, market comparables, and an overall market capitalization reasonableness test in computing fair value by reporting unit.
However, the Company believes that the methodologies and weightings used are reasonable and result in appropriate fair values of the reporting units.
As all stock options from the 1999 Stock Option Plan are fully vested, the Company recorded no compensation expense related to stock options for the three months ended March 31, 2018 and 2017.
The Company maintains an equity award program to give the Company a competitive advantage in attracting, retaining, and motivating officers, employees and directors and to provide an incentive to those individuals to increase shareholder value through long-term incentives directly linked to the Company’s performance.
Under the Preformed Line Products Company Long Term Incentive Plan of 2008 (the “LTIP”), certain employees, officers, and directors were eligible to receive awards of options, restricted shares and restricted share units (RSUs).
The total number of Company common shares reserved for awards under the LTIP was 900,000, of which 800,000 common shares were reserved for RSUs and 100,000 common shares have been reserved for share options.
Under the Incentive Plan, certain employees, officers, and directors will be eligible to receive awards of options, restricted shares and RSUs. The total number of Company common shares reserved for awards under the Incentive Plan is 1,000,000 of which 900,000 common shares have been reserved for restricted share awards and 100,000 common shares have been reserved for share options.
For the regular annual grants, a portion of the RSUs is subject to time-based cliff vesting and a portion is subject to vesting based upon the Company’s performance over a set period for all participants except the CEO.
All of the CEO’s regular annual RSUs are subject to vesting based upon the Company’s performance over a set-year period.
The fair value of RSUs is based on the market price of a common share on the grant date and the shares are restricted until they vest.
For time-based RSUs, the Company recognizes stock-based compensation expense on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period of the award in General and administrative expense in the accompanying Statements of Consolidated Income.
Compensation expense related to the time-based RSUs for both three-month periods ended March 31, 2018 and 2017 was $.1 million.
As of March 31, 2018, there was $1.0 million of total unrecognized compensation cost related to time-based RSUs that is expected to be recognized over the weighted-average remaining period of approximately 2.3 years.
For the performance-based RSUs, the number of RSUs in which the participants will vest depends on the Company’s level of performance measured by growth in either operating or pre-tax income and sales growth over a requisite performance period.
Depending on the extent to which the performance criterions are satisfied under the LTIP and the Incentive Plan, the participants are eligible to earn common shares over the vesting period.
Performance-based compensation expense for the three months ended March 31, 2018 and 2017 was $.7 million and $.4 million, respectively.
As of March 31, 2018, the remaining compensation expense of $5.4 million for outstanding performance-based RSU’s is expected to be recognized over a period of approximately 2.1 years.
To satisfy the vesting of its RSU awards, the Company has reserved new shares from its authorized but unissued shares.
Any additional awards granted will also be issued from the Company’s authorized but unissued shares.
The LTIP permitted and now the Incentive Plan permits the grant of 100,000 options to buy common shares of the Company to certain employees at not less than fair market value of the shares on the date of grant.
For both three-month periods ended March 31, 2018 and 2017, the Company recorded compensation expense related to the stock options currently vested of less than $.1 million.
The total compensation cost related to nonvested awards not yet recognized at March 31, 2018 is expected to be less than $.1 million over a weighted-average period of approximately 1.7 years.
The Company maintains a trust, commonly referred to as a rabbi trust, in connection with the Company’s deferred compensation plan.
The deferred compensation plan allows the Directors to elect to receive Director fees in common shares of the Company at a later date instead of fees paid each quarter in cash.
Second, this plan allows certain Company employees to defer restricted shares or RSUs for future distribution in the form of common shares.
Assets of the rabbi trust are consolidated, and the value of the Company’s common shares held in the rabbi trust is classified in Shareholders’ equity and generally accounted for in a manner similar to treasury stock.
The Company recognizes the original amount of the deferred compensation (fair value of the deferred stock award at the date of grant) as the basis for recognition in common shares issued to the rabbi trust.
Changes in the fair value of amounts owed to certain employees or Directors are not recognized as the Company’s deferred compensation plan does not permit diversification and must be settled by the delivery of a fixed number of the Company’s common shares.
The Company has a non-qualified Supplemental Profit Sharing Plan for its executives.
The liability for this unfunded Supplemental Profit Sharing Plan was $4.7 million and $4.8 million at March 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017, respectively, and is recorded within Other noncurrent liabilities on the Company’s consolidated balance sheets.
During January 2018, the Company amended the Supplemental Profit Sharing Plan to allow the participants the ability to hypothetically invest their proportionate award into various investment options, which primarily includes mutual funds.
The company then credits earnings, gains and losses to the participants’ deferred compensation account balances based on the investments selected by the participants.
The Company measures the fair value of the Supplemental Profit Sharing Plan liability using the market values of the participants’ underlying investment accounts.
In March 2017, the FASB issued ASU 2017-07, “Improving the Presentation of Net Periodic Pension Cost and Net Periodic Postretirement Benefit Cost,” which requires that an employer report the service cost component in the same line item or items as other compensation costs arising from services rendered by the pertinent employees during the period.
The adoption did not have a material impact on the Company’s consolidated financial statements.
In January 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-01, “Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities”, which changes how companies recognize, measure, present and make disclosures about certain financial assets and financial liabilities.

Refer to Note I “Fair Value of Financial Assets and Liabilities” for additional details regarding the Company’s marketable securities.
