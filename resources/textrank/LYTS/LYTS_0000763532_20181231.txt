A summary of the Company’s significant accounting policies is included in Note 1 to the audited consolidated financial statements of the Company’s fiscal 2018 Annual Report on Form 10-K.
The Company recognizes revenue when it satisfies the performance obligation in its customer contracts or purchase orders.
Most of the Company’s products have a single performance obligation which is satisfied at a point in time when control is transferred to the customer.
For customer contracts with multiple performance obligations, the Company allocates the transaction price and any discounts to each performance obligation based on relative standalone selling prices.
The Company offers standard warranties that do not represent separate performance obligations.
The Company disaggregates the revenue from contracts with customers by the timing of revenue recognition because the Company believes it best depicts the nature, amount, and timing of our revenue and cash flows.
The Company’s contracts with customers have an expected duration of one year or less, as such the Company applies the practical expedient to expense sales commissions as incurred, and have omitted disclosures on the amount of remaining performance obligations.
On  July 1, 2018, the Company adopted ASU 2014-09.
The Company recorded a net increase to beginning retained earnings of $591,000 on  July 1, 2018 due to the cumulative impact of adopting Topic 606, as described below.
The amended guidance is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years and interim periods within those years, beginning after  December 15, 2018, or the Company’s fiscal year 2020, with early adoption permitted.
The Company has an implementation team tasked with reviewing our lease obligations and determining the impact of the new standard to its financial statements.
The Company will continue to evaluate the new standard’s impact to its financial statements.
These activities primarily include intercompany profit in inventory eliminations, expense related to certain corporate officers and support staff, the Company’s internal audit staff, expense related to the Company’s Board of Directors, equity compensation expense for various equity awards granted to corporate administration employees, certain consulting expenses, investor relations activities, and a portion of the Company’s legal, auditing and professional fee expenses.
As a result, the geographic distribution of the Company’s net sales and long-lived assets originate within North America.
(c)   Options to purchase 3,536,732 common shares and 3,569,762 common shares for the three months ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively, were not included in the computation of the three month diluted loss per share because the exercise price was greater than the average fair market value of the common shares.
Additionally, options to purchase 3,356,101 common shares and 3,549,705 common shares for the six months ended at December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively, were not included in the computation of the six month diluted loss per share because the exercise price was greater than the average fair market value of the common shares.
For the three months ended and the six months ended in December 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017, the effect of dilutive securities was not included in the calculation of diluted loss per share because there was a net loss for the period.
A sustained and significant decline in the Company’s stock price in the second quarter of fiscal 2019 led management to believe that a triggering event occurred and that an interim goodwill impairment test was required for one of the reporting units in the Lighting Segment that contains goodwill, as of  December 31, 2018.
Amortization expense for intangible assets was $689,000 and $690,000 for the three months ended  December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively, and $1,380 and $1,380 for the six months ended  December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively.

The Company recorded severance expense of $492,000 and $83,000 in the six months ended  December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively.
The closure is part of ongoing actions to align the Company’s supply chain to more cost effectively serve the changing requirements of the lighting market.
The Company will move production to its other existing facilities.
The Company will record an estimated range of restructuring costs of $0.8 million to $1.5 million mostly over the next two quarters and up until the time the facility is ultimately sold.

Fiscal 2019 second quarter net sales of $89,541,000 decreased $2.8 million or 3% as compared to second quarter fiscal 2018 net sales of $92,305,000.
Fiscal 2019 second quarter operating loss of $(20.3) million represents a $24.8 million change from operating income of $4.6 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2018.
The $24.8 million change from operating income in fiscal 2018 to an operating loss in fiscal 2019 was mostly the result of a pre-tax $20.2 million goodwill impairment charge in the Lighting Segment in the second quarter of fiscal 2019.
Adjusted fiscal 2019 second quarter operating income of $1.5 million decreased $3.1 million or 66% from adjusted fiscal 2018 operating income of $4.6 million.
Adjusted first half fiscal 2019 operating income of $5.1 million decreased $2.8 million or 35% from adjusted fiscal 2018 operating income of $7.8 million.
Also contributing to the period-over-period results is a one-time adjustment to the Company’s paid-time-off policy in fiscal 2019 which resulted in a favorable pre-tax adjustment to earnings of $1.2 million.
Lighting Segment net sales of $63,654,000 in the second quarter of fiscal 2019 decreased 8% from fiscal 2018 same period net sales of $69,174,000.
Graphics Segment net sales of $25,887,000 in the second quarter of fiscal 2019 increased $2.8 million or 12% from fiscal 2018 same period net sales of $23,131,000.
The Graphics Segment second quarter fiscal 2019 operating income of $861,000 decreased $1.4 million or 62% from operating income of $2,255,000 in the same period of fiscal 2018.
The decrease of $1.4 million was primarily the net result of a shift in customer mix on higher sales and an increase in selling and administrative expenses.
Administrative expenses of $2,667,000 in the second quarter of fiscal 2019 decreased $0.3 million from the same period of the prior year.
The Company reported $615,000 net interest expense in the second quarter of fiscal 2019 compared to $417,000 net interest expense in the second quarter of fiscal 2018.
The Company reported a net loss of $(15,782,000) in the second quarter of fiscal 2019 compared to net loss of $(1,468,000) in the same period of the prior year.
The change in the net loss in fiscal 2018 to the net loss in the second quarter of fiscal 2019 is mostly driven by the $20.2 million goodwill impairment charge in the second quarter of fiscal 2019 with no comparable charge in the second quarter of fiscal 2018.
Also contributing to the quarter-over-quarter change is a $4.7 million charge in the second quarter of fiscal 2018 related to the re-valuation of the Company’s deferred tax assets with no comparable charge in fiscal 2019.
To a lesser degree, there were other non-GAAP charges in both fiscal years besides the goodwill impairment and the re-valuation of the deferred tax assets impacting the comparable quarter-over-quarter results (refer to the non-GAAP tables above.) When the impact of all non-GAAP charges is removed from both fiscal years, the fiscal 2019 adjusted net income of $875,000 decreased $2.4 million from fiscal 2018 adjusted net income of $3,267,000.
The change in adjusted net income is primarily the net result of decreased net sales, decreased gross profit, decreased selling and administrative expenses, increased interest expense, and a lower tax rate.
The Lighting Segment first half fiscal 2019 operating loss of $(14,602,000) increased $3.1 million from an operating loss of $(17,655,000) in the same period of fiscal 2018 primarily due to a $20.2 million pre-tax goodwill impairment charge in fiscal 2019 compared to a $28 million pre-tax goodwill impairment charge in fiscal 2018.
When the goodwill impairment charges and the restructuring charges of $1,623,000 ($1,598,000 in cost of sales and $25,000 in selling and administrative expenses) are removed from both fiscal years, fiscal 2019 adjusted operating income of $7,369,000 was $3.0 million lower than fiscal 2018 adjusted operating income of $10,345,000.
Graphics Segment net sales of $49,412,000 in the first half of fiscal 2019 increased $7.2 million or 17% from fiscal 2018 same period net sales of $42,169,000.
Selling and administrative expenses of $7,461,000 in the first half of fiscal 2019 increased $0.1 million or 1% from the same period of fiscal 2018.
The Graphics Segment first half fiscal 2019 operating income of $3,248,000 decreased $0.5 million or 13% from operating income of $3,731,000 in the same period of fiscal 2018.
The decrease of $0.5 million was primarily the net result of a shift in customer mix on higher sales and a modest increase in selling and administrative expenses.
Administrative expenses of $5,974,000 in the first half of fiscal 2019 decreased $0.3 million from the same period of the prior year.
The Company reported $1,133,000 net interest expense in the first half of fiscal 2019 compared to $820,000 net interest expense in the first half of fiscal 2019.
The first half FY 2018 effective tax rate of 18.9% and income tax benefit of $3,990,000 was most notably influenced by the first quarter goodwill impairment partially offset by a $4.7 million re-valuation of the Company’s deferred tax assets for the US tax rate change on the enactment date of the Tax Cut and Jobs Act.
The Company reported a net loss of $(14,033,000) in the first half of fiscal 2019 compared to net loss of $(17,097,000) in the same period of the prior year.
The change from the net loss in fiscal 2018 to the net loss in the second half of fiscal 2019 is mostly driven by the $20.2 million and the $28 million goodwill impairment charges in the first of fiscal 2019 and fiscal 2018, respectively.
Also contributing to the year-over-year change is a $4.7 million charge in the first half of fiscal 2018 related to the re-valuation of the Company’s deferred tax assets with no comparable charge in fiscal 2019.
(Refer to the non-GAAP tables above.) When the impact of all non-GAAP charges is removed from both fiscal years, the fiscal 2019 adjusted net income of $3,078,000 decreased $1.9 million from fiscal 2018 adjusted net income of $5,001,000.
The change in adjusted net income is primarily the net result of decreased net sales, decreased gross profit, decreased selling and administrative expenses, increased interest expense, and a larger tax benefit.
The $6.9 million increase in working capital from June 30, 2018 to December 31, 2018 was primarily related to the net effect of increased cash and cash equivalents ($6.4 million), increased net accounts receivable ($5.8 million), increased net inventory ($3.1 million), an increase in accrued expenses ($0.7 million), a decrease in refundable income taxes ($0.8 million), and an increase in accounts payable ($8.8 million).
The Company generated $7.6 million of cash from operating activities in the first half of fiscal 2019 as compared to a use of cash of $43,000 in the same period of the prior year.
This $7.7 million increase in net cash flows from operating activities is primarily the net result of an increase rather than a decrease in accounts payable (favorable change of $11.3 million), a smaller increase in net accounts receivable (favorable change of $9.8 million), an increase rather than a decrease in net inventory (unfavorable change of $9.6 million), a greater decrease in accrued expenses and other (unfavorable change of $1.2 million), and an improvement in net loss from fiscal 2018 to fiscal 2019 more than offset by several non-cash add-backs to the net loss in both fiscal years (unfavorable change of $3.3 million).
Based on a strategy of balancing inventory reductions with customer service and the timing of shipments, net inventory increased 4.8 million in the first half of fiscal 2019 in the Graphics Segment which was partially offset by a decrease in net inventory in the Lighting Segment of $1.7 million.
The Company believes that its $100 million line of credit plus cash flows from operating activities are adequate for the Company’s fiscal 2019 operational and capital expenditure needs.
The Company used cash of $1.6 million related to investing activities in the first half of fiscal 2019 as compared to a source of $0.3 million in the same period of the prior year, resulting in an unfavorable change of $1.9 million.
Capital expenditures for the first half of fiscal 2019 increased $0.4 million to $1.6 million from the same period in fiscal 2018.
The Company sold its Woonsocket manufacturing facility for $1.5 million in the first half of fiscal 2018 which contributed to the change in cash flow from investing activities from fiscal 2018 to fiscal 2019.
The Company had a $0.3 million source of cash related to financing activities in the first half of fiscal 2019 compared to a use of cash of $0.2 million in the first half of fiscal 2018.
