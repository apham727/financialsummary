The Company offers standard warranties that do not represent separate performance obligations.
The Company is not always responsible for installation of products it sells and has no post-installation responsibilities other than standard warranties.
The Company also offers installation services.
The Company disaggregates the revenue from contracts with customers by the timing of revenue recognition because the Company believes it best depicts the nature, amount, and timing of our revenue and cash flows.
The Company’s contracts with customers have an expected duration of one year or less, as such the Company applies the practical expedient to expense sales commissions as incurred and have omitted disclosures on the amount of remaining performance obligations.

On July 1, 2018, the Company adopted ASU 2014-09.
The Company recorded a net increase to beginning retained earnings of $591,000 on July 1, 2018 due to the cumulative impact of adopting Topic 606, as described below.
In February 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued ASU 2016-02, “Leases.” The amended guidance requires an entity to recognize assets and liabilities that arise from leases.
The amended guidance is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal and interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2018, or the Company’s fiscal 2020, with early adoption permitted.
The Company adopted this guidance effective July 1, 2019 using a modified-retrospective transition method, under which it elected not to adjust comparative periods.
The Company elected the package of practical expedients permitted under the new guidance to not reassess prior conclusions related to contracts containing leases, lease classification, and initial direct costs.
In addition, the Company elected the practical expedient to not separate lease and non-lease component and the accounting policy election to not present leases with an initial term of twelve months or less on the balance sheet.

All of the Company’s leases are operating leases and are included in other long-term assets with the corresponding liability in other long-term liabilities.

The adoption of the new lease standard resulted in the recognition of right-of-use assets (ROU assets) of $10.4 million and lease liabilities of 10.8 million which includes the impact of existing deferred rents and tenant improvement allowances on the consolidated balance sheets as of July 1, 2019 for the Company’s real estate leases.
In February 2019, the Company amended its secured line of credit to a $75 million facility from a $100 million facility in order to better match its financing needs with an appropriate borrowing capacity.
Interest on the revolving line of credit is charged based upon an increment over the LIBOR rate as periodically determined, or at the bank’s base lending rate, at the Company’s option.
The increment over the LIBOR borrowing rate, as periodically determined, fluctuates between 125 and 250 basis points depending upon the ratio of indebtedness to earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (“EBITDA”), as defined in the line of credit agreement.
Under the terms of this line of credit, the Company has agreed to a negative pledge of real estate assets and is required to comply with financial covenants that limit the ratio of indebtedness to EBITDA and require a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio.
The Company is in compliance with all of its loan covenants as of September 30, 2019.
The Company paid cash dividends of $1,319,000 and $1,296,000 in the three months ended September 30, 2019 and 2018, respectively.
The plan implements the use of a fungible share ratio that consumes 2.5 available shares for every full value share awarded by the Company as stock compensation.
The Company may occasionally issue a standby letter of credit in favor of third parties.
In the first quarter of fiscal 2020, the Company sold its New Windsor, New York facility.
The Company also incurred additional restructuring costs totaling $233,000 related to closure of the New York facility which impacted both the Lighting and Graphics segment.
The Company leases two of its manufacturing facilities along with a small office space, a company vehicle, several forklifts, several small tooling items, and various items of office equipment.
All of the Company’s leases are operating leases and are included in other long-term assets with the corresponding liability in other long-term liabilities.
The Company does not assume renewals in determining the lease term unless the renewals are deemed reasonably certain.
The Company has certain leases that contain lease and non-lease components and has elected to utilize the practical expedient to account for these components together as a single lease component.
The Company used its incremental borrowing rate when determining the present value of lease payments.
The adoption of the new lease standard resulted in the recognition of right-of-use assets (ROU assets) of $10.4 million and lease liabilities of 10.8 million which includes the impact of existing deferred rents and tenant improvement allowances on the consolidated balance sheets as of July 1, 2019 for the Company’s real estate leases.

Fiscal 2020 first quarter operating income of $6.9 million increased $4.0 million from operating income of $2.9 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2019.
The $4.0 million increase in operating income in fiscal 2019 was impacted by the sale of the Company’s New Windsor, New York facility in the first quarter of fiscal 2020 which favorably resulted in a pre-tax gain of $4.8 million.
Also contributing to the period-over-period change in operating income is a one-time adjustment to the Company’s paid-time-off policy in fiscal 2019 which resulted in a favorable pre-tax adjustment to earnings of $1.2 million with no comparable event in fiscal 2020.
When the impact of the sale of the New Windsor facility along with the other restructuring and plant closure costs are removed from the operating results along with the one-time adjustment to the Company’s paid-time-off policy in fiscal 2019, operating income period-over-period remained relatively flat.
Selling and administrative expenses of $8,060,000 in the first quarter of fiscal year 2020 decreased $3.6 million from the same period of fiscal 2019 selling and administrative expenses of $11,625,000, primarily due to the $4.8 million gain on the sale of the New Windsor, New York facility.
When the $4.8 million gain is removed from fiscal 2020 results, there was a $1.3 million or 11.1% increase in selling and administrative expenses.
The increase in selling and administrative expenses is mostly driven by higher commission expense which is the result of increased sales volume and a one-time adjustment to the Company’s paid-time-off policy in fiscal 2019 with no comparable event in fiscal 2020.
The Lighting Segment first quarter fiscal 2019 operating income of $9,159,000 increased $5.3 million from operating income of $3,850,000 in the same period of fiscal 2019 primarily due to the $4.8million gain on the sale of its New Windsor, New York facility.
When the impact of $4.8 million gain is removed from fiscal 2020 results along with the restructuring and plant closure costs in both fiscal years, fiscal 2020 Non-GAAP adjusted operating income of $4,510,000 was $70,000 higher than fiscal 2019 Non-GAAP adjusted operating income of $4,440,000.
Graphics Segment net sales of $25,510,000 in the first quarter of fiscal 2020 increased $2.0 million or 8.4% from fiscal 2019 same period net sales of $23,525,000.
The Company reported $431,000 net interest expense in the first quarter of fiscal 2020 compared to $518,000 net interest expense in the first quarter of fiscal 2019.
The change from interest expense from fiscal 2019 to fiscal 2020 is primarily the result of reduced borrowings against the Company’s line of credit.
The Company reported a net income of $4,475,000 in the first quarter of fiscal 2020 compared to net income of $1,749,000 in the same period of the prior year.
The change in net income between fiscal 2019 and fiscal 2020 includes the $4.8 million gain on the sale of the Company’s New Windsor, New York facility along with other restructuring and plant closure costs.
The change in net income is also the net result of increased net sales, increased gross profit, increased selling and administrative expenses, decreased interest expense, and a higher tax rate.
For long-term liquidity indicators, the Company believes its ratio of long-term debt to equity and its historical levels of net cash flows from operating activities to be the most important measures.
The Company generated $6.4 million of cash from operating activities in the first quarter of fiscal 2020 as compared to a source of cash of $2.2 million in the same period of the prior year.
This $4.2 million increase in net cash flows from operating activities is the result the Company’s strategy to aggressively manage its working capital which includes the reduction of the accounts receivable days sales outstanding (DSO), increasing inventory turns while simultaneously reducing inventory levels, and effectively managing the Company’s supply chain which includes partnering with its suppliers to find the appropriate service level while effectively managing payment terms.
Based on a strategy of balancing inventory reductions with customer service and the timing of shipments, net inventory decreased 0.8 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2020 in the Graphics Segment which more than offset an increase in net inventory in the Lighting Segment of $0.4 million.
This line of credit is a $75 million five-year credit line expiring in the third quarter of fiscal 2022.
The Company believes that its $75 million line of credit plus cash flows from operating activities are adequate for the Company’s fiscal 2020 operational and capital expenditure needs.
The Company had a source of cash of $12.0 million related to investing activities in the first quarter of fiscal 2020 as compared to a use of cash of $0.6 million in the same period of the prior year, resulting in a favorable change of $12.6 million.
Capital expenditures for the first quarter of fiscal 2020 decreased $0.3 million to $0.4 million from the same period in fiscal 2019.
The Company sold its New Windsor, New York manufacturing facility for $12.3 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2020 which contributed to the change in cash flow from investing activities from fiscal 2019 to fiscal 2020.
