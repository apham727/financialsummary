The Company may first assess qualitative factors in order to determine if goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets are impaired.
If it is determined more likely than not that goodwill and indefinite-lived assets are impaired, or if the Company elects not to first assess qualitative factors, the Company’s impairment testing continues with the estimation of the fair value of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets using a combination of a market approach and an income (discounted cash flow) approach, at the reporting unit level.
The Company identified its reporting units in conjunction with its annual goodwill impairment testing.
The Company relies upon a number of factors, judgments and estimates when conducting its impairment testing including, but not limited to, the Company’s stock price, operating results, forecasts, anticipated future cash flows and marketplace data.
