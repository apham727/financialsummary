Fair value measurements of nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities are primarily used in goodwill and other intangible asset impairment analyses, long-lived asset impairment analyses, and in the purchase price of acquired companies (if any).
The computation of basic earnings per common share is based on the weighted average common shares outstanding for the period net of treasury shares held in the Company’s nonqualified deferred compensation plan.
Common share equivalents include the dilutive effect of stock options, restricted stock units, contingently issuable shares and common shares to be issued under a deferred compensation plan, all of which totaled 756,000 and 787,000 shares for the three month ended  December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively, and 686,000 shares and 852,000 shares for the six months ended  December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively.

If it is determined more likely than not that goodwill and indefinite-lived assets are impaired, or if the Company elects not to first assess qualitative factors, the Company’s impairment testing continues with the estimation of the fair value of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets using a combination of a market approach and an income (discounted cash flow) approach, at the reporting unit level.
The Company identified its reporting units in conjunction with its annual goodwill impairment testing.
The Company relies upon a number of factors, judgments and estimates when conducting its impairment testing including, but not limited to, the Company’s stock price, operating results, forecasts, anticipated future cash flows and marketplace data.
A sustained and significant decline in the Company’s stock price in the first quarter of fiscal 2018 led management to believe that a triggering event occurred and that an interim goodwill impairment test was required for one of the reporting units in the Lighting Segment that contains goodwill, as of  September 30, 2017.

The maximum exercise period of stock options granted under the 2012 Plan is ten years.
If a stock option holder’s employment with the Company terminates by reason of death, disability or retirement, as defined in the Plan, the Plan generally provides for acceleration of vesting.

Fiscal 2018 first half net sales of $179,771,000 increased $10 million or 5.9% as compared to first half fiscal 2017 net sales of $169,817,000.
The change from operating income in fiscal 2017 to an operating loss in fiscal 2018 is primarily the result of a $28 million goodwill impairment in the first quarter of fiscal 2018.
Also contributing to the year-over-year change in operating income is the net result of increased net sales, increased gross profit and increased gross profit as a percentage of sales, and an increase in selling and administrative expenses.

Also contributing to the quarter-over-quarter net change in net income are increased net sales, increased gross profit and an improvement of gross profit as a percentage of sales, increased selling and administrative expenses, and restructuring and plant closure costs in fiscal 2017 with no comparable costs in fiscal 2018.

The change in amount of gross profit is due to the net effect of increased net sales (customer plus inter-segment net sales), an improvement in the gross profit margin of installation and shipping and handling sales, and decreased employee compensation and benefit expense ($0.5 million).
The Graphics Segment first half fiscal 2018 operating income of $3,731,000 increased $1.5 million or 70.3% from operating income of $2,191,000 in the same period of fiscal 2017.
Administrative expenses of $6,312,000 in the first half of fiscal 2018 increased $0.7 million or 11.5% from the same period of the prior year.
Most of the increase in employee compensation and benefit expense is the result of the reduction of incentive-based compensation in the second quarter of fiscal 2017 which is driven by the operating results of the Company.

Also contributing to the quarter-over-quarter net change in net income are increased net sales, increased gross profit and an improvement of gross profit as a percentage of sales, increased selling and administrative expenses, and restructuring and plant closure costs in fiscal 2017 with no comparable costs in fiscal 2018.
The Company used $0.8 million of cash from operating activities in the first half of fiscal 2018 as compared to a source of cash of $4.6 million in the same period of the prior year.
This $5.4 million decrease in net cash flows from operating activities is primarily the net result of a larger increase in accounts receivable (unfavorable change of $8.2 million), a larger decrease in accounts payable (unfavorable change of $2.4 million), a decrease rather than an increase in customer prepayments (unfavorable change of $0.4 million), a smaller decrease in net inventory (unfavorable change of $0.7 million), a smaller decrease in accrued expenses and other (favorable change of $1.9 million), a decrease in refundable income taxes (favorable change of $0.8 million), and a change from net income in fiscal 2017 to a net loss in fiscal 2018 more than offset by an increase in non-cash items (favorable change of $3.7 million).
Based on a strategy of balancing inventory reductions with customer service and the timing of shipments, net inventory increases occurred in the first half of fiscal 2018 in the Graphics Segment of approximately $0.9 million which was more than offset by a decrease in net inventory in the Lighting Segment of $2.2 million.
