A summary of the Company’s significant accounting policies is included in Note 1 to the audited consolidated financial statements of the Company’s fiscal 2018 Annual Report on Form 10-K.
The Company recognizes revenue when it satisfies the performance obligation in its customer contracts or purchase orders.
Most of the Company’s products have a single performance obligation which is satisfied at a point in time when control is transferred to the customer.
For customer contracts with multiple performance obligations, the Company allocates the transaction price and any discounts to each performance obligation based on relative standalone selling prices.
The Company offers standard warranties that do not represent separate performance obligations.
The Company’s contracts with customers have an expected duration of one year or less, as such the Company applies the practical expedient to expense sales commissions as incurred, and have omitted disclosures on the amount of remaining performance obligations.
The Company’s accounts receivable balance represents the Company’s unconditional right to receive payment from its customers with contracts.
The amended guidance is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years and interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2018, or the Company’s fiscal year 2020, with early adoption permitted.
The Company has an implementation team tasked with reviewing our lease obligations and determining the impact of the new standard to its financial statements.
Under the terms of the agreement, the Company will receive approximately $12 million of gross proceeds related to the sale and expects to report a gain between $3 million to $5.5 million.
As a result, the geographic distribution of the Company’s net sales and long-lived assets originate within North America.
(c)   Options to purchase 3,787,519 common shares and 1,945,348 common shares for the three months ended March 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively, were not included in the computation of the three month diluted loss per share because the exercise price was greater than the average fair market value of the common shares.
Additionally, options to purchase 3,702,031 common shares and 3,086,121 common shares for the nine months ended at March 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively, were not included in the computation of the nine month diluted loss per share because the exercise price was greater than the average fair market value of the common shares.
For the three months ended in March 31, 2019 and the nine months ended March 31, 2019 and 2018, the effect of dilutive securities was not included in the calculation of diluted loss per share because there was a net loss for the period.
A sustained and significant decline in the Company’s stock price in the second quarter of fiscal 2019 led management to believe that a triggering event occurred and that an interim goodwill impairment test was required for one of the reporting units in the Lighting Segment that contains goodwill, as of December 31, 2018.
The result of the impairment test on the reporting unit in the Lighting Segment indicated that goodwill was impaired by $20,165,000.
The Company will continue to monitor market conditions and other events that may result in a sustained and significant drop in its stock price which would require an interim goodwill impairment test.
As of March 1, 2019, the Company performed its annual goodwill impairment test on the two reporting units that contain goodwill.
The preliminary goodwill impairment test on one reporting unit in the Lighting Segment passed with a business enterprise value that was $38.9 million or 54% above the carrying value of this reporting unit including goodwill.
The preliminary goodwill impairment test of the reporting unit with goodwill in the Graphics Segment passed with an estimated business enterprise value that was $3.0 million or 297% above the carrying value of the reporting unit including goodwill.
The Company performed its annual review of indefinite-lived intangible assets as of March 1, 2019 and determined there was no impairment.
The definitive indefinite-lived impairment test is expected to be completed in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019.
Amortization expense (in thousands) for intangible assets was $691 and $691 for the three months ended March 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively, and $2,071 and $2,071 for the nine months ended March 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively.
In February 2019, the Company amended its secured line of credit to a $75 million facility from a $100 million facility in order to better match its financing needs with an appropriate borrowing capacity.
Interest on the revolving line of credit is charged based upon an increment over the LIBOR rate as periodically determined, or at the bank’s base lending rate, at the Company’s option.
Under the terms of this line of credit, the Company has agreed to a negative pledge of real estate assets and is required to comply with financial covenants that limit the ratio of indebtedness to EBITDA and require a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio.
The Company paid cash dividends of $3,882,000 and $3,845,000 in the nine months ended March 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively.
The Company recorded severance expense of $534,000 and $91,000 in the nine months ended March 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively.
As of March 31, 2019, the Company has incurred restructuring costs of $155,000 related to the closure of the Hawthorne facility.
The Company also incurred $148,000 of expense to write-down inventory which is a re-valuation of the previous estimate and which is not included in the tables below.
Additionally, the above tables do not include expense of $1,067,000 recorded during the nine months ended March 31, 2019 related to the write-down of inventory included as cost of sales as part of facility closures.
The above table does not include fixed asset impairment and accelerated depreciation expense of $228,000 recorded in the first nine months of fiscal 2019.
In the second quarter of fiscal 2019, a deferred tax asset of $4.8 million was created as a result of the impairment of goodwill in the Lighting reporting unit.
In the first quarter of fiscal 2018, a deferred tax asset of $10.7 million was created as a result of the impairment of goodwill in the Lighting reporting unit.

Fiscal 2019 third quarter net sales of $72,832,000 decreased $6.0 million or 8% as compared to third quarter fiscal 2018 net sales of $78,843,000.
Fiscal 2019 first nine months net sales of $247,330,000 decreased $11.3 million or 4% as compared to first nine months fiscal 2018 net sales of $258,614,000.
Fiscal 2019 third quarter operating loss of $(2,273,000) represents a $3.0 million change from operating income of $0.7 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2018.
The $3.0 million change from operating income in fiscal 2018 to an operating loss in fiscal 2019 was primarily the result of decreased net sales and decreased gross profit offset by a decrease in selling and administrative expenses.
Fiscal 2019 first nine months operating loss of $(19,610,000) represents a $0.1 million increase in operating loss from an operating loss of $(19,524,000) in the nine months of fiscal 2018.
The decrease in adjusted operating income was the result of decreased net sales and decreased gross profit offset by a decrease in selling and administrative expenses.
Also contributing to the period-over-period results is a one-time adjustment to the Company’s paid-time-off policy in fiscal 2019 which resulted in a favorable pre-tax adjustment to earnings of $1.2 million.
Lighting Segment net sales of $52,785,000 in the third quarter of fiscal 2019 decreased $8.8 million or 14% from fiscal 2018 same period net sales of $61,554,000.
Graphics Segment net sales of $20,047,000 in the third quarter of fiscal 2019 increased $2.7 million or 16% from fiscal 2018 same period net sales of $17,289,000.
Selling and administrative expenses of $3,916,000 in the third quarter of fiscal 2019 increased $0.4 million or 10% from the same period of fiscal 2018 primarily as a result of an increase in outside service expense and bad debt expense.
The Company reported $579,000 net interest expense in the third quarter of fiscal 2019 compared to $400,000 net interest expense in the third quarter of fiscal 2018.
The change in interest expense from fiscal 2018 to fiscal 2019 is the result of higher interest rates on the Company’s line of credit.
The $133,000 income tax expense in the third quarter of fiscal 2019 compared to a pre-tax loss is the result of a cumulative change to the Company’s estimated annual tax rate.
This is the net result of adjusting the Company’s year-to-date tax expense to an overall income tax rate of 28.9% influenced by the first quarter goodwill impairment and by certain permanent book-tax differences and adjustments related to uncertain income tax positions.
The Company reported a net loss of $(3,168,000) in the third quarter of fiscal 2019 compared to net income of $220,000 in the same period of the prior year.
The change from net income in fiscal 2018 to a net loss in the third quarter of fiscal 2019 is the net result of decreased net sales, decreased gross profit, decreased selling and administrative expenses, and increased interest expense.
Diluted loss per share of $(0.12) was reported in the third quarter of fiscal 2019 as compared to $ 0.01 diluted earnings per share in the same period of fiscal 2018.
The Lighting Segment first nine month fiscal 2019 operating loss of $(13,911,000) decreased $0.8 million from an operating loss of $(14,673,000) in the same period of fiscal 2018 primarily due to a $20.2 million pre-tax goodwill impairment charge in fiscal 2019 compared to a $28.0 million pre-tax goodwill impairment charge in fiscal 2018.
When the goodwill impairment charges are removed from both fiscal years along with the restructuring charges of $1,991,000 ($1,859,000 in cost of sales and $132,000 in selling and administrative expenses) and severance expense ($77,000 in cost of sales and $160,000 in selling and administrative expense) from the current fiscal year, fiscal 2019 adjusted operating income of $8,482,000 was $4.9 million lower than fiscal 2018 adjusted operating income of $13,335,000.
Graphics Segment net sales of $69,459,000 in the first nine months of fiscal 2019 increased $10.0 million or 17% from fiscal 2018 same period net sales of $59,458,000.
Selling and administrative expenses of $11,377,000 in the first nine months of fiscal 2019 increased $0.4 million or 4% from the same period of fiscal 2018.
The Company reported $1,712,000 net interest expense in the first nine months of fiscal 2019 compared to $1,220,000 net interest expense in the first nine months of fiscal 2019.
The change in interest expense from fiscal 2018 to fiscal 2019 is the result of higher interest rates on the Company’s line of credit.
The $4,304,000 income tax benefit in the first nine months of fiscal 2019 represents a consolidated effective tax rate of 20.0%, which is inclusive of a cumulative change to the estimated annual tax rate mostly due to the tax treatment related to the fourth quarter sale of its New Windsor, New York facility.
This is the net result of an overall income tax rate of 28.9% influenced by the first quarter goodwill impairment, by the second quarter $4.7 million tax adjustment related to the revaluation of the Company’s deferred tax assets, and by certain permanent book-tax differences and adjustments related to uncertain income tax positions.
The Company reported a net loss of $(17,201,000) in the first nine months of fiscal 2019 compared to net loss of $(16,877,000) in the same period of the prior year.
The increase in the net loss from fiscal 2018 to the net loss in the first nine months of fiscal 2019 is mostly driven by decreased net sales, decreased gross profit, decreased selling and administrative expenses, increased interest expense, and a larger tax benefit.
Diluted loss per share of $(0.66) was reported in the first nine months of fiscal 2019 as compared to $(0.65) diluted loss per share in the same period of fiscal 2018.
The $0.4 million increase in working capital from June 30, 2018 to March 31, 2019 was primarily related to the net effect of decreased cash and cash equivalents ($1.5 million), increased net accounts receivable ($1.5 million), increased net inventory ($0.6 million), a decrease in accrued expenses ($2.1 million), a decrease in refundable income taxes ($0.3 million), an increase on other current assets ($0.6 million), and an increase in accounts payable ($2.7 million).
The Company generated $6.4 million of cash from operating activities in the first nine months of fiscal 2019 as compared to a source of cash of $7.9 million in the same period of the prior year.
This $1.5 million decrease in net cash flows from operating activities is primarily the net result of an increase rather than a decrease in accounts payable (favorable change of $5.8 million), a decrease rather than an increase in net accounts receivable (favorable change of $3.7 million), a greater increase in net inventory (unfavorable change of $4.0 million), a greater decrease in accrued expenses and other (unfavorable change of $1.3 million), and an increase in net loss from fiscal 2018 to fiscal 2019 along with unfavorable change of non-cash add-backs to the change in net loss (unfavorable change of $6.1 million).
Based on a strategy of balancing inventory reductions with customer service and the timing of shipments, net inventory increased $3.7 million in the first nine months of fiscal 2019 in the Graphics Segment which was partially offset by a decrease in net inventory in the Lighting Segment of $3.0 million.
(The Company amended its revolving line of credit in the third quarter of fiscal 2019 and reduced its available line of credit from $100 million to $75 million in order to better match its financing needs with an appropriate borrowing capacity.) This line of credit is a $75 million five-year credit line expiring in the third quarter of fiscal 2022.
The Company believes that its $75 million line of credit plus cash flows from operating activities are adequate for the Company’s fiscal 2019 operational and capital expenditure needs.
The Company used cash of $2.3 million related to investing activities in the first nine months of fiscal 2019 as compared to a use of $0.7 million in the same period of the prior year, resulting in an unfavorable change of $1.6 million.
Capital expenditures for the first nine months of fiscal 2019 increased $0.1 million to $2.3 million from the same period in fiscal 2018.
The Company sold its Woonsocket manufacturing facility for $1.5 million in fiscal 2018 which contributed to the change in cash flow from investing activities from fiscal 2018 to fiscal 2019.
The Company had a $5.5 million use of cash related to financing activities in the nine months of fiscal 2019 compared to a use of cash of $8.2 million in the first nine months of fiscal 2018.
The $2.7 million favorable change in cash flow was primarily the net result of a reduction in net payments against the Company’s revolving line of credit.
The amended guidance is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal and interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2018, or the Company’s fiscal 2020, with early adoption permitted.
The Fourth Amendment decreases the company’s revolving line of credit from $100 million to $75 million and modifies the covenant requiring the company to maintain a Leverage Ratio (as defined in the Loan Documents) of 3.50 to 1.00.
