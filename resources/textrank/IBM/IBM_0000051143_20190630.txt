Noncontrolling interest amounts of $4.9 million and $3.8 million, net of tax, for the three months ended June 30, 2019 and 2018, respectively, and $11.9 million and $11.7 million, net of tax, for the six months ended June 30, 2019 and 2018, respectively, are included as a reduction within other (income) and expense in the Consolidated Statement of Earnings.
The guidance requires lessees to recognize right-of-use (ROU) assets and lease liabilities for most leases in the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position.
The company made a policy election to not recognize ROU assets and lease liabilities for short-term leases for all asset classes.
As a lessee, at adoption, the company recognized operating and financing ROU assets of $4.8 billion and $0.2 billion, respectively, and operating and financing lease liabilities of $5.1 billion and $0.2 billion, respectively.
The amount of revenue recognized during the three and six months ended June 30, 2019 that was included within the deferred income balance at March 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018 was $3.8 billion and $5.7 billion, respectively, and primarily related to services and software.
The amount of revenue recognized during the three and six months ended June 30, 2018 that was included within the deferred income balance at March 31, 2018 and January 1, 2018 was $4.0 billion and $6.0 billion, respectively, and primarily related to services and software.
Accounts payable, other accrued expenses and short-term debt (excluding the current portion of long-term debt and including short-term finance lease liabilities) are financial liabilities with carrying values that approximate fair value.
For other long-term debt (including long-term finance lease liabilities) for which a quoted market price is not available, an expected present value technique that uses rates currently available to the company for debt with similar terms and remaining maturities is used to estimate fair value.
The carrying amount of long-term debt was $58,445 million and $35,605 million, and the estimated fair value was $62,018 million and $36,599 million at June 30, 2019 and December 31, 2018, respectively.
These arrangements require the company to hold or post collateral (cash or U.S. Treasury securities) when the derivative fair values exceed contractually established thresholds.
The aggregate fair value of all derivative instruments under these collateralized arrangements that were in a liability position at June 30, 2019 and December 31, 2018 was $325 million and $74 million, respectively, for which $8 million of collateral was posted by the company and reduced the position at June 30, 2019 and no collateral was posted at December 31, 2018.
The aggregate fair value of derivative instruments in asset positions at June 30, 2019 and December 31, 2018 was $419 million and $731 million, respectively.
At June 30, 2019 and December 31, 2018, the net exposure related to derivative assets recorded in the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position was $157 million and $395 million, respectively.
At June 30, 2019 and December 31, 2018, the net position related to derivative liabilities recorded in the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position was $320 million and $116 million, respectively.
In the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position, the company does not offset derivative assets against liabilities in master netting arrangements nor does it offset receivables or payables recognized upon payment or receipt of cash collateral against the fair values of the related derivative instruments.
The company restricts the use of cash collateral received to rehypothecation, and therefore reports it in restricted cash in the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position.
To manage these mismatches and to reduce overall interest cost, the company may use interest-rate swaps to convert specific fixed-rate debt issuances into variable-rate debt (i.e., fair value hedges) and to convert specific variable-rate debt issuances into fixed-rate debt (i.e., cash flow hedges).
At June 30, 2019 and December 31, 2018, the total notional amount of the company’s interest-rate swaps was $5.5 billion and $7.6 billion, respectively.
The company did not have any cash flow hedges relating to this program outstanding at June 30, 2019 and December 31, 2018.
In connection with cash flow hedges of forecasted interest payments related to the company's borrowings, the company recorded net losses of $201 million and net losses of $35 million (before taxes) at June 30, 2019 and December 31, 2018, respectively, in AOCI.
The company estimates that $18 million (before taxes) of the deferred net losses on derivatives in AOCI at June 30, 2019 will be reclassified to net income within the next 12 months, providing an offsetting economic impact against the underlying anticipated transactions.
At June 30, 2019 and December 31, 2018, in connection with cash flow hedges of foreign currency denominated borrowings, the company recorded net losses of $84 million and net gains of $75 million (before taxes), respectively, in AOCI.
The company estimates that $305 million (before taxes) of deferred net gains on derivatives in AOCI at June 30, 2019 will be reclassified to net income within the next 12 months, providing an offsetting economic impact against the underlying exposure.
Operating leases are included in operating right-of-use assets – net, current operating lease liabilities and operating lease liabilities in the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position.
Finance leases are included in property, plant and equipment, short-term debt and long-term debt in the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position.
At June 30, 2019, the total amount of ROU assets and lease liabilities for finance leases recognized in the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position in property, plant and equipment, short-term debt and long-term debt was $63 million, $7 million and $65 million, respectively.
For operating leases, the amortization of the ROU asset and the interest expense on the lease liability are not separately recorded; rather, the lease cost is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term as a single-line item in the Consolidated Statement of Earnings, unless the ROU asset is impaired.
The company has elected to not recognize leases with a lease term of less than 12 months in the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position, including those acquired in a business combination, and lease costs for those short-term leases are recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term in the Consolidated Statement of Earnings.
The company recorded net gains on sale and leaseback transactions of $5 million and $41 million for the three and six months ended June 30, 2019, respectively.
Prior to the adoption of the new lease guidance on January 1, 2019, ROU assets and lease liabilities for operating leases were not recognized in the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position.
The difference between the company’s total lease commitments as reported at December 31, 2018 compared to the January 1, 2019 ROU asset balance in the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position is primarily due to the required use of a discount factor (imputed interest) under the new lease guidance and certain amounts that are not included in the ROU asset under the new lease guidance (e.g., tenant incentives and vacant space).
Variable lease payments that do not depend on an index or a rate (e.g., property taxes), that are paid directly by the company and are reimbursed by the client, are recorded as revenue, along with the related cost, in the period in which collection of these payments is probable.
At the end of the lease term, the company allows the client to either return the equipment, purchase the equipment at the then-current fair market value or at a pre-stated purchase price or renew the lease based on mutually agreed upon terms.
When lease arrangements include multiple performance obligations, the company allocates the consideration in the contract between the lease components and the non-lease components on a relative standalone selling price basis.
For further information on the company’s net investment in leases, including residual values, refer to note 6, “Financing Receivables.” Any selling profit or loss arising from a sales-type lease is recorded at lease commencement.
Selling profit or loss is presented on a gross basis when the company enters into a lease to realize value from a product that it would otherwise sell in its ordinary course of business, whereas in transactions where the company enters into a lease for the purpose of generating revenue by providing financing, the selling profit or loss is presented on a net basis.
Over the term of the lease, the company recognizes finance income on the net investment in the lease and any variable lease payments, which are not included in the net investment in the lease.
For sales-type and direct financing leases, this reduction lowers the recorded net investment and is recognized as a loss charged to finance income in the period in which the estimate is changed, as well as an adjustment to unearned income to reduce future-period financing activities.
As lease payments are made, the company records sales revenue over the lease term.
Investment in sales-type and direct financing leases relates principally to the company’s Systems products and are for terms ranging generally from two to six years.
The company did not have any financing receivables held for sale as of June 30, 2019 and December 31, 2018.
Provisions for credit losses recorded for lease receivables and loan receivables were $14 million and $2 million, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2018.
The company did not have any significant troubled debt restructurings during the six months ended June 30, 2019 or for the year ended December 31, 2018 .
In an acquisition, U.S. GAAP requires the company to record all assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the acquisition date fair value.
The company received a net cash payment of $240 million at the U.S. closing and expects to receive an additional $150 million within 36 months.
The company’s extended lines of credit to third-party entities include unused amounts of $4,783 million and $7,368 million at June 30, 2019 and December 31, 2018, respectively.
In addition, the company has committed to provide future financing to its clients in connection with client purchase agreements for approximately $5,033 million and $4,432 million at June 30, 2019 and December 31, 2018, respectively.

In the second quarter of 2019, the company reported $19.2 billion in revenue, $2.5 billion in income from continuing operations and operating (non-GAAP) earnings of $2.8 billion, resulting in diluted earnings per share from continuing operations of $2.81 as reported and $3.17 on an operating (non-GAAP) basis.
Total operating (non-GAAP) expense and other (income) decreased 0.2 percent year to year, driven primarily by the same factors, excluding the non-operating retirement-related costs.

Total expense and other (income) decreased 2.8 percent in the second quarter of 2019 versus the prior year primarily due to lower non-operating retirement-related costs ($258 million) as a result of the amortization period change to the U.S. Pension Plan in the first quarter.
Operating (non-GAAP) expense decreased 2.1 percent year to year, also primarily driven by the effects of currency.
Overall interest expense (excluding capitalized interest) for the second quarter and first six months of 2019 was $512 million and $901 million, respectively, an increase of $145 million and $188 million versus the comparable prior-year periods, primarily driven by a higher average debt balance and higher average interest rates as the company issued debt for the Red Hat acquisition.
Total pre-tax retirement-related plan cost decreased by $264 million compared to the second quarter of 2018, driven by a decrease in recognized actuarial losses ($281 million), primarily due to the change in the amortization period in the U.S. Qualified Personal Pension Plan and higher expected return on plan assets ($31 million), partially offset by higher interest costs ($40 million).
Non-operating costs of $136 million in the second quarter of 2019 decreased $258 million year to year, driven primarily by lower recognized actuarial losses ($281 million) and a higher expected return on plan assets ($31 million), partially offset by higher interest costs ($40 million).

The operating (non-GAAP) tax rate for the first six months of 2019 was 10.6 percent, an increase of 10.4 points compared to the first six months of 2018.
The decrease in the continuing operations effective tax rate in the second quarter of 2019 was primarily driven by an increase in tax benefits attributable to foreign audit activity (3.7 points).
As previously stated, the company continues to expect the acquisition of Red Hat, including related activity to be accretive to free cash flow in the first year, and accretive to operating (non-GAAP) earnings per share by the end of the second year after closing.
Non-operating retirement-related plan cost is expected to be approximately $0.6 billion, a decrease of approximately $1 billion compared to 2018, primarily driven by lower actuarial loss amortization resulting from the change in amortization period for the U.S. plan.
On an income from continuing operations before income tax basis, these translation impacts mitigated by the net impact of hedging activities resulted in a theoretical maximum (assuming no pricing or sourcing actions) increase of approximately $160 million in the first six months of 2019 on an as-reported basis and an increase of approximately $140 million on an operating (non-GAAP) basis.
The company defines free cash flow as net cash from operating activities less the change in Global Financing receivables and net capital expenditures, including the investment in software.
