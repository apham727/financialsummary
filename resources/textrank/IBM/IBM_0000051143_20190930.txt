Noncontrolling interest amounts of $7.1 million and $6.2 million, net of tax, for the three months ended September 30, 2019 and 2018, respectively, and $19.0 million and $17.9 million, net of tax, for the nine months ended September 30, 2019 and 2018, respectively, are included as a reduction within other (income) and expense in the Consolidated Statement of Earnings.
The guidance requires lessees to recognize right-of-use (ROU) assets and lease liabilities for most leases in the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position.
The company made a policy election to not recognize ROU assets and lease liabilities for short-term leases for all asset classes.
As a lessee, at adoption, the company recognized operating and financing ROU assets of $4.8 billion and $0.2 billion, respectively, and operating and financing lease liabilities of $5.1 billion and $0.2 billion, respectively.
The amount of revenue recognized during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2019 that was included within the deferred income balance at June 30, 2019 and December 31, 2018 was $3.6 billion and $7.7 billion, respectively, and was primarily related to services and software.
The amount of revenue recognized during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2018 that was included within the deferred income balance at June 30, 2018 and January 1, 2018 was $3.8 billion and $8.0 billion, respectively, and was primarily related to services and software.
The following tables present the company’s financial assets and financial liabilities that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis at September 30, 2019 and December 31, 2018.
Accounts payable, other accrued expenses and short-term debt (excluding the current portion of long-term debt and including short-term finance lease liabilities) are financial liabilities with carrying values that approximate fair value.
For other long-term debt (including long-term finance lease liabilities) for which a quoted market price is not available, an expected present value technique that uses rates currently available to the company for debt with similar terms and remaining maturities is used to estimate fair value.
The carrying amount of long-term debt was $57,797 million and $35,605 million, and the estimated fair value was $62,398 million and $36,599 million at September 30, 2019 and December 31, 2018, respectively.
These arrangements require the company to hold or post collateral (cash or U.S. Treasury securities) when the derivative fair values exceed contractually established thresholds.
The aggregate fair value of all derivative instruments under these collateralized arrangements that were in a liability position at September 30, 2019 and December 31, 2018 was $737 million and $74 million, respectively, for which $116 million of collateral was posted by the company and reduced the position at September 30, 2019, and for which no collateral was posted at December 31, 2018.
The aggregate fair value of derivative instruments in asset positions at September 30, 2019 and December 31, 2018 was $536 million and $731 million, respectively.
At September 30, 2019 and December 31, 2018, the net exposure related to derivative assets recorded in the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position was $220 million and $395 million, respectively.
At September 30, 2019 and December 31, 2018, the net position related to derivative liabilities recorded in the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position was $641 million and $116 million, respectively.
In the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position, the company does not offset derivative assets against liabilities in master netting arrangements nor does it offset receivables or payables recognized upon payment or receipt of cash collateral against the fair values of the related derivative instruments.
The company restricts the use of cash collateral received to rehypothecation, and therefore reports it in restricted cash in the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position.
To manage these mismatches and to reduce overall interest cost, the company may use interest-rate swaps to convert specific fixed-rate debt issuances into variable-rate debt (i.e., fair value hedges) and to convert specific variable-rate debt issuances into fixed-rate debt (i.e., cash flow hedges).
At September 30, 2019 and December 31, 2018, the total notional amount of the company’s interest-rate swaps was $4.7 billion and $7.6 billion, respectively.
The company did not have any cash flow hedges relating to this program outstanding at September 30, 2019 and December 31, 2018.
The company estimates that $18 million (before taxes) of the deferred net losses on derivatives in AOCI at September 30, 2019 will be reclassified to net income within the next 12 months, providing an offsetting economic impact against the underlying interest payments.
At September 30, 2019 and December 31, 2018, in connection with cash flow hedges of foreign currency denominated borrowings, the company recorded net losses of $138 million and net gains of $75 million (before taxes), respectively, in AOCI.
The company estimates that $278 million (before taxes) of deferred net gains on derivatives in AOCI at September 30, 2019 will be reclassified to net income within the next 12 months, providing an offsetting economic impact against the underlying exposure.
In addition, the company uses foreign exchange forward contracts to economically hedge, on a net basis, the foreign currency exposure of a portion of the company’s nonfunctional currency assets and liabilities.
At September 30, 2019, the total amount of ROU assets and lease liabilities for finance leases recognized in the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position in property, plant and equipment, short-term debt and long-term debt was $140 million, $34 million and $121 million, respectively.
For operating leases, the amortization of the ROU asset and the interest expense on the lease liability are not separately recorded; rather, the lease cost is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term as a single-line item in the Consolidated Statement of Earnings, unless the ROU asset is impaired.
The company has elected to not recognize leases with a lease term of less than 12 months in the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position, including those acquired in a business combination, and lease costs for those short-term leases are recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term in the Consolidated Statement of Earnings.
There were no net gains recorded on sale and leaseback transactions for the three months ended September 30, 2019 and the company recorded $41 million of net gains for the nine months ended September 30, 2019.
Prior to the adoption of the new lease guidance on January 1, 2019, ROU assets and lease liabilities for operating leases were not recognized in the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position.
The difference between the company’s total lease commitments as reported at December 31, 2018 compared to the January 1, 2019 ROU asset balance in the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position is primarily due to the required use of a discount factor (imputed interest) under the new lease guidance and certain amounts that are not included in the ROU asset under the new lease guidance (e.g., tenant incentives and vacant space).
Variable lease payments that do not depend on an index or a rate (e.g., property taxes), that are paid directly by the company and are reimbursed by the client, are recorded as revenue, along with the related cost, in the period in which collection of these payments is probable.
At the end of the lease term, the company allows the client to either return the equipment, purchase the equipment at the then-current fair market value or at a pre-stated purchase price or renew the lease based on mutually agreed upon terms.
For further information on the company’s net investment in leases, including residual values, refer to note 6, “Financing Receivables.” Any selling profit or loss arising from a sales-type lease is recorded at lease commencement.
Selling profit or loss is presented on a gross basis when the company enters into a lease to realize value from a product that it would otherwise sell in its ordinary course of business, whereas in transactions where the company enters into a lease for the purpose of generating revenue by providing financing, the selling profit or loss is presented on a net basis.
Over the term of the lease, the company recognizes finance income on the net investment in the lease and any variable lease payments, which are not included in the net investment in the lease.
As lease payments are made, the company records sales revenue over the lease term.
Investment in sales-type and direct financing leases relates principally to the company’s Systems products and are for terms ranging generally from two to six years.
The company did not have any financing receivables held for sale as of September 30, 2019 and December 31, 2018.
Provision for credit losses recorded for lease receivables and loan receivables were a release of $3 million and $2 million, respectively, for the nine months ended September 30, 2019.
The company did not have any significant troubled debt restructurings during the nine months ended September 30, 2019 or for the year ended December 31, 2018.
The Consolidated Statement of Earnings includes revenue and a pre-tax loss attributable to Red Hat since the date of acquisition for both the three and nine months ended September 30, 2019 of $371 million and $981 million, respectively.
The company received a net cash payment of $240 million on June 30, 2019 and expects to receive an additional $150 million within 36 months of the U.S. closing.
The company’s extended lines of credit to third-party entities include unused amounts of $3,060 million and $7,368 million at September 30, 2019 and December 31, 2018, respectively.
In addition, the company has committed to provide future financing to its clients in connection with client purchase agreements for approximately $5,003 million and $4,432 million at September 30, 2019 and December 31, 2018, respectively.
