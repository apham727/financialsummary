The condensed consolidated unaudited financial statements contained in this report include the accounts of Watsco, all of its wholly owned subsidiaries and the accounts of three joint ventures with Carrier Corporation (Carrier), in each of which Watsco maintains a controlling interest.
The results of operations for the quarter and six months ended June 30, 2018 are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for the year ending December 31, 2018.
In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (the FASB) issued a standard on revenue recognition that provides a single, comprehensive revenue recognition model for all contracts with customers.
The adoption of this standard and its related amendments (collectively, the New Revenue Standard) on January 1, 2018 did not result in the recognition of a cumulative adjustment to opening retained earnings under the modified retrospective approach, nor did it have a significant impact on our consolidated net income, balance sheet or cash flow.
In May 2017, the FASB issued guidance to clarify when to account for a change to the terms or conditions of a share-based payment award as a modification.
Under the new guidance, modification accounting is required only if the fair value, the vesting conditions or the classification of the award (as equity or liability) changes as a result of the change in terms or conditions.
The adoption of this guidance did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.
This guidance is effective prospectively and is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2018 with early adoption permitted.
We elected to adopt this guidance during the quarter ended June 30, 2018, which did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.
In February 2016, the FASB issued guidance on accounting for leases, which requires lessees to recognize most leases on their balance sheets for the rights and obligations created by those leases.
We will apply this guidance using a modified retrospective approach, and it will be effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2018.
Based on our preliminary assessment of our lease portfolio, we expect the adoption of this guidance to have a material impact on our consolidated balance sheets due to the recognition of right-of-use assets and lease liabilities.
However, we do not expect a material impact on our consolidated statements of income.
Our current minimum lease commitments are disclosed in Note 16 to our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2017.
We do not expect the adoption of this guidance to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.
The New Revenue Standard did not have an impact on the amount and timing of our revenue recognition; however, certain payments to customers were reclassified from expense to a reduction from revenues, resulting in an immaterial impact to the individual financial statement line items of our condensed consolidated unaudited statements of income.
Results for reporting periods beginning on and after January 1, 2018 are presented under the New Revenue Standard, while prior period results have not been adjusted and continue to be reported under the accounting standards in effect for those periods.
Total service revenue is not material and accounted for less than 1% of our consolidated revenues for both the quarter and six months ended June 30, 2018.
Accrued sales incentives of $11,600 and $13,001 as of June 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017, respectively, were included in accrued expenses and other current liabilities in our condensed consolidated unaudited balance sheets.
At June 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017, $141,600 and $21,800, respectively, were outstanding under the revolving credit agreement.

At June 30, 2018, $1,510 of short-term borrowings were outstanding under a credit line established by our Mexican subsidiary.
This line of credit has a one-year term, maturing on June 12, 2019, is non-committed and provides for borrowings of up to approximately $3,800 (MXN 75,000) for general corporate purposes.
Accordingly, at June 30, 2018, all of our open foreign currency forward contracts had maturities of one year or less.
The total notional value of our foreign currency exchange contracts designated as cash flow hedges at June 30, 2018 was $31,700, and such contracts have varying terms expiring through March 2019.
At June 30, 2018, we expected an estimated $941 pre-tax gain to be reclassified into earnings to reflect the fixed prices obtained from foreign exchange hedging within the next 12 months.
We recognized gains of $180 and $173 from foreign currency forward and option contracts not designated as hedging instruments in our condensed consolidated unaudited statements of income for the quarters ended June 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively.
We recognized losses of $191 and $410 from foreign currency forward and option contracts not designated as hedging instruments in our condensed consolidated unaudited statements of income for the six months ended June 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively.

(RSI) purchased in June 2017 and our additional 10% ownership interest in Carrier Enterprise II, which we acquired on February 13, 2017.
Revenues for the second quarter of 2018 increased $56.8 million, or 5%, including $6.0 million from locations opened during the preceding 12 months, offset by $3.2 million from locations closed.
On a same-store basis, revenues increased $54.0 million, or 4%, as compared to the same period in 2017, reflecting a 6% increase in sales of HVAC equipment (68% of sales), which included a 6% increase in residential HVAC equipment and a 5% increase in commercial HVAC equipment, a 5% increase in sales of other HVAC products (28% of sales) and a 1% increase in sales of commercial refrigeration products (4% of sales).
Selling, general and administrative expenses for the second quarter of 2018 increased $5.6 million, or 3%, primarily due to increased revenues.
Selling, general and administrative expenses as a percent of revenues for the quarter ended June 30, 2018 decreased to 14.0% versus 14.2% for the same period in 2017.
Selling, general and administrative expenses included $0.7 million of additional costs for 2018 in excess of 2017 for ongoing technology initiatives.
Other income of $3.2 million for the second quarter of 2018 represents our share of the net income of RSI.
Net income attributable to Watsco for the quarter ended June 30, 2018 increased $16.2 million, or 22%, compared to the same period in 2017.
Revenues for the first half of 2018 increased $111.3 million, or 5%, including $10.6 million from locations opened during the preceding 12 months, offset by $6.5 million from locations closed.
On a same-store basis, revenues increased $107.2 million, or 5%, as compared to the same period in 2017, reflecting a 6% increase in sales of HVAC equipment (67% of sales), which included a 7% increase in residential HVAC equipment and a 5% increase in commercial HVAC equipment, a 6% increase in sales of other HVAC products (29% of sales) and flat sales of commercial refrigeration products (4% of sales).
Selling, general and administrative expenses for the first half of 2018 increased $14.3 million, or 4%, primarily due to increased revenues.
Selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenues for the six months ended June 30, 2018 decreased to 16.2% versus 16.3% for the same period in 2017.
Selling, general and administrative expenses included $1.0 million of additional costs for 2018 in excess of 2017 for ongoing technology initiatives.
Net income attributable to Watsco for the first half of 2018 increased $24.2 million, or 24%, compared to the same period in 2017.
We rely on cash flows from operations and borrowing capacity under our revolving credit agreement to fund seasonal working capital needs and for other general corporate purposes, including dividend payments (to the extent declared by our Board of Directors), capital expenditures, business acquisitions, and development of our long-term operating and technology strategies.
We believe that our operating cash flows, cash on hand, and funds available for borrowing under our revolving credit agreement are sufficient to meet our liquidity needs in the foreseeable future.
Working capital increased to $1.1 billion at June 30, 2018 from $920.9 million at December 31, 2017, reflecting higher levels of accounts receivable and inventories, primarily due to the seasonality of our business.
The increase in net cash used in operating activities was primarily due to higher accounts receivable driven by increased sales volume and from a buildup of inventory, partially offset by higher net income for the first half of 2018.
Net cash used in investing activities was lower due to the purchase of an ownership interest in RSI for $63.6 million in 2017 and a decrease in capital expenditures in 2018.
The decrease in net cash provided by financing activities was primarily attributable to an increase in dividends paid in 2018 and the purchase of an additional 10% ownership interest in Carrier Enterprise II for $42.7 million in 2017, partially offset by lower proceeds borrowed under our revolving credit agreement in the 2018 period.
We maintain an unsecured, syndicated revolving credit agreement, which we use to fund seasonal working capital needs and for other general corporate purposes, including acquisitions, dividends (if and as declared by our Board of Directors), capital expenditures, stock repurchases, and issuances of letters of credit.
Effective February 5, 2018, we decreased the borrowing capacity under this credit agreement from $600.0 million to $300.0 million.
At June 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017, $141.6 million and $21.8 million were outstanding under the revolving credit agreement, respectively.
Additionally, at June 30, 2018, $1.5 million of short-term borrowings were outstanding under a credit line established by our Mexican subsidiary.
This line of credit has a one-year term, maturing on June 12, 2019, is non-committed and provides for borrowings of up to approximately $3.8 million (MXN 75.0 million) for general corporate purposes.
On February 13, 2017, we purchased an additional 10% ownership interest in Carrier Enterprise II for cash consideration of $42.7 million, which increased our controlling interest in Carrier Enterprise II to 80%.
On June 21, 2017, Carrier Enterprise I acquired an approximately 35% ownership interest in RSI, an HVAC distributor operating from 30 locations in the Western U.S. for cash consideration of $63.6 million, of which we contributed $50.9 million, and Carrier contributed $12.7 million.
Effective June 29, 2018, Carrier Enterprise I acquired an additional 1.4% voting equity interest in RSI, which increased Carrier Enterprise Is ownership interest in RSI from approximately 35% to 36.3%.
Pursuant to the Shareholders Agreement, RSIs shareholders have the right to sell, and Carrier Enterprise I has the obligation to purchase, their respective shares of RSI for a purchase price determined based on either book value or a multiple of EBIT, the latter of which Carrier Enterprise I used to calculate the price paid for its investment in RSI.
RSIs shareholders may transfer their respective shares of RSI common stock only to members of the Sigler family or to Carrier Enterprise I, and, at any time from and after the date on which Carrier Enterprise I owns 85% or more of RSIs outstanding common stock, it has the right, but not the obligation, to purchase from RSIs shareholders the remaining outstanding shares of RSI common stock.
We believe that our operating cash flows, cash on hand, and funds available for borrowing under our revolving credit agreement will be sufficient to purchase any additional ownership interests in RSI.
We paid cash dividends of $2.70 and $2.10 per share of both Common stock and Class B common stock during the six months ended June 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively.
