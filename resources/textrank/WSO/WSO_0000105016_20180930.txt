The condensed consolidated unaudited financial statements contained in this report include the accounts of Watsco, all of its wholly owned subsidiaries and the accounts of three joint ventures with Carrier Corporation (Carrier), in each of which Watsco maintains a controlling interest.
The adoption of this standard and its related amendments (collectively, the New Revenue Standard) on January 1, 2018 did not result in the recognition of a cumulative adjustment to opening retained earnings under the modified retrospective approach, nor did it have a significant impact on our consolidated net income, balance sheet or cash flow.
In May 2017, the FASB issued guidance to clarify when to account for a change to the terms or conditions of a share-based payment award as a modification.
Under the new guidance, modification accounting is required only if the fair value, the vesting conditions or the classification of the award (as equity or liability) changes as a result of the change in terms or conditions.
We elected to adopt this guidance during the quarter ended June 30, 2018, which did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.
The guidance requires the use of a modified retrospective approach to apply the standard at the beginning of the earliest period presented in the financial statements.
In July 2018, updated guidance was issued which provides an additional transition method of adoption that allows entities to initially apply the standard at the adoption date and recognize a cumulative-effect adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings.
We will adopt the guidance on January 1, 2019 using this additional transition method and recognize a cumulative-effect adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings.
The New Revenue Standard did not have an impact on the amount or timing of our revenue recognition; however, certain payments to customers were reclassified from expenses to a reduction from revenues, resulting in an immaterial impact to the individual financial statement line items of our condensed consolidated unaudited statements of income.
Results for reporting periods beginning on and after January 1, 2018 are presented under the New Revenue Standard, while prior period results have not been adjusted and continue to be reported under the accounting standards in effect for those periods.
At September 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017, $116,400 and $21,800, respectively, were outstanding under the revolving credit agreement.
borrowings outstanding under the credit agreement are classified as current liabilities in our condensed consolidated unaudited balance sheet at September 30, 2018.
On February 13, 2017, we purchased an additional 10% ownership interest in Carrier Enterprise Northeast LLC, which we refer to as Carrier Enterprise II, for cash consideration of $42,688, which increased our controlling interest from 70% to 80%.
Carrier Enterprise II had sales of approximately $545,000 for the year ended December 31, 2017 from 40 locations in the northeastern United States and 14 locations in Mexico.
Pursuant to the Shareholders Agreement, RSIs shareholders have the right to sell, and Carrier Enterprise I has the obligation to purchase, their respective shares of RSI for a purchase price determined based on either book value or a multiple of EBIT, the latter of which Carrier Enterprise I used to calculate the price paid for its investment in RSI.
RSIs shareholders may transfer their respective shares of RSI common stock only to members of the Sigler family or to Carrier Enterprise I, and, at any time from and after the date on which Carrier Enterprise I owns 85% or more of RSIs outstanding common stock, it has the right, but not the obligation, to purchase from RSIs shareholders the remaining outstanding shares of RSI common stock.
Given Carrier Enterprise Is 36.3% ownership interest in RSI and its right to appoint two out of RSIs six board members, this investment in RSI is accounted for under the equity method.
On August 23, 2018, one of our wholly owned subsidiaries acquired Alert Labs Inc., a technology company based in Ontario, Canada for cash consideration of $5,889 and the issuance of 47,103 shares of Common stock, having a fair value of $8,180.
The total notional value of our foreign currency exchange contracts designated as cash flow hedges at September 30, 2018 was $36,800, and such contracts have varying terms expiring through June 2019.
At September 30, 2018, we expected an estimated $3 pre-tax gain to be reclassified into earnings to reflect the fixed prices obtained from foreign exchange hedging within the next 12 months.
We recognized losses of $(108), $(502), $(299) and $(912) from foreign currency forward and option contracts not designated as hedging instruments in our condensed consolidated unaudited statements of income for the quarters and nine months ended September 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively.

Revenues for the third quarter of 2018 increased $66.4 million, or 5%, including $3.4 million from locations opened and acquired during the preceding 12 months, offset by $3.8 million from locations closed.
On a same-store basis, revenues increased $66.8 million, or 5%, as compared to the same period in 2017, reflecting a 7% increase in sales of HVAC equipment (68% of sales), which included a 6% increase in residential HVAC equipment and a 9% increase in commercial HVAC equipment, a 4% increase in sales of other HVAC products (28% of sales) and flat sales of commercial refrigeration products (4% of sales).
Selling, general and administrative expenses for the third quarter of 2018 increased $16.7 million, or 9%, primarily due to increased revenues, additional sales and service-related headcount and an increase in performance-based compensation specific to certain markets.
Selling, general and administrative expenses as a percent of revenues for the quarter ended September 30, 2018 increased to 15.5% versus 14.9% for the same period in 2017.
The increase in selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenues was primarily due to our inability to leverage fixed operating costs to the same extent as in 2017.
Other income of $3.7 million and $2.3 million for the quarters ended September 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively, represents our share of the net income of RSI.
Net income attributable to Watsco for the quarter ended September 30, 2018 increased $14.1 million, or 22%, compared to the same period in 2017.
The increase was primarily driven by higher revenues, expanded profit margins, lower interest expense, net, and lower income taxes, partially offset by higher selling, general and administrative expenses as a percent of revenues, as discussed above.
Revenues for the nine months ended September 30, 2018 increased $177.7 million, or 5%, including $14.0 million from locations opened and acquired during the preceding 12 months, offset by $10.3 million from locations closed.
On a same-store basis, revenues increased $174.0 million, or 5%, as compared to the same period in 2017, reflecting a 7% increase in sales of HVAC equipment (68% of sales), which included a 7% increase in residential HVAC equipment and a 6% increase in commercial HVAC equipment, a 5% increase in sales of other HVAC products (28% of sales) and flat sales of commercial refrigeration products (4% of sales).
Selling, general and administrative expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2018 increased $31.0 million, or 6%, primarily due to increased revenues.
Selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenues for the nine months ended September 30, 2018 increased to 15.9% versus 15.8% for the same period in 2017.
The increase in selling, general and administrative expenses was primarily due to our inability to leverage fixed operating costs to the same extent as in 2017.
Other income of $8.5 million and $2.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively, represents our share of the net income of RSI.
Net income attributable to Watsco for the nine months ended September 30, 2018 increased $38.4 million, or 23%, compared to the same period in 2017.
The increase was primarily driven by higher revenues and other income, expanded profit margins, lower interest expense, net, and lower income taxes as discussed above.
We rely on cash flows from operations and borrowing capacity under our revolving credit agreement to fund seasonal working capital needs and for other general corporate purposes, including dividend payments (to the extent declared by our Board of Directors), capital expenditures, business acquisitions, and development of our long-term operating and technology strategies.
Working capital increased to $993.0 million at September 30, 2018 from $920.9 million at December 31, 2017, reflecting higher levels of accounts receivable and inventories, primarily due to the seasonality of our business.
The decrease in net cash provided by operating activities was primarily due to the timing of payments for accrued expenses and other current liabilities and higher accounts receivable driven by increased sales volume, partially offset by a lower increase in inventory and higher net income in the 2018 period.
Net cash used in investing activities was lower due to the purchase of an ownership interest in RSI for $63.6 million in 2017, partially offset by an acquisition for cash consideration of $5.9 million and the purchase of an additional ownership interest in RSI for $3.8 million in 2018.
The decrease in net cash used in financing activities was primarily attributable to proceeds borrowed under our revolving credit agreement in the 2018 period and the purchase of an additional 10% ownership interest in Carrier Enterprise II for $42.7 million in 2017, partially offset by an increase in dividends paid in 2018.
We maintain an unsecured, syndicated revolving credit agreement, which we use to fund seasonal working capital needs and for other general corporate purposes, including acquisitions, dividends (if and as declared by our Board of Directors), capital expenditures, stock repurchases, and issuances of letters of credit.
At September 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017, $116.4 million and $21.8 million were outstanding under the revolving credit agreement, respectively.
On February 13, 2017, we purchased an additional 10% ownership interest in Carrier Enterprise II for cash consideration of $42.7 million, which increased our controlling interest in Carrier Enterprise II to 80%.
On June 21, 2017, Carrier Enterprise I acquired an approximately 35% ownership interest in RSI, an HVAC distributor operating from 30 locations in the Western U.S. for cash consideration of $63.6 million, of which we contributed $50.9 million, and Carrier contributed $12.7 million.
Pursuant to the Shareholders Agreement, RSIs shareholders have the right to sell, and Carrier Enterprise I has the obligation to purchase, their respective shares of RSI for a purchase price determined based on either book value or a multiple of EBIT, the latter of which Carrier Enterprise I used to calculate the price paid for its investment in RSI.
We believe that our operating cash flows, cash on hand, and funds available for borrowing under our revolving credit agreement will be sufficient to purchase any additional ownership interests in RSI.
During the quarter and nine months ended September 30, 2017, we sold 35,000 shares of Common stock under the ATM Program for net proceeds of $5.4 million.
