As described in Note 2, we adopted Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606), followed by related amendments on September 30, 2018 under the modified retrospective transition method.
In February 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued ASU No. 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842), followed by related amendments (collectively, "the new lease standard"), which requires lessees to recognize most leases on the balance sheet for the rights and obligations created by those leases.
We intend to adopt the new lease standard for our fiscal year 2020 under the optional transition method with an effective date of September 29, 2019.
As a result, we will not adjust our comparative period financial information or make the new required lease disclosures for periods before the effective date, and we will record the impact from adoption as a cumulative-effect reduction to retained earnings as of the effective date.
As of September 30, 2018, we recorded a cumulative-effect reduction to the opening balance of our fiscal year 2019 retained earnings of $6,227, net of tax, for the net deferral of previously recognized revenue and related cost of sales, partially offset by the capitalization and deferral of pre-contract costs.
A performance obligation is a promise in a contract to transfer a distinct good or service to the customer and is the unit of account under the new revenue standard.
The timing of revenue recognition, billings and cash collections results in billed accounts receivable, unbilled accounts receivable (contract assets) and advance payments from customers (contract liabilities).
These payments are recorded in advance payments from customers and other long-term liabilities in our Consolidated Balance Sheets (current and non-current portions, respectively) and are liquidated as revenue is recognized.
Conversely, when billing occurs subsequent to revenue recognition for contracts recognized over time, balances are recorded in unbilled accounts receivable, net in our Consolidated Balance Sheets.
For sales that include installation services, warranty obligations generally extend for a period of 12 to 24 months from the date of either shipment or acceptance based on the contract terms.
These assets were initially measured and recognized at amounts equal to the fair value determined as of the date of acquisition or purchase subject to changes in value only for foreign currency translation.
Fair value measurements of reporting units are estimated using an income approach involving discounted or undiscounted cash flow models that contain certain Level 3 inputs requiring management judgment, including projections of economic conditions and customer demand, revenue and margins, changes in competition, operating costs, working capital requirements and new product introductions.
Fair value measurements of the reporting units associated with our goodwill balances and our indefinite-lived intangible assets are estimated at least annually in the fourth quarter of each fiscal year for purposes of impairment testing if a quantitative analysis is performed.
Certain financial instruments are not measured at fair value but are recorded at carrying amounts approximating fair value based on their short-term nature or variable interest rate.
2 The fair value of the tranche B term loan is based on the most recently quoted market price for the outstanding debt instrument, adjusted for any known significant deviations in value.
Gains and losses related to changes in the market value of these contracts are reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (AOCI) within shareholders' equity in the Consolidated Balance Sheets and reclassified to earnings in the same line item in the Consolidated Statements of Income and in the same period as the recognition of the underlying hedged transaction.
As of March 30, 2019 and September 29, 2018, we had outstanding cash flow hedge currency exchange contracts with gross notional U.S. dollar equivalent amounts of $26,576 and $39,856, respectively.
Upon netting offsetting contracts to sell foreign currencies against contracts to purchase foreign currencies, irrespective of contract maturity dates, the net notional U.S. dollar equivalent amount of contracts outstanding was $24,840 and $29,315 as of March 30, 2019 and September 29, 2018, respectively.
As of March 30, 2019, the net market value of the foreign currency exchange contracts was a net asset of $236, consisting of $314 in assets and $78 in liabilities.
As of September 29, 2018, the net market value of the foreign currency exchange contracts was a net asset of $816, consisting of $989 in assets and $173 in liabilities.
As a result, changes in the fair value of the interest rate swap are recorded in AOCI within shareholders' equity in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.
The gains and losses related to the changes in the market value of these derivative contracts are included in other income (expense), net in the Consolidated Statements of Income.
As of March 30, 2019 and September 29, 2018, we had outstanding foreign currency balance sheet derivative contracts with gross notional U.S. dollar equivalent amounts of $108,957 and $90,816, respectively.
Upon netting offsetting contracts by counterparty banks to sell foreign currencies against contracts to purchase foreign currencies, irrespective of contract maturity dates, the net notional U.S. dollar equivalent amount of contracts outstanding as of March 30, 2019 and September 29, 2018 was $34,789 and $28,271, respectively.
As of March 30, 2019 and September 29, 2018, the net market value of the foreign exchange balance sheet derivative contracts was a net asset of $97 and $91, respectively.
During the six months ended March 30, 2019, we incurred debt financing costs of $541 as a result of this amendment which were capitalized in current maturities of long-term debt, net and long-term debt, less current maturities, net in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.
As of March 30, 2019, there was $80,391 of outstanding borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility which is included in long-term debt, less current maturities, net in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.
The Credit Agreement governing the Term Facility requires us to prepay outstanding term loans, subject to certain exceptions, depending on the leverage ratio with (a) up to 50% of the our annual Excess Cash Flow (as defined in the Credit Agreement) and (b) 100% of the net cash proceeds of (i) certain asset sales and casualty and condemnation events, subject to reinvestment rights and certain other exceptions; and (ii) any incurrence or issuance of certain debt, other than debt permitted under the Credit Agreement.
The fair value of the restricted stock units and performance restricted stock units granted during the six months ended March 30, 2019 and March 31, 2018 was $46.45 and $48.61, respectively, representing the market value of our shares as of the date of grant less the present value of estimated foregone dividends over the vesting period.
The weighted average expected long-term rate of return on plan assets used to determine the net periodic benefit cost for each of the three and six months ended March 30, 2019 and March 31, 2018 was 5.5%.
During the third quarter of fiscal year 2016, we issued 1,150 TEUs in a registered public offering primarily to finance the acquisition of PCB, to repay amounts outstanding under our existing revolving credit facility and to pay related costs, fees and expenses.
The fair value of the prepaid stock purchase contracts, net of underwriting discounts, commissions and other expenses, was recorded in additional paid-in capital in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.
The fair value of the senior amortizing note, net of underwriting discounts, commissions and other expenses, was split between current maturities of long-term debt, net and long-term debt, less current maturities, net in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.
If converted prior to the automatic settlement date at the option of the holder, the minimum of 1.9841 shares of our common stock are delivered to the holder of each prepaid stock purchase contract.
On the automatic settlement date, a minimum of 1.9841 shares and a maximum of 2.3810 shares of our common stock, subject to adjustment based upon the applicable market value discussed below, will be delivered to the holder of each prepaid stock purchase contract at the settlement date.
The "applicable market value" is defined as the average of the daily volume-weighted average price of the common stock on each of the 20 consecutive trading days beginning on, and including, the 23rd scheduled trading day immediately preceding July 1, 2019.
During the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2017, certain holders of our TEUs elected to early convert the equity component on 473 of our outstanding TEUs at the minimum conversion rate of 1.9841 which resulted in the issuance of 939 shares of our common stock.
The value of the Capped Calls is settled with shares of our common stock, based on the approximate market value of our common stock at such time, and could be settled as the TEUs were early converted or settled upon expiration on July 1, 2019 (Capped Call Expiration).
During the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2017, we settled approximately 10% of the Capped Calls, which resulted in us receiving and retiring 12 shares of our common stock.
The Capped Calls will be automatically settled upon Capped Call Expiration with shares of our common stock based on the average market value of our common stock as defined in the Capped Call Agreements.
As of March 30, 2019, the range of shares of our common stock to be received for the outstanding Capped Calls was a minimum of 0 shares to a maximum of 268 shares, which will be realized if the average market value of our common stock as defined in the Capped Call Agreements is at or below $50.40 or at $57.97, respectively, upon Capped Call Expiration.
Using the treasury stock method, diluted earnings per share includes the potentially dilutive effect of common shares issued in connection with outstanding stock-based compensation options and grants.
The potentially dilutive effect of common shares issued in connection with outstanding stock options is determined based on the average market price for the period.
For diluted earnings per share, the TEUs are assumed to be settled at a conversion factor based on our daily volume-weighted average price per share of our common stock for the 20 consecutive trading days preceding the end of the current fiscal quarter not to exceed 2.3810 shares of common stock per TEU.
Under the treasury stock method, shares associated with certain stock options have been excluded from the diluted weighted average shares outstanding calculation because the exercise of those options would lead to a net reduction in common shares outstanding or anti-dilution.
As a result, stock options to acquire 865 and 482 weighted common shares have been excluded from the diluted weighted average common shares outstanding calculation for the three months ended March 30, 2019 and March 31, 2018, respectively.
Stock options to acquire 791 and 489 weighted common shares have been excluded from the diluted weighted average common shares outstanding calculation for the six months ended March 30, 2019 and March 31, 2018, respectively.
reportable segments are the same as those described in Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements found in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended September 29, 2018 and in Note 3 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.
The allocation of purchase price consideration is considered preliminary as of March 30, 2019 with provisional amounts primarily related to inventory, intangible assets, advanced payments to customers and certain tax related items included as our allocation process has not been finalized.

See Note 18 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 1 of Part I of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for further discussion of the acquisition of E2M.
See Note 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 1 of Part I of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for further discussion of the amendment to the Credit Agreement.
See Note 2 and Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 1 of Part I of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the impact of this adoption on our Consolidated Income Statements and Consolidated Balance Sheets.
The following tables compare results of operations, separately identifying the estimated impact of currency translation, the acquisition of E2M in the first quarter of fiscal year 2019 and restructuring costs incurred in the first quarter of fiscal year 2019.
See Notes 3, 17 and 18 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 1 of Part I of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for additional information on the new revenue standard, restructuring and related costs, and the E2M acquisition, respectively.
Selling and marketing expense for the three and six months ended March 30, 2019 increased 9.1% and 4.6%, respectively, primarily due to increased compensation and commissions expense to support sales growth and the addition of E2M expenses, partially offset by the favorable impact of currency translation.
Excluding the impact of currency translation and E2M expenses, selling and marketing expense increased 10.6% and 5.5%, respectively.
Interest expense, net for the three and six months ended March 30, 2019 increased primarily due to an increase in interest expense on the revolving credit facility, which was partially offset by a reduction in interest expense related to lower balances on the tranche B term loan, as well as current year gains on interest rate swaps.
The increase in other income (expense), net for the six months ended March 30, 2019 was primarily driven by a relative decrease in losses on foreign currency transactions.
The effective tax rate for the six months ended March 30, 2019 increased primarily due to certain discrete benefits of $25,378 in the prior year for the estimated impact of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the Tax Act).
The current year also includes a certain discrete tax benefit of $1,293 related to the Tax Act. Excluding the impact of these discrete benefits, the effective tax rate for the six months ended March 30, 2019 and March 31, 2018 would have been 17.3% and 17.5%, respectively.
Net income and diluted earnings per share for the three months ended March 30, 2019 increased primarily due to higher income from operations.
See Notes 3, 17 and 18 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 1 of Part I of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for additional information on the new revenue standard, restructuring and related costs, and the E2M acquisition, respectively.
Revenue for the three and six months ended March 30, 2019 increased 37.0% and 21.1%, respectively, primarily driven by growth in equipment volume across all sectors from conversion of robust beginning-of-year backlog and strong current-year order volume and the acquisition of E2M in the first quarter of fiscal year 2019.
Excluding the impact of currency translation and the E2M acquisition, revenue increased 30.8% and 17.2%, respectively.
Selling and marketing expense for the three and six months ended March 30, 2019 increased 16.0% and 6.4%, respectively, primarily due higher commissions and compensation expense, as well as the addition of E2M expenses, partially offset by the favorable impact of currency translation.
Excluding the impact of currency translation and E2M expenses, selling and marketing expense increased 16.5% and 6.6%, respectively.
Income from operations for the three and six months ended March 30, 2019 increased 284.9% and 124.8%, respectively, primarily due to increased gross profit on higher revenue volume and operational productivity, partially offset by higher compensation expense.
Excluding the impact of currency translation, the E2M acquisition, and restructuring costs incurred in both fiscal years, income from operations increased 242.1% and 116.9%, respectively.
Revenue for the three and six months ended March 30, 2019 increased 1.0% and 1.8%, respectively, primarily driven by continued growth in the Sensors position sector from continued strength in industrial and mobile hydraulics markets and growth in the Sensors test sector from a multi-year contract with the U.S. Department of Defense, partially offset by the unfavorable impact of currency translation.
Selling and marketing expense for the three and six months ended March 30, 2019 increased 1.7% and 2.5%, respectively, primarily driven by increased compensation from headcount additions to support sales growth, partially offset by the favorable impact of currency translation.
Income from operations for the three and six months ended March 30, 2019 declined 13.7% and 8.6%, respectively, primarily due to increased compensation expense and the unfavorable impact of currency translation.
The decrease in cash provided by operating activities was primarily due to an increase in cash used by working capital associated with timing fluctuations from accounts receivable payments received and unbilled accounts receivable accruals, accounts payable payments, inventory purchases, and advanced payments received from customers, as well as a decrease in net income due to the remeasurement of our estimated deferred tax liabilities as a result of the Tax Act in fiscal year 2018.
Shareholders' equity increased by $7,122 during the six months ended March 30, 2019 primarily due to $24,661 net income and $5,219 stock-based compensation.
