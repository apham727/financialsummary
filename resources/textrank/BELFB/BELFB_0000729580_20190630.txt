The Company’s significant accounting policies are summarized in Note 1 of the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018.
There were no significant changes to these accounting policies during the six months ended June 30, 2019, except as discussed in “Recently Adopted Accounting Standards” below.
In connection with the adoption, we elected to utilize the Comparatives Under 840 Option whereby the Company will continue to present prior period financial statements and disclosures under ASC 840.
Further, we elected a short-term lease exception policy, permitting us to not apply the recognition requirements of this standard to short-term leases (i.e. leases with terms of 12 months or less) and an accounting policy to account for lease and non-lease components as a single component for certain classes of assets.
We implemented a new lease system to facilitate the requirements of the new standard and completed the necessary changes to our accounting policies, processes, disclosures and internal control over financial reporting.
Adoption of the new standard resulted in the recording of right-of-use assets in the amount of $20.7 million and lease liabilities related to our operating leases in the amount of $21.0 million on our consolidated balance sheet as of January 1, 2019.
The aggregate amount of transaction price allocated to remaining performance obligations that have not been satisfied as of June 30, 2019 related to contracts that exceed one year in duration amounted to $14.3 million, with expected contract expiration dates that range from 2020 - 2025.
As of June 30, 2019 and December 31, 2018, our available-for-sale securities primarily consisted of investments held in a rabbi trust which are intended to fund the Company’s Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan (“SERP”) obligations.
These securities are measured at fair value using quoted prices in active markets for identical assets (Level 1) inputs and amounted to $1.3 million at June 30, 2019 and $1.4 million at December 31, 2018.
The Company does not have any financial assets measured at fair value on a recurring basis categorized as Level 3, and there were no transfers in or out of Level 1, Level 2 or Level 3 during the six months ended June 30, 2019 or June 30, 2018.
There were no changes to the Company’s valuation techniques used to measure asset fair values on a recurring or nonrecurring basis during the six months ended June 30, 2019 or June 30, 2018.
There were no financial assets accounted for at fair value on a nonrecurring basis as of June 30, 2019 or December 31, 2018.
The Company has other financial instruments, such as cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, restricted cash, accounts payable and accrued expenses, which are not measured at fair value on a recurring basis but are recorded at amounts that approximate fair value due to their liquid or short-term nature.
The fair value of the Company’s long-term debt is estimated using a discounted cash flow method based on interest rates that are currently available for debt issuances with similar terms and maturities.
At June 30, 2019 and December 31, 2018, the estimated fair value of total debt was $118.5 million and $117.9 million, respectively, compared to a carrying amount of $113.0 million and $114.2 million, respectively.
The Company did not have any other financial liabilities within the scope of the fair value disclosure requirements as of June 30, 2019.
There were no triggering events that occurred during the six months ended June 30, 2019 that would warrant interim impairment testing.
In connection with this transition, the Company had classified $1.5 million of property, plant and equipment as held for sale on its condensed consolidated balance sheet at March 31, 2019.
The resulting gain on sale of $4.3 million (pre-tax) was recorded in the accompanying condensed consolidated statements of operations for the three and six months ended June 30, 2019.
The change in warranty accrual during the six months ended June 30, 2019 primarily related to repair costs incurred and adjustments to pre-existing warranties.
There were no new material warranty charges incurred during the six months ended June 30, 2019.
The CSA consists of (i) a term loan, with outstanding borrowings of $114.5 million and $116.0 million at June 30, 2019 and December 31, 2018, respectively and (ii) a $75 million revolving credit facility (“Revolver”), with no outstanding borrowings at June 30, 2019 or December 31, 2018.
At June 30, 2019 and December 31, 2018, the carrying value of the debt on the condensed consolidated balance sheet is reflected net of $1.5 million and $1.8 million, respectively, of deferred financing costs.
During the six months ended June 30, 2019, the Company borrowed $12.0 million from its revolver, all of which was repaid by June 30, 2019.
The weighted-average interest rate in effect was 4.19% at June 30, 2019 and 4.31% at December 31, 2018 and consisted of LIBOR plus the Company’s credit spread, as determined per the terms of the CSA.
The Company incurred $1.4 million and $1.3 million of interest expense during the three months ended June 30, 2019 and June 30, 2018, respectively, and $2.8 million and $2.5 million of interest expense during the six months ended June 30, 2019 and June 30, 2018, respectively.
The CSA contains customary representations and warranties, covenants and events of default and financial covenants that measure (i) the ratio of the Company's total funded indebtedness, on a consolidated basis, to the amount of the Company’s consolidated EBITDA, as defined, (“Leverage Ratio”) and (ii) the ratio of the amount of the Company’s consolidated EBITDA to the Company’s consolidated fixed charges.
At June 30, 2019, the Company was in compliance with its debt covenants, including its most restrictive covenant, the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio.
As a result of the expiration of the statutes of limitations for specific jurisdictions, it is reasonably possible that the related unrecognized benefits for tax positions taken regarding previously filed tax returns may change materially from those recorded as liabilities for uncertain tax positions in the Company’s consolidated financial statements at June 30, 2019.
The Company’s liabilities for uncertain tax positions totaled $28.5 million and $28.9 million at June 30, 2019 and December 31, 2018, respectively, of which $0.1 million and $1.4 million is included in other current liabilities at June 30, 2019 and December 31, 2018, respectively.
These amounts, if recognized, would reduce the Company’s effective tax rate.
As of June 30, 2019, approximately $0.1 million of the Company’s liabilities for uncertain tax positions are expected to be resolved during 2019 by way of expiration of the related statute of limitations.
The Company’s policy is to recognize interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions as a component of the current provision for income taxes.
During the six months ended June 30, 2019 and 2018, the Company recognized $0.3 million and $0.5 million, respectively, in interest and penalties in the condensed consolidated statements of operations.
During the six months ended June 30, 2019 and 2018, the Company recognized a benefit of $0.7 million and a benefit of $0.4 million, respectively, for the reversal of such interest and penalties, relating to the settlement of the liability for uncertain tax positions.
The Company has approximately $4.5 million and $3.8 million accrued for the payment of interest and penalties at June 30, 2019 and December 31, 2018, respectively, which is included in both income taxes payable and liability for uncertain tax positions in the condensed consolidated balance sheets.
At December 31, 2018, the remaining balance of the deemed repatriation tax was included in other current liabilities on the Company’s condensed consolidated balance sheet.
At June 30, 2019, the majority of the deemed repatriation tax is included in other long-term liabilities on the Company's condensed consolidated balance sheet due to clarification of an Internal Revenue Service notice received in December 2018.
The Company maintains the Bel Fuse Inc. Employees’ Savings Plan, a defined contribution plan that is intended to meet the applicable requirements for tax-qualification under sections 401(a) and (k) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”).
The expense for the three months ended June 30, 2019 and 2018 amounted to $0.3 million in both periods.
The expense for the six months ended June 30, 2019 and 2018 amounted to $0.6 million in both periods.
The Company has operating leases for its facilities used for manufacturing, research and development, sales and administration.
These options to extend or terminate a lease are included in the lease term only when it is reasonably likely that the Company will elect that option.
As of June 30, 2019, the Company did not have any additional operating or financing leases that have not yet commenced.
The estimated liability related to this matter is approximately $12.0 million and has been included as a liability for uncertain tax positions on the accompanying condensed consolidated balance sheets.
As Bel is fully indemnified in this matter per the terms of the stock purchase agreement with ABB, a corresponding other asset for indemnification is also included in other assets on the accompanying condensed consolidated balance sheets at June 30, 2019 and December 31, 2018.

As a result, the Company’s material costs as a percentage of sales increased to 43.8% during the first half of 2019 from 41.4% during the first half of 2018.
·   Labor Costs – Labor costs decreased from 11.4% of sales during the first half of 2018 to 11.0% of sales during the first half of 2019, as a more favorable exchange rate environment in 2019 related to the Chinese Renminbi offset the overall impact of minimum wage increases in Mexico which went into effect on January 1, 2019 as well as minimum wage increases in the PRC which went into effect in the first and third quarters of 2018.
·   Impact of Foreign Currency – During the first six months of 2019, the Company experienced lower labor and overhead costs of $3.2 million related to favorable fluctuations in exchange rates versus 2018, partially offset by foreign exchange transactional losses realized of $0.1 million.
Due to the changes in the value of foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar, translating our financial results and the revaluation of certain intercompany as well as third-party transactions to and from foreign currencies to U.S. dollars may result in a favorable or unfavorable impact to our consolidated statements of operations and cash flows.
The Company was favorably impacted by transactional foreign exchange gains in the first half of 2019 due to the depreciation of the Euro, Pound, and Renminbi against the U.S. dollar as compared to exchange rates in effect during 2018.
As a result, the U.S. Dollar equivalent costs of these operations were $3.2 million lower in the first half of 2019 as compared to the same period of 2018.
The Company monitors changes in foreign currencies and may implement pricing actions to help mitigate the impact that changes in foreign currencies may have on its consolidated operating results.
The Company experienced margin pressure during the second quarter of 2019 due to lower sales volumes and high material costs from 2018 which continue to run through the Company’s statement of operations.
Sales declines in our North America segment during the second quarter of 2019 reflected lower sales into our distribution channel as our distribution partners continue to work down their level of inventory on hand.
Sales of our connector products into military applications were also lower during the second quarter of 2019 compared to the same period of 2018, impacting our North America and European segment sales.
Sales in our Asia segment in the second quarter of 2019 were down versus 2018 as a result of customers working down heighted inventory levels which had been built up during 2018 in response to new product launches and the tariffs that went into effect in 2018 and 2019.
Net sales and income from operations by operating segment for the three and six months ended June 30, 2019 and 2018 were as follows.
Income from operations declined across all segments during the second quarter of 2019 as compared with the same quarter of 2018 primary due to lower sales volume.
Our Asia segment was also impacted by $0.4 million of restructuring charges during the second quarter of 2019.
During the first half of 2019, income from operations for our North America segment was unfavorably impacted by $0.9 million of restructuring costs associated with the transition of manufacturing and warehouse operations from our Inwood, New York facility to other existing Bel facilities, and higher labor costs in Mexico due to an increase in minimum wage rates which went into effect on January 1, 2019.
Sales of our connectivity solutions products during the second quarter of 2019 declined $6.4 million primarily due to lower demand from military customers during the quarter, and reduced volume of product flowing through our distribution channels as our distribution partners continue to work down inventory levels that had been built up in 2018 ahead of the tariffs.
These factors also impacted the six-month period ended June 30, 2019, which declined $4.9 million from the same period of 2018, partially offset by higher sales to aerospace customers during the first quarter of 2019.
Sales of our magnetic products during the second quarter and first half of 2019 were down $4.7 million from the same periods of 2018 while inventory levels built up in advance of a new program launch during 2018 are worked through.
Labor costs as a percentage of sales also declined during the second quarter and first six months of 2019 compared to the same periods of 2018 as a more favorable exchange rate environment related to the Chinese Renminbi offset the overall impact of minimum wage increases in the PRC and Mexico.
Furthermore, the minimum wage rates in Mexico increased effective January 1, 2019 which also drove labor costs higher in the second quarter and first half of 2019.
In total, these other expenses decreased during the three and six months ended June 30, 2019 by $0.2 million and $0.5 million, respectively, as compared to the same periods of 2018, primarily due to lower depreciation and amortization expense in the 2019 periods.
Of the geographic segments in which the Company operates, the U.S. and Europe’s tax rates are generally equivalent; and Asia has the lowest tax rates of the Company’s three geographical segments.
The provision for income taxes for the three months ended June 30, 2019 and 2018 was $0.4 million and $2.4 million, respectively.
The Company’s earnings before income taxes for the three months ended June 30, 2019, were approximately $5.6 million lower than the same period in 2018, primarily attributable to lower earnings in the Asia and Europe segments.
The Company’s effective tax rate was 12.4% and 26.6% for the three months ended June 30, 2019 and 2018, respectively.
The change in the effective tax rate during the three months ended June 30, 2019 as compared to the same period in 2018, is primarily attributable to a decrease in U.S. taxes relating to income from foreign subsidiaries taxed in the U.S. as part of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. See Note 9, “Income Taxes.” 
The provision for income taxes for the six months ended June 30, 2019 and 2018 was $0.5 million and $2.7 million, respectively.
The Company’s earnings before income taxes for the six months ended June 30, 2019 were approximately $3.5 million lower than the same period in 2018, primarily attributable to lower earnings in the Asia and Europe segment.
The Company’s effective tax rate was 10.1% and 33.8% for the six-month periods ended June 30, 2019 and 2018, respectively.
The change in the effective tax rate during the six months ended June 30, 2019 as compared to the same period of 2018, is primarily attributable to a decrease in U.S. taxes relating to income from foreign subsidiaries taxed in the U.S. as part of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act and the impact of permanent differences on U.S. tax exempt activities.
At June 30, 2019 and December 31, 2018, $37.6 million and $46.3 million, respectively (or 64% and 86%, respectively), of cash and cash equivalents was held by foreign subsidiaries of the Company.
During the first half of 2019, the Company repatriated $10.0 million of funds from outside of the U.S., with minimal incremental tax liability, and completed an intercompany loan from one of the Company’s foreign subsidiaries to its U.S. parent entity during the second quarter.
See “Cautionary Notice Regarding Forward-Looking Information." We continue to analyze our global working capital and cash requirements and the potential tax liabilities attributable to further repatriation, and we have yet to make any further determination regarding repatriation of funds from outside the U.S. to fund the Company’s U.S. operations in the future.
In the event these funds were needed for Bel’s U.S. operations, the Company would be required to accrue and pay U.S. state taxes and any applicable foreign withholding taxes to repatriate these funds.
Cash and cash equivalents, marketable securities and accounts receivable comprised approximately 31.7% of the Company’s total assets at June 30, 2019 and 32.9% of total assets at December 31, 2018.
The unused credit available under the credit facility at June 30, 2019 was $75.0 million, of which we had the ability to borrow $37.1 million without violating our Leverage Ratio covenant based on the Company’s existing consolidated EBITDA.
During the six months ended June 30, 2019, accounts receivable decreased by $7.7 million primarily due to lower sales during the second quarter of 2019 as compared to the fourth quarter of 2018.
Inventory decreased by $1.8 million at June 30, 2019 compared to December 31, 2018.
During the six months ended June 30, 2018, accounts receivable increased by $10.5 million primarily due to higher sales volume in the second quarter of 2018 as compared to the fourth quarter of 2017.
Excluding the adoption adjustment related to this accounting change, inventory increased by $10.6 million at June 30, 2018 compared to December 31, 2017, primarily in raw materials.
Inventory turns increased from 3.6 at December 31, 2017 to 4.2 at June 30, 2018, primarily due to the change in revenue recognition accounting noted above.
