The Company's significant accounting policies are summarized in Note 1 of the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2017.
There were no significant changes to these accounting policies during the three months ended March 31, 2018, except as discussed in Note 2, Revenue, related to the adoption of the new revenue standards.
In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606) ("ASU 2014-09"), which amends the existing accounting standards for revenue recognition.
ASU 2014-09 is based on principles that govern the recognition of revenue at an amount an entity expects to be entitled when products are transferred to customers.
We adopted the guidance under the new revenue standards effective January 1, 2018 using the modified retrospective approach by recognizing the cumulative effect of initially applying the new standard as an increase to the opening balance of retained earnings.
In connection with the modified retrospective application of the new revenue standards, we recorded an adjustment to increase retained earnings of $3.4 million upon the January 1, 2018 adoption date.
Apart from this adjustment and the inclusion of additional required disclosures in Note 2, the adoption of the new revenue standards did not have a material impact on the Company's condensed consolidated financial statements.
On January 1, 2018, the Company adopted ASC 606 using the modified retrospective method applied to those contracts which were not completed as of January 1, 2018.
The adoption of ASC 606 represents a change in accounting principle that will more closely align revenue recognition with the transfer of control of the Company's goods and services and provides financial statement readers with enhanced disclosures related to the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from contracts with customers.
The amount of revenue recognized reflects the consideration to which the Company expects to be entitled to receive in exchange for these goods and services.
Taxes assessed by a governmental authority that are both imposed on and concurrent with a specific revenue-producing transaction, that are collected by the Company from a customer, are excluded from revenue.
Warranties vary by product line and are competitive for the markets in which the Company operates.
Warranties generally extend for one to three years from the date of sale, providing customers with assurance that the related product will function as intended.
The Company reviews its warranty liability quarterly based on an analysis of actual expenses and failure rates accompanied with estimated future costs and projected failure rate trends.
We estimate product returns, including product exchanges under warranty, based on historical experience.
In general, the Company is not contractually obligated to accept returns except for defective product or in instances where the product does not meet the Company's product specifications.
However, the Company may permit its customers to return product for other reasons.
In certain instances, the Company would generally require a significant cancellation penalty payment by the customer.
The Company estimates such returns, where applicable, based upon management's evaluation of historical experience, market acceptance of products produced and known negotiations with customers.
Payment for products sold under direct contracts with customers or contracts with distributors is typically due in full within 30-90 days from the transfer of title to customer.
Since the customer agrees to a stated price for each product on each purchase order, the majority of contracts are not subject to variable consideration, except as discussed above related to product returns.
However, the "ship and debit" arrangements with distributors, royalty income associated with our licensing agreements, and the product returns described above are each deemed to be variable consideration which requires the Company to make constrained estimates based on historical data.
A contract asset results when goods or services have been transferred to the customer but payment is contingent upon a future event, other than passage of time.
In the case of our consignment arrangements, we are unable to invoice the customer until product is pulled from the hub by the customer, which generates an unbilled receivable (a contract asset) when revenue is initially recognized.
We have certain customers who provide payment in advance of product being shipped, which results in deferred revenue (a contract liability).
The change in balance of our unbilled receivables from January 1, 2018 to March 31, 2018 primarily relates to a timing difference between the Company's performance (i.e. when our product is shipped to a customer-controlled hub) and the point at which the Company can invoice the customer per the terms of the customer contract (i.e. when the customer pulls our product from the customer-controlled hub).
Of the $0.9 million of deferred revenue at January 1, 2018, $0.5 million was recognized as revenue during the three months ended March 31, 2018.
The aggregate amount of transaction price allocated to remaining performance obligations that have not been satisfied as of March 31, 2018 related to contracts that exceed one year in duration amounted to $17.4 million, with expected contract expiration dates that range from 2019 - 2024.
The majority of the Company's total backlog of orders at March 31, 2018 is related to contracts that have an original expected duration of one year or less, for which the Company is electing to utilize the practical expedient available within the guidance, and are excluded from the transaction price related to these future obligations.
The Company will generally satisfy the remaining performance obligations as we transfer control of the products ordered to our customers.
As of March 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017, the Company held certain financial assets that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis.
The securities that are held in the rabbi trust are categorized as available-for-sale securities and are included as other assets in the accompanying condensed consolidated balance sheets at March 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017.
As of March 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017, our available-for-sale securities, which primarily consist of investments held in a rabbi trust of $1.5 million at each date, are measured at fair value using quoted prices in active markets for identical assets (Level 1) inputs.
The Company does not have any financial assets measured at fair value on a recurring basis categorized as Level 3, and there were no transfers in or out of Level 1, Level 2 or Level 3 during the three months ended March 31, 2018 or March 31, 2017.
There were no changes to the Company's valuation techniques used to measure asset fair values on a recurring or nonrecurring basis during the three months ended March 31, 2018.
There were no financial assets accounted for at fair value on a nonrecurring basis as of March 31, 2018 or December 31, 2017.
The weighted-average interest rate in effect was 3.69% at March 31, 2018 and 3.38% at December 31, 2017 and consisted of LIBOR plus the Company's credit spread, as determined per the terms of the CSA.
The Company incurred $1.2 million and $1.4 million of interest expense during the three months ended March 31, 2018 and March 31, 2017, respectively.
At March 31, 2018, the Company was in compliance with its debt covenants, including its most restrictive covenant, the Leverage Ratio.
As a result of the expiration of the statutes of limitations for specific jurisdictions, it is reasonably possible that the related unrecognized benefits for tax positions taken regarding previously filed tax returns may change materially from those recorded as liabilities for uncertain tax positions in the Company's consolidated financial statements at March 31, 2018.
The Company's liabilities for uncertain tax positions totaled $31.3 million and $30.4 million at March 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017, respectively, of which $2.5 million is included in other current liabilities at each date.
These amounts, if recognized, would reduce the Company's effective tax rate.
As of March 31, 2018, approximately $2.5 million of the Company's liabilities for uncertain tax positions are expected to be resolved during 2018 by way of expiration of the related statute of limitations.
The Company's policy is to recognize interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions as a component of the current provision for income taxes.
During the three months ended March 31, 2018 and 2017, the Company recognized $0.2 million and $0.3 million, respectively, in interest and penalties in the consolidated statements of operations.
During the three months ended March 31, 2018 and 2017, the Company recognized zero and a benefit of less than $0.1 million, respectively, for the reversal of such interest and penalties, relating to the expiration of statues of limitations and settlement of the acquired liability for uncertain tax positions, respectively.
The Company has approximately $3.4 million and $3.2 million accrued for the payment of interest and penalties at March 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017, respectively, which is included in both income taxes payable and liability for uncertain tax positions in the consolidated balance sheets.
The Company maintains the Bel Fuse Inc. Employees' Savings Plan, a defined contribution plan that is intended to meet the applicable requirements for tax-qualification under sections 401(a) and (k) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code").
The expense for the three months ended March 31, 2018 and 2017 amounted to $0.3 million in both periods.
The expense for the three months ended March 31, 2018 and 2017 amounted to approximately $0.1 million in both periods.
In connection with the acquisition of Power Solutions, there is an ongoing claim by the Arezzo Revenue Agency in Italy concerning certain tax matters related to what was then Power-One Asia Pacific Electronics Shenzhen Co. Ltd.
The estimated liability related to this matter is approximately $12.0 million and has been included as a liability for uncertain tax positions on the accompanying condensed consolidated balance sheets.
As Bel is fully indemnified in this matter per the terms of the stock purchase agreement with ABB, a corresponding other asset for indemnification is also included in other assets on the accompanying consolidated balance sheets at March 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017.

·   Revenues – The Company's revenues increased by $4.6 million (or 4.0%) in the first quarter of 2018 as compared to the same period of 2017, despite a $1.6 million decline in sales related to the NPS divestiture.
The majority of the sales growth in the first quarter related to strong demand for our Magnetic Solutions products, particularly our integrated connector modules within industrial, Ethernet and server markets.
Sales of our Connectivity Solutions products were also higher in the first quarter of 2018 with an increase in demand related to various military programs and within the industrial market for oil and gas, test and measurement, and broadcasting applications.
·   Backlog – Our backlog reached $178.3 million at March 31, 2018, representing an increase of $31.8 million, or 22%, from December 31, 2017.
As a result, the Company's material costs as a percentage of sales increased to 40.8% during the first quarter of 2018 from 40.1% during the first quarter of 2017.
·   Labor Costs – Labor costs during the first quarter of 2018 increased from 10.2% of sales during the first quarter of 2017 to 11.3% of sales during the first quarter of 2018, primarily due to the appreciation of the Renminbi and Peso against the U.S. Dollar, minimum wage increases in the PRC, and growth in sales of our labor-intensive integrated connector module (ICM) products.
·   Impact of Foreign Currency – During the first quarter of 2018, the Company incurred foreign exchange translation losses of $1.0 million and an estimated $1.8 million of transactional foreign exchange losses.
The Company was unfavorably impacted by transactional foreign exchange losses during the first quarter of 2018 due to the appreciation of the Euro, Pound, Renminbi and Peso against the U.S. dollar as compared to exchange rates in effect during the first quarter of 2017.
As a result, the U.S. Dollar equivalent costs of these operations were higher in the first quarter of 2018.
Net sales and income from operations by operating segment for the three months ended March 31, 2018 and 2017 were as follows.
The decline in income from operations within our North America segment was largely due to higher material costs in the first quarter of 2018 on purchased components, which had been experiencing supply shortages, as well as an increase in the price of certain commodities, such as copper.
Our North America profit was also impacted by higher labor costs in Mexico, due to the appreciation of the Peso during the first quarter of 2018 compared to the same period last year.
The reduction in income from operations at our Asia segment was primarily due to higher labor costs driven by an increase in minimum wage rates at one of our factories in the PRC and the unfavorable appreciation of the Renminbi during the first quarter of 2018 compared to the same period of 2017.
The increase in income from operations from our Europe segment are consistent with the increase in sales for that segment.
Our connectivity solutions products showed an overall improvement in sales of $1.2 million during the first quarter of 2018 compared to the same period of 2017.
Sales within our Cinch businesses were strong in 2018, up $0.7 million from the first quarter of 2017, led by increased activity within key military-aerospace programs and higher sales through our distribution channels.
Labor costs as a percentage of sales also increased during the first quarter of 2018 compared to the same period of 2017 due to several factors.
The appreciation of the Renminbi and the Peso against the U.S. Dollar drove labor costs as a percentage of sales higher in 2018, as the majority of our sales related to product manufactured in the PRC and Mexico are invoiced in U.S. Dollars, while our manufacturing staff in those locations are paid in local currency.
Effective February 1, 2018, the PRC issued an increase to the minimum wage in a region where one of Bel's factories is located, and this contributed to the higher labor costs in the 2018 period.
Lastly, there was a 9.7% increase in sales of our ICM products in the first quarter of 2018 compared to the first quarter of 2017.
Of the geographic segments in which the Company operates, the U.S. and Europe's tax rates are generally equivalent; and Asia has the lowest tax rates of the Company's three geographical segments.
The provision (benefit) for income taxes for the three months ended March 31, 2018 and 2017 was $0.3 million and less than $0.1 million, respectively.
The Company's earnings (loss) before income taxes for the three months ended March 31, 2018, were approximately $1.7 lower than the same period in 2017, primarily attributable to significant losses in the Asia and North America segments.
The Company's effective tax rate was (33.2%) and (3.2%) for the three months ended March 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively.
The change in the effective tax rate during the three months ended March 31, 2018 as compared to the same period in 2017, is primarily attributable to a decrease in the benefit arising from the losses in the North America segment due to the reduction in the U.S. tax rate from 35% in 2017 to 21% in 2018.
Additionally, there was an increase in the liability for uncertain tax positions in the three months ended March 31, 2018 as compared to the same period in 2017.
At March 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017, $52.3 million and $50.5 million, respectively (or 78% and 73%, respectively), of cash and cash equivalents was held by foreign subsidiaries of the Company.
We continue to analyze our global working capital and cash requirements and the potential tax liabilities attributable to further repatriation, and we have yet to make any further determination regarding repatriation of funds from outside the U.S. to fund the Company's U.S. operations in the future.
In the event these funds were needed for Bel's U.S. operations, the Company would be required to accrue and pay U.S. state taxes and any applicable foreign withholding taxes to repatriate these funds.
Cash and cash equivalents, marketable securities and accounts receivable comprised approximately 33.0% of the Company's total assets at March 31, 2018 and 34.4% of total assets at December 31, 2017.
The unused credit available under the credit facility at March 31, 2018 was $75.0 million, of which we had the ability to borrow $25.7 million without violating our Leverage Ratio covenant based on the Company's existing consolidated EBITDA.
During the three months ended March 31, 2018, accounts receivable decreased by $2.5 million primarily due to lower sales volume in the first quarter of 2018 as compared to the fourth quarter of 2017.
Inventory increased by $4.7 million at March 31, 2018 compared to December 31, 2017, primarily due to a change in the timing of revenue recognition (and related release of inventory from our books) in connection with the adoption of ASC 606, as described in Note 2.
During the three months ended March 31, 2017, accounts receivable decreased by $2.0 million primarily due to lower sales volume in the first quarter of 2017 as compared to the fourth quarter of 2016.
Days sales outstanding (DSO) increased to 58 days at March 31, 2017 from 54 days at December 31, 2016, primary due to a 32% increase in sales from February to March 2017.
Inventory levels were up by $2.4 million at March 31, 2017 compared to December 31, 2016 as raw materials and work in progress balances increased from year-end levels to accommodate the anticipated increase in sales for the second half of 2017.
