The Company’s significant accounting policies are summarized in Note 1 of the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018.
Adoption of the new standard resulted in the recording of right-of-use assets in the amount of $20.7 million and lease liabilities related to our operating leases in the amount of $21.0 million on our consolidated balance sheet as of January 1, 2019.
The aggregate amount of transaction price allocated to remaining performance obligations that have not been satisfied as of September 30, 2019 related to contracts that exceed one year in duration amounted to $15.7 million, with expected contract expiration dates that range from 2020 - 2025.
As of September 30, 2019 and December 31, 2018, our available-for-sale securities primarily consisted of investments held in a rabbi trust which are intended to fund the Company’s Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan (“SERP”) obligations.
These securities are measured at fair value using quoted prices in active markets for identical assets (Level 1) inputs and amounted to $1.2 million at September 30, 2019 and $1.4 million at December 31, 2018.
The Company does not have any financial assets measured at fair value on a recurring basis categorized as Level 3, and there were no transfers in or out of Level 1, Level 2 or Level 3 during the nine months ended September 30, 2019 or September 30, 2018.
There were no changes to the Company’s valuation techniques used to measure asset fair values on a recurring or nonrecurring basis during the nine months ended September 30, 2019 or September 30, 2018.
There were no financial assets accounted for at fair value on a nonrecurring basis as of September 30, 2019 or December 31, 2018.
The Company has other financial instruments, such as cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, restricted cash, accounts payable and accrued expenses, which are not measured at fair value on a recurring basis but are recorded at amounts that approximate fair value due to their liquid or short-term nature.
The fair value of the Company’s long-term debt is estimated using a discounted cash flow method based on interest rates that are currently available for debt issuances with similar terms and maturities.
At September 30, 2019 and December 31, 2018, the estimated fair value of total debt was $116.8 million and $117.9 million, respectively, compared to a carrying amount of $112.3 million and $114.2 million, respectively.
The Company did not have any other financial liabilities within the scope of the fair value disclosure requirements as of September 30, 2019.
Nonfinancial assets and liabilities, such as goodwill, indefinite-lived intangible assets and long-lived assets, are accounted for at fair value on a nonrecurring basis.
We review goodwill for impairment on a reporting unit basis annually during the fourth quarter of each year and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of goodwill may not be recoverable.
As weakened market conditions from earlier in 2019 continued into the third quarter without a visible rebound in incoming orders, the Company’s actual revenue and margin levels in 2019 were significantly lower than the financial projections utilized in the annual goodwill impairment analysis (performed as of October 1, 2018), and were not projected to rebound to those levels in 2019.
The Company determined that current business conditions, and the resulting decrease in the Company’s projected undiscounted and discounted cash flows, together with the accompanying stock price decline, constituted a triggering event, which required the Company to perform interim impairment tests related to its long-lived assets and goodwill during the third quarter of 2019.
The Company’s interim test on its long-lived assets indicated that the carrying value of its long-lived assets was recoverable and that no impairment existed as of the July 31, 2019 testing date.
The July 31, 2019 interim impairment test related to the Company's goodwill was performed by reporting unit (North America and Europe).
The valuation test, which heavily weights future discounted cash flow projections, indicated impairment of the goodwill associated with the Company’s North America reporting unit.
As a result, the Company recorded a non-cash goodwill impairment charge of $8.9 million ($8.5 million after-tax) during the third quarter of 2019.
The Company’s goodwill associated with its North America reporting unit originated from several of Bel’s prior acquisitions, primarily Power Solutions and Connectivity Solutions.
The carrying value of the Company's goodwill was $19.8 million at December 31, 2018.
The remaining goodwill as of September 30, 2019 has a carrying value of $10.8 million related solely to the Company's Europe reporting unit.
The Company had also performed an interim impairment analysis of its indefinite-lived intangible assets as of July 31, 2019.
The Company tests indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment using a fair value approach, the relief-from-royalty method (a form of the income approach).
At December 31, 2018, the Company’s indefinite-lived intangible assets related to the trademarks acquired in the Power Solutions, Connectivity Solutions, Cinch and Fibreco acquisitions.
The Company's interim test on its indefinite-lived intangible assets indicated that the carrying value of its long-lived assets was recoverable and that no impairment existed as of the July 31, 2019 testing date.
The accompanying condensed consolidated statements of operations for the nine months ended September 30, 2019 includes a related gain on sale of $4.3 million (pre-tax).
At September 30, 2019 and December 31, 2018, the carrying value of the debt on the condensed consolidated balance sheet is reflected net of $1.4 million and $1.8 million, respectively, of deferred financing costs.
During the nine months ended September 30, 2019, the Company borrowed $12.0 million from its revolver, all of which was repaid by September 30, 2019.
At September 30, 2019, the Company was in compliance with its debt covenants, including its most restrictive covenant, the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio.
As a result of the expiration of the statutes of limitations for specific jurisdictions, it is reasonably possible that the related unrecognized benefits for tax positions taken regarding previously filed tax returns may change materially from those recorded as liabilities for uncertain tax positions in the Company’s consolidated financial statements at September 30, 2019.
The Company’s liabilities for uncertain tax positions totaled $28.6 million and $28.9 million at September 30, 2019 and December 31, 2018, respectively, of which $2.1 million and $1.4 million is included in other current liabilities at September 30, 2019 and December 31, 2018, respectively.
As of September 30, 2019, approximately $2.1 million of the Company’s liabilities for uncertain tax positions are expected to be resolved during 2019 by way of expiration of the related statute of limitations.
The Company’s policy is to recognize interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions as a component of the current provision for income taxes.
During the nine months ended September 30, 2019 and 2018, the Company recognized $0.5 million and $0.7 million, respectively, in interest and penalties in the condensed consolidated statements of operations.
During the nine months ended September 30, 2019 and 2018, the Company recognized a benefit of $0.7 million and a benefit of $0.3 million, respectively, for the reversal of such interest and penalties, relating to the settlement of the liability for uncertain tax positions.
The Company has approximately $4.7 million and $3.8 million accrued for the payment of interest and penalties at September 30, 2019 and December 31, 2018, respectively, which is included in both income taxes payable and liability for uncertain tax positions in the condensed consolidated balance sheets.
The expense for the three months ended September 30, 2019 and 2018 amounted to $0.3 million in both periods.
The expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2019 and 2018 amounted to $0.8 million in both periods.
As of September 30, 2019, the Company did not have any additional operating or financing leases that have not yet commenced.
The estimated liability related to this matter is approximately $12.0 million and has been included as a liability for uncertain tax positions on the accompanying condensed consolidated balance sheets.
As Bel is fully indemnified in this matter per the terms of the stock purchase agreement with ABB, a corresponding other asset for indemnification is also included in other assets on the accompanying condensed consolidated balance sheets at September 30, 2019 and December 31, 2018.
Goodwill Impairment - As discussed in Note 4, Fair Value Measurements, the Company recorded an $8.9 million non-cash impairment charge related to its North America goodwill in the third quarter of 2019.
This charge impacted income from operations for the North America segment in the three- and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2019.

The Company has also experienced margin pressure throughout 2019 due to lower sales volumes and high material costs from 2018 which continue to run through the Company’s statement of operations.
Sales declines in each of our segments during the third quarter of 2019 reflected lower sales into our distribution channel as our distribution partners continue to work down their level of inventory on hand.
Sales of our connector products into military applications were also lower during the third quarter of 2019 compared to the same period of 2018, impacting our North America segment sales.
Sales in our Asia segment in the third quarter of 2019 were down versus 2018 as a result of customers working down heightened inventory levels which had been built up during 2018 in response to new product launches and the tariffs that went into effect in 2018 and 2019.
Net sales and (loss) income from operations by operating segment for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2019 and 2018 were as follows.
Sales of our Connectivity Solutions products during the third quarter of 2019 declined $4.0 million primarily due to lower demand from military customers as compared to last year's third quarter, and reduced volume of product flowing through our distribution channels as our distribution partners continue to work down inventory levels that had been built up in 2018 ahead of the tariffs.
These factors also impacted the nine-month period ended September 30, 2019, which declined $8.9 million from the same period of 2018, partially offset by higher sales to commercial aerospace customers during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2019.
Sales of our Magnetic Solutions products during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2019 were down $13.3 million and $18.0 million, respectively, from the same periods of 2018 while inventory levels built up in advance of a customer's new program launch during 2018 are worked through.
Sales of our Power Solutions and Protection products were $4.7 million lower in the third quarter of 2019 compared to the same quarter of 2018.
Sales of our Bel Power Solutions products into datacenter applications decreased by $3.8 million and sales of our Circuit Protection products were $0.9 million lower as compared to last year’s third quarter.
These decreases were partially offset by a $0.5 million increase in sales of our Custom Module products.
Sales during the nine-month period ended September 30, 2019 decreased by $1.2 million from the same period of 2018, as stronger sales into datacenter applications during the first quarter of 2019 lessened the impact of sales declines during the second and third quarters of 2019.
Material costs as a percentage of sales were higher during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2019 compared to the same periods of 2018 primarily due to the industry-wide supply constraints related to certain of our purchased components during 2018.
Labor costs as a percentage of sales declined during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2019 compared to the same periods of 2018 as a more favorable exchange rate environment related to the Chinese Renminbi offset the overall impact of minimum wage increases in the PRC and Mexico.
The provision (benefit) for income taxes for the three months ended September 30, 2019 and 2018 was $0.6 million and ($2.2) million, respectively.
The Company’s earnings before income taxes for the three months ended September 30, 2019, were approximately $15.1 million lower than the same period in 2018, primarily attributable to the $8.9 million impairment of goodwill in North America, as well as lower earnings in the North America and Asia segments.
The Company’s effective tax rate was (10.0%) and (24.1%) for the three months ended September 30, 2019 and 2018, respectively.
The change in the effective tax rate during the three months ended September 30, 2019 as compared to the same period in 2018, is primarily attributable to a decrease in U.S. taxes relating to income from foreign subsidiaries taxed in the U.S. as part of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. Additionally, the change in the tax rate during the three months ended September 30, 2019 compared to the same period in 2018 is attributable to a decrease in tax expense in the North America segment due to the reduction in the estimated transition tax on post-1986 untaxed accumulated foreign earnings as well as a decrease in the taxes related to uncertain tax positions during the 2018 period.
The provision for income taxes for the nine months ended September 30, 2019 and 2018 was $1.0 million and $0.5 million, respectively.
The Company’s earnings before income taxes for the nine months ended September 30, 2019 were approximately $18.5 million lower than the same period in 2018, primarily attributable to the $8.9 million impairment of goodwill in North America, as well as lower earnings in the North America and Asia segments.
The Company’s effective tax rate was (78.2%) and 3.0% for the nine-month periods ended September 30, 2019 and 2018, respectively.
The change in the effective tax rate during the nine months ended September 30, 2019 as compared to the same period of 2018, is primarily attributable to the same factors noted above related to the third quarter, as well as the impact from permanent tax differences on U.S. tax-exempt activities during the first quarter of 2019.
Cash and cash equivalents, marketable securities and accounts receivable comprised approximately 33.1% of the Company’s total assets at September 30, 2019 and 32.9% of total assets at December 31, 2018.
The unused credit available under the credit facility at September 30, 2019 was $75.0 million, of which we had the ability to borrow $40.6 million without violating our Leverage Ratio covenant based on the Company’s existing consolidated EBITDA.
During the nine months ended September 30, 2019, accounts receivable decreased by $12.4 million primarily due to lower sales during the third quarter of 2019 as compared to the fourth quarter of 2018.
Inventory decreased by $8.4 million at September 30, 2019 compared to December 31, 2018.
During the nine months ended September 30, 2018, accounts receivable increased by $19.0 million primarily due to higher sales volume in the third quarter of 2018 as compared to the fourth quarter of 2017.
Days sales outstanding (DSO) increased to 61 days at September 30, 2018 from 60 days at December 31, 2017.
Excluding the adoption adjustment related to this accounting change, inventory increased by $20.1 million at September 30, 2018 compared to December 31, 2017, primarily in raw materials.
Inventory turns increased from 3.6 at December 31, 2017 to 4.0 at September 30, 2018, primarily due to the change in revenue recognition accounting noted above.

The Company is exposed to market risk primarily from changes in foreign currency exchange rates and changes in interest rates associated with its long-term debt.
During the first nine months of 2019, the U.S. Dollar was stronger against most other currencies in which the Company pays its expenses.
The Company estimates that the depreciation in these foreign currencies led to lower operating costs of $3.9 million, as the majority of our expenses in the PRC, Europe and Mexico are paid in local currency.
Foreign exchange gains were also recognized in the first nine months of 2019 of $0.5 million on translation of local currency balance sheet accounts to the U.S. Dollar in consolidation, resulting from foreign currency fluctuations since December 31, 2018.
