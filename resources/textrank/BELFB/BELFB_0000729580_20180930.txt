The Company's significant accounting policies are summarized in Note 1 of the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2017.
There were no significant changes to these accounting policies during the nine months ended September 30, 2018, except as discussed in Note 2, Revenue, related to the adoption of the new revenue standards.
In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606) ("ASU 2014-09"), which amends the existing accounting standards for revenue recognition.
ASU 2014-09 is based on principles that govern the recognition of revenue at an amount an entity expects to be entitled when products are transferred to customers.
In connection with the modified retrospective application of the new revenue standards, we recorded an adjustment to increase retained earnings of $3.4 million upon the January 1, 2018 adoption date.
Apart from this adjustment and the inclusion of additional required disclosures in Note 2, the adoption of the new revenue standards did not have a material impact on the Company's condensed consolidated financial statements.
We are currently assessing the impact that the new standard will have on our consolidated financial statements, which will consist primarily of recording right-of-use assets and lease liabilities related to our operating leases on our consolidated balance sheet.
On January 1, 2018, the Company adopted ASC 606 using the modified retrospective method applied to those contracts which were not completed as of January 1, 2018.
The adoption of ASC 606 represents a change in accounting principle that will more closely align revenue recognition with the transfer of control of the Company's goods and services and provides financial statement readers with enhanced disclosures related to the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from contracts with customers.
The amount of revenue recognized reflects the consideration to which the Company expects to be entitled to receive in exchange for these goods and services.
The Company also provides incremental services to our customers in the form of training, technical support, special tooling, and other support as deemed necessary from time to time.
Warranties vary by product line and are competitive for the markets in which the Company operates.
Warranties generally extend for one to three years from the date of sale, providing customers with assurance that the related product will function as intended.
The Company reviews its warranty liability quarterly based on an analysis of actual expenses and failure rates accompanied with estimated future costs and projected failure rate trends.
In general, the Company is not contractually obligated to accept returns except for defective product or in instances where the product does not meet the Company's product specifications.
However, the Company may permit its customers to return product for other reasons.
In certain instances, the Company would generally require a significant cancellation penalty payment by the customer.
The Company estimates such returns, where applicable, based upon management's evaluation of historical experience, market acceptance of products produced and known negotiations with customers.
Since the customer agrees to a stated price for each product on each purchase order, the majority of contracts are not subject to variable consideration.
However, the "ship and debit" arrangements with distributors, royalty income associated with our licensing agreements, and the product returns described above are each deemed to be variable consideration which requires the Company to make constrained estimates based on historical data.
A contract asset results when goods or services have been transferred to the customer but payment is contingent upon a future event, other than passage of time.
In the case of our consignment arrangements, we are unable to invoice the customer until product is pulled from the hub by the customer, which generates an unbilled receivable (a contract asset) when revenue is initially recognized.
We have certain customers who provide payment in advance of product being shipped, which results in deferred revenue (a contract liability).
The change in balance of our unbilled receivables from January 1, 2018 to September 30, 2018 primarily relates to a timing difference between the Company's performance (i.e. when our product is shipped to a customer-controlled hub) and the point at which the Company can invoice the customer per the terms of the customer contract (i.e. when the customer pulls our product from the customer-controlled hub).
The aggregate amount of transaction price allocated to remaining performance obligations that have not been satisfied as of September 30, 2018 related to contracts that exceed one year in duration amounted to $17.6 million, with expected contract expiration dates that range from 2019 - 2024.
The majority of the Company's total backlog of orders at September 30, 2018 is related to contracts that have an original expected duration of one year or less, for which the Company is electing to utilize the practical expedient available within the guidance, and are excluded from the transaction price related to these future obligations.
The Company will generally satisfy the remaining performance obligations as we transfer control of the products ordered to our customers.
As of December 31, 2017, the Company held certain financial assets that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis.
During the nine months ended September 30, 2018, the Company sold its securities and realized a gain on sale of $0.2 million.
As of September 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017, our securities primarily consisted of investments held in a rabbi trust of $1.3 million and $1.5 million, respectively, which were measured at fair value using quoted prices in active markets for identical assets (Level 1) inputs.
The Company does not have any financial assets measured at fair value on a recurring basis categorized as Level 3, and there were no transfers in or out of Level 1, Level 2 or Level 3 during the nine months ended September 30, 2018 or September 30, 2017.
Excluding the changes made in accordance with the Company's adoption of ASU 2016-01, there were no additional changes to the Company's valuation techniques used to measure asset fair values on a recurring or nonrecurring basis during the nine months ended September 30, 2018.
There were no financial assets accounted for at fair value on a nonrecurring basis as of September 30, 2018 or December 31, 2017.
The Company has other financial instruments, such as cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, restricted cash, accounts payable, accrued expenses and notes payable, which are not measured at fair value on a recurring basis but are recorded at amounts that approximate fair value due to their liquid or short-term nature.
The fair value of the Company's long-term debt is estimated using a discounted cash flow method based on interest rates that are currently available for debt issuances with similar terms and maturities.
At September 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017, the estimated fair value of total debt was $116.9 million and $124.8 million, respectively, compared to a carrying amount of $114.8 million and $122.7 million, respectively.
The Company did not have any other financial liabilities within the scope of the fair value disclosure requirements as of September 30, 2018.
The CSA contains customary representations and warranties, covenants and events of default and financial covenants that measure (i) the ratio of the Company's total funded indebtedness, on a consolidated basis, to the amount of the Company's consolidated EBITDA, as defined, ("Leverage Ratio") and (ii) the ratio of the amount of the Company's consolidated EBITDA to the Company's consolidated fixed charges.
At September 30, 2018, the Company was in compliance with its debt covenants, including its most restrictive covenant, the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio.
As a result of the expiration of the statutes of limitations for specific jurisdictions, it is reasonably possible that the related unrecognized benefits for tax positions taken regarding previously filed tax returns may change materially from those recorded as liabilities for uncertain tax positions in the Company's consolidated financial statements at September 30, 2018.
The Company's liabilities for uncertain tax positions totaled $28.2 million and $30.4 million at September 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017, respectively, of which $1.1 million and $2.5 million is included in other current liabilities at September 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017, respectively.
These amounts, if recognized, would reduce the Company's effective tax rate.
As of September 30, 2018, approximately $2.5 million of the Company's liabilities for uncertain tax positions were resolved during 2018 by way of expiration of the related statute of limitations.
The Company's policy is to recognize interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions as a component of the current provision for income taxes.
During the nine months ended September 30, 2018 and 2017, the Company recognized $0.7 million and $0.6 million, respectively, in interest and penalties in the consolidated statements of operations.
During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2018, the Company recognized a benefit of $0.3 million and $0.7 million, respectively, for the reversal of such interest and penalties, relating to the expiration of statutes of limitations and settlement of the acquired liability for uncertain tax positions.
The Company has approximately $3.1 million and $3.2 million accrued for the payment of interest and penalties at September 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017, respectively, which is included in both income taxes payable and liability for uncertain tax positions in the consolidated balance sheets.
The Company maintains the Bel Fuse Inc. Employees' Savings Plan, a defined contribution plan that is intended to meet the applicable requirements for tax-qualification under sections 401(a) and (k) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code").
The expense for the three months ended September 30, 2018 and 2017 amounted to $0.3 million in both periods.
The expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2018 and 2017 amounted to $0.8 million and $0.9 million, respectively.
The expense for the three months ended September 30, 2018 and 2017 amounted to $0.1 million in both periods.
The expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2018 and 2017 amounted to $0.3 million in both periods.
On December 5, 2016, the Arezzo Revenue Agency filed an appeal with the Supreme Court and BPS China filed a counter-appeal on January 4, 2017.
The estimated liability related to this matter is approximately $12.0 million and has been included as a liability for uncertain tax positions on the accompanying condensed consolidated balance sheets.
As Bel is fully indemnified in this matter per the terms of the stock purchase agreement with ABB, a corresponding other asset for indemnification is also included in other assets on the accompanying consolidated balance sheets at September 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017.
Setec subsequently filed a lawsuit against the Company and three of its subsidiaries in the Regional Court of Dusseldorf, Germany on January 29, 2016 for patent infringement.
In 2015, one of the Company's subsidiaries in the PRC, Dongguan Transpower Electric Products Co., Ltd.
("Dongguan Transpower"), was provided notice of a claim by DG Yu Shing Industrial Development Company Limited against Dongguan Transpower and three other defendants for past due construction costs of approximately $3.2 million.
On June 1, 2018, the Company filed an action against Unipower, LLC in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York for breach of contract.
Specifically, the Company alleges in its Complaint that Unipower has willfully violated the Master Services Agreement ("MSA") entered into by the parties on January 23, 2015 by failing to make payment for the products it contracted for under the MSA.
On October 1, 2018, the Company completed the acquisition of BCMZ Precision Engineering Limited, a UK manufacturer of precision machined components, for approximately $2.6 million in cash.

·   Revenues – The Company's revenues increased by $33.8 million, or 9.1%, in the first nine months of 2018 as compared to the same period of 2017, despite a $5.1 million decline in sales related to the NPS divestiture.
·   Backlog – Our backlog reached $185.1 million at September 30, 2018, representing an increase of $38.6 million, or 26%, from December 31, 2017.
Since year-end, we saw a 65% increase at Magnetic Solutions, driven by a strong position with our integrated connector modules in next-generation switching products.
·   Labor Costs – Labor costs during the first nine months of 2018 increased from 10.4% of sales during the first nine months of 2017 to 11.5% of sales during the first nine months of 2018, primarily due to the appreciation of the Renminbi against the U.S. Dollar, particularly during the first half of 2018, minimum wage increases in the PRC, and growth in sales of our labor-intensive integrated connector module (ICM) products.
The growth in North America sales in 2018 was largely due to increased demand for our passive connector products from our premise wiring customers, strength in our connectivity products within key military programs, and higher sales of our transformer products into medical applications.
Sales of our Power Solutions products have also increased in 2018 with heightened demand for our power supplies for use in various datacenter applications.
The increases in Asia sales noted above for the 2018 periods primarily relate to higher sales of our integrated connector modules for next-generation switching platforms.
Sales in Europe increased in both 2018 periods presented as a result of higher demand for our Stewart and Cinch connector products in that region, coupled with strong sales of our power products into rail applications.
There was also a favorable impact on our European sales in general during the nine-month period ended September 30, 2018 as a portion of those sales are invoiced in Euros or Pounds, which had appreciated against the U.S. Dollar particularly during the first half of 2018 as compared to the same period of 2017.
Net sales and income from operations by operating segment for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2018 and 2017 were as follows.
The improvement in income from operations within our North America segment was largely due to higher sales volumes in the 2018 periods, partially offset by increased material costs on purchased components.
The income from operations at our Asia segment for both 2018 periods presented was impacted by higher labor costs driven by increased minimum wage rates at our factories in the PRC, higher raw material costs during 2018 and the unfavorable appreciation of the Renminbi particularly during the first half of 2018 compared to the same period of 2017.
This accounted for $7.5 million and $11.4 million of the sales growth during the third quarter and nine-month period of 2018 versus 2017.
Our Signal Transformer business also contributed with an increase in sales of $1.6 million and $3.2 million during the third quarter and nine-month period of 2018, as orders from new programs within industrial applications remained strong throughout the third quarter.
Our connectivity solutions products showed an overall improvement in sales of $5.7 million and $12.0 million during the third quarter and first nine months of 2018, respectively, compared to the same periods of 2017.
Sales of our Stewart passive connectors were very strong in the 2018 periods with increases of $3.6 million and $7.1 million during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2018 as compared to 2017.
Sales of our Cinch products were also up in 2018 (by $2.1 million for the third quarter and by $5.0 million for the nine-month period) primarily from the military sector for our optical and copper products used in encryption, communications and flight-grade applications and for our micro-miniature copper connectivity products in relation to key defense programs.
Labor costs as a percentage of sales also increased during the third quarter and first nine months of 2018 compared to the same periods of 2017 due primarily to two factors.
In total, these other expenses increased during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2018 by $1.1 million and $3.1 million, respectively, as compared to the same periods of 2017.
This included higher support labor costs of $1.5 million and $3.0 million, respectively, partially offset by lower depreciation and amortization expense of $0.4 million and $0.9 million during the three and nine-month periods ending September 30, 2018 as compared to the same periods of 2017.
The (benefit) provision for income taxes for the three months ended September 30, 2018 and 2017 was ($2.2) million and less than $0.1 million, respectively.
The Company's earnings before income taxes for the three months ended September 30, 2018, were approximately $4.1 million higher than the same period in 2017, primarily attributable to significantly higher earnings in the North America and Asia segments.
The Company's effective tax rate was (24.1%) and 1.2% for the three months ended September 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively.
The change in the effective tax rate during the three months ended September 30, 2018 as compared to the same period in 2017, is primarily attributable to a decrease in tax expense in the North America segment due to the reduction in the estimated transition tax on post 1986 untaxed accumulated foreign earnings, a reduction in the U.S. tax rate from 35% in 2017 to 21% in 2018, as well as a decrease in the taxes related to uncertain tax positions.
The provision for income taxes for the nine months ended September 30, 2018 and 2017 was $0.5 million and $2.3 million, respectively.
The Company's earnings before income taxes for the nine months ended September 30, 2018 were approximately $6.0 million higher than the same period in 2017, primarily attributable to increases in income in the Europe and North America segments.
The Company's effective tax rate was 3.0% and 20.8% for the nine month periods ended September 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively.
The change in the effective tax rate during the nine months ended September 30, 2018 as compared to the same period of 2017, is primarily attributable to a decrease in tax expense in the North America segment due to the reduction in the estimated transition tax on post 1986 untaxed accumulated foreign earnings, a reduction in the U.S. tax rate from 35% in 2017 to 21% in 2018, as well as a decrease in taxes related to uncertain tax positions.
This decrease was partially offset by an increase in U.S. taxes relating to income from foreign subsidiaries taxed in the U.S. as part of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. Additionally, the decrease in the effective tax rate for the nine months ended September 30, 2018 as compared to the same period in 2017, is attributable to U.S. and foreign taxes accrued for gains recognized on a Bel Fuse legal entity restructuring transaction during the 2017 period.
During the nine months ended September 30, 2018, accounts receivable increased by $19.0 million primarily due to higher sales volume in the third quarter of 2018 as compared to the fourth quarter of 2017.
Excluding the adoption adjustment related to this accounting change, inventory increased by $20.1 million at September 30, 2018 compared to December 31, 2017, primarily in raw materials.
The increased raw materials balance was driven by a higher volume of raw materials purchased to accommodate increased demand for our products, coupled with higher material costs in 2018 resulting from constraints in component availability.
Inventory turns increased from 3.6 at December 31, 2017 to 4.0 at September 30, 2018, primarily due to the change in revenue recognition accounting noted above.
During the nine months ended September 30, 2017, accounts receivable increased by $7.9 million primarily due to higher sales volume in the third quarter of 2017 as compared to the fourth quarter of 2016.
Days sales outstanding (DSO) increased to 60 days at September 30, 2017 from 54 days at December 31, 2016, primary due the extension of credit terms with one of our large customers, as well as the increase in revenue (and resulting accounts receivable balance) in our Asia segment where DSO tends to be higher as compared to our other geographic segments.
Inventory levels were up by $3.3 million at September 30, 2017 compared to December 31, 2016 as work in progress and finished goods balances increased from year-end levels to accommodate the increase in demand for our products in 2017.

The Employees' Savings Plan provides for matching contributions to be invested in shares of the Company's Class A Common Stock.
The trustees of the Employees' Savings Plan adopted a "10b5-1 Plan," in accordance with guidelines specified by Rule 10b5-1 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, to make open market purchases of shares of Class A Common Stock with such matching contributions.
As previously disclosed, on August 16, 2018, the trustees of the Employees' Savings Plan adopted a plan (the "10b5-1 Plan") in accordance with guidelines specified by Rule 10b5-1 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, pursuant to which KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc. was engaged to purchase shares of the Class A common stock of Bel Fuse Inc.
("Bel") to implement the Employees' Savings Plan's requirements that matching contributions be invested in shares of Bel's Class A common stock.
While it was originally expected that purchases under the 10b5-1 Plan would be completed by November 30, 2018, as a sufficient number of shares of Class A common stock have been purchased already to meet the requirements of the "match" for 2018, the 10b5-1 Plan was terminated effective November 7, 2018.
