The Company’s significant accounting policies are summarized in Note 1 of the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018.
There were no significant changes to these accounting policies during the three months ended March 31, 2019, except as discussed in Note 12, Leases, related to the adoption of the new lease standard.
In connection with the adoption, we elected to utilize the Comparatives Under 840 Option whereby the Company will continue to present prior period financial statements and disclosures under ASC 840.
Further, we elected a short-term lease exception policy, permitting us to not apply the recognition requirements of this standard to short-term leases (i.e. leases with terms of 12 months or less) and an accounting policy to account for lease and non-lease components as a single component for certain classes of assets.
We implemented a new lease system to facilitate the requirements of the new standard and completed the necessary changes to our accounting policies, processes, disclosures and internal control over financial reporting.
Adoption of the new standard resulted in the recording of right-of-use assets in the amount of $20.7 million and lease liabilities related to our operating leases in the amount of $21.0 million on our consolidated balance sheet as of January 1, 2019.
The standard did not materially affect the Company’s consolidated net earnings or have any impact on cash flows.
The change in balance of our unbilled receivables from December 31, 2018 to March 31, 2019 primarily relates to a timing difference between the Company’s performance (i.e. when our product is shipped to a customer-controlled hub) and the point at which the Company can invoice the customer per the terms of the customer contract (i.e. when the customer pulls our product from the customer-controlled hub).
The aggregate amount of transaction price allocated to remaining performance obligations that have not been satisfied as of March 31, 2019 related to contracts that exceed one year in duration amounted to $16.0 million, with expected contract expiration dates that range from 2020 - 2025.
As of March 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018, our available-for-sale securities primarily consisted of investments held in a rabbi trust which are intended to fund the Company’s Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan (“SERP”) obligations.
These securities are measured at fair value using quoted prices in active markets for identical assets (Level 1) inputs and amounted to $1.3 million at March 31, 2019 and $1.4 million at December 31, 2018.
The Company does not have any financial assets measured at fair value on a recurring basis categorized as Level 3, and there were no transfers in or out of Level 1, Level 2 or Level 3 during the three months ended March 31, 2019 or March 31, 2018.
There were no changes to the Company’s valuation techniques used to measure asset fair values on a recurring or nonrecurring basis during the three months ended March 31, 2019 or March 31, 2018.
There were no financial assets accounted for at fair value on a nonrecurring basis as of March 31, 2019 or December 31, 2018.
The Company has other financial instruments, such as cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, restricted cash, accounts payable, accrued expenses and notes payable, which are not measured at fair value on a recurring basis but are recorded at amounts that approximate fair value due to their liquid or short-term nature.
The fair value of the Company’s long-term debt is estimated using a discounted cash flow method based on interest rates that are currently available for debt issuances with similar terms and maturities.
At March 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018, the estimated fair value of total debt was $118.0 million and $117.9 million, respectively, compared to a carrying amount of $113.6 million and $114.2 million, respectively.
The Company did not have any other financial liabilities within the scope of the fair value disclosure requirements as of March 31, 2019.
There were no triggering events that occurred during the three months ended March 31, 2019 that would warrant interim impairment testing.
In connection with this transition, the Company has classified $1.5 million of property, plant and equipment as held for sale on the accompanying condensed consolidated balance sheet at March 31, 2019.
The Company expects the transition to be complete by the end of the third quarter of 2019.
The change in warranty accrual during the three months ended March 31, 2019 primarily related to repair costs incurred and adjustments to pre-existing warranties.
There were no new material warranty charges incurred during the three months ended March 31, 2019.
The CSA consists of (i) a term loan, with outstanding borrowings of $115.2 million and $116.0 million at March 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018, respectively and (ii) a $75 million revolving credit facility (“Revolver”), with no outstanding borrowings at March 31, 2019 or December 31, 2018.
At March 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018, the carrying value of the debt on the condensed consolidated balance sheet is reflected net of $1.7 million and $1.8 million, respectively, of deferred financing costs.
During the three months ended March 31, 2019, the Company borrowed $10.0 million from its revolver, all of which was repaid by March 31, 2019.
The CSA contains customary representations and warranties, covenants and events of default and financial covenants that measure (i) the ratio of the Company's total funded indebtedness, on a consolidated basis, to the amount of the Company’s consolidated EBITDA, as defined, (“Leverage Ratio”) and (ii) the ratio of the amount of the Company’s consolidated EBITDA to the Company’s consolidated fixed charges.
At March 31, 2019, the Company was in compliance with its debt covenants, including its most restrictive covenant, the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio.
As a result of the expiration of the statutes of limitations for specific jurisdictions, it is reasonably possible that the related unrecognized benefits for tax positions taken regarding previously filed tax returns may change materially from those recorded as liabilities for uncertain tax positions in the Company’s consolidated financial statements at March 31, 2019.
The Company’s liabilities for uncertain tax positions totaled $29.4 million and $28.9 million at March 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018, respectively, of which $1.1 million and $1.4 million is included in other current liabilities at March 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018, respectively.
These amounts, if recognized, would reduce the Company’s effective tax rate.
As of March 31, 2019, approximately $1.1 million of the Company’s liabilities for uncertain tax positions are expected to be resolved during 2019 by way of expiration of the related statute of limitations.
The Company’s policy is to recognize interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions as a component of the current provision for income taxes.
During the three months ended March 31, 2019 and 2018, the Company recognized $0.2 million in interest and penalties in the condensed consolidated statements of operations during each period.
During the three months ended March 31, 2019 and 2018, the Company recognized a benefit of $0.3 million and zero, respectively, for the reversal of such interest and penalties, relating to the settlement of the liability for uncertain tax positions.
The Company has approximately $4.8 million and $3.8 million accrued for the payment of interest and penalties at March 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018, respectively, which is included in both income taxes payable and liability for uncertain tax positions in the condensed consolidated balance sheets.
The Company continues to monitor the impacts of the U.S. tax reform and supplementary guidance as it becomes available.
At December 31, 2018, the remaining balance of the deemed repatriation tax was included in other current liabilities on the Company’s condensed consolidated balance sheet.
At March 31, 2019, the majority of the deemed repatriation tax is included in other long-term liabilities on the Company's condensed consolidated balance sheet due to clarification of an Internal Revenue Service notice received in December 2018.
The Company maintains the Bel Fuse Inc. Employees’ Savings Plan, a defined contribution plan that is intended to meet the applicable requirements for tax-qualification under sections 401(a) and (k) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”).
The expense for the three months ended March 31, 2019 and 2018 amounted to $0.3 million in both periods.
The expense for the three months ended March 31, 2019 and 2018 amounted to approximately $0.1 million in both periods.
The Company has operating leases for its facilities used for manufacturing, research and development, sales and administration.
These options to extend or terminate a lease are included in the lease term only when it is reasonably likely that the Company will elect that option.
The estimated liability related to this matter is approximately $12.0 million and has been included as a liability for uncertain tax positions on the accompanying condensed consolidated balance sheets.
As Bel is fully indemnified in this matter per the terms of the stock purchase agreement with ABB, a corresponding other asset for indemnification is also included in other assets on the accompanying condensed consolidated balance sheets at March 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018.

·   Revenues – The Company’s revenues increased by $7.1 million (or 6.0%) in the first quarter of 2019 as compared to the same period of 2018.
The majority of the sales growth in the first quarter related to continued strength of our power products for datacenter applications.
We also saw increased demand for our connectivity products for use in commercial aerospace applications, particularly from our after-market customers.
·   Backlog – Our backlog of orders amounted to $166.8 million at March 31, 2019, a decline of $4.4 million, or 3%, from December 31, 2018.
Since year-end, we saw an 11% increase in the backlog for our Connectivity Solutions products, driven by additional orders from our commercial aerospace and distribution customers.
Order volumes were lower in the first quarter of 2019 as a result of slowdowns in certain markets coupled with customers working down heighted inventory levels which had been built up in response to new product launches and the potential rise in tariffs.
As a result, the Company’s material costs as a percentage of sales increased to 41.8% during the first quarter of 2019 from 40.8% during the first quarter of 2018.
·   Labor Costs – Labor costs during the first quarter of 2019 increased from 11.3% of sales during the first quarter of 2018 to 11.5% of sales during the first quarter of 2019, primarily due to minimum wage increases in Mexico which went into effect on January 1, 2019 as well as minimum wage increases in the PRC which went into effect in the first and third quarters of 2018.
·   Impact of Foreign Currency – During the first quarter of 2019, the Company realized foreign exchange transactional losses of $0.6 million, offset by lower labor and overhead costs of $1.7 million related to favorable fluctuations in exchange rates versus 2018.
Due to the changes in the value of foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar, translating our financial results and the revaluation of certain intercompany as well as third-party transactions to and from foreign currencies to U.S. dollars may result in a favorable or unfavorable impact to our consolidated statements of operations and cash flows.
The Company was favorably impacted by transactional foreign exchange gains in the first quarter of 2019 due to the depreciation of the Euro, Pound, and Renminbi against the U.S. dollar as compared to exchange rates in effect during 2018.
As a result, the U.S. Dollar equivalent costs of these operations were $1.7 million lower in 2019.
Sales growth is also expected within the areas of commercial aerospace and key military platforms related to fighter jet, munition and encryption applications later in the year for our connectivity solutions products, and our power products are well positioned on several new HEV applications.
Sales growth in our North America segment during the first quarter of 2019 was led by higher sales of our power products into U.S. datacenter applications and increased demand for our connectivity products from our commercial aerospace customers.
Sales in our Asia segment in the first quarter of 2019 were down slightly as customers related to our magnetic solutions business slowed shipments of products during the quarter in order to work down inventory levels that they had built up in advance of potentially higher tariff costs.
Our Europe segment benefited from additional sales of our power products into European datacenter applications during the first quarter of 2019 as compared to the same quarter of 2018.
Net sales and income (loss) from operations by operating segment for the three months ended March 31, 2019 and 2018 were as follows.
Loss from operations for our North America segment was unfavorably impacted during the first quarter of 2019 by $0.9 million of restructuring costs associated with the transition of manufacturing and warehouse operations from our Inwood, New York facility to other existing Bel facilities, and higher labor costs in Mexico due to an increase in minimum wage rates which went into effect on January 1, 2019.
Our Europe segment’s income from operations benefited from higher sales volume and a more favorable exchange rate environment in the first quarter of 2019 as compared to the same quarter of 2018.
The increase in sales of our connectivity solutions products during the first quarter of 2019 primarily related to higher demand from our commercial aerospace customers, both for new aircraft builds as well as to service after-market needs.
Labor costs as a percentage of sales also increased during the first quarter of 2019 compared to the same period of 2018 as the PRC government increased the minimum wage in the regions where Bel’s factories are located in February and July of 2018.
Furthermore, the minimum wage rates in Mexico increased effective January 1, 2019 which also drove labor costs higher in the first quarter of 2019.
Of the geographic segments in which the Company operates, the U.S. and Europe’s tax rates are generally equivalent; and Asia has the lowest tax rates of the Company’s three geographical segments.
The provision for income taxes for the three months ended March 31, 2019 and 2018 was less than $0.1 million and $0.3 million, respectively.
The Company’s earnings (loss) before income taxes for the three months ended March 31, 2019, were approximately $2.2 million higher than the same period in 2018, primarily attributable to an increase in the income from the Europe and Asia segments, offset by greater losses in the U.S. segment.
The Company’s effective tax rate was 3.3% and (33.2%) for the three months ended March 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively.
The change in the effective tax rate during the three months ended March 31, 2019 as compared to the same period in 2018, is primarily attributable to a decrease in taxes related to uncertain tax positions and the impact of permanent differences on U.S. tax exempt activities.
At March 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018, $37.9 million and $46.3 million, respectively (or 88% and 86%, respectively), of cash and cash equivalents was held by foreign subsidiaries of the Company.
During the first quarter of 2019, the Company repatriated $10.0 million of funds from outside of the U.S., with minimal incremental tax liability.
Management has current intentions to repatriate an additional $10 million of funds from outside of the U.S., with a minimal incremental tax liability, by the end of the third quarter of 2019 with the intent of reducing our outstanding debt balance.
We continue to analyze our global working capital and cash requirements and the potential tax liabilities attributable to further repatriation, and we have yet to make any further determination regarding repatriation of funds from outside the U.S. to fund the Company’s U.S. operations in the future.
In the event these funds were needed for Bel’s U.S. operations, the Company would be required to accrue and pay U.S. state taxes and any applicable foreign withholding taxes to repatriate these funds.
Cash and cash equivalents, marketable securities and accounts receivable comprised approximately 30.3% of the Company’s total assets at March 31, 2019 and 32.9% of total assets at December 31, 2018.
The unused credit available under the credit facility at March 31, 2019 was $75.0 million, of which we had the ability to borrow $47.4 million without violating our Leverage Ratio covenant based on the Company’s existing consolidated EBITDA.
During the three months ended March 31, 2019, accounts receivable increased by $2.3 million primarily due to a $2.4 million increase in sales during the month of March 2019 as compared to the month of December 2018.
Days sales outstanding (DSO) increased to 68 days at March 31, 2019 from 59 days at December 31, 2018.
Inventory increased by $4.2 million at March 31, 2019 compared to December 31, 2018, primarily due to the recent slowdown in demand as customers work through their inventory levels on hand.
During the three months ended March 31, 2018, accounts receivable decreased by $2.5 million primarily due to lower sales volume in the first quarter of 2018 as compared to the fourth quarter of 2017.
Inventory increased by $4.7 million at March 31, 2018 compared to December 31, 2017, primarily due to a change in the timing of revenue recognition (and related release of inventory from our books) in connection with the adoption of ASC 606.
The discussion of new financial accounting standards applicable to the Company is incorporated herein by reference to Note 1 to the Company’s Financial Statements, “Basis of Presentation and Accounting Policies,” included in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.
