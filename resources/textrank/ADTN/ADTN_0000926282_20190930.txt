We maintain disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to provide reasonable assurance that the information required to be disclosed by us in reports that we file or submit under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”), is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the rules and forms promulgated by the SEC, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.
As of the end of the period covered by this report, an evaluation was carried out by management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(e)) pursuant to Rule 13a-15 of the Exchange Act. Based upon that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of September 30, 2019 due to the material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting described below.


part2.txt
We have identified certain material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting, which could, if not remediated, materially adversely affect us.
Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (“Section 404”) requires us to include in our annual reports on Form 10-K an assessment by the Company’s management of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting.
We must perform system and process evaluation and testing of our internal control over financial reporting to allow management and our independent auditors to report on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting, as required by Section 404.
In addition, if management or our independent auditors are unable to conclude that our internal control over financial reporting is effective, we could lose investor confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial statements, which could have an adverse effect on our stock price.
The implementation of these measures is ongoing, and, while we believe that they will ultimately be effective in remediating the material weaknesses described above, our initiatives may not prove successful, and management may not be able to conclude that our internal control over financial reporting is effective.
Furthermore, even if management were to reach such a conclusion, if our independent auditors are not satisfied with the adequacy of our internal control over financial reporting, or if the independent auditors interpret the requirements, rules or regulations differently than we do, then they in the future may decline to issue a report on our internal control over financial reporting or may issue a report that is qualified.
