ASU 2016-02 requires an entity to recognize lease assets and lease liabilities on the balance sheet and to disclose key information about the entity's leasing arrangements.
The two primary areas of impact of these ASUs were network implementation service revenue performance obligations and contract costs.
The primary impact will be accelerated revenue recognition for certain performance obligations related to service revenue arrangements that were previously deferred until customer acceptance and capitalization and amortization of incremental costs of obtaining a contract as described below.
We recorded a bargain purchase gain of $11.3 million during the first quarter of 2018, net of income taxes, which is subject to customary working capital adjustments between the parties.
The bargain purchase gain of $11.3 million represents the difference between the fair value of the net assets acquired over the cash paid.
SEI’s Broadband Networks Division through its SEL subsidiary operated a North American EPON business including sales, marketing, support, and region-specific engineering development.
The transfer of these assets to ADTRAN, which included key customer relationships and required assumption by ADTRAN of relatively low incremental expenses, along with the value of the technology license and OEM supply agreement, resulted in the bargain purchase gain.
Aside from revising the 2017 and 2018 net income for the effect of the bargain purchase gain, there were no material, non-recurring adjustments to this unaudited pro forma information.
For the three months ended March 31, 2018, we incurred acquisition and integration related expenses and amortization of acquired intangibles of $0.2 million related to this acquisition.
The majority of the revenue from this segment is from hardware sales and is recognized when control is transferred to our customers, which is generally when we ship the products.
Our products generally include assurance-based warranties of 90 days to five years for product defects, which are accrued at the time revenue is recognized.
Revenue for network implementation and maintenance services is recognized as described below.
Our maintenance service periods range from one month to five years.
Customers are typically invoiced and pay for maintenance services at the beginning of the maintenance period, which is recorded in current or non-current unearned revenue depending on the length of the service period.
Accordingly, we recognize revenue for maintenance services on a straight-line basis over the maintenance period in services revenue.
We recognize revenue for network implementation, which primarily consists of engineering, execution and enablement services, when performance obligations are complete at a point in time.
If we have recognized revenue, but not billed the customer, the right to consideration is recognized as a contract asset, which is included in other receivables in the Consolidated Balance Sheet.
As of March 31, 2018, we did not have any remaining performance obligations related to customer contracts that had an original expected duration of one year or more, other than maintenance services, which are satisfied over time.
Our effective tax rate decreased from 20.3% in the three months ended March 31, 2017, to 15.1%, excluding the tax impact of the bargain purchase gain, in the three months ended March 31, 2018.
The components of net periodic pension cost other than the service cost component are included in the line item “Other income (expense), net” in the Consolidated Statements of Income.
As of March 31, 2018, there was $2.5 million of unrecognized compensation expense related to unvested stock options, which is expected to be recognized over an average remaining recognition period of 1.3 years.
The determination of the fair value of stock options on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes model is affected by our stock price, as well as assumptions regarding a number of complex and subjective variables that may have a significant impact on the fair value estimate.
There were no stock options granted during the three months ended March 31, 2018 or 2017.
The fair value of RSUs and restricted stock is equal to the closing price of our stock on the date of grant.
The fair value of these performance-based PSU awards was equal to the closing price of our stock on the date of grant.
As of March 31, 2018, there was $12.9 million of unrecognized compensation expense related to unvested market-based PSUs, RSUs and restricted stock, which is expected to be recognized over an average remaining recognition period of 2.9 years.
In addition, there was $10.7 million of unrecognized compensation expense related to unvested performance-based PSUs, which will be recognized over the requisite service period of three years as achievement of the performance objective becomes probable.
For the three months ended March 31, 2018, no compensation expense was recognized related to these performance-based PSU awards.
Unrealized gains and losses were recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income, net of deferred taxes, on the balance sheet.
Our cash flow hedging activities utilize foreign exchange forward contracts to reduce the risk that movements in exchange rates will adversely affect the net cash flows resulting from the planned purchase of products from foreign suppliers.
Changes in the fair value of derivatives designated as cash flow hedges are not recognized in current operating results, but are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income.
Our derivative instruments are recorded in the Consolidated Balance Sheets at their fair values.
We establish reserves for estimated excess, obsolete, or unmarketable inventory equal to the difference between the cost of the inventory and the estimated fair value of the inventory based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions.
Intangible assets are included in other assets in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets and include intangibles acquired in conjunction with our acquisitions of Bluesocket, Inc. on August 4, 2011, the NSN BBA business on May 4, 2012, CommScope’s active fiber access business on September 13, 2016 and Sumitomo Electric Lightwave Corp.’s North American EPON business and technology license and OEM supply agreement with Sumitomo Electric Industries, Ltd. on March 19, 2018.
Amortization expense, all of which relates to business acquisitions, was $0.4 million and $1.1 million for the three months ended March 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively.
We received proceeds totaling $0.4 million from the exercise of these stock options during the three months ended March 31, 2018.
Other comprehensive income consists of unrealized gains (losses) on available-for-sale securities; unrealized gains (losses) on cash flow hedges; reclassification adjustments for amounts included in net income related to impairments of available-for-sale securities, realized gains (losses) on available-for-sale securities, realized gains (losses) on cash flow hedges, and amortization of actuarial gains (losses) related to our defined benefit plan; defined benefit plan adjustments; and foreign currency translation adjustments.
