During the three months ended June 30, 2019, the Company revised the methodology in how it estimates its excess and obsolete inventory reserves.
During the three months ended June 30, 2019, the Company determined that there was an immaterial misstatement of its excess and obsolete inventory reserves in its previously issued annual and interim financial statements.
The Company corrected this misstatement by recognizing a $0.8 million out-of-period adjustment during the three months ended June 30, 2019, which increased its excess and obsolete inventory reserve and cost of goods sold for the period.
For the six months ended June 30, 2019, the out-of-period adjustment was a cumulative $0.2 million reduction in its excess and obsolete inventory reserve and cost of goods sold.
In addition, the Company determined that a $1.0 million cash inflow related to an insurance recovery was incorrectly classified as a cash flow from operations instead of a cash flow from investing activities within the unaudited Condensed Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows for the three months ended March 31, 2019.
The accompanying Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows for the six months ended June 30, 2019 correctly reflects the $1.0 million insurance recovery as a cash inflow from investing activities.
Additionally, the Company elected the practical expedients which allow the use of hindsight when determining the lease term, the short-term lease recognition exemption and the option to not separate lease and non-lease components.
The adoption of this standard resulted in the recognition of a right-of-use asset and corresponding right-of-use liability on our Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet of $10.3 million, primarily related to our operating leases for office space, automobiles and other equipment.
Contingent liabilities with a fair value totaling $1.2 million were recognized at the acquisition date, the payments of which were dependent upon SmartRG achieving future revenue, EBIT or customer purchase order milestones during the first half of 2019.
We recorded goodwill of $3.5 million as a result of this acquisition, which represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of net assets acquired.
For the three and six months ended June 30, 2019, we incurred amortization of acquired intangibles of $0.6 million and $1.2 million, respectively, related to the SmartRG acquisition.
No acquisition-related expenses were incurred during the three and six months ended June 30, 2018 related to the SmartRG acquisition.

Of the outstanding unearned revenue balance at December 31, 2018, $3.6 million and $10.5 million was recognized as revenue during the three and six months ended June 30, 2019, respectively.
The decrease in the effective tax rate between the two periods was primarily driven by the shift to profitability in the six months ended June 30, 2019, with tax expense being offset by a 29.1% rate reduction related to a transfer pricing study completed during the second quarter of 2019 that resulted in the assignment of operating expenditures to specific company locations, and the effective income tax rates among the respective jurisdictions.
At June 30, 2019, total unrecognized compensation expense related to non-vested stock options was approximately $0.3 million, which is expected to be recognized over an average remaining recognition period of 0.4 years.
All of the options above were issued at exercise prices that approximated fair market value at the date of grant.
The aggregate intrinsic value of stock options represents the total pre-tax intrinsic value (the difference between ADTRAN’s closing stock price on the last trading day of the quarter and the exercise price, multiplied by the number of in-the-money options) that would have been received by the option holders had all option holders exercised their options on June 30, 2019.
The amount of aggregate intrinsic value will change based on the fair market value of ADTRAN’s stock and was zero as of June 30, 2019.
The total pre-tax intrinsic value of options exercised during the six months ended June 30, 2019 was $0.1 million.
There were no stock options granted during the three and six months ended June 30, 2019 or 2018.
At June 30, 2019, total unrecognized compensation expense related to the non-vested portion of market-based PSUs, RSUs and restricted stock was approximately $14.2 million, which is expected to be recognized over an average remaining recognition period of 2.6 years.
In addition, there was $8.3 million of unrecognized compensation expense related to unvested 2017 performance-based PSUs, which will be recognized over the remaining requisite service period of 0.5 years if achievement of the performance obligation becomes probable.
For the three and six months ending June 30, 2019 and 2018, no compensation expense was recognized related to these 2017 performance-based PSUs.
At June 30, 2019, 2.6 million stock options, PSUs, RSUs or restricted stock were available for grant under shareholder-approved equity plans.
ASU 2016-01 also provides a measurement alternative for equity investments that do not have a readily determinable fair value in which investments can be recorded at cost less impairment, if any, adjusted for observable price changes for an identical or similar investment.
As of December 31, 2018, the Company had a note receivable of approximately $4.3 million, which was included in other receivables on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet.
The carrying value of this investment under the measurement alternative was $3.4 million as of June 30, 2019.
The remaining amount was converted into a new note receivable, which is included in other receivables on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet and represents a non-cash operating activity.
As of June 30, 2019, our operating leases have remaining lease terms of one month to six years, some of which include options to extend the leases for up to three years, and some of which include options to terminate the leases within three months.
Lease expense related to these short-term leases was $0.1 million and $0.3 million for the three and six months ended June 30, 2019, respectively, and is included in selling, general and administrative expenses on the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income.
Operating lease payments include $1.2 million related to options to extend lease terms that are reasonably certain of being exercised.
Certain renewal options were subsequently determined to not be reasonably assured of renewal upon the Company’s adoption of the new lease accounting standard on January 1, 2019.
For the three months ended June 30, 2019 and 2018, 1.9 million and 5.0 million, respectively, and for the six months ended June 30, 2019 and 2018, 2.3 million and 4.8 million, respectively, stock options were outstanding but were not included in the computation of diluted earnings (loss) per share because the stock options’ exercise prices were greater than the average market price of the common shares, during the applicable periods, therefore making them anti-dilutive under the treasury stock method.
For the three months ended June 30, 2019 and 2018, 15,000 and 0.1 million, respectively, and for both the six months ended June 30, 2019 and 2018, 0.1 million PSUs, RSUs and restricted stock awards were not included in the computation of diluted earnings (loss) per share because the weighted average assumed proceeds per share were greater than the average market price of the common shares, during the applicable periods, therefore making them anti-dilutive under the treasury stock method.
The cumulative amount incurred during the year ended December 31, 2018 related to this restructuring program was $7.3 million, of which $1.0 million and $7.0 million was incurred during the three and six months ended June 30, 2018, respectively.
This lease has an initial term of five years and includes an option to renew for an additional five-year period.
As a result of this agreement, we will record a right-of-use asset and corresponding lease liability of approximately $10.2 million in our Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet during the third quarter of 2019.
