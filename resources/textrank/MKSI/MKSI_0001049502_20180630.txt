Approximately 58% of our net revenues for both the six months ended June 30, 2018 and 2017 were from sales to semiconductor capital equipment manufacturers and semiconductor device manufacturers.
Approximately 42% of our net revenues for both the six months ended June 30, 2018 and 2017 were from other advanced manufacturing applications.
For both six month periods ended June 30, 2018 and 2017, international net revenues accounted for approximately 50% of our total net revenues.
Long-lived assets located in the United States were $132 million and $125 million as of June 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017, respectively, excluding goodwill and intangibles, and long-term tax-related accounts.
Long-lived assets located outside of the United States were $76 million and $78 million as of June 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017, respectively, excluding goodwill and intangibles, and long-term tax-related accounts.
The reported results for the six months ended June 30, 2018 reflect the application of ASC 606 guidance while the reported results for 2017 were prepared under the guidance of ASC 605, Revenue Recognition (ASC 605).
We have recorded a net increase to opening retained earnings of $1.8 million as of January 1, 2018 due to the cumulative impact of adopting ASC 606, with the impact primarily related to its service business and certain custom products.
The impact to revenues for the quarter ended June 30, 2018 was immaterial as a result of applying ASC 606.
Revenue under ASC 606 is recognized when or as obligations under the terms of a contract with our customer has been satisfied and control has transferred to the customer.
The majority of our performance obligations, and associated revenue, are transferred to customers at a point in time, generally upon shipment of a product to the customer or receipt of the product by the customer and without significant judgments.
Extended warranty, service contracts, and repair services, which are transferred to the customer over time, are recorded as revenue as the services are performed.
For repair services, we make an accrual at quarter end based upon historical repair times within our product groups to record revenue based upon the estimated number of days completed to date, which is consistent with ratable recognition.
Contract assets as of January 1 and June 30, 2018 were $3.1 million and $3.3 million, respectively, and included in other current assets.
We periodically enter into contracts with our customers in which a customer may purchase a combination of goods and or services, such as products with installation services or extended warranty obligations.
We then allocate the transaction price to each performance obligation in the contract based on a relative stand-alone selling price charged separately to customers or using an expected cost plus margin method.
We sell separately-priced service contracts and extended warranty contracts related to certain of our products, especially our laser products.
We normally receive payment at the inception of the contract and recognize revenue over the term of the agreement in proportion to the costs expected to be incurred in satisfying the obligations under the contract.
We have elected to use the practical expedient related to disclosing the remaining performance obligations as of June 30, 2018, as the majority have a duration of less than one year.
Product revenues increased $83.7 million and $192.4 million during the three and six months ended June 30, 2018, respectively, compared to the same period in the prior year.
These increases were both primarily attributed to increases in net product revenues from our semiconductor customers of $47.8 million and $104.0 million for the three and six month periods ended June 30, 2018, respectively.
The remainder of the increases were attributed to net product revenues from customers in our other advanced markets of $35.9 million and $88.4 million for the three and six months ended June 30, 2018, respectively, primarily from our industrial technologies market.
Service revenues consisted mainly of fees for services related to the maintenance and repair of our products, sales of spare parts, and installation and training.
In 2018, we started to record the sales of spare parts in our service revenue and related cost of sales line items rather than in our product revenue and related cost of sales line items.
As a result, for the three and six months ended June 30, 2017, we reclassified $5.6 million and $10.6 million, respectively of product revenue for spare parts from product to service revenue.
Service revenues increased $8.7 million and $17.1 million during the three and six months ended June 30, 2018, respectively, compared to the same periods in the prior year.
These increases were primarily attributed to increases in net service revenues from our semiconductor customers of $6.1 million and $14.9 million for the three and six month periods ended June 30, 2018, respectively.
The remainder of the increases were attributed to net service revenues from customers in our other advanced markets of $2.6 million and $2.2 million for the three and six months ended June 30, 2018, respectively, primarily from our industrial technologies market.
Total international net revenues, including product and service, were $291.3 million and $568.9 million for the three and six months ended June 30, 2018, respectively, compared to $236.1 million and $455.2 million for the three and six months ended June 30, 2017, respectively.
The increases of $55.2 million and $113.7 million in total international net revenues for the three and six months ended June 30, 2018, respectively, compared to the same period in the prior year, were due to increases in net revenues in Japan, Germany, South Korea and China.
Gross profit as a percentage of net product revenues increased by 1.8 percentage points and 1.1 percentage points for the three and six months ended June 30, 2018, respectively, compared to the same periods in the prior year.

Research and development expenses increased $4.4 million for the six months ended June 30, 2018, compared to the same period in the prior year, primarily due to an increase of $3.3 million in compensation costs and benefits and $1.1 million of project materials, related to increased investment in research and development activities.

Amortization of intangible assets decreased by $0.6 million and $1.9 million during the three and six months ended June 30, 2018, respectively, compared to the same periods in the prior year, due to certain intangible assets becoming fully amortized.
We recorded a $74.9 million gain for the three and six months ended June 30, 2017 on the sale of our Data Analytics Solutions business during the second quarter of 2017.
