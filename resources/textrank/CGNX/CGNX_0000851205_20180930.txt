The Company identifies performance obligations as promises in contracts to transfer distinct goods or services.
Standard products and services that the Company regularly sells separately are accounted for as distinct performance obligations.
These activities are required to fulfill the Company’s promise to transfer the goods and are expensed when revenue is recognized.
The Company determines the transaction price as the amount of consideration it expects to receive in exchange for transferring promised goods or services to the customer.
The Company allocates the transaction price to each performance obligation at contract inception based on a relative stand-alone selling price basis, or the price at which the Company would sell the good or service separately to similar customers in similar circumstances.
The Company recognizes revenue when it transfers the promised goods or services to the customer.
Revenue for application-specific customer solutions is recognized at the point in time when the solution is validated, which is the point in time when the Company can objectively determine that the agreed-upon specifications in the contract have been met and the customer will accept the performance obligations in the arrangement.
If the Company can objectively determine that control of a good or service has been transferred to the customer in accordance with the agreed-upon specifications in the contract, then customer acceptance is a formality.
For the Company’s standard products and services, revenue recognition and billing typically occur at the same time.
The Company's contracts have an original expected duration of less than one year, and therefore as a practical expedient, the Company has elected to ignore the impact of the time value of money on a contract and to expense sales commissions.
The Company recognizes an asset for costs to fulfill a contract if the costs relate directly to the contract and to future performance, and the costs are expected to be recovered.
Such judgments include, but are not limited to, assessing the customer’s ability and intention to pay substantially all of the contract consideration when due, determining when two or more contracts should be combined and accounted for as a single contract, determining whether a contract modification has occurred, assessing whether promises are immaterial in the context of the contract, determining whether material promises in a contract represent distinct performance obligations, estimating the transaction price for a contract that contains variable consideration, determining the stand-alone selling price of each performance obligation, determining whether control is transferred over time or at a point in time for performance obligations, and assessing whether formal customer acceptance provisions are substantive.

On January 1, 2018, the Company adopted Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 606, "Revenue from Contracts with Customers," using the full retrospective method to present all periods reported on a consistent basis.
In addition, certain of the Company’s product accessory sales, which were reported on a net basis, are now reported on a gross basis as a result of applying the expanded guidance in the new standard related to principal versus agent considerations.
This change results in the Company reporting higher revenue and higher cost of revenue when these sales are reported on a gross basis, although the gross margin dollars do not change.
Furthermore, for arrangements that include customer-specified acceptance criteria, revenue is recognized when the Company can objectively determine that control has been transferred to the customer in accordance with the agreed-upon specifications in the contract, which may occur before formal customer acceptance.
This change primarily impacts revenue recognition for arrangements in the logistics industry where certain customer solutions include installed products and results in earlier recognition of revenue.
Credit losses recognized on accounts receivable were immaterial for the three-month and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2018 and October 1, 2017, respectively.
