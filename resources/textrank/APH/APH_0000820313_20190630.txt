In accordance with the adoption of the Securities and Exchange Commission Final Rule Release No. 33-10532 Disclosure Update and Simplification, the Company’s rollforward of consolidated changes in equity in Note 6 of the accompanying Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for the prior period has been conformed to the current period presentation, presenting both the current quarter and year-to-date, which had no impact on our consolidated results of operations, financial position or cash flows.
Prior to adoption, the Company evaluated Topic 842, including the initial review of any necessary changes to existing processes and systems that would be required to implement this standard, in order to determine its impact on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.
The Company recognized ROU assets and related lease liabilities on our Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets as of January 1, 2019 of approximately $180 related to our operating 
For the three and six months ended June 30, 2019 and 2018, less than 5% of our net sales were recognized over time, where the associated contracts relate to the sale of goods with no alternative use as they are only sold to a single customer and whose underlying contract terms provide the Company with an enforceable right to payment, including a reasonable profit margin, for performance completed to date, in the event of customer termination.
Since we typically invoice our customers at the same time that we satisfy our performance obligations, contract assets and contract liabilities recorded in the Company’s Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets were not significant as of June 30, 2019 and December 31, 2018.
The Company evaluates the performance of business units on, among other things, profit or loss from operations before interest, headquarters’ expense allocations, stock-based compensation expense, income taxes, amortization related to certain intangible assets and nonrecurring gains and losses.
On April 24, 2018, the Company’s Board of Directors authorized a stock repurchase program under which the Company may purchase up to $2,000.0 of the Company’s Common Stock during the three-year period ending April 24, 2021 (the “2018 Stock Repurchase Program”) in accordance with the requirements of Rule 10b-18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”).
During the three and six months ended June 30, 2019, the Company repurchased 2.6 million and 4.4 million shares of its Common Stock for $248.7 and $408.7, respectively, under the 2018 Stock Repurchase Program.

During the three months ended March 31, 2018, the Company repurchased 4.2 million shares of its Common Stock for $382.0 under the 2017 Stock Repurchase Program, bringing total repurchases under this program to 12.6 million shares or $1,000.0, thus completing the 2017 Stock Repurchase Program.
These repurchases in the first quarter of 2018, coupled with the Company’s repurchase of 3.1 million shares of its Common Stock for $263.4 under the 2018 Stock Repurchase Program during the three months ended June 30, 2018, resulted in total repurchases of 7.3 million shares for $645.4 during the six months ended June 30, 2018.
For the six months ended June 30, 2019 and 2018, the Company’s income before income taxes was reduced for stock-based compensation expense of $29.8 and $26.0, respectively.

During the first six months of 2019, the Company completed five acquisitions (including SSI) for $756.2, net of cash acquired.
The increase in goodwill, net of foreign currency translation, during the first six months of 2019 is due to the Company’s acquisitions during the first half of 2019.
Amortization expense during the three and six months ended June 30, 2019 includes $3.2 and $15.7, respectively, related to the amortization of acquired backlog, primarily related to the SSI acquisition.
As of June 30, 2019, amortization expense relating to the Company’s current intangible assets estimated for the remainder of 2019 is approximately $25.6 and for each of the next five fiscal years is approximately $46.8 in 2020, $42.1 in 2021, $34.8 in 2022, $32.0 in 2023 and $28.5 in 2024.

The Company’s 2.20% Senior Notes are due in April 2020 and are therefore recorded, net of the related unamortized discount and debt issuance costs, within Current portion of long-term debt in the accompanying Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets as of June 30, 2019.
At June 30, 2019, the Company was in compliance with the financial covenants under its U.S. Senior Notes.

Net sales were $2,015.3 in the second quarter of 2019 compared to $1,981.4 in the second quarter of 2018, which represented an increase of 2% in U.S. dollars and 4% in constant currencies, and a decrease of 1% organically over the same respective prior year period.
Net sales were $3,973.8 in the first six months of 2019 compared to $3,848.3 in the first six months of 2018, which represented an increase of 3% in U.S. dollars, 6% in constant currencies and 2% organically over the same respective prior year period.
Net sales in the Interconnect Products and Assemblies segment (approximately 96% of net sales) in the second quarter of 2019 increased 3% in U.S. dollars and 5% in constant currencies, with flat organic growth, compared to the second quarter of 2018.
The sales growth in the second quarter of 2019 relative to the same period of 2018 was driven by contributions from the Company’s acquisition program, with growth in the military, commercial aerospace, mobile networks and mobile devices markets, offset in part by moderations in the broadband, industrial, and information technology and data communications markets.
Net sales in the Interconnect Products and Assemblies segment (approximately 95% of net sales) in the first six months of 2019 increased 4% in U.S. dollars, 6% in constant currencies and 2% organically, compared to the first six months of 2018.
The sales growth for the first six months of 2019 relative to the same period of 2018 was driven by growth in the military, commercial aerospace, mobile networks, information technology and data communications, and industrial markets including contributions from the Company’s acquisition program, offset in part by moderations in the broadband, mobile devices and automotive markets.
Net sales in the Cable Products and Solutions segment (approximately 5% of net sales) in the first six months of 2019 decreased 11% in U.S. dollars, 8% in constant currencies and 8% organically, compared to the first six months of 2018.
The comparatively stronger U.S. dollar for the second quarter and first six months of 2019 had the effect of decreasing sales by approximately $41.9 and $88.6, respectively, compared to the same respective periods in 2018.
Operating income for the second quarter of 2019 included $8.9 of acquisition-related expenses (separately presented in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income) comprised primarily of external transaction costs of $5.7, as well as the amortization of $3.2 related to the value associated with acquired backlog from an acquisition which closed in the second quarter of 2019.
Operating income for the first six months of 2019 included $25.4 of acquisition-related expenses (separately presented in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income) comprised of the amortization of $15.7 related to the value associated with acquired backlog from two acquisitions, as well as external transaction costs of $9.7.
For the three and six months ended June 30, 2019, these acquisition-related expenses had the effect of decreasing net income by $7.8 or $0.03 per share and $21.0 or $0.07 per share, respectively.
Excluding the effect of these acquisition-related expenses, Adjusted Operating Income and Adjusted Operating Margin, as defined in the “Non-GAAP Financial Measures” section below, was $408.4 or 20.3% of net sales and $801.1 or 20.2% of net sales for the three and six months ended June 30, 2019, respectively.
Operating income for the Interconnect Products and Assemblies segment for the second quarter and first six months of 2019 was $428.4 or 22.2% of net sales and $838.5 or 22.1% of net sales, respectively, compared to $419.7 or 22.4% and $810.9 or 22.3% of net sales for the second quarter and first six months of 2018, respectively.
The slight decrease in operating margin for the Interconnect Products and Assemblies segment for the second quarter and first six months of 2019, compared to the same respective periods in 2018, was primarily driven by the impact of recent acquisitions which currently have, on average, a lower operating margin than the average of the Interconnect Products and Assemblies segment for such periods.
Operating income for the Cable Products and Solutions segment for the second quarter and first six months of 2019 was $8.7 or 9.7% of net sales and $19.1 or 10.3% of net sales, respectively, compared to $14.7 or 13.2% of net sales and $26.0 or 12.5% of net sales for the second quarter and first six months of 2018, respectively.
The decrease in operating margin for the Cable Products and Solutions segment for the second quarter and first six months of 2019, compared to the same respective periods in 2018, was primarily driven by lower volumes and product mix.
For the second quarter and first six months of 2019 and 2018, the excess tax benefits resulting from stock option exercise activity had the impact of lowering the effective tax rate and increasing earnings per share by the amounts noted in the tables below.
The effective tax rate for the second quarter and first six months of 2019 was further impacted by the tax effect of acquisition-related expenses during such periods of 2019, as noted in the tables below.
Excluding the effect of these items, the Adjusted Effective Tax Rate, a non-GAAP financial measure as defined in the “Non-GAAP Financial Measures” section below within this Item 2, for the three and six months ended June 30, 2019 was 24.5%, and for the three and six months ended June 30, 2018 was 25.5%, as reconciled in the tables below to the comparable effective tax rate based on GAAP results.
Excluding the effect of the excess tax benefits related to stock-based compensation and acquisition-related expenses discussed above, Adjusted Net Income attributable to Amphenol Corporation and Adjusted Diluted EPS were $557.3 and $1.81, respectively, for the first six months of 2019, compared to $543.3 and $1.73, respectively, for the first six months of 2018.
At June 30, 2019 and December 31, 2018, the Company had cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments of $997.3 and $1,291.7, respectively.
The Company’s primary sources of liquidity are internally generated cash flow, our cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments on hand, the Commercial Paper Programs, and the 2019 Revolving Credit Facility.
The Company believes that its cash, cash equivalents and short-term investment position on hand, ability to generate future cash flow from operations, availability under its credit facilities, and access to capital markets (including the issuance of the 2029 Senior Notes in January 2019, discussed further within this Item 2) provide adequate liquidity to meet its obligations for at least the next twelve months.
The Company’s primary ongoing cash requirements will be for operating and capital expenditures, product development activities, repurchases of its Common Stock, dividends, debt service, payments associated with the Transition Tax (which is payable in annual installments until 2025), taxes due upon the repatriation of foreign earnings (which will be payable upon the repatriation of such earnings), and funding of pension obligations.
The Company’s debt service requirements consist primarily of principal and interest on the Company’s Senior Notes, the 2019 Revolving Credit Facility and the Commercial Paper Programs (all as defined below).

In the first six months of 2019, the components of working capital as presented on the accompanying Condensed Consolidated Statements of Cash Flow increased $66.6, excluding the impact of acquisitions and foreign currency translation, primarily due to decreases in accrued liabilities, including income taxes, of $124.6 and accounts payable of $107.0, partially offset by decreases in accounts receivable of $157.9 and inventories of $13.1.
In the first six months of 2018, the components of working capital as presented on the accompanying Condensed Consolidated Statements of Cash Flow increased $185.5, excluding the impact of acquisitions and foreign currency translation, primarily due to an increase in inventories of $80.0, accounts receivable of $44.5 and other current assets of $29.8, as well as a decrease in accrued liabilities, including income taxes, of $44.8, partially offset by an increase in accounts payable of $13.6.
Accounts receivable decreased $106.8 to $1,685.0, primarily due to lower sales, partially offset by the impact of acquisitions, as well as the effect of translation from exchange rate changes at June 30, 2019 compared to December 31, 2018 (“Translation”).
Intangibles, net and other long-term assets increased $241.5 to $735.8, primarily due to (i) the adoption of the new lease standard (“Topic 842”) described in Note 15 of the accompanying Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements, which resulted in the recognition of $178.9 of operating lease right-of-use assets as of June 30, 2019 and (ii) the recognition of certain intangible assets related to the SSI acquisition and other 2019 acquisitions, partially offset by (iii) the amortization of $40.4 related to the Company’s intangible assets during the six months ended June 30, 2019.
Total accrued expenses, including accrued income taxes, increased $38.7 to $835.2, primarily as a result of the adoption of Topic 842, which resulted in the recognition of $58.6 of current operating lease liabilities as of June 30, 2019, and the impact of acquisitions, partially offset by certain tax payments.
Other long-term liabilities increased $90.9 to $623.7, primarily as a result of the adoption of Topic 842, which resulted in the recognition of approximately $121.7 of long-term operating lease liabilities as of June 30, 2019, partially offset by a decrease in deferred income tax liabilities.
There is no current requirement for cash contributions to any of the U.S. Plans, and the Company plans to evaluate annually, based on actuarial calculations and the investment performance of the Plans’ assets, the timing and amount of cash contributions in the future.
In the first quarter of 2018, the Company made a voluntary cash contribution to fund the Company’s U.S. Plans of approximately $81.0.
The following table reconciles Free Cash Flow to its most directly comparable U.S. GAAP financial measure for the six months ended June 30, 2019 and 2018.
Cash flows from financing activities consist primarily of cash flows associated with borrowings and repayments of the Company’s credit facilities and other long-term debt, repurchases of common stock, proceeds from stock option exercises, dividend payments, and distributions to and purchases of noncontrolling interests.
The Company’s debt financing includes the use of commercial paper programs, revolving credit facility and senior notes as part of its overall cash management strategy.
At June 30, 2019, the Company was in compliance with the financial covenants under the Revolving Credit Facility.

In January 2019, the Company issued $500.0 principal amount of 4.350% Senior Notes due June 1, 2029 at 99.904% of face value, the net proceeds of which were used, along with proceeds from borrowings under the U.S. Commercial Paper Program, to repay the $750.0 of the Company’s 2.55% Senior Notes due in January 2019.
The Company used a portion of the net proceeds from the 2028 Euro Notes to repay a portion of the outstanding amounts under its Commercial Paper Programs, with the remainder of the net proceeds being used for general corporate purposes.

These repurchases in the first quarter of 2018, coupled with the Company’s repurchase of 3.1 million shares of its Common Stock for $263.4 under the 2018 Stock Repurchase Program during the three months ended June 30, 2018, resulted in total repurchases of 7.3 million shares for $645.4 during the six months ended June 30, 2018.
