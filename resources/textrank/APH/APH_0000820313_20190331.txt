Prior to adoption, the Company evaluated Topic 842, including the initial review of any necessary changes to existing processes and systems that would be required to implement this standard, in order to determine its impact on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.
The Company recognized ROU assets and related lease liabilities on our Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets as of January 1, 2019 of approximately $180 related to our operating lease commitments, and there was no cumulative impact on retained earnings as of January 1, 2019.
Going forward, the impact of Topic 842 on the Company’s consolidated financial statements will be dependent upon the Company’s lease portfolio.
For the three months ended March 31, 2019 and 2018, less than 5% of our net sales are recognized over time, as the associated contracts relate to the sale of goods with no alternative use as they are only sold to a single customer and whose underlying contract terms provide the Company with an enforceable right to payment, including a reasonable profit margin, for performance completed to date, in the event of customer termination.
Since we typically invoice our customers at the same time that we satisfy our performance obligations, contract assets and contract liabilities recorded in the Company’s Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets were not significant as of March 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018.
While the Company typically offers standard product warranty coverage which provides assurance that our products will conform to the contractually agreed-upon specifications for a limited period from the date of shipment, the Company’s warranty liabilities and related warranty expense have not been and were not material in the accompanying Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements as of March 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018, and for the three months ended March 31, 2019 and 2018.
The accounting policies of the segments are the same as those for the Company as a whole and are described herein and in Note 1 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements in the Company’s 2018 Annual Report.

During the three months ended March 31, 2018, the Company repurchased 4.2 million shares of its Common Stock for $382.0 under the 2017 Stock Repurchase Program, bringing total repurchases under this program to approximately 12.6 million shares or $1,000.0, thus completing the 2017 Stock Repurchase Program.

In January 2019, pursuant to a definitive agreement entered into on November 27, 2018, the Company acquired SSI Controls Technologies (“SSI”), the sensor manufacturing division of SSI Technologies, Inc., for approximately $397, net of cash acquired (subject to customary post-closing adjustments), plus a performance-related contingent payment.
As of March 31, 2019, amortization expense relating to the Company’s current intangible assets estimated for the remainder of 2019 is approximately $35.1 and for each of the next five fiscal years is approximately $41.8 in 2020, $37.1 in 2021, $29.7 in 2022, $27.0 in 2023 and $23.9 in 2024.

“Commercial Paper Programs”) pursuant to which the Euro Issuer may issue short-term unsecured commercial paper notes (the “ECP Notes” and, together with the USCP Notes, “Commercial Paper”), which are guaranteed by the Company and are to be issued outside of the United States.
The Company may, at its option, redeem some or all of any series of U.S. Senior Notes at any time subject to certain terms and conditions, which include paying 100% of the principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the date of repurchase and, with certain exceptions, a make-whole premium.

The Company’s real estate leases, which are comprised primarily of manufacturing facilities, warehouses and sales offices, represent the vast majority of our operating lease liabilities and generally have a lease term between 2 and 12 years.
non-components, are included in the measurement of the Company’s lease liabilities to the extent that such payments are either fixed amounts or variable amounts based on a rate or index (fixed in substance) as stipulated in the lease contract.
Some of our lease agreements, primarily related to real estate, include options for the Company to either renew (extend) or early terminate the lease.
When determining if a renewal option is reasonably certain of being exercised, the Company considers several factors, including but not limited to, the significance of leasehold improvements incurred on the property, whether the asset is difficult to replace, or specific characteristics unique to the particular lease that would make it reasonably certain that we would exercise such option.
In most cases, the Company has concluded that renewal and early termination options are not reasonably certain of being exercised by the Company (and thus not included in our ROU asset and lease liability) unless there is an economic, financial or business reason to do so.
The Company records its finance leases within Property, plant and equipment, Current portion of long-term debt and Long-term debt on the accompanying Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets.
The Company’s finance leases and related depreciation and interest expense, cash flows and impact on the Company’s condensed consolidated financial statements were not material individually or in the aggregate as of and for the three months ended March 31, 2019.
Net sales were $1,958.5 in the first quarter of 2019 compared to $1,866.9 in the first quarter of 2018, which represented an increase of 5% in U.S. dollars, 8% in constant currencies and 5% organically over the same respective prior year period.
The sales growth was driven by increases in the information technology and data communications, industrial, military, commercial aerospace and mobile networks markets, arising primarily from organic growth along with contributions from the Company’s acquisitions, which was partially offset by a decrease in the mobile device market and a small decrease in the automotive market.
Net sales in the Cable Products and Solutions segment (approximately 5% of net sales) in the first quarter of 2019, which primarily serves the broadband market, decreased 1% in U.S. dollars, while increasing 2% in constant currencies and 2% organically, compared to the first quarter of 2018.
(1)    Net sales growth in U.S. dollars is calculated based on Net sales as reported in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income and Note 5 of the accompanying financial statements.
(4)    Acquisition impact, a non-GAAP measure, represents the impact on net sales resulting from acquisitions closed since the beginning of the prior calendar year, which were not included in the Company’s results as of the comparable prior year periods and which do not reflect the underlying growth of the Company on a comparative basis.
Operating income for the first three months of 2019 included $16.5 of acquisition-related expenses (separately presented in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income) comprised of the amortization of $12.5 related to the value associated with acquired backlog from the SSI acquisition, as well as external transaction costs of $4.0.
Excluding the effect of these acquisition-related expenses, Adjusted Operating Income and Adjusted Operating Margin, as defined in the “Non-GAAP Financial Measures” section below, was $392.7 or 20.1% of net sales for the three months ended March 31, 2019.
The increase in interest expense is primarily due to higher average debt levels, along with higher average interest rates on the Company’s U.S. commercial paper borrowings as well as the new 4.350% U.S. Senior Notes issuance in January 2019.
The borrowings under the U.S. Commercial Paper Program and net proceeds from the 4.350% U.S. Senior Notes were used to repay the Company’s 2.55% U.S. Senior Notes in January 2019.
For the first quarter of 2019 and 2018, the excess tax benefits resulting from stock option exercise activity had the impact of lowering the effective tax rate and increasing earnings per share by the amounts noted in the table below.
Excluding the effect of these items, the Adjusted Effective Tax Rate, a non-GAAP financial measure as defined in the “Non-GAAP Financial Measures” section below within this Item 2, for the three months ended March 31, 2019 and 2018 was 24.5% and 25.5%, respectively, as reconciled in the tables below to the comparable effective tax rate based on GAAP results.
At March 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018, the Company had cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments of $987.6 and $1,291.7, respectively.
The majority of the Company’s cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments on hand as of December 31, 2018 and March 31, 2019 is located outside of the United States.
The Company’s primary sources of liquidity are internally generated cash flow, our cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments on hand, the Commercial Paper Programs, and the 2019 Revolving Credit Facility.
The Company believes that its cash, cash equivalents and short-term investment position on hand, ability to generate future cash flow from operations, availability under its credit facilities, and access to capital markets (including the recent issuance of the 2029 Senior Notes in January 2019, discussed further within this Item 2) provide adequate liquidity to meet its obligations for the next twelve months.
The Company’s primary ongoing cash requirements will be for operating and capital expenditures, product development activities, repurchases of its Common Stock, dividends, debt service, payments associated with the Transition Tax (which is payable in annual installments until 2025), taxes due upon the repatriation of foreign earnings (which will be payable upon the repatriation of such earnings), and funding of pension obligations.
The Company’s debt service requirements consist primarily of principal and interest on the Company’s Senior Notes, the 2019 Revolving Credit Facility and the Commercial Paper Programs (all as defined below).
In the first three months of 2019, the components of working capital as presented on the accompanying Condensed Consolidated Statements of Cash Flow increased $22.7, excluding the impact of acquisitions and foreign currency translation, primarily due to decreases in accounts payable of $113.4 and accrued liabilities, including income taxes, of $91.3, partially offset by decreases in accounts receivable of $160.8 and inventories of $31.7.
In the first three months of 2018, the components of working capital as presented on the accompanying Condensed Consolidated Statements of Cash Flow increased $133.3, excluding the impact of acquisitions and foreign currency translation, primarily due to a decrease in accounts payable and accrued liabilities of $99.3 and $65.5, respectively, and an increase in inventories of $55.8, partially offset by a decrease in accounts receivable of $118.3.
Accounts receivable decreased $129.9 to $1,661.9, primarily due to lower sales in the first quarter of 2019 relative to the fourth quarter of 2018, partially offset by the effect of translation from exchange rate changes at March 31, 2019 compared to December 31, 2018 (“Translation”) and the impact of the SSI acquisition in the Interconnect Products and Assemblies segment that 
Intangibles, net and other long-term assets increased $214.4 to $708.7, primarily due to (i) the adoption of the new lease standard (“Topic 842”) described in Note 15 of the accompanying Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements, which resulted in the recognition of $179.6 of operating lease right-of-use assets as of March 31, 2019 and (ii) the recognition of certain intangible assets related to the SSI acquisition, partially offset by (iii) the amortization of $24.8 related to the Company’s intangible assets.
Total accrued expenses, including accrued income taxes, increased $49.6 to $846.1, primarily as a result of the adoption of Topic 842, which resulted in the recognition of $62.7 of current operating lease liabilities as of March 31, 2019, which was partially offset by certain tax payments.
Other long-term liabilities increased $114.6 to $391.8, primarily as a result of the adoption of Topic 842, which resulted in the recognition of approximately $117.4 of long-term operating lease liabilities as of March 31, 2019.
There is no current requirement for cash contributions to any of the U.S. Plans, and the Company plans to evaluate annually, based on actuarial calculations and the investment performance of the Plans’ assets, the timing and amount of cash contributions in the future.
In the first quarter of 2018, the Company made a voluntary cash contribution to fund the Company’s U.S. Plans of approximately $81.0.
In addition to cash flow from operating activities, the Company also considers Free Cash Flow, a non-GAAP financial measure defined in the “Non-GAAP Financial Measures” section below, as a key metric in measuring the Company’s ability to generate cash.
Cash flows from investing activities consist primarily of cash flows associated with capital expenditures, proceeds from disposals of property, plant and equipment, net sales and maturities (purchases) of short-term investments, and acquisitions.
In the first quarter of 2018, net cash used in investing activities was driven primarily by the use of $99.5 in cash to fund acquisitions, along with capital expenditures (net of disposals) of $54.1, partially offset by net sales and maturities of short-term investments of $11.3.
Cash flows from financing activities consist primarily of cash flows associated with borrowings and repayments of the Company’s credit facilities and other long-term debt, repurchases of common stock, proceeds from stock option exercises, dividend payments and purchases of and distributions to shareholders of noncontrolling interests.
The Company’s debt financing includes the use of commercial paper programs, revolving credit facility and senior notes as part of its overall cash management strategy.
At March 31, 2019, the Company was in compliance with the financial covenants under the Revolving Credit Facility.
Pursuant to the terms of the U.S. commercial paper program, the Company issues short-term unsecured commercial paper notes in one or more private placements in the United States (the “U.S. Commercial Paper Program”).

The Company may, at its option, redeem some or all of any series of U.S. Senior Notes, subject to certain terms and conditions.
In January 2019, the Company issued $500.0 principal amount of 4.350% Senior Notes due June 1, 2029, the net proceeds of which were used, along with proceeds from borrowings under the U.S. Commercial Paper Program, to repay the $750.0 of the Company’s 2.55% Senior Notes due in January 2019.
The Company may, at its option, redeem some or all of the 2028 Euro Notes at any time by paying 100% of the principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the date of repurchase, and if redeemed prior to July 8, 2028, a make-whole premium.
The Company used a portion of the net proceeds from the 2028 Euro Notes to repay a portion of the outstanding amounts under its Commercial Paper Programs, with the remainder of the net proceeds being used for general corporate purposes.
The Company’s Senior Notes contain certain financial and non-financial covenants.

In addition, any borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility either bear interest at or trade at rates that fluctuate with a spread over LIBOR, while any borrowings under the Commercial Paper Programs are subject to floating interest rates.
Therefore, when the Company borrows under these debt instruments, the Company is exposed to market risk from exposure to changes in interest rates.
As of March 31, 2019, there were no outstanding borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility, while borrowings under the U.S. Commercial Paper Program and Euro Commercial Paper Program were at an average floating rate of 2.64% and (0.10)%, respectively.
