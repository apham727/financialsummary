Under this transition method, the Company’s results in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2018 are presented under Topic 606, while the comparative results for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2017 were not retrospectively adjusted, as such results were recognized in accordance with the revenue recognition policy discussed under Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in Note 1 of the Company’s 2017 Annual Report.
Effective January 1, 2018, the Company adopted Topic 606 using the modified retrospective transition method, resulting in accounting policy changes surrounding revenue recognition which replaced certain related policies discussed under Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates (in Item 7) and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (in Note 1) of the Company’s 2017 Annual Report.
The adoption of Topic 606 did not have a material impact on the Company’s condensed consolidated financial statements.
Less than 5% of our net sales are recognized over time, as the associated contracts relate to the sale of goods with no alternative use as they are only sold to a single customer and whose underlying contract terms provide the Company with an enforceable right to payment, including a reasonable profit margin, for performance completed to date, in the event of customer termination.
Sales to certain distributors and resellers are made under terms allowing certain price adjustments and limited rights of return of the Company’s products held in their inventory or upon sale to their end customers.
Warranty liabilities and related warranty expense have not been and were not significant in the accompanying Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements as of and for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2018.
As the Company’s performance obligations are typically less than one year, these amounts are generally recorded as current in the accompanying Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets within Other current assets or Other accrued expenses as of September 30, 2018.
Contract assets and contract liabilities recorded in the Company’s Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets were not significant both at the date of adoption and as of September 30, 2018.
The accounting policies of the segments are the same as those for the Company as a whole and are described herein and in Note 1 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements in the Company’s 2017 Annual Report.

On January 24, 2017, the Company’s Board of Directors authorized a stock repurchase program under which the Company could purchase up to $1,000.0 of the Company’s Common Stock during the two-year period ending January 24, 2019 in accordance with the requirements of Rule 10b-18 of the Exchange Act (the “2017 Stock Repurchase Program”).
On April 24, 2018, the Company’s Board of Directors authorized a new stock repurchase program under which the Company may purchase up to $2,000.0 of the Company’s Common Stock during the three-year period ending April 24, 2021 in accordance with the requirements of Rule 10b-18 of the Exchange Act (the “2018 Stock Repurchase Program”).
During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2018, the Company repurchased 0.4 million and 3.5 million shares of its common stock for $34.8 and $298.2, respectively, under the 2018 Stock Repurchase Program.
The price and timing of any future purchases under the 2018 Stock Repurchase Program will depend on factors such as levels of cash generation from operations, the volume of stock option exercises by employees, cash requirements for acquisitions, dividends, economic and market conditions and stock price.
The Company believes that its operations are currently in substantial compliance with applicable environmental laws and regulations and that the costs of continuing compliance will not have a material adverse effect on the Company’s financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.
For the three months ended September 30, 2018 and 2017, the Company’s income before income taxes was reduced for stock-based compensation expense of $14.4 and $12.6, respectively.
In addition, for the three months ended September 30, 2018 and 2017, the Company recognized aggregate income tax benefits associated with stock-based compensation of $8.9 and $19.5, respectively, in the provision for income taxes in the accompanying Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income, which include the excess tax benefits from option exercises of $7.0 and $16.6, respectively.

The impact associated with recognizing excess tax benefits from option exercises in the provision for income taxes on our consolidated financial statements could result in significant fluctuations in our effective tax rate in the future, since the provision for income taxes will be impacted by the timing and intrinsic value of future stock-based compensation award exercises.
The grant-date fair value of each share grant is determined based on the closing share price of the Company’s Common Stock on the date of the grant.
As a result of the adoption of ASU 2017‑07, the Company records service costs in the same line item as the respective employee compensation costs and within operating income, while all other pension-related costs including interest cost, expected return on plan assets, amortization of prior service cost and amortization of net actuarial losses are reported separately within Other income, net in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income.
In January 2018, the Company made a voluntary cash contribution of approximately $81.0 to fully fund the U.S. Plans, and estimates that, based on current actuarial calculations, cash contributions to the Plans will aggregate approximately $90.0 in 2018.
The Company offers various defined contribution plans for certain U.S. and foreign employees.
During the nine months ended September 30, 2018 and 2017, the Company provided matching contributions to the U.S. defined contribution plans of approximately $6.2 and $5.0, respectively.
During the third quarter, the Company determined that it was more likely than not that the fair value of its reporting units exceeded their respective carrying amounts and therefore, a quantitative assessment was not required.
As of September 30, 2018, amortization expense relating to the Company’s current intangible assets estimated for the remainder of 2018 is approximately $11.5 and for each of the next five fiscal years is approximately $42.7 in 2019, $37.1 in 2020, $32.4 in 2021, $24.9 in 2022 and $22.2 in 2023.
Based on our qualitative assessment, the Company determined that it was more likely than not that the fair value of the indefinite-lived intangible assets exceeded their respective carrying amounts.
On July 10, 2018, the Company and one of its wholly owned European subsidiaries (the “Euro Issuer”) entered into a euro-commercial paper program (the “Euro Commercial Paper Program” and, together with the U.S. Commercial Paper Program, the “Commercial Paper Programs”) pursuant to which the Euro Issuer may issue short-term unsecured commercial paper notes (the “ECP Notes” and, together with the USCP Notes, “Commercial Paper”), which are guaranteed by the Company and are to be issued outside of the United States.
The Company may, at its option, redeem some or all of any series of U.S. Senior Notes at any time subject to certain terms and conditions, which include paying 100% of the principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the date of repurchase and, with certain exceptions, a make-whole premium.
The 2.55% Senior Notes are due in January 2019 and are therefore recorded, net of the related unamortized discount and debt issuance costs, within Current portion of long-term debt in the accompanying Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets as of September 30, 2018.
At September 30, 2018, the Company was in compliance with the financial covenants under its U.S. Senior Notes.
For the three months ended September 30, 2018 and 2017, stock option exercise activity had the impact of lowering our Provision for income taxes by approximately $7.0 and $16.6, respectively, and lowering our effective tax rate by approximately 170 basis points and 470 basis points, respectively, due to the recognition of excess tax benefits within Provision for income taxes in the accompanying Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income.
For the nine months ended September 30, 2018 and 2017, stock option exercise activity had the impact of lowering our Provision for income taxes by approximately $14.1 and $45.8, respectively, and lowering our effective tax rate by approximately 120 basis points and 470 basis points, respectively.
Net sales were $2,129.0 in the third quarter of 2018 compared to $1,840.8 in the third quarter of 2017, which represented an increase of 16% in U.S. dollars, 17% in constant currencies and 15% organically over the same respective prior year period.
Net sales were $5,977.3 in the first nine months of 2018 compared to $5,067.4 in the first nine months of 2017, which represented an increase of 18% in U.S. dollars, 16% in constant currencies and 13% organically over the same respective prior year period.
Net sales in the Interconnect Products and Assemblies segment (approximately 95% of net sales) in the third quarter of 2018 increased 17% in U.S. dollars, 17% in constant currencies and 15% organically, compared to the third quarter of 2017 and in the first nine months of 2018 increased 19% in U.S. dollars, 17% in constant currencies and 14% organically, compared to the first nine months of 2017.
Net sales in the Cable Products and Solutions segment (approximately 5% of net sales) in the third quarter of 2018, which primarily serves the broadband market, was flat in U.S. dollars, and increased 4% in constant currencies and 4% organically, compared to the third quarter of 2017 and in the first nine months of 2018 increased 2% in U.S. dollars, 3% in constant currencies and 3% organically, compared to the same period in 2017.
(1)    Net sales growth in U.S. dollars is calculated based on Net sales as reported in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income and Note 5 of the accompanying financial statements.
(4)    Acquisition impact, a non-GAAP measure, represents the impact on net sales resulting from acquisitions closed since the beginning of the prior calendar year, which were not included in the Company’s results as of the comparable prior year periods and which do not reflect the underlying growth of the Company on a comparative basis.
Operating income for the first nine months of 2017 included $4.0 of acquisition-related expenses (separately presented in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income) related to external transaction costs incurred in the second quarter of 2017.
Excluding the effect of these acquisition-related expenses, Adjusted Operating Income and Adjusted Operating Margin, as defined in the “Non-GAAP Financial Measures” section below, was $1,032.2 or 20.4% of net sales for the nine months ended September 30, 2017.
The increase in the Adjusted Operating Margin for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2018, compared to the same respective periods in 2017, was driven primarily by an increase in operating margin for the Interconnect Products and Assemblies segment.
The increase in operating margin for the Interconnect Products and Assemblies segment for the third quarter and first nine months of 2018, compared to the same respective periods of 2017, resulted primarily from higher sales volumes combined with strong operating execution.
The increase in interest expense for the first nine months of 2018 is primarily due to higher average interest rates associated with the Company’s commercial paper borrowings as well as the senior note issuances in April 2017, along with higher average debt levels used to fund the Company’s dividend and stock buyback programs.
For the third quarter and first nine months of 2018 and 2017, the excess tax benefits resulting from stock option exercise activity had the impact of lowering the effective tax rate and increasing earnings per share by the amounts noted in the table below.
Excluding the effect of these items, the Adjusted Effective Tax Rate, a non-GAAP financial measure as defined in the “Non-GAAP Financial Measures” section below within this Item 2, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2018 was 25.5%, and for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2017 was 26.5%, as reconciled in the tables below to the comparable effective tax rate based on GAAP results.
At September 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017, the Company had cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments of $1,019.8 and $1,753.7, respectively.
As a result, on December 31, 2017, the Company recorded a provisional U.S. tax expense for the Transition Tax. This Transition Tax on the deemed repatriation of the accumulated unremitted earnings and profits of foreign subsidiaries, will be paid, net of applicable tax credits and deductions, in annual installments until 2025, as permitted under the Tax Act. In the second quarter of 2018, the Company paid the first annual installment of the Transition Tax of approximately $18.0.
The increase in cash flow provided by operating activities (“Operating Cash Flow”) for the first nine months of 2018 compared to the first nine months of 2017 is primarily related to an increase in net income in the first nine months of 2018 which was partially offset by (i) the Company’s voluntary cash contribution of approximately $81.0 in the first quarter of 2018 to fully fund its U.S. defined benefit pension plans (“U.S. Plans”, and together with its foreign plans, the “Plans”) and (ii) certain tax payments made during the first nine months of 2018 related to the Tax Act of approximately $61.0, including the first annual installment of the Transition Tax of approximately $18.0 in the second quarter of 2018 and payments for foreign and state withholding and income taxes of approximately $43.0 related to foreign cash repatriated during the first nine months of 2018.
In the first nine months of 2018, the components of working capital as presented on the accompanying Condensed Consolidated Statements of Cash Flow increased $246.4, excluding the impact of acquisitions and foreign currency translation, primarily due to an increase in inventories of $184.2, accounts receivable of $182.5 and other current assets of $61.3, partially offset by increases in accounts payable of $150.8 and accrued liabilities, including income taxes, of $30.8.
In the first nine months of 2017, the components of working capital as presented on the accompanying Condensed Consolidated Statements of Cash Flow increased $252.8, excluding the impact of acquisitions and foreign currency translation, primarily due to increases in accounts receivable, inventories and other current assets of $141.2, $107.4 and $61.9, respectively, partially offset by an increase in accounts payable of $103.4.
Accounts receivable increased $139.0 to $1,737.6, primarily due to higher sales in the third quarter of 2018 relative to the fourth quarter of 2017, which were partially offset by the effect of translation from exchange rate changes at September 30, 2018 compared to December 31, 2017 (“Translation”).
Intangibles, net and other long-term assets decreased $27.5 to $461.0, primarily as a result of amortization related to the Company’s intangible assets.
The Company estimates that, based on current actuarial calculations and including the first quarter contribution to its U.S. Plans, cash contributions to the Plans will aggregate approximately $90.0 in 2018.
In addition to cash flow from operating activities, the Company also considers Free Cash Flow, a non-GAAP financial measure defined in the “Non-GAAP Financial Measures” section below, as a key metric in measuring the Company’s ability to generate cash.
Cash flows from financing activities consist primarily of cash flows associated with borrowings and repayments of the Company’s credit facilities and other long-term debt, repurchases of common stock, proceeds from stock option exercises, dividend payments and purchases of and distributions to shareholders of noncontrolling interests.
For the first nine months of 2018, cash used in financing activities was driven primarily by repurchases of the Company’s common stock of $680.2, net repayments of commercial paper and other debt of $308.8, dividend payments of $184.4, and purchases of and distributions to noncontrolling interests of $17.9, partially offset by cash proceeds from the exercise of stock options of $123.0.
For the first nine months of 2017, cash used in financing activities was driven primarily by repurchases of the Company’s common stock of $555.6, the repayment of the 1.55% Senior Notes in September 2017 of $375.0, dividend payments of $147.1, purchases of and distributions to noncontrolling interests of $22.1, and payments of costs related to the issuances of two senior notes of $5.2, partially 
offset by borrowings related to the issuances of two senior notes in April 2017 of $749.3, net borrowings of commercial paper of $173.6, and cash proceeds from the exercise of stock options of $134.4.
The Company’s debt financing includes the use of commercial paper programs, revolving credit facility and senior notes as part of its overall cash management strategy.
On July 10, 2018, the Company and one of its wholly owned European subsidiaries (the “Euro Issuer”) entered into a euro-commercial paper program (the “Euro Commercial Paper Program” and, together with the U.S. Commercial Paper Program, the “Commercial Paper Programs”) pursuant to which the Euro Issuer may issue short-term unsecured commercial paper notes (the “ECP Notes” and, together with the USCP Notes, the “Commercial Paper”), which are guaranteed by the Company and are to be issued outside of the United States.
The Company may, at its option, redeem some or all of any series of Senior Notes, subject to certain terms and conditions.
The 2.55% Senior Notes are due in January 2019 and are therefore recorded, net of the related unamortized discount and debt issuance costs, within Current portion of long-term debt in the accompanying Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets as of September 30, 2018.

The price and timing of any future purchases under the 2018 Stock Repurchase Program will depend on factors such as levels of cash generation from operations, the volume of stock option exercises by employees, cash requirements for acquisitions, dividends, economic and market conditions and stock price.
The Company’s primary sources of liquidity are internally generated cash flow, the Commercial Paper Programs, the Revolving Credit Facility, and its cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments on hand.
