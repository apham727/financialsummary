For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2019 and 2018, less than 5% of our net sales were recognized over time, where the associated contracts relate to the sale of goods with no alternative use as they are only sold to a single customer and whose underlying contract terms provide the Company with an enforceable right to payment, including a reasonable profit margin, for performance completed to date, in the event of customer termination.

While the Company typically offers standard product warranty coverage which provides assurance that our products will conform to the contractually agreed-upon specifications for a limited period from the date of shipment, the Company’s warranty liabilities as of September 30, 2019 and December 31, 2018, and related warranty expense for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2019 and 2018 have not been and were not material in the accompanying Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements.

Net sales were $6,074.4 in the first nine months of 2019 compared to $5,977.3 in the first nine months of 2018, which represented an increase of 2% in U.S. dollars and 4% in constant currencies, while decreasing 1% organically over the same respective prior year period.
The decline in sales for the third quarter of 2019 relative to the same period of 2018 was driven by moderations in mobile devices, information technology and data communications, broadband communications, and mobile networks markets, offset in part by growth in the military, commercial aerospace, industrial and automotive markets, including contributions from the Company’s acquisition program.
Net sales in the Interconnect Products and Assemblies segment (approximately 95% of net sales) in the first nine months of 2019 increased 2% in U.S. dollars and 4% in constant currencies, while decreasing 1% organically, compared to the first nine months of 2018.
The sales growth in the first nine months of 2019 relative to the same period of 2018 was driven by growth in the military, commercial aerospace, mobile networks, industrial and automotive markets, including contributions from the Company’s acquisition program, offset in part by moderations in the mobile devices, broadband communications, and information technology and data communications markets.
Operating income for the first nine months of 2019 included $25.4 of acquisition-related expenses (separately presented in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income) comprised of the amortization of $15.7 related to the value associated with acquired backlog from two acquisitions, as well as external transaction costs of $9.7.
For the nine months ended September 30, 2019, these acquisition-related expenses had the effect of decreasing net income by $21.0 or $0.07 per share.
Excluding the effect of these acquisition-related expenses, Adjusted Operating Income and Adjusted Operating Margin, as defined in the “Non-GAAP Financial Measures” section below, was $1,214.8 or 20.0% of net sales for the nine months ended September 30, 2019.
The slight decrease in operating margin for the Interconnect Products and Assemblies segment for the third quarter and first nine months of 2019, compared to the same respective periods in 2018, was primarily driven by normal downside conversion related to the organic decline in sales as well as the impact of recent acquisitions which currently have, on average, a lower operating margin than the average of the Interconnect Products and Assemblies segment for such periods.
The loss on early extinguishment of debt incurred during the third quarter of 2019 was related to refinancing-related costs, specifically premiums and fees incurred associated with the early extinguishment of certain redeemed principal amounts of the 3.125% Senior Notes and 4.00% Senior Notes (collectively, the “Tendered Notes”) as a result of the tender offers in September 2019.
For the third quarter and first nine months of 2019 and 2018, the excess tax benefits resulting from stock option exercise activity had the impact of lowering the effective tax rate and increasing earnings per share by the amounts noted in the tables below.
The effective tax rate for the third quarter of 2019 was further impacted by the tax effect of the refinancing-related costs associated with the early extinguishment of debt, while the effective tax rate for the first nine months of 2019 was further impacted by the tax effects of both the acquisition-related expenses and the refinancing-related costs associated with the early extinguishment of debt, all as noted in the tables below.

The Company’s debt service requirements consist primarily of principal and interest on the Company’s Senior Notes, the 2019 Revolving Credit Facility and the Commercial Paper Programs (all as defined below).
In the first nine months of 2019, the components of working capital as presented on the accompanying Condensed Consolidated Statements of Cash Flow increased $27.1, excluding the impact of acquisitions and foreign currency translation, primarily due to decreases in accounts payable of $75.9 and accrued liabilities, including income taxes, of $74.4, partially offset by a decrease in accounts receivable of $129.6.
In the first nine months of 2018, the components of working capital as presented on the accompanying Condensed Consolidated Statements of Cash Flow increased $246.4, excluding the impact of acquisitions and foreign currency translation, primarily due to an increase in inventories of $184.2, accounts receivable of $182.5 and other current assets of $61.3, partially offset by increases in accounts payable of $150.8 and accrued liabilities, including income taxes, of $30.8.
Intangibles, net and other long-term assets increased $241.9 to $736.2, primarily due to (i) the adoption of the new lease standard (“Topic 842”) described in Note 15 of the accompanying Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements, which resulted in the recognition of $185.5 of operating lease right-of-use assets as of September 30, 2019 and (ii) the recognition of certain intangible assets related to the SSI acquisition and other 2019 acquisitions, partially offset by (iii) the amortization of $54.0 related to the Company’s intangible assets during the nine months ended September 30, 2019.
Total accrued expenses, including accrued income taxes, increased $91.7 to $888.2, primarily as a result of the adoption of Topic 842, which resulted in the recognition of $53.6 of current operating lease liabilities as of September 30, 2019, and the impact of acquisitions, partially offset by certain tax payments.
Other long-term liabilities, including deferred taxes, increased $95.7 to $628.5, primarily as a result of the adoption of Topic 842, which resulted in the recognition of $132.9 of long-term operating lease liabilities as of September 30, 2019, partially offset by a decrease in deferred income tax liabilities.
