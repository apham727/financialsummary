At June 30, 2019, total unrecognized compensation expense related to nonvested restricted stock units granted prior to that date was $1.2 billion, which is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 2.1 years.
Since we do not invoice for sales-based royalties estimated and recognized in any given quarter until after the conclusion of that quarter (which is generally the following quarter when such royalties are reported by licensees), revenues recognized from sales-based royalties results in unbilled receivables (included in accounts receivable, net on the consolidated balance sheet).
Adoption of the new accounting guidance had no impact to net cash provided (used) by operating, financing or investing activities on our condensed consolidated statement of cash flows for the nine months ended June 30, 2019.
We adopted the new accounting guidance in the first quarter of fiscal 2019 using the modified retrospective transition method, with the cumulative effect of applying the new accounting guidance recognized as an adjustment to opening retained earnings of $2.6 billion, primarily as the result of establishing a deferred tax asset on the basis difference of certain intellectual property distributed from one of our foreign subsidiaries to a subsidiary in the United States in fiscal 2018.
Therefore, the related deferred tax asset was written-off, resulting in a $2.5 billion charge to income tax expense in the third quarter of fiscal 2019 (Note 3).
Revenues recognized from performance obligations satisfied (or partially satisfied) in previous periods were $4.8 billion and $4.1 billion for the three and nine months ended June 30, 2019, respectively, and primarily related to licensing revenues of $4.7 billion recognized in the third quarter of fiscal 2019 (a portion of which was attributable to the first and second quarters of fiscal 2019) resulting from the settlement with Apple and its contract manufacturers (Note 6), consisting of a payment from Apple and the release of certain of our obligations to pay Apple and the contract manufacturers customer-related liabilities.
Remaining performance obligations, substantially all of which are included in unearned revenues, represent the aggregate amount of the transaction price of certain customer contracts yet to be recognized as revenues as of the end of the reporting period and exclude revenues related to (a) contracts that have an original expected duration of one year or less and (b) sales-based royalties (i.e., future royalty revenues) pursuant to our license agreements.
At June 30, 2019, we had $1.8 billion of remaining performance obligations, of which $129 million, $516 million, $436 million, $429 million and $195 million was expected to be recognized as revenues for the remainder of fiscal 2019 and each of the subsequent four years from fiscal 2020 through 2023, respectively, and $77 million thereafter.
Prior to the adoption of the new accounting guidance in the first quarter of fiscal 2019, investments in non-marketable equity securities were recorded at cost less impairment, if any, with any losses resulting from an impairment recognized in investment and other income, net.
Accounts receivable, trade at September 30, 2018 included approximately $960 million related to the short payment in the second quarter of fiscal 2017 of royalties reported by and deemed collectible from Apple’s contract manufacturers.
In the second quarter of fiscal 2019, non-marketable debt and equity securities (non-cash consideration) with an aggregate fair value of $98 million were received related to a development contract with one of our equity method investees, which was recognized as revenues in the second quarter of fiscal 2019.
In addition, in the second quarter of fiscal 2019, non-marketable equity securities (non-cash consideration) with a fair value of $53 million were received in connection with the sale of certain assets as part of the Cost Plan (Note 8).
Reclassifications from accumulated other comprehensive income included adjustments of $51 million to the opening retained earnings balance as a result of the adoption of new accounting guidance in the first quarter of fiscal 2019 related to financial instruments and hedge instruments (Note 1).
Reclassifications from accumulated other comprehensive income (excluding adjustments to opening retained earnings) related to available-for-sale securities were negligible in the three and nine months ended June 30, 2019 and June 24, 2018 and were recorded in investment and other income, net.
Other expenses in the three months ended June 30, 2019 consisted of a $275 million charge related to the fine imposed by the European Commission (EC) related to the Icera complaint (2019 EC fine) (Note 6) and negligible net charges related to our Cost Plan.
Other expenses in the nine months ended June 30, 2019 included $275 million related to the 2019 EC fine, $207 million in net restructuring and restructuring-related charges related to our Cost Plan, partially offset by a $43 million gain due to the partial recovery of a fine we previously paid to the Korea Fair Trade Commission (KFTC) and a $31 million gain related to a favorable legal settlement.
Other expenses in the three and nine months ended June 24, 2018 consisted of $112 million and $422 million, respectively, in restructuring and restructuring-related charges related to our Cost Plan.
Other expenses in the nine months ended June 24, 2018 also included a $1.2 billion charge related to an EC fine (2018 EC fine) (Note 6).
The effective tax rate of 61% for the third quarter of fiscal 2019 was higher than the estimated annual effective tax rate of 41% primarily due to the $2.5 billion charge to income tax expense recorded discretely in the third quarter of fiscal 2019 resulting from the write-off of the deferred tax asset related to the distributed intellectual property.
The estimated annual effective tax rate for fiscal 2019 was also impacted by the tax benefit of $570 million recorded discretely in the first quarter of fiscal 2019 due to establishing new U.S. net deferred tax assets from making certain check-the-box elections.
At June 30, 2019 and September 30, 2018, we had $998 million and $1.0 billion, respectively, of outstanding commercial paper included in short-term debt with a weighted-average interest rate of 2.57% and 2.35%, respectively, which included fees paid to the commercial paper dealers, and weighted-average remaining days to maturity of 28 days and 16 days, respectively.
At June 30, 2019, we had outstanding interest rate swaps with an aggregate notional amount of $1.8 billion related to the May 2015 Notes, which effectively converted approximately 43% and 50% of the fixed-rate notes due in 2020 and 2022, respectively, into floating-rate notes.
Cash interest paid related to our commercial paper program and long-term debt, net of cash received from the related interest rate swaps, was $516 million and $594 million in the nine months ended June 30, 2019 and June 24, 2018, respectively.
The Revolving Credit Facility requires that we comply with certain covenants, including one financial covenant to maintain a ratio of consolidated earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization to consolidated interest expense, as defined in each of the respective agreements, of not less than three to one at the end of each fiscal quarter.
At June 30, 2019, the liability, including related foreign currency gains and accrued interest (which, to the extent they were not related to the net investment hedge, were recorded in investment and other income, net), was $1.16 billion and included in other current liabilities.
In fiscal 2018, all of the costs related to pre-commercial research and development of 5G technologies, of which we recorded $124 million and $340 million in the third quarter and first nine months of fiscal 2018, respectively, were included in unallocated corporate research and development expenses.
We revised our condensed consolidated statement of cash flows for the nine months ended June 24, 2018 for this correction, which had no impact to net cash provided by operating activities in the period.
QTL segment results were revised for this correction (Note 7), which resulted in a decrease in QTL revenues and EBT (earnings before income taxes) of $22 million and $95 million for the three and nine months ended June 24, 2018, respectively.

•We continued to invest significant resources toward advancements primarily in support of 4G- and 5G-based technologies as well as other technologies to extend the demand for our products and generate new or expanded licensing opportunities, including within adjacent industry segments outside traditional cellular industries, such as automotive, the Internet of Things (IoT) and networking.
•We adopted new revenue recognition accounting guidance in the first quarter of fiscal 2019 that requires us to estimate and recognize QTL royalties in the period in which the associated sales occur, resulting in an acceleration of royalty revenues by one quarter compared to the prior method.
As a result of this change, pursuant to an agreement with the Internal Revenue Service, we will forgo the federal tax basis step-up of intellectual property that was distributed in fiscal 2018 by one of our foreign subsidiaries to a U.S. subsidiary.
We derive revenues principally from sales of integrated circuit products and licensing our intellectual property, including patents, software and other rights.
Substantially all of our products and services businesses, including QCT, and substantially all of our engineering, research and development functions, are operated by Qualcomm Technologies, Inc.
+$4.7 billion in licensing revenues recorded in the third quarter of fiscal 2019 resulting from the settlement with Apple and its contract manufacturers (which were not allocated to our segment results)
In fiscal 2018, all of the costs related to pre-commercial research and development of 5G technologies, of which we recorded $124 million and $340 million in the third quarter and first nine months of fiscal 2018, respectively, were included in unallocated corporate research and development expenses.
Beginning in the first quarter of fiscal 2019, all research and development costs associated with 5G technologies are included in segment results.
Additionally, beginning in the first quarter of fiscal 2019, certain research and development costs associated with early research and development that were historically included in our QCT segment are allocated to our QTL segment.
The effective tax rate of 61% for the third quarter of fiscal 2019 was higher than the estimated annual effective tax rate of 41% primarily due to the $2.5 billion charge to income tax expense recorded discretely in the third quarter of fiscal 2019 resulting from the write-off of the deferred tax asset related to the distributed intellectual property.
The following should be read in conjunction with the financial results for the third quarter and first nine months of fiscal 2019 for each reportable segment included in this Quarterly Report in “Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements, Note 7.
Revenues and operating results related to the Small Cells business were included in nonreportable segments through the end of fiscal 2018.
QCT accounts receivable decreased by 39% in the first nine months of fiscal 2019 from $1.36 billion to $836 million, primarily due to a decrease in revenues, as well as the impact of settling certain receivables in connection with the settlement agreements with Apple and its contract manufacturers.
QTL results in the third quarter and first nine months of fiscal 2019 reflected the adoption of the new accounting guidance that requires us to estimate and recognize QTL royalties in the period in which the associated sales occur, resulting in an acceleration of royalty revenues by one quarter as compared to fiscal 2018.
As a result of the settlement with Apple and its contract manufacturers, QTL results for the third quarter of fiscal 2019 included royalties from Apple and its contract manufactures for sales made in the June 2019 quarter.
Revenues in the first six months of fiscal 2019 and the first nine months of fiscal 2018 did not include royalties due on sales of Apple or other products by Apple’s contract manufacturers.
Unfavorable resolutions of one or more of these matters have had and could in the future have a material adverse effect on our business, revenues, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.
Depending on the matter, various remedies that could result from an unfavorable resolution include, among others, the loss of our ability to enforce one or more of our patents; injunctions; monetary damages or fines or other orders to pay money; the issuance of orders to cease certain conduct or modify our business practices, such as requiring us to reduce our royalty rates, reduce the base on which our royalties are calculated, grant patent licenses to chipset manufacturers, sell chipsets to unlicensed OEMs or modify or renegotiate some or all of our existing license agreements; and determinations that some or all of our license agreements are invalid or unenforceable.
Commitments and Contingencies” and “Risk Factors” in this Quarterly Report, including the Risk Factors entitled “Efforts by some communications equipment manufacturers or their customers to avoid paying fair and reasonable royalties for the use of our intellectual property may require the investment of substantial management time and financial resources and may result in legal decisions or actions by governments, courts, regulators or agencies, Standards Development Organizations (SDOs) or other industry organizations that harm our business,” “Our business, particularly our licensing business, may suffer as a result of adverse rulings in government investigations or proceedings” and “Changes in our patent licensing practices, whether due to governmental investigations, private legal proceedings challenging those practices or otherwise, could adversely impact our business and results of operations.”
•In the first quarter of fiscal 2019, we entered into a second interim agreement with Huawei in which Huawei agreed to make three quarterly payments of $150 million (for sales made in consecutive calendar quarters beginning with the quarter ended December 2018) as minimum, non-refundable payments for royalties due for sales of licensed products by Huawei during the relevant quarter.
If no agreement is reached, Huawei may not make any other payments or may not make full payments under the underlying license agreement, which may result in significant legal costs and will negatively impact our future revenues, as well as our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows, until the dispute is resolved.
We believe it is important that we remain a leader in 5G technology development, standardization, intellectual property creation and licensing of 5G technologies, and to be a leading developer and supplier of 5G integrated circuit products in order to sustain and grow our business long term.
The net increase in total cash provided by operating activities included the settlement with Apple and its contract manufacturers, as well as lower segment revenues and the impact of timing of payments of customer-related liabilities.
The decrease in accounts receivable was primarily due to the settlement with Apple and its contract manufacturers and decrease in integrated circuit shipments, partially offset by the adoption of the new revenue recognition accounting guidance in the first quarter of fiscal 2019.
Our stock repurchase program has significantly reduced and we expect that it will continue to reduce the amount of cash that we have available to fund our operations including research and development, working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, investments, dividends and other corporate purposes; and increases our exposure to adverse economic, market, industry and competitive conditions and developments, and other changes in our business and our industry.
Unfavorable resolutions of one or more of these matters have had and could in the future have a material adverse effect on our business, revenues, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.
Our revenues depend on commercial network deployments, expansions and upgrades of CDMA, OFDMA and other communications technologies, including 5G; our customers’ and licensees’ sales of products and services based on these technologies; and customers’ demand for our products and services.
We believe it is important that we be a leader in 5G technology development, standardization, intellectual property creation and licensing, and that we develop, commercialize and be a leading supplier of 5G integrated circuit products and services, in order to sustain and grow our business long-term.
We derive a significant portion of our consolidated revenues from a small number of customers and licensees, which increasingly includes a small number of Chinese OEMs. If revenues derived from these customers or licensees decrease or the timing of such revenues fluctuates, our business and results of operations could be negatively affected.
Chinese OEMs continue to grow their device share in China and are increasing their device share in regions outside of China, and we derive a significant and increasing portion of our revenues from a small number of these OEMs. In addition, certain of our largest integrated circuit customers develop their own integrated circuit products, which they have in the past chosen to utilize in certain of their devices and may in the future choose to utilize in certain (or all) of their devices, rather than our products (and may sell their integrated circuit products to third parties in competition with us).
We have experienced, and expect to continue to experience, slowing growth in the premium-tier device segment due to, among other factors, lengthening replacement cycles in developed regions, where premium-tier smartphones are common; increasing consumer demand in emerging regions where premium-tier smartphones are less common and replacement cycles are on average longer than in developed regions and are continuing to lengthen; and a maturing premium-tier smartphone industry in which demand is increasingly driven by new product launches and innovation cycles.
Efforts by some communications equipment manufacturers or their customers to avoid paying fair and reasonable royalties for the use of our intellectual property may require the investment of substantial management time and financial resources and may result in legal decisions or actions by governments, courts, regulators or agencies, Standards Development Organizations (SDOs) or other industry organizations that harm our business.
In addition, certain licensees have disputed, underreported, underpaid, not reported or not paid royalties owed to us under their license agreements or reported to us in a manner that is not in compliance with their contractual obligations, and certain companies have yet to enter into or have delayed entering into or renewing license agreements with us for their use of our intellectual property, and licensees and companies may continue to do so in the future.
Further, to the extent such licensees and companies increase their device share, the negative impact of their underreporting, underpayment, non-payment or non-reporting on our business, revenues, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows will be exacerbated.
Changes in our patent licensing practices, whether due to governmental investigations, private legal proceedings challenging those practices or otherwise, could adversely impact our business and results of operations.
Commitments and Contingencies.” Key allegations in those matters include, among others, that we violate FRAND licensing commitments by refusing to grant licenses to chipset makers, that our royalty rates are too high, that the base on which our royalties are calculated should be something less than the wholesale (i.e., licensee’s) selling price of the applicable device (minus certain permitted deductions), that we unlawfully require customers to execute a patent license before we sell them cellular modem chipsets, that we have entered into exclusive agreements with chipset customers that foreclose competition, and that we violate antitrust laws, engage in anticompetitive conduct and unfair methods of competition.
If more licensees choose a license to only our cellular standard-essential patents instead of a portfolio license than has historically been the case, our licensing revenues and earnings would be negatively impacted unless we were able to license our other patents at rates that offset all or a portion of any difference between the royalties previously received for licenses of substantially all of our patent portfolio as compared to licenses of only our cellular standard-essential patents or there was a sufficient increase in the overall volume of sales of devices upon which royalties are paid.
Our growth increasingly depends on our ability to extend our technologies, products and services into new and expanded product areas, such as RFFE, and adjacent industry segments and applications outside of traditional cellular industries, such as automotive, IoT and networking, among others.
Our research, development and other investments in these new and expanded product areas, industry segments and applications, and related technologies, products and services, as well as in our existing technologies, products and services and new technologies, such as 5G, may not generate operating income or contribute to future results of operations that meet our expectations.
In particular, our future growth significantly depends on new and expanded product areas, such as RFFE, and adjacent industry segments and applications outside of traditional cellular industries, such as automotive, IoT (including the connected home, smart cities, wearables, voice and music and robotics), networking, computing and AI, such as machine learning, among others; our ability to develop leading and cost-effective technologies, products and services for new and expanded product areas, adjacent industry segments and applications; and third parties incorporating our technologies, products and services into devices used in these product areas, industry segments and applications.
Accordingly, we intend to continue to make substantial investments in these new and expanded product areas and adjacent industry segments and applications, and in developing new products, services and technologies for these product areas, industry segments and applications.
Further, to remain competitive and meet customer demand, we may be required to improve our facilities and process technologies and carry out extensive research and development, each of which may require investment of significant amounts of capital and may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.
The continued and future success of our licensing programs requires us to continue to evolve our patent portfolio, and our licensing programs may be impacted by the proliferation of devices in new industry segments such as automotive and IoT, as well as the need to renew or renegotiate license agreements that are expiring or to cover additional future patents.
If we do not maintain a strong portfolio that is applicable to current and future standards, products and services, particularly 5G, our future licensing revenues could be negatively impacted.
Standards, even de facto standards, that develop as these technologies mature, in particular those that do not include a base level of interoperability, may impact our ability to obtain royalties at all or that are equivalent to those that we receive for products used in cellular communications.
If there is a delay in extending, modifying or entering into a new license agreement with a licensee, there would be a delay in our ability to recognize revenues related to that licensee’s product sales.
Compliance with existing laws, regulations, policies and standards, the adoption of new laws, regulations, policies or standards, changes in the interpretation of existing laws, regulations, policies or standards, changes in the regulation of our activities by a government or standards body or rulings in court, regulatory, administrative or other proceedings relating to such laws, regulations, policies or standards, including, among others, those affecting licensing practices, competitive business practices, the use of our technology or products, protection of intellectual property, trade and trade protection including tariffs, foreign currency, investments or loans, spectrum availability and license issuance, adoption of standards, the provision of device subsidies by wireless operators to their customers, taxation, export control, privacy and data protection, environmental protection, health and safety, labor and employment, human rights, corporate governance, public disclosure or business conduct, could have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations.
See the Risk Factor entitled “There are numerous risks associated with our operation and control of the manufacturing facilities of our joint venture with TDK, RF360 Holdings, including a higher portion of fixed costs relative to a fabless model, environmental compliance and liability, exposure to natural disasters, timely supply of equipment and materials and manufacturing difficulties.”
Certain of our software and our suppliers’ software may contain or may be derived from “open source” software, and we have seen, and believe we will continue to see, an increase in customers requesting that we develop products, including software associated with our integrated circuit products, that incorporate open source software elements and operate in an open source environment, which, under certain open source licenses, may offer accessibility to a portion of a product’s source code and may expose related intellectual property to adverse licensing conditions.
This stock repurchase program has significantly reduced and will continue to reduce the amount of cash that we have available to fund our operations, including research and development, working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, investments, dividends and other corporate purposes; and increases our exposure to adverse economic, market, industry and competitive conditions and developments, and other changes in our business and our industry.
See the Risk Factor entitled “We may not be able to attract and retain qualified employees.” Similarly, we provide access to certain of our intellectual property or proprietary or confidential business information to our direct and indirect customers and licensees, who may wrongfully use such intellectual property or information or wrongfully disclose such intellectual property or information to third parties, including our competitors.
If we do not meet the criteria required to retain such incentives, our Singapore tax rate could increase prior to fiscal 2022, and our results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected.
Failures in our products or services, or in the products or services of our customers or licensees, including those resulting from security vulnerabilities, defects or errors, could harm our business.
Further, security failures, defects or errors in the products of our customers or licensees could have an adverse impact on our results of operations and cash flows due to a delay or decrease in demand for our products or services generally, and our premium-tier products in particular, among other factors.
