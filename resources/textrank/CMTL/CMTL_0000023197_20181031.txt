For over time contracts using a cost-to-cost measure of progress, we have an estimate at completion (“EAC”) process in which management reviews the progress and execution of our performance obligations.
Since certain contracts extend over a long period of time, the impact of revisions in revenue and or cost estimates during the progress of work may impact current period earnings through a cumulative adjustment.
These services are typically recognized as a series of services performed over the contract term using the straight-line method, or based on our customers’ actual usage of the networks and platforms which we provide.
The contracts related to these product lines do not meet the requirements for over time revenue recognition because our customers cannot utilize the equipment for its intended purpose during any phase of our manufacturing process; customers do not simultaneously receive and or consume the benefits provided by our performance; customers do not control the asset (i.e., prior to delivery, customers cannot direct the use of the asset, sell or exchange the equipment, etc.); and, although many of our contracts have termination for convenience clauses and or an enforceable right to payment for performance completed to date, our performance creates an asset with an alternative use through the point of delivery.
The estimation of this variable consideration and determination of whether to include estimated amounts in the transaction price are based largely on an assessment of our anticipated performance and all information (e.g., historical, current and forecasted) that is reasonably available to us.
If the standalone selling price is not observable through past transactions, we estimate the standalone selling price taking into account available information such as market conditions, including geographic or regional specific factors, competitive positioning, internal costs, profit objectives and internally approved pricing guidelines related to the performance obligations.
International sales for the three months ended October 31, 2018 and 2017 include sales to U.S. domestic companies for inclusion in products that are sold to international customers.
Except for the U.S., no individual country (including sales to U.S. domestic companies for inclusion in products that are sold to a foreign country) represented more than 10% of consolidated net sales for the three months ended October 31, 2018 and 2017.
Of the total contract liabilities at August 1, 2018, $23,127,000 was recognized as revenue during the three months ended October 31, 2018.
As commissions payable to our sales and marketing employees or contractors are contingent upon multiple factors, such commissions are not considered direct costs to obtain or fulfill a contract with a customer and are expensed as incurred in selling, general and administrative expenses on our Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations.
Commissions payable to our third party sales representatives related to large long-term contracts are included in total estimated costs at completion for such contracts and are expensed over time through cost of sales on our Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations, as we consider these types of commissions direct and incremental costs to obtain and fulfill such contracts.
Our basic earnings per share ("EPS") is computed based on the weighted average number of common shares (including vested but unissued stock units, share units, performance shares and restricted stock units ("RSUs")), outstanding during each respective period.
Weighted average stock options, RSUs and restricted stock outstanding of 279,000 and 2,246,000 for the three months ended October 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively, were not included in our diluted EPS calculation because their effect would have been anti-dilutive.
Unbilled receivables as of October 31, 2018 relate to contracts-in-progress for which revenue has been recognized, but for which we have not yet earned the right to bill the customer for work performed to-date.
Of the unbilled receivables from commercial and international customers at October 31, 2018 and July 31, 2018, approximately $1,592,000 and $1,558,000, respectively, relates to a large over-the-horizon microwave system contract with our large U.S. prime contractor customer (all of which related to our North African country end-customer).
As of October 31, 2018 and July 31, 2018, the amount of inventory directly related to long-term contracts (including contracts-in-progress) was $1,235,000 and $1,249,000, respectively, and the amount of inventory related to contracts from third party commercial customers who outsource their manufacturing to us was $1,334,000 and $1,310,000, respectively.
Other accrued expenses as of October 31, 2018 include $992,000 for the current portion of the facility exit costs related to the closure of a manufacturing facility, as discussed in more detail in Note (9) - "Cost Reduction Actions."
Accrued warranty obligations as of October 31, 2018 relate to estimated liabilities for assurance-type warranty coverage that we provide to our customers.
During the three months ended three months ended October 31, 2018, we took steps to improve our future operating results and we successfully consolidated our Government Solutions segment’s manufacturing facility located in Tampa, Florida with another facility that we maintain in Orlando, Florida; and in doing so, incurred $1,373,000 of facility exit costs, which are recorded in selling, general and administrative expenses on our Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations.
At October 31, 2018, we had $2,705,000 of standby letters of credit outstanding under our Credit Facility related to guarantees of future performance on certain customer contracts and no outstanding commercial letters of credit.
Stock-based compensation for equity-classified awards is measured at the date of grant, based on an estimate of the fair value of the award and is generally expensed over the vesting period of the award.
At October 31, 2018, unrecognized stock-based compensation of $11,084,000, net of estimated forfeitures of $925,000, is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of 3.2 years.
Total stock-based compensation capitalized and included in ending inventory at both October 31, 2018 and July 31, 2018 was $48,000.
Stock options outstanding as of October 31, 2018 have exercise prices ranging from $20.90 to $33.94, representing the fair market value of our common stock on the date of grant, a contractual term of five or ten years and a vesting period of three or five years.
As a result, 9,345 net shares of our common stock were issued during the three months ended October 31, 2018 after reduction of shares retained to satisfy the exercise price and minimum statutory tax withholding requirements.
As of October 31, 2018, the number of outstanding performance shares included in the above table, and the related compensation expense prior to consideration of estimated pre-vesting forfeitures, assume achievement of the pre-established goals at a target level.
RSUs and restricted stock granted to non-employee directors have a vesting period of three years and are convertible into shares of our common stock generally at the time of termination, on a one-for-one basis for no cash consideration, or earlier under certain circumstances.
Share units granted prior to July 31, 2017 were vested when issued and are convertible into shares of our common stock, generally at the time of termination, on a one-for-one basis for no cash consideration, or earlier under certain circumstances.
The fair value of performance shares, RSUs, restricted stock and share units is determined using the closing market price of our common stock on the date of grant, less the present value of any estimated future dividend equivalents such awards are not entitled to receive and an applicable estimated discount for post vesting restrictions.
During the three months ended October 31, 2018, we exited our Government Solutions segment's manufacturing facility located in Tampa, Florida and recorded a related charge of $1,373,000 in selling, general and administrative expenses on our Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations.
Interest expense for the three months ended October 31, 2018 and 2017 includes $2,542,000 and $2,465,000, respectively, principally related to our Prior Credit Facility and includes amortization of deferred financing costs.
In addition, on October 31, 2018, we recorded a $3,217,000 loss from the write-off of deferred financing costs primarily related to the Term Loan Facility portion of our Prior Credit Facility.
In making this assessment, we considered, among other things, expectations of projected net sales and cash flows, assumptions impacting the weighted average cost of capital, trends in trading multiples of comparable companies, changes in our stock price and changes in the carrying values of our reporting units with goodwill.
Finally, we compared our estimates of fair values to our August 1, 2018 total public market capitalization and assessed implied control premiums based on our common stock price of $33.70 as of August 1, 2018.

Additionally, as of October 31, 2018, net intangibles recorded on our Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet aggregated $236.5 million (of which $195.6 million relates to our Commercial Solutions segment and $40.9 million relates to our Government Solutions segment).
In making this assessment, we considered, among other things, expectations of projected net sales and cash flows, assumptions impacting the weighted average cost of capital, trends in trading multiples of comparable companies, changes in our stock price and changes in the carrying values of our reporting units with goodwill.
Excluding these aforementioned items, our consolidated operating income and net income for the first quarter of fiscal 2019 would have been $9.8 million and $5.5 million, respectively, or 6.1% and 3.4% of consolidated net sales, respectively, a significant improvement from the amounts and related percentages we achieved in the first quarter of fiscal 2018.
Based on our outstanding first quarter performance, our Business Outlook has improved since September 26, 2018 (the date we filed our Annual Report on Form 10-K with the Securities Exchange Commission (the “SEC”)) and we are increasing our targeted goals for consolidated net sales, net income per diluted share and Adjusted EBITDA for fiscal 2019.
Our fiscal 2019 consolidated net sales goal is now expected to be higher and within a range of approximately $625.0 million to $640.0 million as compared to our prior range of $600.0 million to $625.0 million.
In addition to increasing our targeted goals for consolidated net sales, net income per diluted share and Adjusted EBITDA, we are also adjusting our expectations of the timing of our financial performance given actual first quarter 2019 performance, changes in expected fielding schedules from our customers and an overall updated assessment of our assumptions.
In this regard, our second quarter consolidated net sales, operating income and Adjusted EBITDA are expected to be nearly the same as our first quarter results of fiscal 2019.
We still expect our fourth quarter of fiscal 2019 to be the peak quarter for consolidated net sales, operating income and Adjusted EBITDA.
Despite incurring facility exit costs and acquisition plan expenses, we anticipate consolidated operating income, both in dollars and as a percentage of consolidated net sales, to be higher in fiscal 2019 as compared to the $35.1 million or 6.2% we achieved in fiscal 2018.
Additionally, as a percentage of consolidated net sales, Adjusted EBITDA in fiscal 2019 is expected to be similar to the percentage we achieved in fiscal 2018.
Consolidated net sales were $160.8 million and $121.6 million for the three months ended October 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively, representing an increase of $39.2 million, or 32.2%.
Net sales in our Commercial Solutions segment were $78.0 million for the three months ended October 31, 2018, as compared to $76.1 million for the three months ended October 31, 2017, an increase of $1.9 million, or 2.5%.
Our Commercial Solutions segment represented 48.5% of consolidated net sales for the three months ended October 31, 2018 as compared to 62.6% for the three months ended October 31, 2017.
Net sales of our satellite earth station products (which include satellite modems, traveling wave tube amplifiers (“TWTAs”) and solid-state power amplifiers (“SSPAs”)) during the three months ended October 31, 2018 were higher than the three months ended October 31, 2017 and reflect growth in sales to both U.S. government and international customers.
Net sales in our Government Solutions segment were $82.9 million for the three months ended October 31, 2018 as compared to $45.5 million for the three months ended October 31, 2017, a significant increase of $37.4 million, or 82.2%.
Our Government Solutions segment represented 51.5% of consolidated net sales for the three months ended October 31, 2018, as compared to 37.4% for the three months ended October 31, 2017.
Based on updated customer fielding schedules and our own assessment of business activity, our first quarter of fiscal 2019 net sales in this segment is expected to be the peak quarter for fiscal 2019.
Overall, based on the mix and anticipated timing of performance on orders in backlog and expected new orders, we anticipate that fiscal 2019 net sales for our Government Solutions segment will be significantly higher than fiscal 2018.
International sales for the three months ended October 31, 2018 and 2017 (which include sales to U.S. domestic companies for inclusion in products that are sold to international customers) were $39.3 million and $28.3 million, respectively.
Except for the U.S., no individual country (including sales to U.S. domestic companies for inclusion in products that are sold to a foreign country) represented more than 10.0% of consolidated net sales for the three months ended October 31, 2018 and 2017.
The increase of $10.1 million reflects significantly higher net sales in our Government Solutions segment, as discussed above.
Gross profit, as a percentage of consolidated net sales, for the three months ended October 31, 2018 was 35.9% as compared to 39.3% for the three months ended October 31, 2017.
The decrease in gross profit, as a percentage of consolidated net sales, was almost entirely driven by the significant period-to-period increase in net sales in our Government Solutions segment, as discussed above.
The three months ended October 31, 2017 also included a favorable warranty settlement which resulted in a reduction of $0.7 million to cost of sales in our unallocated segment.
Our Commercial Solutions segment's gross profit, as a percentage of related segment net sales, for the three months ended October 31, 2018 was slightly higher than the three months ended October 31, 2017.
Overall, looking forward, based on the mix and anticipated timing of shipments and performance related to orders currently in our backlog and the mix and timing of expected new orders, gross profit for this segment, as a percentage of related segment net sales, for fiscal 2019 is expected to be lower than the level achieved in fiscal 2018.
Our Government Solutions segment's gross profit, as a percentage of related segment net sales, for the three months ended October 31, 2018 was higher than the level we achieved in the three months ended October 31, 2017.
This increase was primarily due to overall favorable product mix changes during the most recent fiscal quarter, including a higher percentage of segment net sales related to our over-the-horizon microwave systems products.
Based on the mix and anticipated timing of shipments and performance related to orders currently in our backlog and the mix and timing of expected new orders, gross profit for this segment, as a percentage of related segment net sales, for fiscal 2019 is expected to be comparable to the level achieved in fiscal 2018.
Nevertheless, based on expected bookings, expected timing of our performance on orders and the anticipated increase of Government Solutions segment net sales as a percentage of consolidated net sales, we currently expect our consolidated gross profit, as a percentage of consolidated net sales, for fiscal 2019 to be lower than the percentage we achieved in fiscal 2018.
As a percentage of consolidated net sales, selling, general and administrative expenses were 19.8% and 23.4% for the three months ended October 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively.
Amortization in the three months ended October 31, 2017 includes the benefit of a $0.4 million reversal of stock-based compensation expense related to certain performance shares previously expected to be earned.
Based on our current spending plans, we expect fiscal 2019 selling, general and administrative expenses, in dollars, to be higher and, as a percentage of consolidated net sales, to be similar to the percentage achieved in fiscal 2018.
As a percentage of consolidated net sales, research and development expenses were 8.2% and 11.3% for the three months ended October 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively.
For three months ended October 31, 2018 and 2017, research and development expenses of $11.4 million and $11.8 million, respectively, related to our Commercial Solutions segment, and $1.7 million and $1.9 million, respectively, related to our Government Solutions segment.
Based on our current spending plans, we expect fiscal 2019 research and development expenses, in dollars, to be higher and, as a percentage of consolidated net sales, to be comparable to fiscal 2018.
The significant increase in our Government Solutions segment’s operating income, both in dollars and as a percentage of related segment net sales, was primarily due to significantly higher net sales at slightly higher gross margins, offset, in part, by $1.4 million of facility exit costs, as discussed above.
Looking forward, we expect fiscal 2019 operating income, in dollars and as a percentage of related segment net sales, to be significantly higher as compared to fiscal 2018.
On an annual basis, amortization of stock-based compensation expense in fiscal 2019 is expected to increase to a range of $10.0 million to $12.0 million as compared to the $8.6 million amortized in fiscal 2018.This increase is largely due to an increase in the number and value of annual non-equity incentive awards expected to be granted in fiscal 2019 as a result of anticipated operating income contributions from each of our two reportable operating segments.
Consolidated GAAP operating income was $7.3 million or 4.5% of consolidated net sales in our most recent quarter as compared to GAAP operating income of $0.2 million or 0.2% of consolidated net sales in the first quarter of fiscal 2018.
Excluding the aforementioned $1.4 million of facility exit costs and $1.1 million of acquisition plan expenses, consolidated operating income would have been $9.8 million, or 6.1% of consolidated net sales in the first quarter of fiscal 2019.
Looking forward, on a consolidated basis, we are targeting operating income, as a percentage of consolidated net sales, to be higher than the 6.2% we achieved in fiscal 2018.
Based on the type, terms, amount of outstanding debt (including capital leases and other obligations) and current interest rates, our effective interest rate (including amortization of deferred financing costs) in fiscal 2019 is now anticipated to range from 5.4% to 5.6% which compares to our prior estimate of 6.0% to 6.4%.
The significant increase in consolidated Adjusted EBITDA, in dollars, during the three months ended October 31, 2018 as compared to the three months ended October 31, 2017 is primarily attributable to significantly higher net sales and product mix changes in our Government Solutions segment and the benefit of cost reduction actions previously initiated, as discussed above.
We have not quantitatively reconciled our fiscal 2019 Adjusted EBITDA target to the most directly comparable GAAP measure because items such as stock-based compensation, adjustments to the provision for income taxes, amortization of intangibles and interest expense, which are specific items that impact these measures, have not yet occurred, are out of our control, or cannot be predicted.
At October 31, 2018, we had $2.7 million of standby letters of credit outstanding under our Credit Facility related to our guarantees of future performance on certain customer contracts and no outstanding commercial letters of credit.
As discussed in "Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements - Note (9) - Cost Reduction Actions," during the three months ended October 31, 2018, we exited our Government Solutions segment's manufacturing facility located in Tampa, Florida and recorded a related charge of $1.4 million in selling, general and administrative expenses on our Condensed Consolidated Statement of Operations.
