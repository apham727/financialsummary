The fair value of the non-current portion of our Secured Credit Facility as of April 30, 2018 approximates its carrying amount due to its variable interest rate and pricing grid that is dependent upon our leverage ratio as of the end of each fiscal quarter.
Weighted average stock options, RSUs and restricted stock outstanding of 1,505,000 and 1,912,000 for the three months ended April 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively, and 1,804,000 and 2,227,000 for the nine months ended April 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively, were not included in our diluted EPS calculation because their effect would have been anti-dilutive.
Of the unbilled receivables from commercial and international customers at April 30, 2018 and July 31, 2017, approximately $1,049,000 and $2,995,000, respectively, relates to a large over-the-horizon microwave system contract with our large U.S. prime contractor customer (all of which related to our North African country end-customer).
At April 30, 2018, we had $3,268,000 of standby letters of credit outstanding under our Secured Credit Facility, as amended, related to our guarantees of future performance on certain customer contracts and no outstanding commercial letters of credit.
Diluted earnings per share - Prior to the adoption of ASU 2016-09, in addition to considering the amount an employee must pay upon assumed exercise of stock-based awards and the amount of stock-based compensation cost attributed to future services and not yet recognized, when calculating our diluted earnings per share, the assumed proceeds also included the amount of excess tax benefits, if any, that would have been credited to additional paid-in capital assuming exercise of in-the-money stock-based awards.
During the nine months ended April 30, 2018, we recorded a $62,000 net benefit which primarily represents the recoupment of certain share units.
Stock options outstanding as of April 30, 2018 have exercise prices ranging from $20.90 to $33.94, representing the fair market value of our common stock on the date of grant, a contractual term of five or ten years and a vesting period of three or five years.
The total intrinsic value relating to stock options exercised during the three and nine months ended April 30, 2018 was $225,000.
The total intrinsic value relating to fully-vested awards settled during the three months ended April 30, 2018 was $17,000.

The total intrinsic value relating to fully-vested awards settled during the nine months ended April 30, 2018 and 2017 was $1,964,000 and $633,000, respectively.
Performance shares granted to employees prior to fiscal 2014 generally vest over a 5.3 year period, beginning on the date of grant once pre-established performance goals were attained, and are convertible into shares of our common stock at the time of vesting, on a one-for-one basis for no cash consideration.
As of April 30, 2018, the number of outstanding performance shares included in the above table, and the related compensation expense prior to consideration of estimated pre-vesting forfeitures, assume achievement of the pre-established goals at a target level.
RSUs and restricted stock granted to non-employee directors have a vesting period of three years and are convertible into shares of our common stock generally at the time of termination, on a one-for-one basis for no cash consideration, or earlier under certain circumstances.
Share units granted prior to July 31, 2017 were vested when issued and are convertible into shares of our common stock, generally at the time of termination, on a one-for-one basis for no cash consideration, or earlier under certain circumstances.
The fair value of performance shares, RSUs, restricted stock and share units is determined using the closing market price of our common stock on the date of grant, less the present value of any estimated future dividend equivalents such awards are not entitled to receive and an applicable estimated discount for post vesting restrictions.
We recorded $96,000 of income tax expense in our Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations for the nine months ended April 30, 2018, which represents net income tax shortfalls from the settlement of stock-based awards and the reversal of deferred tax assets associated with expired and unexercised stock-based awards.
During the nine months ended April 30, 2017, net income tax shortfalls from similar items totaled $590,000 and, pursuant to prior GAAP, were recorded as a reduction to additional paid-in capital.
Included in domestic sales, are sales to Verizon which represented 9.8% and 10.6% of consolidated net sales for the three and nine months ended April 30, 2018, respectively.
International sales for the three months ended April 30, 2018 and 2017 (which include sales to U.S. domestic companies for inclusion in products that are sold to international customers) were $36,316,000 and $34,131,000, respectively.

Except for the U.S., no individual country (including sales to U.S. domestic companies for inclusion in products that are sold to a foreign country) represented more than 10% of consolidated net sales for the three and nine months ended April 30, 2018 and 2017.
Interest expense for the three and nine months ended April 30, 2018 and 2017 includes $2,351,000 and $7,166,000, respectively, and $2,641,000 and $8,524,000, respectively, related to our Secured Credit Facility, as amended, and includes the amortization of deferred financing costs.
In making this assessment, we considered, among other things, expectations of projected net sales and cash flows, assumptions impacting the weighted average cost of capital, trends in trading multiples of comparable companies, changes in our stock price and changes in the carrying values of our reporting units with goodwill.

During the three months ended April 30, 2018, our Commercial Solutions segment received a large strategic multi-year contract award from the U.S. Navy's Space and Naval Warfare Systems Command in the amount of $59.0 million to purchase our SLM-5650B satellite modems, upgrade kits and related services.
â€¢consolidated operating income, as a percentage of net sales, of approximately 5.2% which compares favorably with the 3.3% of consolidated net sales we achieved in fiscal 2017 (excluding the $18.8 million of favorable adjustments that are more fully discussed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended July 31, 2017, as filed with the SEC); 
Consolidated net sales were $147.9 million and $127.8 million for the three months ended April 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively, representing an increase of $20.1 million, or 15.7%.
Net sales in our Commercial Solutions segment were $89.9 million for the three months ended April 30, 2018, as compared to $79.4 million for the three months ended April 30, 2017, an increase of $10.5 million, or 13.2%.
Our Commercial Solutions segment represented 60.8% of consolidated net sales for the three months ended April 30, 2018 as compared to 62.1% for the three months ended April 30, 2017.
Net sales in our Government Solutions segment were $57.9 million for the three months ended April 30, 2018 as compared to $48.4 million for the three months ended April 30, 2017, an increase of $9.5 million, or 19.6%.
Our Government Solutions segment represented 39.2% of consolidated net sales for the three months ended April 30, 2018, as compared to 37.9% for the three months ended April 30, 2017.
Net sales of our command and control solutions (which include the design, installation and operation of secure wireless communication networks, cyber intelligence solutions and blue-force tracking solutions) during the three months ended April 30, 2018 were significantly higher than the three months ended April 30, 2017.
This increase in gross profit dollars was largely driven by higher net sales in both our Commercial Solutions and Government Solutions segments, offset in part by the absence of $1.7 million of BFT-1 intellectual property license fees during the third quarter of fiscal 2018.
Our Commercial Solutions segment's gross profit, as a percentage of related segment net sales, for the three months ended April 30, 2018 was higher than the comparable prior year period.
The increase was primarily due to higher net sales and overall favorable product mix changes (including earlier than expected shipments of satellite earth station equipment to the U.S. Navy) during the most recent fiscal quarter.
Our Government Solutions segment's gross profit, as a percentage of related segment net sales, for the three months ended April 30, 2018 was slightly lower when compared to the prior year period, but an improvement over the first two quarters of fiscal 2018.
Although we expect net sales in the fourth quarter in this segment to increase as compared to our most recent quarter, we have updated our product mix assumptions for the remainder of fiscal 2018 which now reflect lower expected sales of higher margin cyber training software solutions, offset by other anticipated command and control solution sales.
As a result of our updated product mix assumptions, we believe that gross profit (both in dollars and as a percentage of net sales in this segment) will be lower in the fourth quarter as compared to our third quarter of fiscal 2018.
As a percentage of consolidated net sales, selling, general and administrative expenses were 20.6% and 20.3% for the three months ended April 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively.
The increase in spending, both in dollars and as a percentage of consolidated net sales, is primarily attributable to the recovery of certain legal expenses from a third party during the three months ended April 30, 2017.
Based on our current spending plans, we expect fiscal 2018 selling, general and administrative expenses, as a percentage of consolidated net sales, to be comparable to fiscal 2017.
As a percentage of consolidated net sales, research and development expenses were 8.7% and 10.2% for the three months ended April 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively.
During the three months ended April 30, 2017, we recorded a favorable adjustment to operating income of $2.0 million, net of estimated legal fees, to reflect a lower loss than originally estimated for a TCS intellectual property matter which was settled during that period.
The increase during the most recent fiscal quarter in our Commercial Solutions segmentâ€™s operating income, in dollars and as a percentage of related segment net sales, was primarily due to higher net sales, overall favorable product mix changes and the benefit of cost reduction actions previously initiated, as discussed above.
Overall, we expect fiscal 2018 operating income in our Commercial Solutions segment, in dollars and as a percentage of related segment net sales, to increase as compared to fiscal 2017.
The increase during the most recent fiscal quarter in our Government Solutions segment's operating income, in dollars and as a percentage of related segment net sales, was primarily due to higher net sales, overall product mix changes and the benefit of cost reduction actions previously initiated, offset in part by the absence of $1.7 million of BFT-1 intellectual property license fees, as discussed above.
Based on the strength of our third quarter performance, an assessment of timing associated with our current backlog and updated product mix assumptions for the remainder of fiscal 2018 (including lower expected sales of higher margin cyber training software solutions), we expect this segment's operating income for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018 to be comparable to the amount we achieved during the third quarter of fiscal 2018.
Unallocated operating expenses for the three months ended April 30, 2018 were $5.4 million as compared to operating income of $0.2 million for the three months ended April 30, 2017 (which includes a favorable adjustment of $2.0 million, as discussed above).
Unallocated operating expenses for the three months ended April 30, 2018 and 2017 include amortization of stock-based compensation of $1.1 million and $1.0 million, respectively.
On a consolidated basis, we are targeting to achieve operating income, as a percentage of net sales, of approximately 5.2% in fiscal 2018, which compares favorably with the 3.3% of consolidated net sales we achieved in fiscal 2017 (excluding the $18.8 million of favorable adjustments to operating income discussed above).
The increase in consolidated Adjusted EBITDA during the three months ended April 30, 2018 as compared to the three months ended April 30, 2017 was primarily attributable to higher net sales and overall favorable product mix changes, offset in part by higher operating expenses during the three months ended April 30, 2018 as a result of the increased sales activity during the period.
The increase in our Commercial Solutions segment's Adjusted EBITDA, in dollars and as a percentage of related segment net sales, during the most recent fiscal quarter was primarily due to higher net sales, overall favorable product mix changes and the benefit of cost reduction actions previously initiated, as discussed above.
The increase in our Government Solutions segment's Adjusted EBITDA, in dollars and as a percentage of related segment net sales, during the most recent fiscal quarter was primarily due to higher net sales, overall product mix changes and the benefit of cost reduction actions previously initiated, offset in part by an absence of $1.7 million of BFT-1 intellectual property license fees, as discussed above.
In addition, despite the absence of $6.7 million of BFT-1 intellectual property license fees (which the U.S. Army is no longer obligated to pay us to support the BFT-1 system), we expect Adjusted EBITDA, as a percentage of fiscal 2018 consolidated net sales, to be close to 13.0%, which is slightly higher than the 12.8% we achieved in fiscal 2017.

Net sales of our command and control solutions (which include the design, installation and operation of secure wireless communication networks, cyber intelligence solutions and blue-force tracking solutions) during the nine months ended April 30, 2018 were higher than the nine months ended April 30, 2017.
Although net sales of our over-the-horizon microwave systems products for the nine months ended April 30, 2018 were lower than the comparative period of the prior year, business activity in our over-the-horizon microwave systems product line continues to pick-up.
The increase of $3.2 million in gross profit dollars was largely driven by higher net sales and overall favorable product mix changes in our Commercial Solutions segment, offset by significantly lower net sales of over-the-horizon microwave systems products and the absence of $6.7 million of BFT-1 intellectual property license fees in our Government Solutions segment, as discussed above.
The increase in gross profit percentage is largely attributable to a greater percentage of our consolidated net sales during the nine months ended April 30, 2018 occurring in our Commercial Solutions segment, which historically achieves higher gross margins than our Government Solutions segment, as well as a favorable warranty settlement during the nine months ended April 30, 2018 that resulted in a $0.7 million reduction to cost of sales (which is reflected in our unallocated segment).
Our Commercial Solutions segment's gross profit, as a percentage of related segment net sales, for the nine months ended April 30, 2018 was higher than the comparable prior year period.
The increase was primarily due to higher net sales and overall favorable product mix changes (including earlier than expected shipments of satellite earth station equipment to the U.S. Navy) during the most recent nine month period.

As a percentage of consolidated net sales, research and development expenses were 9.9% and 10.0% for the nine months ended April 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively.
During the nine months ended April 30, 2017, we recorded a favorable adjustment to operating income of $12.0 million, net of estimated legal fees, to reflect a lower loss than originally estimated for a TCS intellectual property matter which was settled during that period.
The increase during the most recent nine month period in our Commercial Solutions segmentâ€™s operating income, in dollars and as a percentage of related segment net sales, was primarily due to higher net sales, overall favorable product mix changes and the benefit of cost reduction actions previously initiated, as discussed above.
Overall, we expect fiscal 2018 operating income in our Commercial Solutions segment, in dollars and as a percentage of related segment net sales, to increase as compared to fiscal 2017.
The decrease during the most recent nine month period in our Government Solutions segment's operating income, in dollars and as a percentage of related segment net sales, was driven by lower net sales, most notably significantly lower over-the-horizon microwave systems sales and the absence of $6.7 million of BFT-1 intellectual property license fees, as discussed above.
Based on the strength of our third quarter performance, an assessment of timing associated with our current backlog and updated product mix assumptions for the remainder of fiscal 2018 (including lower expected sales of higher margin cyber training software solutions), we expect this segment's operating income for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018 to be comparable to the amount we achieved during the third quarter of fiscal 2018.
Stock-based compensation for the nine months ended April 30, 2018 includes a reversal of $0.4 million of stock-based compensation expense related to certain performance shares that were previously expected to be earned.
