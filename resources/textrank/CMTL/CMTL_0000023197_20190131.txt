For over time contracts using a cost-to-cost measure of progress, we have an estimate at completion ("EAC") process in which management reviews the progress and execution of our performance obligations.
This EAC process requires management judgment relative to assessing risks, estimating contract revenue and costs, and making assumptions for schedule and technical issues.
Since certain contracts extend over a long period of time, the impact of revisions in revenue and or cost estimates during the progress of work may impact current period earnings through a cumulative adjustment.
The contracts related to these product lines do not meet the requirements for over time revenue recognition because our customers cannot utilize the equipment for its intended purpose during any phase of our manufacturing process; customers do not simultaneously receive and or consume the benefits provided by our performance; customers do not control the asset (i.e., prior to delivery, customers cannot direct the use of the asset, sell or exchange the equipment, etc.); and, although many of our contracts have termination for convenience clauses and or an enforceable right to payment for performance completed to date, our performance creates an asset with an alternative use through the point of delivery.
If the standalone selling price is not observable through past transactions, we estimate the standalone selling price taking into account available information such as market conditions, including geographic or regional specific factors, competitive positioning, internal costs, profit objectives and internally approved pricing guidelines related to the performance obligations.
Except for the U.S., no individual country (including sales to U.S. domestic companies for inclusion in products that are sold to a foreign country) represented more than 10% of consolidated net sales for the three and six months ended January 31, 2019 and 2018.
For certain contracts with provisions that are intended to protect customers in the event we do not satisfy our performance obligations, billings occur subsequent to revenue recognition, resulting in what we have historically presented as unbilled receivables.
Of the total contract liabilities at August 1, 2018, $24,606,000 was recognized as revenue during the six months ended January 31, 2019.
As commissions payable to our internal sales and marketing employees or contractors are contingent upon multiple factors, such commissions are not considered direct costs to obtain or fulfill a contract with a customer and are expensed as incurred in selling, general and administrative expenses on our Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations.
Therefore, such types of commissions are included in total estimated costs at completion for such contracts and expensed over time through cost of sales on our Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations.
Unbilled receivables as of January 31, 2019 relate to contracts-in-progress for which revenue has been recognized, but for which we have not yet earned the right to bill the customer for work performed to-date.
Of the unbilled receivables from commercial and international customers at January 31, 2019 and July 31, 2018, approximately $1,545,000 and $1,558,000, respectively, relates to a large over-the-horizon microwave systems contract with our large U.S. prime contractor customer (all of which related to our North African country end-customer).
As of January 31, 2019 and July 31, 2018, the amount of inventory directly related to long-term contracts (including contracts-in-progress) was $1,337,000 and $1,249,000, respectively, and the amount of inventory related to contracts from third party commercial customers who outsource their manufacturing to us was $1,641,000 and $1,310,000, respectively.
Accrued warranty obligations as of January 31, 2019 relate to estimated liabilities for assurance-type warranty coverage that we provide to our customers.
During the three and six months ended January 31, 2019, we made cash payments of $181,000 related to such facility exit cost accrual.
As of January 31, 2019, the remaining estimated facility exit costs amounted to $1,192,000, of which $811,000 and $381,000, respectively, was included in "accrued expenses and other current liabilities" and "other liabilities (non-current)" on our Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet.
In connection with the establishment of our new Credit Facility, during the three months ended October 31, 2018, we wrote-off $3,217,000 of deferred financing costs primarily related to the Term Loan Facility portion of our Prior Credit Facility and capitalized deferred financing costs of $1,812,000 related to the new Credit Facility.
At January 31, 2019, we had $2,331,000 of standby letters of credit outstanding under our Credit Facility related to guarantees of future performance on certain customer contracts and no outstanding commercial letters of credit.
During the six months ended January 31, 2019 and 2018, we recorded benefits of $130,000 and $62,000, respectively, which primarily represents the recoupment of certain share units.
As a result, 9,345 net shares of our common stock were issued during the six months ended January 31, 2019 after reduction of shares retained to satisfy the exercise price and minimum statutory tax withholding requirements.
As of January 31, 2019, the number of outstanding performance shares included in the above table, and the related compensation expense prior to consideration of estimated pre-vesting forfeitures, assume achievement of the pre-established goals at a target level.
The fair value of performance shares, RSUs, restricted stock and share units is determined using the closing market price of our common stock on the date of grant, less the present value of any estimated future dividend equivalents such awards are not entitled to receive and an applicable estimated discount for post vesting restrictions.
During the three months ended October 31, 2018, we exited our Government Solutions segment's manufacturing facility located in Tampa, Florida and recorded a related charge of $1,373,000 in selling, general and administrative expenses on our Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations.
In connection with our ongoing repositioning, we recorded $3,886,000 of estimated contract settlement costs in our Commercial Solutions segment during the three and six months ended January 31, 2019.
During the three and six months ended January 31, 2019, unallocated expenses also include $1,778,000 and $2,908,000, respectively, of acquisition plan expenses primarily related to our acquisition of Solacom and our efforts to acquire another small but growing technology solutions company which we believe will further complement our product offerings.
In addition, offsetting unallocated expenses for the three and six months ended January 31, 2019 is a $3,204,000 benefit as a result of a favorable ruling issued by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit related to a legacy TCS intellectual property matter.
In addition, during the three months ended October 31, 2018, we recorded a $3,217,000 loss from the write-off of deferred financing costs primarily related to the Term Loan Facility portion of our Prior Credit Facility.
In making this assessment, we considered, among other things, expectations of projected net sales and cash flows, assumptions impacting the weighted average cost of capital, trends in trading multiples of comparable companies, changes in our stock price and changes in the carrying values of our reporting units with goodwill.
As a result of the Federal Circuit Courtâ€™s decision, during the three and six months ended January 31, 2019, we reduced our accrued legal costs related to this matter and recorded a $3,204,000 benefit in the Condensed Consolidated Statement of Operations.
During the three months ended January 31, 2019, a customer that purchased a TCS 911 call handling software solution in December 2014 (which was more than one year prior to our acquisition of TCS) informed us that it experienced several network outages and that it would seek indemnification for any claims made against it as a result of such outages.

Excluding the net financial impact of the aforementioned steps, our consolidated operating income for the second quarter of fiscal 2019 would have been $14.9 million, or 9.1% of consolidated net sales, an improvement from the amounts and related percentages achieved in the first quarter of fiscal 2019 and the second quarter of fiscal 2018.
Based on our strong fiscal 2019 year-to-date performance, our Business Outlook for Fiscal 2019 has improved since December 6, 2018 (the date we filed our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q with the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC")) and we are increasing our targeted goals for consolidated net sales and Adjusted EBITDA.
After considering the impact of all GAAP operating expenses, we anticipate consolidated operating income, in dollars, to be higher than the $35.1 million we achieved in fiscal 2018 and, as a percentage of consolidated net sales, to be similar to the 6.2% we achieved in fiscal 2018.
Consolidated net sales were $164.1 million and $133.7 million for the three months ended January 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively, representing an increase of $30.4 million, or 22.7%.
Net sales in our Commercial Solutions segment were $86.7 million for the three months ended January 31, 2019, as compared to $85.8 million for the three months ended January 31, 2018, an increase of $0.9 million, or 1.1%.
Our Commercial Solutions segment represented 52.8% of consolidated net sales for the three months ended January 31, 2019 as compared to 64.2% for the three months ended January 31, 2018.
Net sales in our Government Solutions segment were $77.4 million for the three months ended January 31, 2019 as compared to $47.9 million for the three months ended January 31, 2018, a significant increase of $29.5 million, or 61.6%.
Our Government Solutions segment represented 47.2% of consolidated net sales for the three months ended January 31, 2019, as compared to 35.8% for the three months ended January 31, 2018.
Based on our current assessment, we expect net sales in our Government Solutions segment in each of the third and fourth quarters of fiscal 2019 to be lower than the amount we achieved in the second quarter.
Overall, based on fiscal 2019 performance to date, the mix and anticipated timing of performance on orders in backlog and expected new orders, we anticipate that fiscal 2019 net sales for our Government Solutions segment will be significantly higher than fiscal 2018.
International net sales for the three months ended January 31, 2019 and 2018 (which include sales to U.S. domestic companies for inclusion in products that are sold to international customers) were $37.4 million and $35.4 million, respectively.
Our Government Solutions segment's gross profit, as a percentage of related segment net sales, for the three months ended January 31, 2019 was higher than the level we achieved in the three months ended January 31, 2018.
This increase was primarily due to overall favorable product mix changes during the most recent fiscal quarter, including a higher percentage of segment net sales related to our over-the-horizon microwave systems products.
Based on the mix and anticipated timing of shipments and performance related to orders currently in our backlog and the mix and timing of expected new orders, gross profit for this segment, as a percentage of related segment net sales, for fiscal 2019 is expected to be comparable to the level achieved in fiscal 2018.
As a percentage of consolidated net sales, selling, general and administrative expenses were 19.5% and 20.3% for the three months ended January 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively.

For the three months ended January 31, 2019 and 2018, research and development expenses of $11.9 million and $11.4 million, respectively, related to our Commercial Solutions segment, and $2.0 million in both periods, related to our Government Solutions segment.
Based on our current spending plans, we expect fiscal 2019 research and development expenses, in dollars, to be higher and, as a percentage of consolidated net sales, to be similar to fiscal 2018.
The slight decrease in our Commercial Solutions segmentâ€™s operating income, both in dollars and as a percentage of related segment net sales, reflects $3.9 million of estimated contract settlement costs, as discussed above.
Excluding such charge, operating income in our Commercial Solutions segment for the three months ended January 31, 2019 would have been $12.7 million, or 14.6% of related segment net sales.
That increase over the three months ended January 31, 2018, both in dollars and as a percentage of related segment net sales, is due primarily to higher net sales at higher gross margins, lower amortization of intangibles and the benefit of cost reduction actions previously initiated, partially offset by higher research and development expenses, as discussed above.
Looking forward, excluding the $3.9 million charge, we expect fiscal 2019 operating income, both in dollars and as a percentage of related segment net sales, to be similar to fiscal 2018.
The significant increase in our Government Solutions segmentâ€™s operating income, both in dollars and as a percentage of related segment net sales, was primarily due to significantly higher net sales at higher gross margins, as discussed above.

Excluding the $1.8 million of acquisition plan expenses, $3.9 million expense for estimated contract settlement costs and $3.2 million benefit related to a legacy TCS intellectual property matter, as discussed above, consolidated operating income would have been $14.9 million, or 9.1% of consolidated net sales in the second quarter of fiscal 2019.
The significant increase in consolidated Adjusted EBITDA, both in dollars and as a percentage of consolidated net sales, during the three months ended January 31, 2019 as compared to the three months ended January 31, 2018 is primarily attributable to significantly higher net sales, favorable product mix changes in both of our segments and the benefit of cost reduction actions previously initiated, as discussed above.
Our Adjusted EBITDA is a Non-GAAP measure that represents earnings (loss) before income taxes, interest (income) and other, write-off of deferred financing costs, interest expense, amortization of stock-based compensation, amortization of intangibles, depreciation expense, estimated contract settlement costs, settlement of intellectual property litigation, acquisition plan expenses or strategic alternatives analysis expenses, facility exit costs and other.

Our Government Solutions segment represented 49.3% of consolidated net sales for the six months ended January 31, 2019, as compared to 36.6% for the six months ended January 31, 2018.
Net sales during the six months ended January 31, 2019 benefited from work performed on our $31.0 million order received in fiscal 2018 for Modular Transportable Transmission System ("MTTS") troposcatter terminals to be utilized as part of a deployable communications network for an Asia Pacific military service and a $9.1 million contract to supply another foreign military with our over-the-horizon microwave systems.
Based on our current assessment, we expect net sales in our Government Solutions segment in each of the third and fourth quarters of fiscal 2019 to be lower than the amount we achieved in the second quarter.
Overall, based on fiscal 2019 performance to date, the mix and anticipated timing of performance on orders in backlog and expected new orders, we anticipate that fiscal 2019 net sales for our Government Solutions segment will be significantly higher than fiscal 2018.
The six months ended January 31, 2018 also included a favorable warranty settlement which resulted in a reduction of $0.6 million to cost of sales in our Unallocated segment.
Our Government Solutions segment's gross profit, as a percentage of related segment net sales, for the six months ended January 31, 2019 was higher than the level we achieved in the six months ended January 31, 2018.

Based on our current spending plans, we expect fiscal 2019 selling, general and administrative expenses, in dollars, to be higher and, as a percentage of consolidated net sales, to be similar to the percentage achieved in fiscal 2018.
As a percentage of consolidated net sales, research and development expenses were 8.4% and 10.7% for the six months ended January 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively.
Based on our current spending plans, we expect fiscal 2019 research and development expenses, in dollars, to be higher and, as a percentage of consolidated net sales, to be similar to fiscal 2018.
The increase in our Commercial Solutions segmentâ€™s operating income, both in dollars and as a percentage of related segment net sales, was primarily due to higher net sales at higher gross margins, lower amortization of intangibles and the benefit of cost reduction actions previously initiated, offset in part by a $3.9 million charge for estimated contract settlement costs and slightly higher research and development expenses, as discussed above.
Looking forward, excluding the $3.9 million charge, we expect fiscal 2019 operating income, both in dollars and as a percentage of related segment net sales, to be similar to fiscal 2018.

Excluding the $3.9 million of estimated contract settlement costs, $1.4 million of facility exit costs, $2.9 million of acquisition plan expenses and $3.2 million benefit related to a legacy TCS intellectual property matter, as discussed above, consolidated operating income would have been $24.7 million, or 7.6% of consolidated net sales for the six months ended January 31, 2019.
During the six months ended January 31, 2018, we recorded a net discrete tax benefit of $14.0 million, resulting from the passage of Tax Reform which required us to remeasure our deferred tax assets and liabilities (including liabilities associated with the non-deductible amortization related to our intangible assets).
The significant increase in consolidated Adjusted EBITDA, both in dollars and as a percentage of consolidated net sales, during the six months ended January 31, 2019 as compared to the six months ended January 31, 2018 is primarily attributable to significantly higher net sales, favorable product mix changes in both of our segments and the benefit of cost reduction actions previously initiated, as discussed above.
Our Adjusted EBITDA is a Non-GAAP measure that represents earnings (loss) before income taxes, interest (income) and other, write-off of deferred financing costs, interest expense, amortization of stock-based compensation, amortization of intangibles, depreciation expense, estimated contract settlement costs, settlement of intellectual property litigation, acquisition plan expenses or strategic alternatives analysis expenses, facility exit costs and other.
