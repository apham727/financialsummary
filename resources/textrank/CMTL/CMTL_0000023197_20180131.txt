The fair value of the non-current portion of our Secured Credit Facility as of January 31, 2018 approximates its carrying amount due to its variable interest rate and pricing grid that is dependent upon our leverage ratio as of the end of each fiscal quarter.
Weighted average stock options, RSUs and restricted stock outstanding of 1,812,000 and 2,173,000 for the three months ended January 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively, and 1,821,000 and 2,305,000 for the six months ended January 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively, were not included in our diluted EPS calculation because their effect would have been anti-dilutive.
Of the unbilled receivables from commercial and international customers at January 31, 2018 and July 31, 2017, approximately $2,012,000 and $2,995,000, respectively, relates to a large over-the-horizon microwave system contract with our large U.S. prime contractor customer (all of which related to our North African country end-customer).
At January 31, 2018, we had $2,660,000 of standby letters of credit outstanding under our Secured Credit Facility, as amended, related to our guarantees of future performance on certain customer contracts and no outstanding commercial letters of credit.
Diluted earnings per share - Prior to the adoption of ASU 2016-09, in addition to considering the amount an employee must pay upon assumed exercise of stock-based awards and the amount of stock-based compensation cost attributed to future services and not yet recognized, when calculating our diluted earnings per share, the assumed proceeds also included the amount of excess tax benefits, if any, that would have been credited to additional paid-in capital assuming exercise of in-the-money stock-based awards.
Stock-based compensation for equity-classified awards is measured at the date of grant, based on an estimate of the fair value of the award and is generally expensed over the vesting period of the award.
At January 31, 2018, unrecognized stock-based compensation of $9,015,000, net of estimated forfeitures of $902,000, is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of 3.0 years.
Total stock-based compensation capitalized and included in ending inventory at both January 31, 2018 and July 31, 2017 was $12,000.
Stock options outstanding as of January 31, 2018 have exercise prices ranging from $20.90 to $33.94, representing the fair market value of our common stock on the date of grant, a contractual term of five or ten years and a vesting period of three or five years.
As there were no exercises during the six months ended January 31, 2018 and 2017, there were no net settlements of stock options or the related issuance of common stock during the respective periods.
Performance shares granted to employees prior to fiscal 2014 generally vest over a 5.3 year period, beginning on the date of grant once pre-established performance goals were attained, and are convertible into shares of our common stock at the time of vesting, on a one-for-one basis for no cash consideration.
As of January 31, 2018, the number of outstanding performance shares included in the above table, and the related compensation expense prior to consideration of estimated pre-vesting forfeitures, assume achievement of the pre-established goals at a target level.
RSUs and restricted stock granted to non-employee directors have a vesting period of three years and are convertible into shares of our common stock generally at the time of termination, on a one-for-one basis for no cash consideration, or earlier under certain circumstances.
Share units granted prior to July 31, 2017 were vested when issued and are convertible into shares of our common stock generally at the time of termination, on a one-for-one basis for no cash consideration, or earlier under certain circumstances.
Share units granted on or after July 31, 2017 were granted to certain employees in lieu of fiscal 2017 non-equity incentive compensation and are convertible into shares of our common stock on the one-year anniversary of the grant date.
The fair value of performance shares, RSUs, restricted stock and share units is determined using the closing market price of our common stock on the date of grant, less the present value of any estimated future dividend equivalents such awards are not entitled to receive and an applicable estimated discount for post vesting restrictions.
We recorded $71,000 of income tax expense in our Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations for the six months ended January 31, 2018, which represents net income tax shortfalls from the settlement of stock-based awards and the reversal of deferred tax assets associated with expired and unexercised stock-based awards.
During the six months ended January 31, 2017, net income tax shortfalls from similar items totaled $601,000 and, pursuant to prior GAAP, were recorded as a reduction to additional paid-in capital.
Included in domestic sales, are sales to Verizon which represented 10.5% and 11.1% of consolidated net sales for the three and six months ended January 31, 2018, respectively.
International sales for the three months ended January 31, 2018 and 2017 (which include sales to U.S. domestic companies for inclusion in products that are sold to international customers) were $35,400,000 and $44,623,000, respectively.
International sales for the six months ended January 31, 2018 and 2017 (which include sales to U.S. domestic companies for inclusion in products that are sold to international customers) were $63,714,000 and $82,457,000, respectively.
Interest expense for the three and six months ended January 31, 2018 and 2017 includes $2,350,000 and $4,815,000, respectively, and $2,708,000 and $5,883,000, respectively, related to our Secured Credit Facility, as amended, and includes the amortization of deferred financing costs.
In making this assessment, we considered, among other things, expectations of projected net sales and cash flows, assumptions impacting the weighted average cost of capital, trends in trading multiples of comparable companies, changes in our stock price and changes in the carrying values of our reporting units with goodwill.
Finally, we compared our estimates of fair values to our August 1, 2017 total public market capitalization and assessed implied control premiums based on our common stock price of $18.47 as of August 1, 2017.

In line with our original Business Outlook for Fiscal 2018, our fourth quarter of fiscal 2018 is expected to be the peak quarter - by far - for consolidated net sales, GAAP operating income and Adjusted EBITDA.
We currently believe that our third quarter consolidated net sales and Adjusted EBITDA will be approximately 10.0% higher than the related amounts we achieved in the second quarter of fiscal 2018.
GAAP operating income and Adjusted EBITDA, as a percentage of consolidated third quarter fiscal 2018 net sales, are expected to approximate 4.0% and 11.0%, respectively, with significant increases in each metric in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018.
Net sales in our Commercial Solutions segment were $85.8 million for the three months ended January 31, 2018, as compared to $82.1 million for the three months ended January 31, 2017, an increase of $3.7 million, or 4.5%.
Our Commercial Solutions segment represented 64.2% of consolidated net sales for the three months ended January 31, 2018 as compared to 59.1% for the three months ended January 31, 2017.
Net sales in our Government Solutions segment were $47.9 million for the three months ended January 31, 2018 as compared to $56.9 million for the three months ended January 31, 2017, a decrease of $9.0 million, or 15.8%.
Our Government Solutions segment represented 35.8% of consolidated net sales for the three months ended January 31, 2018, as compared to 40.9% for the three months ended January 31, 2017.
This decrease in gross profit dollars was largely driven by lower net sales in our Government Solutions segment, including the absence of $2.5 million of BFT-1 intellectual property license fees, both of which are discussed above.
Gross profit, as a percentage of consolidated net sales, was 38.0% for the three months ended January 31, 2018 as compared to 38.3% for the three months ended January 31, 2017.
Excluding the $2.5 million of intellectual property license fees that we earned supporting the U.S. Army’s BFT-1 system, gross profit, as a percentage of consolidated net sales, for the three months ended January 31, 2017 would have been 37.1%.
The increase from 37.1% to 38.0% in fiscal 2018 was primarily driven by favorable product mix changes including a greater percentage of our consolidated net sales during the second quarter of fiscal 2018 occurring in our Commercial Solutions segment.
Our Commercial Solutions segment's gross profit, as a percentage of related segment net sales, for the three months ended January 31, 2018 was higher than the comparable prior year period.
As a percentage of consolidated net sales, selling, general and administrative expenses were 20.3% and 22.3% for the three months ended January 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively.
Based on our current spending plans, we expect fiscal 2018 selling, general and administrative expenses, as a percentage of consolidated net sales, to be comparable to fiscal 2017.
As a percentage of consolidated net sales, research and development expenses were 10.0% and 9.6% for the three months ended January 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively.
During the three months ended January 31, 2017, we recorded a favorable adjustment to operating income of $10.0 million, net of estimated legal fees, to reflect a lower loss than originally estimated for a TCS intellectual property matter which was settled during that period.
The increase during the most recent fiscal quarter in our Commercial Solutions segment’s operating income, in dollars and as a percentage of related segment net sales, was primarily due to higher net sales, overall favorable product mix changes and the benefit of cost reduction actions previously initiated, as discussed above.
We expect fiscal 2018 operating income in our Commercial Solutions segment, in dollars and as a percentage of related segment net sales, to increase as compared to fiscal 2017.
The expected operating loss in our Government Solutions segment during the three months ended January 31, 2018 was driven by lower net sales, most notably significantly lower over-the-horizon microwave systems sales and the absence of $2.5 million of BFT-1 intellectual property license fees, as discussed above.
As such, operating income for this segment, in dollars and as a percentage of related segment net sales, is expected to be higher in fiscal 2018 than in fiscal 2017.
Unallocated operating expenses for the three months ended January 31, 2018 were $3.7 million as compared to operating income of $4.6 million for the three months ended January 31, 2017 (which includes a favorable adjustment of $10.0 million, as discussed above).
Given our expected sales growth on a consolidated basis in fiscal 2018 and current spending plans, our unallocated operating expenses in fiscal 2018 are expected to be comparable to fiscal 2017 unallocated operating expenses of $24.4 million, prior to the favorable adjustments discussed above.
On a consolidated basis, we are targeting to achieve operating income, as a percentage of net sales, of approximately 5.0% in fiscal 2018, which compares favorably with the 3.3% of consolidated net sales we achieved in fiscal 2017 (excluding the $18.8 million of favorable adjustments to operating income discussed above).
Consolidated operating income, as a percentage of expected consolidated third quarter fiscal 2018 net sales, is expected to approximate 4.0% and increase significantly in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018.
The increase in consolidated Adjusted EBITDA during the three months ended January 31, 2018 as compared to the three months ended January 31, 2017 was primarily attributable to overall product mix changes (including a higher percentage of consolidated net sales occurring in the Commercial Solutions segment as compared to the prior year period) and lower unallocated expenses, all of which are discussed above.
The increase in our Commercial Solutions segment's Adjusted EBITDA, in dollars and as a percentage of related segment net sales, during the most recent fiscal quarter was primarily due to higher net sales, overall favorable product mix changes and the benefit of cost reduction actions previously initiated, as discussed above.
The decrease in our Government Solutions segment's Adjusted EBITDA, in dollars and as a percentage of related segment net sales, during the most recent fiscal quarter was primarily driven by lower net sales, most notably significantly lower sales of over-the-horizon microwave systems products and the absence of $2.5 million of BFT-1 intellectual property license fees, as discussed above.
An anticipated increase in this segment’s sales during each of the third and fourth quarters of fiscal 2018 is expected to drive an increase in Adjusted EBITDA, in both dollars and as a percentage of related segment net sales, from the level we achieved in our most recent quarter.
In addition, despite the absence of $6.7 million of BFT-1 intellectual property license fees (which we no longer earn given the expiration of such contract in March 2017), we expect Adjusted EBITDA, as a percentage of fiscal 2018 consolidated net sales, to be comparable to the 12.8% we achieved in fiscal 2017.
Consolidated net sales were $255.3 million and $274.8 million for the six months ended January 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively, representing a decrease of $19.5 million, or 7.1%.
Net sales in our Commercial Solutions segment were $161.9 million for the six months ended January 31, 2018, as compared to $158.3 million for the six months ended January 31, 2017, an increase of $3.6 million, or 2.3%.
Our Commercial Solutions segment represented 63.4% of consolidated net sales for the six months ended January 31, 2018 as compared to 57.6% for the six months ended January 31, 2017.
Net sales in our Government Solutions segment were $93.4 million for the six months ended January 31, 2018 as compared to $116.5 million for the six months ended January 31, 2017, a decrease of $23.1 million, or 19.8%.
Our Government Solutions segment represented 36.6% of consolidated net sales for the six months ended January 31, 2018, as compared to 42.4% for the six months ended January 31, 2017.
The decrease of $6.8 million in gross profit dollars was largely driven by lower net sales in our Government Solutions segment, including the absence of $5.0 million of BFT-1 intellectual property license fees, both of which are discussed above.
Gross profit, as a percentage of consolidated net sales, increased from 38.3% for the six months ended January 31, 2017 to 38.6% for the six months ended January 31, 2018.
The increase in gross profit percentage is largely attributable to a greater percentage of our consolidated net sales during the six months ended January 31, 2018 occurring in our Commercial Solutions segment, which historically achieves higher gross margins than our Government Solutions segment, as well as a favorable warranty settlement during the six months ended January 31, 2018 that resulted in a $0.7 million reduction to cost of sales (which is reflected in our unallocated segment).
Our Commercial Solutions segment's gross profit, as a percentage of related segment net sales, for the six months ended January 31, 2018 was higher than the comparable prior year period.
As a percentage of consolidated net sales, selling, general and administrative expenses were 21.8% and 23.2% for the six months ended January 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively.
Based on our current spending plans, we expect fiscal 2018 selling, general and administrative expenses, as a percentage of consolidated net sales, to be comparable to fiscal 2017.
As a percentage of consolidated net sales, research and development expenses were 10.7% and 10.0% for the six months ended January 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively.
Based on our current spending plans, we expect fiscal 2018 research and development expenses, as a percentage of consolidated net sales, to be comparable to fiscal 2017.
During the six months ended January 31, 2017, we recorded a favorable adjustment to operating income of $10.0 million, net of estimated legal fees, to reflect a lower loss than originally estimated for a TCS intellectual property matter which was settled during that period.
The increase during the most recent six month period in our Commercial Solutions segment’s operating income, in dollars and as a percentage of related segment net sales, was primarily due to higher net sales, overall favorable product mix changes and the benefit of cost reduction actions previously initiated, as discussed above.
We expect fiscal 2018 operating income in our Commercial Solutions segment, in dollars and as a percentage of related segment net sales, to increase as compared to fiscal 2017.
The expected operating loss in our Government Solutions segment during the six months ended January 31, 2018 was driven by lower net sales, most notably significantly lower over-the-horizon microwave systems sales and the absence of $5.0 million of BFT-1 intellectual property license fees, as discussed above.
As such, operating income for this segment, in dollars and as a percentage of related segment net sales, is expected to be higher in fiscal 2018 when compared to fiscal 2017.
Given our expected sales growth on a consolidated basis in fiscal 2018 and current spending plans, our unallocated operating expenses in fiscal 2018 are expected to be comparable to fiscal 2017 unallocated operating expenses of $24.4 million, prior to the favorable adjustments discussed above.
We are targeting to achieve operating income, as a percentage of consolidated net sales, of approximately 5.0% in fiscal 2018, which compares favorably with the 3.3% of consolidated net sales we achieved in fiscal 2017 (excluding the $18.8 million of favorable adjustments to operating income discussed above).
Consolidated operating income, as a percentage of expected consolidated third quarter fiscal 2018 net sales, is expected to approximate 4.0% and increase significantly in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018.
The increase in consolidated Adjusted EBITDA during the six months ended January 31, 2018 as compared to the six months ended January 31, 2017 was primarily attributable to overall favorable product mix changes (including a higher percentage of consolidated net sales, occurring in the Commercial Solutions segment as compared to the prior year period) and lower unallocated expenses, all of which are discussed above.
The increase in our Commercial Solutions segment's Adjusted EBITDA, in dollars and as a percentage of related segment net sales, during the most recent six month period, was primarily attributable to higher net sales, overall favorable product mix changes and the benefit of cost reduction actions previously initiated, as discussed above.
The decrease in our Government Solutions segment's Adjusted EBITDA, in dollars and as a percentage of related segment net sales, during the most recent six month period was primarily driven by lower net sales, most notably significantly lower sales of over-the-horizon microwave systems products and the absence of $5.0 million of BFT-1 intellectual property license fees, as discussed above.
An anticipated increase in this segment’s sales during each of the third and fourth quarters of fiscal 2018 is expected to drive an increase in Adjusted EBITDA, in both dollars and as a percentage of related net sales, from the level we achieved in our most recent quarter.
In addition, despite the absence of $6.7 million of BFT-1 intellectual property license fees (which we no longer earn given the expiration of such contract in March 2017), we expect Adjusted EBITDA, as a percentage of fiscal 2018 consolidated net sales, to be comparable to the 12.8% we achieved in fiscal 2017.
