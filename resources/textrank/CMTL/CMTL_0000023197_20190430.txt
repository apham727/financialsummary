We are accounting for the acquisition of Solacom under the acquisition method of accounting in accordance with FASB ASC 805, "Business Combinations." The purchase price was allocated to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed, based on their preliminary fair value as of February 28, 2019, pursuant to the business combination accounting rules.
The primary areas of the purchase price allocation not yet finalized include the purchase price (due to customary provisions in the purchase agreement related to adjustments to net working capital as of the acquisition date), a final assessment of accrued warranty obligations, income taxes and residual goodwill.
On April 29, 2019, we completed the acquisition of a state and local government NG-911 business, pursuant to the Asset Purchase Agreement, dated as of April 29, 2019, by and among General Dynamics Information Technology, Inc., Comtech and Comtech NextGen LLC, a Delaware limited liability company and indirect, wholly-owned subsidiary of Comtech.
The purchase price was allocated to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed, based on their preliminary fair value as of April 29, 2019, pursuant to the business combination accounting rules.
The preliminary fair value of customer relationships and contracts was based on the value of the discounted cash flows that the related intangible asset could be expected to generate in the future.
The preliminary fair value of other liabilities was based on the difference in discounted cash flows related to remaining performance obligations under a certain acquired contract as compared to current market terms for similar arrangements that a market participant would expect.
The primary areas of the purchase price allocation not yet finalized include the purchase price (due to customary provisions in the asset purchase agreement related to adjustments to net working capital as of the acquisition date), the estimated fair value of intangible assets acquired, intangible liability assumed, a final assessment of accrued warranty obligations, income taxes and residual goodwill.
For over time contracts using a cost-to-cost measure of progress, we have an estimate at completion ("EAC") process in which management reviews the progress and execution of our performance obligations.
Since certain contracts extend over a long period of time, the impact of revisions in revenue and or cost estimates during the progress of work may impact current period earnings through a cumulative adjustment.
These services are typically recognized as a series of services performed over the contract term using the straight-line method, or based on our customersâ€™ actual usage of the networks and platforms which we provide.
The contracts related to these product lines do not meet the requirements for over time revenue recognition because our customers cannot utilize the equipment for its intended purpose during any phase of our manufacturing process; customers do not simultaneously receive and or consume the benefits provided by our performance; customers do not control the asset (i.e., prior to delivery, customers cannot direct the use of the asset, sell or exchange the equipment, etc.); and, although many of our contracts have termination for convenience clauses and or an enforceable right to payment for performance completed to date, our performance creates an asset with an alternative use through the point of delivery.
The estimation of this variable consideration and determination of whether to include estimated amounts in the transaction price are based largely on an assessment of our anticipated performance and all information (e.g., historical, current and forecasted) that is reasonably available to us.
If the standalone selling price is not observable through past transactions, we estimate the standalone selling price taking into account available information such as market conditions, including geographic or regional specific factors, competitive positioning, internal costs, profit objectives and internally approved pricing guidelines related to the performance obligations.
Except for the U.S., no individual country (including sales to U.S. domestic companies for inclusion in products that are sold to a foreign country) represented more than 10% of consolidated net sales for the three and nine months ended April 30, 2019 and 2018.
For certain contracts with provisions that are intended to protect customers in the event we do not satisfy our performance obligations, billings occur subsequent to revenue recognition, resulting in what we have historically presented as unbilled receivables.
Of the total contract liabilities at August 1, 2018, $30,061,000 was recognized as revenue during the nine months ended April 30, 2019.
As commissions payable to our internal sales and marketing employees or contractors are contingent upon multiple factors, such commissions are not considered direct costs to obtain or fulfill a contract with a customer and are expensed as incurred in selling, general and administrative expenses on our Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations.
Therefore, such types of commissions are included in total estimated costs at completion for such contracts and expensed over time through cost of sales on our Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations.
Unbilled receivables as of April 30, 2019 relate to contracts-in-progress for which revenue has been recognized, but for which we have not yet earned the right to bill the customer for work performed to-date.
As of April 30, 2019 and July 31, 2018, the amount of inventory directly related to long-term contracts (including contracts-in-progress) was $2,513,000 and $1,249,000, respectively, and the amount of inventory related to contracts from third party commercial customers who outsource their manufacturing to us was $1,822,000 and $1,310,000, respectively.
Accrued warranty obligations as of April 30, 2019 relate to estimated liabilities for assurance-type warranty coverage that we provide to our customers.
We record a liability for estimated warranty expense based on historical claims, product failure rates, a consideration of contractual obligations, future costs to resolve software issues and other factors.
During the nine months ended April 30, 2019, we made cash payments of $358,000 related to such facility exit cost accrual.
As of April 30, 2019, the remaining estimated facility exit costs amounted to $1,015,000, of which $634,000 and $381,000, respectively, was included in "accrued expenses and other current liabilities" and "other liabilities (non-current)" on our Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet.
In connection with this ongoing repositioning, we recorded $2,465,000 and $6,351,000, respectively, of estimated contract settlement costs in our Commercial Solutions segment during the three and nine months ended April 30, 2019.
At April 30, 2019, we had $1,754,000 of standby letters of credit outstanding under our Credit Facility related to guarantees of future performance on certain customer contracts and no outstanding commercial letters of credit.
Stock options outstanding as of April 30, 2019 have exercise prices ranging from $20.90 to $33.94, representing the fair market value of our common stock on the date of grant, a contractual term of five or ten years and a vesting period of three or five years.
As of April 30, 2019, the number of outstanding performance shares included in the above table, and the related compensation expense prior to consideration of estimated pre-vesting forfeitures, assume achievement of the pre-established goals at a target level.
The fair value of performance shares, RSUs, restricted stock and share units is determined using the closing market price of our common stock on the date of grant, less the present value of any estimated future dividend equivalents such awards are not entitled to receive and an applicable estimated discount for post vesting restrictions.
In addition, during the three months ended October 31, 2018, we recorded a $3,217,000 loss from the write-off of deferred financing costs primarily related to the Term Loan Facility portion of our Prior Credit Facility.
As discussed further in Note (2) -"Acquisitions," the goodwill resulting from the acquisitions of Solacom and the GD NG-911 business was based upon preliminary valuation and estimates and assumptions that are subject to change within the purchase price allocation period (generally one year from the acquisition date).

In connection with this repositioning, we recorded $2.5 million of estimated contract settlement costs in our Commercial Solutions segment during the three months ended April 30, 2019.
Excluding the financial impact of these expenses incurred during the third quarter of fiscal 2019, our consolidated operating income would have been $15.5 million, or 9.1% of consolidated net sales.
Based on our strong operating performance to-date and revenue contributions from the acquisition of the GD NG-911 business, our fiscal 2019 consolidated net sales are now expected to be higher than previously expected, with fourth quarter consolidated net sales approximating $164.6 million and total fiscal 2019 consolidated net sales approximating $660.0 million.
Consolidated net sales were $170.4 million and $147.9 million for the three months ended April 30, 2019 and 2018, respectively, representing an increase of $22.5 million, or 15.2%.
Net sales in our Commercial Solutions segment were $89.6 million for the three months ended April 30, 2019, as compared to $89.9 million for the three months ended April 30, 2018, a slight decrease of $0.3 million.
Our Commercial Solutions segment represented 52.6% of consolidated net sales for the three months ended April 30, 2019 as compared to 60.8% for the three months ended April 30, 2018.
We believe that overall market conditions for these products remain favorable and, based on our year-to-date performance, we expect fiscal 2019 to be a year of net sales growth for our safety and security technology solutions as compared to fiscal 2018.
Net sales in our Government Solutions segment were $80.8 million for the three months ended April 30, 2019 as compared to $57.9 million for the three months ended April 30, 2018, a significant increase of $22.9 million, or 39.6%.
Our Government Solutions segment represented 47.4% of consolidated net sales for the three months ended April 30, 2019, as compared to 39.2% for the three months ended April 30, 2018.
However, based on fiscal 2019 performance to-date, the mix and anticipated timing of performance on orders in backlog and expected new orders, we anticipate that fiscal 2019 net sales for our Government Solutions segment will be significantly higher than fiscal 2018.
International net sales for the three months ended April 30, 2019 and 2018 (which include sales to U.S. domestic companies for inclusion in products that are sold to international customers) were $45.0 million and $36.3 million, respectively.
As a percentage of consolidated net sales, selling, general and administrative expenses were 19.6% and 20.6% for the three months ended April 30, 2019 and 2018, respectively.
As a percentage of consolidated net sales, research and development expenses were 7.9% and 8.7% for the three months ended April 30, 2019 and 2018, respectively.
For the three months ended April 30, 2019 and 2018, research and development expenses of $11.6 million and $11.3 million, respectively, related to our Commercial Solutions segment, and $1.8 million and $1.4 million, respectively, related to our Government Solutions segment.
The significant decrease in our Commercial Solutions segmentâ€™s operating income, both in dollars and as a percentage of related segment net sales, reflects $2.5 million of estimated contract settlement costs, as discussed above.
Excluding such charge, operating income in our Commercial Solutions segment for the three months ended April 30, 2019 would have been $10.6 million, or 11.8% of related segment net sales.
The decrease from the three months ended April 30, 2018, both in dollars and as a percentage of related segment net sales, is due primarily to a lower gross profit percentage and slightly higher research and development expenses, offset in part by lower amortization of intangibles, as discussed above.
Looking forward, excluding total estimated contract settlement costs, we expect fiscal 2019 operating income, both in dollars and as a percentage of related segment net sales, to be similar to fiscal 2018.
The significant increase in our Government Solutions segmentâ€™s operating income, both in dollars and as a percentage of related segment net sales, was primarily due to significantly higher net sales, offset in part by higher research and development expenses, as discussed above.
Excluding the $1.7 million of acquisition plan expenses and $2.5 million expense for estimated contract settlement costs, as discussed above, consolidated operating income would have been $15.5 million, or 9.1% of consolidated net sales in the third quarter of fiscal 2019.
Looking forward, after considering the impact of all actual and expected GAAP operating expenses, consolidated GAAP operating income in fiscal 2019, in dollars, is expected to be similar to the $35.1 million and, as a percentage of consolidated net sales, to be lower than the 6.2% that we achieved in fiscal 2018.
Such GAAP operating income target includes the additional acquisition plan expenses and estimated contract settlement costs of approximately $2.2 million expected during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019.
The increase in consolidated Adjusted EBITDA, in dollars, during the three months ended April 30, 2019 as compared to the three months ended April 30, 2018 reflects significantly higher net sales in our Government Solutions segment, as discussed above.
The decrease in consolidated Adjusted EBITDA, as a percentage of consolidated net sales, during the three months ended April 30, 2019 as compared to the three months ended April 30, 2018 reflects product mix changes in both of our segments, as discussed above.
The significant increase in our Government Solutions segment's Adjusted EBITDA, both in dollars and as a percentage of related segment net sales, was primarily driven by significantly higher net sales, offset in part by higher research and development expenses, as discussed above.
Our Adjusted EBITDA is a Non-GAAP measure that represents earnings (loss) before income taxes, interest (income) and other, write-off of deferred financing costs, interest expense, amortization of stock-based compensation, amortization of intangible assets, depreciation expense, estimated contract settlement costs, settlement of intellectual property litigation, acquisition plan expenses or strategic alternatives analysis expenses, facility exit costs and other.
Consolidated net sales were $495.4 million and $403.2 million for the nine months ended April 30, 2019 and 2018, respectively, representing a significant increase of $92.2 million, or 22.9%.
Net sales in our Commercial Solutions segment were $254.3 million for the nine months ended April 30, 2019, as compared to $251.9 million for the nine months ended April 30, 2018, an increase of $2.4 million, or 1.0%.
Our Commercial Solutions segment represented 51.3% of consolidated net sales for the nine months ended April 30, 2019 as compared to 62.5% for the nine months ended April 30, 2018.
Net sales in our Government Solutions segment were $241.1 million for the nine months ended April 30, 2019 as compared to $151.3 million for the nine months ended April 30, 2018, a significant increase of $89.8 million, or 59.4%.
Our Government Solutions segment represented 48.7% of consolidated net sales for the nine months ended April 30, 2019, as compared to 37.5% for the nine months ended April 30, 2018.
However, based on fiscal 2019 performance to-date, the mix and anticipated timing of performance on orders in backlog and expected new orders, we anticipate that fiscal 2019 net sales for our Government Solutions segment will be significantly higher than fiscal 2018.
The nine months ended April 30, 2018 also included a favorable warranty settlement which resulted in a reduction of $0.7 million to cost of sales in our Unallocated segment during such period.
As a percentage of consolidated net sales, selling, general and administrative expenses were 19.6% and 21.4% for the nine months ended April 30, 2019 and 2018, respectively.
Selling, general and administrative expenses for the nine months ended April 30, 2019 include $1.4 million of facility exit costs as a result of our successful consolidation of our Government Solutions segmentâ€™s manufacturing facility located in Tampa, Florida with our facility in Orlando, Florida.
During the nine months ended April 30, 2019, we also incurred $6.4 million of estimated contract settlement costs related to an ongoing repositioning of our enterprise technology solutions offerings in our Commercial Solutions segment that we initiated during the second quarter.
Excluding such costs, our selling, general and administrative expenses for the nine months ended April 30, 2019 would have been $89.5 million, or 18.1% of consolidated net sales.
Amortization in the nine months ended April 30, 2018 includes the benefit of a $0.4 million reversal of stock-based compensation expense related to certain performance shares previously expected to be earned.
As a percentage of consolidated net sales, research and development expenses were 8.2% and 9.9% for the nine months ended April 30, 2019 and 2018, respectively.
For the nine months ended April 30, 2019 and 2018, research and development expenses of $35.0 million and $34.5 million, respectively, related to our Commercial Solutions segment, and $5.5 million and $5.3 million, respectively, related to our Government Solutions segment.
The remaining research and development expenses of $0.2 million for both the nine months ended April 30, 2019 and 2018, respectively, related to the amortization of stock-based compensation expense.
The decrease in our Commercial Solutions segmentâ€™s operating income, both in dollars and as a percentage of related segment net sales, reflects $6.4 million of estimated contract settlement costs, as discussed above.
Excluding such charge, operating income in our Commercial Solutions segment for the nine months ended April 30, 2019 would have been $30.3 million, or 11.9% of related segment net sales.
The increase from the nine months ended April 30, 2018, both in dollars and as a percentage of related segment net sales, was primarily due to higher net sales at higher gross margins, lower amortization of intangibles and the benefit of cost reduction actions previously initiated, offset in part by higher research and development expenses, as discussed above.
Looking forward, excluding total estimated contract settlement costs, we expect fiscal 2019 operating income, both in dollars and as a percentage of related segment net sales, to be similar to fiscal 2018.
The significant increase in our Government Solutions segmentâ€™s operating income, both in dollars and as a percentage of related segment net sales, was primarily due to significantly higher net sales, offset in part by $1.4 million of facility exit costs, as discussed above.
Amortization of stock-based compensation for the nine months ended April 30, 2018 reflects a reversal of $0.4 million of stock-based compensation expense related to certain performance shares that were previously expected to be earned.
Consolidated GAAP operating income was $31.0 million or 6.3% of consolidated net sales for the nine months ended April 30, 2019 as compared to GAAP operating income of $19.1 million or 4.7% of consolidated net sales for the nine months ended April 30, 2018.
Excluding the $6.4 million of estimated contract settlement costs, $1.4 million of facility exit costs, $4.6 million of acquisition plan expenses and $3.2 million benefit related to a legacy TCS intellectual property matter, as discussed above, consolidated operating income would have been $40.2 million, or 8.1% of consolidated net sales for the nine months ended April 30, 2019.
Looking forward, after considering the impact of all actual and expected GAAP operating expenses, consolidated GAAP operating income in fiscal 2019, in dollars, is expected to be similar to the $35.1 million and, and as a percentage of consolidated net sales is expected to be lower than the 6.2% that we achieved in fiscal 2018.
Such GAAP operating income target includes the additional acquisition plan expenses and estimated contract settlement costs of approximately $2.2 million expected during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019.
During the nine months ended April 30, 2018, we recorded a net discrete tax benefit of $14.1 million, resulting from the passage of Tax Reform which required us to remeasure our deferred tax assets and liabilities (including liabilities associated with the non-deductible amortization related to our intangible assets).
The significant increase in consolidated Adjusted EBITDA, both in dollars and as a percentage of consolidated net sales, during the nine months ended April 30, 2019 as compared to the nine months ended April 30, 2018 is primarily attributable to significantly higher net sales and the benefit of cost reduction actions previously initiated, as discussed above.
Our Adjusted EBITDA is a Non-GAAP measure that represents earnings (loss) before income taxes, interest (income) and other, write-off of deferred financing costs, interest expense, amortization of stock-based compensation, amortization of intangible assets, depreciation expense, estimated contract settlement costs, settlement of intellectual property litigation, acquisition plan expenses or strategic alternatives analysis expenses, facility exit costs and other.
As discussed in "Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements - Note (10) - Cost Reduction Actions," during the three months ended October 31, 2018, we exited our Government Solutions segment's manufacturing facility located in Tampa, Florida and recorded a related charge of $1.4 million in selling, general and administrative expenses on our Condensed Consolidated Statement of Operations.
