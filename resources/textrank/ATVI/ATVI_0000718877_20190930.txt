During the three months ended March 31, 2019, we identified an error principally related to the initial recognition of global intangible low-taxed income of foreign subsidiaries income taxes which should have been recorded in the three months and year ended December 31, 2018.
Income tax expense for the three months and year ended December 31, 2018 should have been reduced by $35 million.
In February 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued new guidance related to the accounting for leases.
Lease assets and liabilities are recognized based on the present value of future lease payments over the lease term at the commencement date.
Leases with an initial term of 12 months or less are not recorded on the balance sheet, and we recognize lease expense for these leases on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
As noted in Note 2 above, we adopted the new lease accounting standard effective January 1, 2019.
The new standard is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019, and will be applied on a modified retrospective basis, with the cumulative effect of adoption recorded as an adjustment to retained earnings.

The opening balance of deferred revenues as of January 1, 2019 and the ending balance as of September 30, 2019, were $1.6 billion and $0.8 billion, respectively, including our current and non-current balances.
For the nine months ended September 30, 2019, the additions to our deferred revenues balance were primarily due to cash payments received or due in advance of satisfying our performance obligations, while the reductions to our deferred revenues balance were primarily due to the recognition of revenues upon fulfillment of our performance obligations, both of which were in the ordinary course of business.
During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2019, $0.1 billion and $1.4 billion of revenues, respectively, were recognized that were included in the deferred revenues balance at December 31, 2018.

•a decrease in Activision net bookings of $188 million driven by (1) lower net bookings from the Destiny franchise (reflecting our sale of the publishing rights for Destiny to Bungie in December 2018), and (2) lower net bookings from the Call of Duty franchise catalog titles.
The decrease in in-game net bookings for the three months ended September 30, 2019, as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2018, was primarily due to a decrease in Blizzard and Activision in-game net bookings of $183 million and $113 million, respectively, due to the same drivers discussed for net bookings above.

King’s net revenues for the three months ended September 30, 2019, were roughly equal to net revenues for the three months ended September 30, 2018, as lower in-game revenues from player purchases were largely offset by an increase in advertising revenues.

The decrease in Activision’s operating income for the three months ended September 30, 2019, as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2018, was primarily due to lower revenues, as discussed above.
The decrease was partially offset by lower operating costs associated with the Destiny franchise (reflecting our sale of the publishing rights for Destiny to Bungie in December 2018).
The decrease in net revenues from the Americas region for the three months ended September 30, 2019, as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2018, was primarily due to lower revenues recognized from the Destiny franchise (reflecting our sale of the publishing rights for Destiny to Bungie in December 2018).

The decrease in interest and other expense (income), net, for the three months ended September 30, 2019, as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2018, was primarily due to an $11 million decrease in interest expense and amortization of deferred financing costs associated with our debt obligations, due to a decrease in our total debt outstanding as a result of our debt redemptions and repayment activities during 2018.
Net cash provided by operating activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2019, was $913 million, as compared to $791 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2018.
The increase was primarily due to changes in our working capital resulting from the timing of collections and payments and lower cash spent to support the Destiny franchise (reflecting our sale of the publishing rights for Destiny to Bungie in December 2018).
This increase was partially offset by lower net income and a decrease in non-cash adjustments to net income, primarily due to lower amortization on intangible assets related to King and lower amortization of capitalized software development costs and intellectual property licenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2019, as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2018.
The primary drivers of net cash flows associated with investing activities typically include capital expenditures, purchases and sales of investments, changes in restricted cash balances, and cash used for acquisitions.
Net cash provided by investing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2019, was $79 million, as compared to net cash used in investing activities of $160 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2018.
The increase was primarily due to $153 million of cash proceeds from the maturities of available-for-sale investments, as compared to purchases of available-for-sale investments of $59 million in the prior-year period.
Additionally, capital expenditures of $79 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2019, were lower than the capital expenditures of $97 million for the prior-year period.

Similarly, our revenues, operating expenses, net income, and cash flows will increase for our international operations if the U.S. dollar weakens against foreign currencies.
