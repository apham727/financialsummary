The accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements include the accounts and operations of the Company.
During the three months ended March 31, 2019, we identified an error principally related to the initial recognition of global intangible low-taxed income of foreign subsidiaries income taxes which should have been recorded in the three months and year ended December 31, 2018.
Income tax expense for the three months and year ended December 31, 2018 should have been reduced by $35 million.
This amount is not material to the consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2018, and we will revise our 2018 consolidated financial statements to correct this matter in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ending December 31, 2019.
In February 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued new guidance related to the accounting for leases.
The new standard, among other things, requires a lessee to classify a lease as either an operating or financing lease, and to recognize a lease liability and a right-of-use (“ROU”) asset for its leases.
On January 1, 2019, we adopted the new lease accounting standard.
Lease assets and liabilities are recognized based on the present value of future lease payments over the lease term at the commencement date.
Variable lease payments are recognized as lease expenses as incurred, and generally relate to variable payments made based on the level of services provided by the landlords of our leases.
Leases with an initial term of 12 months or less are not recorded on the balance sheet, and we recognize lease expense for these leases on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
As noted in Note 2 above, we adopted the new lease accounting standard effective January 1, 2019.
We are evaluating the impact, if any, of adopting this new accounting guidance on our consolidated financial statements.
The capitalized costs are required to be amortized over the associated term of the arrangement, generally on a straight-line basis, with amortization of these costs presented in the same financial statement line item as other costs associated with the arrangement.
Amortization expense of our intangible assets was $55 million and $119 million for the three months ended March 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively.
Additionally, $4 million of net realized but unrecognized gains are recorded within “Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss)” at March 31, 2019 for Cash Flow Hedges that had settled but were deferred and will be amortized into earnings, along with the associated hedged revenues.
For the three months ended March 31, 2019 and 2018, pre-tax net gains (losses) associated with these forward contracts were recorded in “General and administrative expenses” and were not material.
For the three months ended March 31, 2019 and 2018, there were no impairment charges related to assets that are measured on a non-recurring basis.
The opening balance of deferred revenues as of January 1, 2019 and the ending balance as of March 31, 2019, were $1.6 billion and $1.0 billion, respectively, including our current and non-current balances.
For the three months ended March 31, 2019, the additions to our deferred revenues balance were primarily due to cash payments received or due in advance of satisfying our performance obligations, while the reductions to our deferred revenues balance were primarily due to the recognition of revenues upon fulfillment of our performance obligations, both of which were in the ordinary course of business.
During the three months ended March 31, 2019, $0.9 billion of revenues were recognized that were included in the deferred revenues balance at the beginning of the period.
As of March 31, 2019, the aggregate amount of contracted revenues allocated to our unsatisfied performance obligations is $2.2 billion, which includes our deferred revenues balances and amounts to be invoiced and recognized as revenue in future periods.
Refer to Note 13 contained in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018 for further details regarding the Credit Agreement, its key terms, and previous amendments made to it.
As of March 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018, we had accrued interest payable of $14 million and $15 million, respectively, related to the Notes.
Refer to Note 13 contained in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018 for further details regarding key terms under our indentures that govern the Notes.
For the three months ended March 31, 2019 and March 31, 2018, interest expense was $21 million and $40 million, respectively, and amortization of the debt discount and deferred financing costs was $1 million and $2 million, respectively.
With the exception of the 2047 Notes, using Level 2 inputs (i.e., observable market prices in less-than-active markets) at March 31, 2019, the carrying values of the Notes approximated their fair values, as the interest rates were similar to the current rates at which we could borrow funds over the selected interest periods.
At March 31, 2019, based on Level 2 inputs, the fair value of the 2047 Notes was $378 million.
The Company’s net revenues in the U.S. were 49% and 47% of consolidated net revenues for the three months ended March 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively.
The Company’s net revenues in the U.K. were 10% and 11% of consolidated net revenues for the three months ended March 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively.
No other country’s net revenues exceeded 10% of consolidated net revenues for either the three months ended March 31, 2019 or 2018.
Therefore, approximately 6 million and 2 million options to purchase shares of common stock were not included in the calculation of diluted earnings per common share for the three months ended March 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively, as the effect of their inclusion would be anti-dilutive.
We have recorded $283 million of dividends payable in “Accrued expenses and other liabilities” on our condensed consolidated balance sheet as of March 31, 2019.
On May 9, 2018, we made an aggregate cash dividend payment of $259 million to shareholders of record at the close of business on March 30, 2018.

Activision primarily delivers content through retail and digital channels, including full-game and in-game sales, as well as by licensing software to third-party or related-party companies that distribute Activision products.
•the Activision Blizzard Distribution (“Distribution”) business, which consists of operations in Europe that provide warehousing, logistics, and sales distribution services to third-party publishers of interactive entertainment software, our own publishing operations, and manufacturers of interactive entertainment hardware.
Since certain of our games are hosted online or include significant online functionality that represents a separate performance obligation, we defer the transaction price allocable to the online functionality from the sale of these games and recognize the attributable revenues over the relevant estimated service periods, which are generally less than a year.
Net revenues and operating income for the three months ended March 31, 2019, include a net effect of $567 million and $441 million, respectively, from the recognition of deferred net revenues and related cost of revenues.
In addition, due to technical limitations, for Activision and King, an individual who accesses the same game on two platforms or devices in the relevant period would be counted as two users.
Average MAUs decreased by 11 million, or 3%, for the three months ended March 31, 2019, as compared to the three months ended December 31, 2018 primarily driven by a decrease in average MAUs for Activision.
The decrease in Activision’s average MAUs is primarily due to (1) the Destiny franchise, as Destiny MAUs are no longer included in our average MAU metric since we sold our publishing rights in the Destiny franchise to Bungie in December 2018, and (2) decreases in the Call of Duty franchise.
King is a leading developer of mobile and free-to-play games and our other business units have mobile efforts underway that present the opportunity for us to expand the reach of, and drive additional player investment from, our franchises.
King’s net revenues for the three months ended March 31, 2019, were roughly equal to net revenues for the three months ended March 31, 2018.
The decrease is partially offset by lower operating costs associated with the Destiny franchise, the publishing rights to which we sold to Bungie in December 2018, as previously disclosed.
The decrease in King’s operating income for the three months ended March 31, 2019, as compared to the three months ended March 31, 2018, was primarily due to higher sales and marketing costs driven by the Candy Crush franchise.
Net revenues from mobile and ancillary for the three months ended March 31, 2019, were roughly equal to net revenues for the three months ended March 31, 2018.
The decrease in product costs for the three months ended March 31, 2019, as compared to the three months ended March 31, 2018, was in line with the decrease in product sales.
The decrease in game operations and distribution costs for the three months ended March 31, 2019, as compared to the three months ended March 31, 2018, was primarily due to a decrease of $19 million in digital storefront fees (e.g. fees retained by Apple and Google for our sales on their platforms) and payment processor fees.
The decrease in product development costs for the three months ended March 31, 2019, as compared to the three months ended March 31, 2018, was primarily driven by lower product development costs from the Destiny franchise, the publishing rights to which we sold to Bungie in December 2018, as previously disclosed.
The decrease in general and administrative expenses for the three months ended March 31, 2019, as compared to the three months ended March 31, 2018, was primarily due to a $15 million decrease in personnel costs.
The decrease in interest and other expense (income), net, for the three months ended March 31, 2019, as compared to the three months ended March 31, 2018, was primarily due to an $18 million decrease in interest expense and amortization of deferred financing costs associated with our debt obligations due to our lower total debt outstanding as a result of our debt redemptions and repayment activities during 2018.
In the near term, we expect our business and financial condition to remain strong and to continue to generate significant operating cash flows, which, we believe, in combination with our existing balance of cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments of $4.8 billion, our access to capital, and the availability of our $1.5 billion revolving credit facility, will be sufficient to finance our operational and financing requirements for the next 12 months.
Net cash provided by operating activities for the three months ended March 31, 2019, was $450 million, as compared to $529 million for the three months ended March 31, 2018.
The primary drivers of net cash flows associated with investing activities typically include capital expenditures, purchases and sales of investments, changes in restricted cash balances, and cash used for acquisitions.
Net cash used in investing activities for the three months ended March 31, 2019, was $5 million, as compared to $51 million for the three months ended March 31, 2018.
The decrease was primarily due to cash flow activities associated with available-for-sale investments, for which, in the three months ended March 31, 2019, there were $13 million of cash proceeds from the maturities of available-for-sale investments as compared to purchases of available-for-sale investments of $20 million in the prior-year period.
Additionally, we had lower capital expenditures of $18 million for the three months ended March 31, 2019, as compared to $31 million in the prior-year period.
Changes in foreign exchange rates had a positive impact of $2 million on our cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash for the three months ended March 31, 2019, as compared to a positive impact of $18 million for the three months ended March 31, 2018.
During the three months ended March 31, 2019, capital expenditures were $18 million.

We transact business in many different foreign currencies and may be exposed to financial market risk resulting from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates.
To the extent the U.S. dollar strengthens against foreign currencies, the translation of these foreign currency-denominated transactions will result in reduced revenues, operating expenses, net income, and cash flows from our international operations.
Similarly, our revenues, operating expenses, net income, and cash flows will increase for our international operations if the U.S. dollar weakens against foreign currencies.
To mitigate our foreign currency risk resulting from our foreign currency-denominated monetary assets, liabilities, and earnings and our foreign currency risk related to functional currency-equivalent cash flows resulting from our intercompany transactions, we periodically enter into currency derivative contracts, principally forward contracts.
The fair values of our foreign currency contracts are estimated based on the prevailing exchange rates of the various hedged currencies as of the end of the period.
