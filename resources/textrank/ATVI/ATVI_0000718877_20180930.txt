During the nine months ended September 30, 2018, there were no significant changes to our accounting policies, except for our adoption of a new revenue accounting standard as discussed below.
In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued new accounting guidance related to revenue recognition.
The new standard replaces all current U.S. GAAP guidance on this topic, eliminating all industry-specific guidance and providing a unified model to determine when and how revenue is recognized.
On January 1, 2018, we adopted the new accounting standard and related amendments (collectively, the new revenue accounting standard).
Revenues related to online hosted software arrangements are generally recognized ratably over the estimated service period.
Revenues associated with the sales of subscriptions are deferred until the subscription service is activated by the consumer and are then recognized ratably over the subscription period as the performance obligations are satisfied.
Durable virtual goods represent goods that are accessible to the player over an extended period of time; accordingly, we recognize revenues from the sale of durable virtual goods ratably over the period of time the goods are available to the player and our performance obligation is satisfied, which is generally the estimated service period.
As noted in Note 2 above, we adopted the new revenue accounting standard effective January 1, 2018, utilizing the modified retrospective method.
Additionally, we elected to apply the new revenue accounting standard only to contracts not completed as of the adoption date.
We recognized the cumulative effect of initially applying the new revenue accounting standard as an adjustment to the opening  
While the impact of the new revenue accounting standard may differ on a contract-by-contract basis (as the actual revenue recognition treatment required under the standard will depend on contract-specific terms), the new revenue accounting standard generally results in earlier revenue recognition for these arrangements.
Adoption of the new revenue accounting standard had no impact to net cash from or used in operating, investing, or financing activities in our condensed consolidated statement of cash flows.
The new standard, among other things, generally requires companies to measure investments in other entities, except those accounted for under the equity method, at fair value and to recognize any changes in fair value in net income.
The new standard is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, and the guidance should be applied by means of a cumulative-effect adjustment to the balance sheet as of the beginning of the fiscal year of adoption.
We adopted the new standard during the first quarter of 2018 and it did not have a material impact on our condensed consolidated financial statements.
The application of this new standard did not have a material impact on our condensed consolidated statements of cash flows for the nine months ended September 30, 2018 and 2017.
In our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ending December 31, 2018, there will be a significant impact to the consolidated statements of cash flows for 2016, as this period includes, as an investing activity, the $3.6 billion movement in restricted cash resulting from the transfer of cash into escrow at December 31, 2015 to facilitate the acquisition of King, and the subsequent release of that cash in 2016 to complete the acquisition.
Under this new standard, the restricted cash balance will be included in the beginning and ending total cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash balances and, hence, will not be included as an investing activity in the statement of cash flows.
The new guidance expands and refines hedge accounting for both financial and non-financial risk components, aligns the recognition and presentation of the effects of hedging instruments and hedged items in the financial statements, and includes certain targeted improvements to ease the application of current guidance related to the assessment of a hedges effectiveness.
When the new standard was initially issued, it was required to be adopted using a modified retrospective transition that required application of the new guidance at the beginning of the earliest comparative period presented, subject to certain transition practical expedients available to provide relief in connection with the adoption.
In July 2018, the FASB issued guidance to provide for an optional adoption method that allows companies to use the effective date of the new lease standard as the initial date of application on transition, and therefore does not require prior periods to be restated.
Although we continue to evaluate the impact of this new accounting guidance on our financial statements, we expect it to have a significant impact on our consolidated balance sheet as a result of establishing lease liabilities and right-of-use assets for our operating leases.
We are evaluating the impact, if any, of adopting this new accounting guidance on our consolidated financial statements.
In August 2018, the FASB issued new guidance related to a customers accounting for implementation costs incurred in a cloud computing arrangement (i.e. hosting arrangement) that is a service contract.
We are evaluating the impact, if any, of adopting this new accounting guidance on our financial statements.
Additionally, $3 million of net realized but unrecognized gains are recorded within Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) at September 30, 2018 for Cash Flow Hedges that had settled but were deferred and will be amortized into earnings, along with the associated hedged revenues.
For the nine months ended September 30, 2018, the additions to our deferred revenues balance were primarily due to cash payments received or due in advance of satisfying our performance obligations, while the reductions to our deferred revenues balance were primarily due to the recognition of revenues upon fulfillment of our performance obligations, both of which were in the ordinary course of business.
During the nine months ended September 30, 2018, $1.6 billion of revenues were recognized that were included in the deferred revenues balance at the beginning of the period.

The Companys net revenues in the U.K. were 11% and 10% of consolidated net revenues for the nine months ended September 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively.
Approximately 6 million shares are not included in the computation of diluted earnings per share for both the three and nine months ended September 30, 2018, as their underlying performance measures had not yet been met.
Approximately 9 million and 8 million shares are not included in the computation of diluted earnings per share for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2017, respectively, as their underlying performance measures had not yet been met.

To the extent the U.S. dollar strengthens against foreign currencies, the translation of these foreign currency-denominated transactions will result in reduced revenues, operating expenses, net income, and cash flows from our international operations.
Similarly, our revenues, operating expenses, net income, and cash flows will increase for our international operations if the U.S. dollar weakens against foreign currencies.
