Leases are included in other long-term assets, accrued expenses and other liabilities, and other long-term liabilities on our Consolidated Balance Sheets.
Lease assets represent our right to use underlying assets for the lease term, and lease liabilities represent our obligations to make lease payments over the lease term.
On the commencement date, leases are evaluated for classification, and assets and liabilities are recognized based on the present value of lease payments over the lease term.
We use our incremental borrowing rate based on the information available at commencement in determining the present value of lease payments.
Operating lease expense is generally recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
Our lease values include options to extend or not to terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain that we will exercise such options.
Leases with a lease term of 12 months or less are not recorded on the balance sheet; we recognize lease expense for these leases on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
In connection with the issuance of long-term debt, we may use financial derivatives such as treasury-rate lock agreements that are recognized in AOCI and amortized over the life of the related debt.
The fair values of our derivative financial instruments were not material as of June 30, 2019.
Our investments in cash equivalents, short-term investments and certain long-term investments, as well as our deferred compensation liabilities, are carried at fair value.
The carrying values for other current financial assets and liabilities, such as accounts receivable and accounts payable, approximate fair value due to the short maturity of such instruments.
As of June 30, 2019, the carrying value of long-term debt, including the current portion, was $5.81 billion, and the estimated fair value was $6.14 billion.
The adoption of the new standard resulted in the recognition of $229 million of lease liabilities with corresponding lease assets as of January 1, 2019.
This standard requires entities to use a current lifetime expected credit loss methodology to measure impairments of certain financial assets.
Credit losses relating to available-for-sale debt securities will be recorded through an allowance for credit losses rather than as a reduction to the amortized cost basis of the securities.
We are currently evaluating the potential impact of this standard, but we do not expect it to have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations.
We did not recognize any credit losses related to available-for-sale investments for the first six months of 2019 and 2018.
Proceeds from sales, redemptions and maturities of short-term available-for-sale investments were $200 million and $1.38 billion for the second quarters of 2019 and 2018, respectively, and $1.78 billion and $2.83 billion for the first six months of 2019 and 2018, respectively.
Level 1 – Uses unadjusted quoted prices that are available in active markets for identical assets or liabilities as of the reporting date.
Level 2 – Uses inputs other than Level 1 that are either directly or indirectly observable as of the reporting date through correlation with market data, including quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets and quoted prices in markets that are not active.
Level 2 also includes assets and liabilities that are valued using models or other pricing methodologies that do not require significant judgment since the input assumptions used in the models, such as interest rates and volatility factors, are corroborated by readily observable data.
In addition, certain long-term supply agreements to purchase industrial gases are accounted for as operating leases.

Analog and embedded processing products sold into industrial and automotive markets provide long product life cycles, intrinsic diversity and less capital-intensive manufacturing, which we believe offer stability, profitability and strong cash generation.
This business model is the foundation of our capital management strategy, which is based on our belief that free cash flow growth, especially on a per-share basis, is important for maximizing shareholder value over the long term.
We also believe that free cash flow will be valued only if it is productively invested in the business or returned to shareholders.
The combined effect of these sustainable competitive advantages is that over time we have gained market share in Analog and Embedded Processing and have grown free cash flow.
In our core businesses, Analog revenue declined 6% and Embedded Processing declined 16% from the same quarter a year ago.
Our cash flow from operations of $7.2 billion for the trailing 12 months again underscored the strength of our business model.
Free cash flow for the trailing 12 months was $5.9 billion and 39% of revenue.
For an explanation of free cash flow and the term “annual operating tax rate,” see the Non-GAAP financial information section.
Revenue of $3.67 billion decreased $349 million, or 9%, primarily due to lower revenue from Analog and Embedded Processing.
Gross profit of $2.36 billion was down $259 million, or 10%, due to lower revenue.
Operating profit was $1.51 billion, or 41.1% of revenue, compared with $1.71 billion, or 42.6% of revenue.
Revenue of $7.26 billion decreased $544 million, or 7%, due to lower revenue from Embedded Processing and, to a lesser extent, Analog.
Gross profit of $4.62 billion was down $445 million, or 9%, primarily due to lower revenue.
Operating profit was $2.89 billion, or 39.7% of revenue, compared with $3.26 billion, or 41.8% of revenue.
Accounts receivable were $1.42 billion, an increase of $212 million compared with the end of 2018.
Inventory was $2.08 billion, a decrease of $138 million from the end of 2018.
Cash flows from operating activities for the first six months of 2019 were $2.90 billion, a decrease of $35 million.
Investing activities for the first six months of 2019 provided $915 million compared with $185 million in the year-ago period.
Capital expenditures were $535 million compared with $438 million in the year-ago period and were primarily for semiconductor manufacturing equipment in both periods.
We had sales of short-term investments, net of purchases, that provided cash proceeds of $1.40 billion compared with $621 million in the year-ago period.
Financing activities for the first six months of 2019 used $2.44 billion compared with $1.86 billion in the year-ago period.
In the year-ago period, we received net proceeds of $1.50 billion from the issuance of fixed-rate, long-term debt, and we retired maturing debt of $500 million.
Dividends paid were $1.45 billion compared with $1.22 billion in the year-ago period, reflecting an increase in the dividend rate, partially offset by fewer shares outstanding.
We used $2.02 billion to repurchase 19.6 million shares of our common stock compared with $1.89 billion used in the year-ago period to repurchase 17.8 million shares.
Employee exercises of stock options provided cash proceeds of $297 million compared with $280 million in the year-ago period.
We had $3.81 billion of cash and cash equivalents and $405 million of short-term investments as of June 30, 2019.
All open-market purchases during the quarter were made under the authorization from our board of directors to purchase up to $6.0 billion of additional shares of TI common stock announced September 21, 2017.
