Leases are included in other long-term assets, accrued expenses and other liabilities, and other long-term liabilities on our Consolidated Balance Sheets.
Lease assets represent our right to use underlying assets for the lease term, and lease liabilities represent our obligations to make lease payments over the lease term.
On the commencement date, leases are evaluated for classification, and assets and liabilities are recognized based on the present value of lease payments over the lease term.
We use our incremental borrowing rate based on the information available at commencement in determining the present value of lease payments.
Operating lease expense is generally recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
Our lease values include options to extend or not to terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain that we will exercise such options.
Leases with an initial lease term of 12 months or less are not recorded on the balance sheet; we recognize lease expense for these leases on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
In connection with the issuance of long-term debt, we may use financial derivatives such as treasury-rate lock agreements that are recognized in AOCI and amortized over the life of the related debt.
The fair values of our derivative financial instruments were not material as of September 30, 2019.
Our investments in cash equivalents, short-term investments and certain long-term investments, as well as our deferred compensation liabilities, are carried at fair value.
The carrying values for other current financial assets and liabilities, such as accounts receivable and accounts payable, approximate fair value due to the short maturity of such instruments.
As of September 30, 2019, the carrying value of long-term debt, including the current portion, was $5.80 billion, and the estimated fair value was $6.32 billion.
The adoption of the new standard resulted in the recognition of $229 million of lease liabilities with corresponding lease assets as of January 1, 2019.
This standard requires entities to use a current lifetime expected credit loss methodology to measure impairments of certain financial assets.
Credit losses relating to available-for-sale debt securities will be recorded through an allowance for credit losses rather than as a reduction to the amortized cost basis of the securities.
We did not recognize any credit losses related to available-for-sale investments for the first nine months of 2019 and 2018.
Proceeds from sales, redemptions and maturities of short-term available-for-sale investments were $220 million and $1.72 billion for the third quarters of 2019 and 2018, respectively, and $2.00 billion and $4.55 billion for the first nine months of 2019 and 2018, respectively.
•Level 1 – Uses unadjusted quoted prices that are available in active markets for identical assets or liabilities as of the reporting date.
•Level 2 – Uses inputs other than Level 1 that are either directly or indirectly observable as of the reporting date through correlation with market data, including quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets and quoted prices in markets that are not active.
Level 2 also includes assets and liabilities that are valued using models or other pricing methodologies that do not require significant judgment since the input assumptions used in the models, such as interest rates and volatility factors, are corroborated by readily observable data.
In the first quarter of 2019, we issued a principal amount of $750 million of fixed-rate, long-term debt due in 2039.
In addition, certain long-term supply agreements to purchase industrial gases are accounted for as operating leases.

Analog and embedded processing products sold into industrial and automotive markets provide long product life cycles, intrinsic diversity and less capital-intensive manufacturing, which we believe offer stability, profitability and strong cash generation.
The combined effect of these sustainable competitive advantages is that over time we have gained market share in Analog and Embedded Processing and have grown free cash flow.
In our core businesses, Analog revenue declined 8% and Embedded Processing declined 19% from the same quarter a year ago.
Our cash flow from operations of $7.0 billion for the trailing 12 months again underscored the strength of our business model.
Free cash flow for the trailing 12 months was $6.0 billion and 41% of revenue.
For an explanation of free cash flow and the term “annual operating tax rate,” see the Non-GAAP financial information section.
Revenue of $3.77 billion decreased $490 million, or 11%, primarily due to lower revenue from Analog and Embedded Processing.
Gross profit of $2.45 billion was down $358 million, or 13%, due to lower revenue.
Operating profit was $1.59 billion, or 42.1% of revenue, compared with $1.94 billion, or 45.5% of revenue.
Revenue of $11.03 billion decreased $1.03 billion, or 9%, primarily due to lower revenue from Embedded Processing and Analog.
Gross profit of $7.07 billion was down $803 million, or 10%, primarily due to lower revenue.
Operating profit was $4.47 billion, or 40.6% of revenue, compared with $5.20 billion, or 43.1% of revenue.
At the end of the third quarter of 2019, total cash (cash and cash equivalents plus short-term investments) was $5.07 billion, an increase of $834 million from the end of 2018.
Accounts receivable were $1.34 billion, an increase of $135 million compared with the end of 2018.
Inventory was $2.04 billion, a decrease of $177 million from the end of 2018.
Cash flows from operating activities for the first nine months of 2019 were $4.90 billion, a decrease of $149 million primarily due to lower net income.
Investing activities for the first nine months of 2019 provided $1 million compared with $1.58 billion of cash used in the year-ago period.
Capital expenditures were $684 million compared with $808 million in the year-ago period and were primarily for semiconductor manufacturing equipment in both periods.
Short-term investments provided cash of $630 million compared with $763 million of cash used in the year-ago period.
Financing activities for the first nine months of 2019 used $3.44 billion compared with $3.62 billion in the year-ago period.
In 2019, we received net proceeds of $1.49 billion from the issuance of fixed-rate, long-term debt, and we retired maturing debt of $750 million.
In the year-ago period, we received net proceeds of $1.50 billion from the issuance of fixed-rate, long-term debt, and we retired maturing debt of $500 million.
Dividends paid were $2.17 billion compared with $1.82 billion in the year-ago period, reflecting an increase in the dividend rate, partially offset by fewer shares outstanding.
We used $2.47 billion to repurchase 23.4 million shares of our common stock compared with $3.09 billion used in the year-ago period to repurchase 28.6 million shares.
Employee exercises of stock options provided cash proceeds of $491 million compared with $335 million in the year-ago period.
We had $3.89 billion of cash and cash equivalents and $1.17 billion of short-term investments as of September 30, 2019.
