The outdoor, aviation, marine, and fitness segments collectively increased by 17%, contributing 80% of total revenue.

Outdoor, fitness, marine, and aviation segment revenues increased 4%, 24%, 24%, and 23%, respectively, when compared to the year-ago quarter.

Advertising expense increased 4% in absolute dollars and was relatively flat as a percent of revenues compared to the year-ago quarter.
The total absolute dollar increase was driven primarily by increased cooperative advertising associated with higher sales.

Operating income increased 4% in absolute dollars and decreased 90 basis points as a percent of revenue when compared to the year-ago quarter.

Foreign currency gains and losses for the Company are typically driven by movements in the Taiwan Dollar, Euro, and British Pound Sterling in relation to the U.S. Dollar.
The $2.6 million currency gain recognized in the second quarter of 2018 was primarily due to the strengthening of the U.S. Dollar against the Taiwan Dollar, partially offset by the U.S. Dollar strengthening against the Euro and British Pound Sterling within the 13-weeks ended June 30, 2018.
During this period, the U.S. Dollar strengthened 4.7% against the Taiwan Dollar, resulting in a gain of $26.7 million, while the U.S. Dollar strengthened 5.2% against the Euro and 5.8% against the British Pound Sterling, resulting in losses of $14.0 million and $1.9 million, respectively.
The $15.1 million currency gain recognized in the second quarter of 2017 was primarily due to the weakening of the U.S. Dollar against the Euro and the British Pound Sterling and slight strengthening against the Taiwan Dollar within the 13-weeks ended July 1, 2017.

Excluding the effect of the $7.3 million tax expense associated with the expiration of share-based awards in second quarter of 2017, the second quarter of 2018 effective tax rate decreased 200 basis points compared to the effective tax rate in the prior year quarter primarily due to the reduction of the U.S. corporate tax rate.

Cost of goods sold increased 6% in absolute dollars for the 26-week period ended June 30, 2018 when compared to the year-ago period.

Operating income was relatively flat as a percent of revenue primarily due to an increase in gross margin, offset by increased operating expenses as discussed above.
The $3.5 million currency gain recognized in the first half of 2018 was primarily due to the strengthening of the U.S. Dollar against the Taiwan Dollar, partially offset by the U.S. Dollar strengthening against the Euro and British Pound Sterling within the 26-weeks ended June 30, 2018.
During this period, the U.S. Dollar strengthened 2.7% against the Taiwan Dollar, resulting in a gain of $13.9 million, while the U.S. Dollar strengthened 2.6% against the Euro and 2.3% against the British Pound Sterling, resulting in losses of $5.1 million and $0.1 million, respectively.
The $22.4 million currency loss recognized in the first half of 2017 was primarily due to the weakening of the U.S. Dollar against the Taiwan Dollar within the 26-weeks ended July 1, 2017.
