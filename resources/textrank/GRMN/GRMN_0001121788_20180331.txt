We operate in five reportable segments, the outdoor, fitness, marine, auto and aviation markets.
Allocation of certain research and development expenses, and selling, general, and administrative expenses are made to each segment on a percent of revenue basis.
The segment table located in Note 4 to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements sets forth the Company’s results of operations (in thousands) including net sales, gross profit, and operating income for each of the Company’s five segments during the periods shown.
For each line item in the table, the total of the outdoor, fitness, marine, auto, and aviation segments' amounts equals the amount in the condensed consolidated statements of income included in Item 1.
Net sales increased 11% for the 13-week period ended March 31, 2018 when compared to the year-ago quarter.
The outdoor, aviation, marine, and fitness segments collectively increased by 18%, contributing 80% of total revenue.
Fitness was the largest portion of our revenue mix at 23% in the first quarter of 2018 compared to 22% in the first quarter of 2017.
Total unit sales decreased to 2,956 in the first quarter of 2018 from 3,099 in the same period of 2017.
Cost of goods sold increased 6% in absolute dollars compared to the prior year quarter.
The increase in revenues outpaced the increase in cost of goods sold, which resulted in a 190 basis point decrease in cost of goods sold as a percent of revenues compared to the year-ago quarter.
Advertising expense decreased 20% in absolute dollars compared to the year-ago quarter.
The overall decrease in absolute dollars was driven primarily by decreased cooperative advertising associated with customer mix and fitness media, partially offset by an increase in outdoor media.
Selling, general and administrative expense increased 15% in absolute dollars and was relatively flat as a percent of revenues compared to the year-ago quarter.
The absolute dollar increase was primarily attributable to personnel costs and expenses from prior year acquisitions in the first quarter of 2018.
All segments, except for marine, were relatively flat as a percent of revenues.
The marine segment increase as a percent of revenues was primarily due to expenses resulting from prior year acquisitions in the first quarter of 2018.
Research and development expense increased 16% primarily due to engineering personnel costs related to our wearable product offerings, aviation, and expenses resulting from prior year acquisitions within the marine segment.
In absolute dollars, research and development costs increased $19.8 million when compared with the year-ago quarter and increased 90 basis points as a percent of revenue.
Operating income increased 22% in absolute dollars and increased 180 basis points as a percent of revenue when compared to the first quarter of 2017.
The growth in operating income on an absolute dollar and percent of revenue basis resulted from revenue growth and an increase in gross margin percent, while operating expenses as a percent of revenue remained relatively flat, as discussed above 
The $0.8 million currency gain recognized in the first quarter of 2018 was primarily due to the weakening of the U.S. Dollar against the Taiwan Dollar, Euro, and British Pound Sterling within the 13-weeks ended March 31, 2018.
During this period, the U.S. Dollar weakened 2.7% against the Euro and 3.7% against the British Pound Sterling, resulting in gains of $8.8 million and $2.0 million, respectively, while the U.S. Dollar weakened 2.0% against the Taiwan Dollar, resulting in a loss of $12.7 million.
The $37.5 million currency loss recognized in the first quarter of 2017 was primarily due to the weakening of the U.S. Dollar against the Taiwan Dollar, Euro, and British Pound Sterling within the 13-weeks ended April 1, 2017.
During this period, the U.S. Dollar weakened 7.1% against the Taiwan Dollar, resulting in a loss of $42.9 million, while the U.S. Dollar weakened 1.3% against the Euro and 1.7% against the British Pound Sterling, resulting in gains of $2.7 million and $0.8 million, respectively.
The Company recorded an income tax expense of $24.6 million in the 13-week period ended March 31, 2018, compared to income tax benefit of $150.0 million in the 13-week period ended April 1, 2017, which included a $168.8 million income tax benefit due to the revaluation of certain Switzerland deferred tax assets.
The effective tax rate was 16.0% in the first quarter of 2018, compared to (169.8%) in the first quarter of 2017.
Excluding the effect of the $168.8 million revaluation of deferred tax assets in the first quarter of 2017, the first quarter of 2018 effective tax rate decreased by 520 basis points primarily due to the reduction of the U.S. corporate tax rate, as a result of U.S. tax reform passed in December 2017, and the net release of uncertain tax position reserves.
We primarily use cash flow from operations, and expect that future cash requirements may be used to fund our capital expenditures, support our working capital requirements, pay dividends, fund strategic acquisitions, and fund share repurchases.
The $93.8 million increase in cash provided by operating activities in the first quarter of 2018 compared to the first quarter of 2017 was primarily due to the increase in cash provided by working capital of $57.4 million (which included an increase of $52.8 million in net receipts of accounts receivable and a decrease of $11.7 million in cash paid for inventory) and income taxes payable of $10.1 million.
Additionally, the year over year decrease in net income of $109.0 million was offset by other non-cash adjustments to net income of $135.3 million, including an income tax benefit of $168.8 million recognized in the first quarter of 2017 related to the revaluation of certain Switzerland deferred tax assets.
The $99.3 million increase in cash used in investing activities in the first quarter of 2018 compared to the first quarter of 2017 was primarily due to increased net purchases of marketable securities of $88.8M and cash payments for acquisitions of $9.4 million.
The $26.6 million decrease in cash used in financing activities in the first quarter of 2018 compared to the first quarter of 2017 was primarily due to decreased purchases of treasury stock under our share repurchase authorization of $27.9M.
The Board of Directors approved a share repurchase program on February 13, 2015, authorizing the Company to purchase up to $300 million of its common shares as market and business conditions warrant.
