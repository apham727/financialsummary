(Xilinx or the Company) consolidated financial statements filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended March 30, 2019.
The Company adopted this authoritative guidance using modified retrospective method during first quarter of fiscal 2020 and resulted in the recognition of right-of-use assets of approximately $50.0 million and lease liabilities for operating leases of approximately $50.0 million on March 31, 2019, the beginning of fiscal 2020.
For the first quarter of fiscal 2020 and 2019, approximately 50% and 63%, respectively, of the Company's net revenues were from products sold to distributors for subsequent resale to original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) or their subcontract manufacturers.
No other distributor or end customer accounted for more than 10% of the Company’s worldwide net revenues for the first quarter of fiscal 2020 and 2019.
When determining the fair value measurements for assets and liabilities required or permitted to be recorded at fair value, the Company considers the principal or most advantageous market in which Xilinx would transact and also considers assumptions that market participants would use when pricing the asset or liability, such as inherent risk, transfer restrictions and risk of nonperformance.
The Company’s Level 2 assets consist of financial institution securities, non-financial institution securities, U.S. agency securities, foreign government and agency securities, mortgage-backed securities, debt mutual funds, asset-backed securities and commercial 
For certain of the Company’s financial instruments, including cash held in banks, accounts receivable and accounts payable, the carrying amounts approximate fair value due to their short maturities, and are therefore excluded from the fair value tables above.
The Company's $500.0 million principal amount of 3.000% notes due March 15, 2021 (2021 Notes) and $750.0 million principal amount of 2.950% senior notes due June 1, 2024 (2024 Notes) are measured at fair value on a quarterly basis for disclosure purposes.
As of June 29, 2019, the Company had non-marketable equity securities in private companies of $72.8 million, which were classified as Level 3 assets.
The Company’s investments in non-marketable securities of private companies are recorded at fair value if the Company recognizes an observable price adjustment or an impairment.
The Company’s investments in non-financial assets such as property, plant and equipment, goodwill and acquisition-related intangibles, are recorded at cost (net of accumulated depreciation or amortization, where applicable).
The marketable debt securities (financial institution securities, non-financial institution securities, U.S. and foreign government and agency securities, asset-backed securities, mortgage-backed securities and commercial mortgage-backed securities) are highly rated by the credit rating agencies, there have been no defaults on any of these securities and the Company has received interest payments as they become due.
The Company records the change in the fair value of its investment in debt mutual funds as part of its interest and other income (expense), net.
This change in fair value was a net increase of $1.4 million for the three months ended June 29, 2019 and resulted in a gain within interest and other income (expense) net for the period.
As a result of the use of derivative financial instruments, the Company is exposed to the risk that counterparties to derivative contracts may fail to meet their contractual obligations.
In May 2017, the Company entered into interest rate swap contracts with certain independent financial institutions to manage interest rate risks related to fixed interest rate expenses from its 2024 Notes and floating interest rate income from its investments in marketable debt securities.
Changes in fair values of the interest rate swap contracts and the 2024 Notes were recorded in the Company’s consolidated balance sheets.
As a result of the sale, the Company recorded the net change in fair value of the interest rate swap contracts of $11.7 million in the Company's condensed consolidated balance sheets for the period ended June 29, 2019.
For the majority of RSUs granted, the number of shares of common stock issued on the date the RSU awards vest is net of the minimum statutory withholding requirements that the Company pays in cash to the appropriate taxing authorities on behalf of the Company's employees.
These options and RSUs were immaterial for the first quarter of fiscal 2020 and 2019, respectively, but could be dilutive in the future if the Company’s average share price increases and is greater than the combined exercise prices and the unamortized fair values of these options and RSUs. The Company received net proceeds of $495.4 million from issuance of the 2021 Notes, after the debt discount and deduction of debt issuance costs.
In relation to the issuance of the 2024 Notes, the Company entered into interest rate swap contracts with certain independent financial institutions, whereby the Company pays on a semi-annual basis, a variable interest rate equal to the three-month London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) plus 91.43 bps, and receives on a semi-annual basis, interest income at a fixed interest rate of 2.950%.
The Company incurred a net interest expense of $1.0 million for the three months ended June 29, 2019 and earned a net interest income of $851 thousand for the three months ended June 30, 2018, from the interest rate swap contracts, which was included in interest and other income (expense), net on the condensed consolidated statements of income.
The Board of Directors (Board) has approved stock repurchase programs enabling the Company to repurchase its common stock in the open market or through negotiated transactions with independent financial institutions.
During the first quarter of fiscal 2020, the Company repurchased 1.4 million shares of common stock in the open market for a total of $145.0 million.
Additionally, the Company entered into a stock repurchase agreement with an independent financial institution to repurchase shares under the 2018 Repurchase Program.
Under the agreement, the Company provided the financial institution with an up-front payment totaling $300.0 million and the financial institution agreed to deliver to the Company a certain number of shares based upon the volume weighted-average price, during an averaging period, less a specified discount.
Under this arrangement, the Company received an initial 1.6 million shares of common stock during the first quarter of fiscal 2020 for $168.1 million (estimated based on volume-weighted average price up to June 29, 2019).
The Company expects to receive additional shares and a portion of the remaining estimated $131.9 million back during the next quarter.
During the first quarter of fiscal 2019, the Company repurchased 2.1 million shares of common stock in the open market for a total of $136.8 million.

The Company’s total gross unrecognized tax benefits as of June 29, 2019, determined in accordance with FASB authoritative guidance for measuring uncertain tax positions, increased by $1.2 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2020 to $148.8 million.
The $85.5 million relates to an additional deduction claimed on federal and state amended tax returns for fiscal 2014 for repurchase premium paid in that year in connection with the early redemption of the Company’s 3.125% Junior Convertible debenture due March 15, 2037.
The Company’s policy is to include interest and penalties related to income tax liabilities within the provision for income taxes on the condensed consolidated statements of income.
The balance of accrued interest and penalties recorded in the condensed consolidated balance sheets and the amounts of interest and penalties included in the Company's provision for income taxes were not material for all periods presented.
As of the fiscal quarter ended June 29, 2019, the potential impact of a final adverse decision to the consolidated statement of income could be as much as $45.0 million for prior years' taxes and interest.
The Company offers, subject to certain terms and conditions, to indemnify customers and distributors for costs and damages awarded against these parties in the event the Company’s hardware products are found to infringe third-party intellectual property rights, including patents, copyrights or trademarks, and to compensate certain customers for limited specified costs they actually incur in the event the Company's hardware products experience epidemic failure.
However, there can be no assurances that the Company will not incur any financial liabilities in the future as a result of these obligations.

Further, changes to our qualified personnel, including key members of management, may be disruptive to our business, and any failure to successfully assimilate key new hires, or to successfully retain, develop and transition promoted employees, could adversely affect our business and results of operations.
The availability of substantial amounts of our common stock resulting from the exercise or settlement of equity awards outstanding under our equity incentive plans, which would be dilutive to existing stockholders, could adversely affect the prevailing market price of our common stock and could impair our ability to raise additional capital through the sale of equity securities.
