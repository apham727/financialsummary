As a result, the Company had $10 million of backlog as of the current quarter ended April 30, 2019.
As a result of the Company’s backlog balance as of April 30, 2019, the Company’s liquidity and available capital resources are expected to continue to improve during the balance of the current fiscal year.
The Company used cash of $2.6 million during the six months ended April 30, 2019 due largely to an increase in sales, which resulted in increased inventory purchases and an increase in outstanding accounts receivables as of quarter-end.
For example, on March 15, 2019, the Company purchased all of the assets of C Enterprises for $600,000 in cash and the assumption of certain liabilities.
Accordingly, the Company’s results of operations for the both three and six month periods ended April 30, 2018 have been adjusted to remove the results of Comnet; the operating results of Comnet in 2018 are reported in the attached condensed consolidated financial statements as discontinued operations on the statement of operations.

Net sales of $13.6 million decreased by 34%, or $6.9 million, for the three months ended April 30, 2019 (the “fiscal 2019 quarter”) when compared to the three months ended April 30, 2018 (the “fiscal 2018 quarter”).
Net sales for the fiscal 2019 quarter at the Company’s Custom Cabling segment decreased by $7.5 million, or 42%, when compared to the fiscal 2018 quarter.
The year-over-year decline in sales was primarily due to the largest series of orders the Company has ever received in the 2018 fiscal quarter, which orders significantly enhanced net sales in the second quarter of fiscal 2018.
The net sales at the Company’s Custom Cabling segment in the fiscal 2019 second quarter were supplemented by $1.7 million of net sales that the Company generated from its newly acquired C Enterprises subsidiary.
The Company did not own C Enterprises in the 2018 fiscal year.
However, net sales at the Company’s Custom Cabling segment for the second quarter ended April 30, 2019 increased over the first quarter ended January 31, 2019.
Even excluding the additional net sales generated by C Enterprises in the second quarter of fiscal 2019, net sales in the Company’s Custom Cabling segment increased by $0.7 million over the first quarter of fiscal 2019.
Net sales for the fiscal 2019 quarter at the RF Connector segment increased by $0.6 million, or 22%, to $3.3 million as compared to $2.7 million for the fiscal 2018 quarter.
Engineering expenses decreased $0.3 million during the fiscal 2019 quarter to $0.3 million compared to $0.6 million for the fiscal 2018 quarter due to higher compensation expense related to engineering activities in the fiscal 2018 quarter to support the higher net sales in the fiscal 2018 quarter.
For the fiscal 2019 quarter, income (loss) from continuing operations for the Custom Cabling segment and the RF Connector segment was $1.1 million and $0.3 million, respectively, as compared to $4.4 million and ($0.5) million for the comparable second quarter last year.
The decrease in income from continuing operations at the Custom Cabling segment was primarily due to the higher sales in the fiscal 2018 quarter, while the RF Connector segment had an increase in income (loss) from continuing operations due in part to the increase in sales and an increase in gross margins.
The increase in the effective income tax rate from period to period was primarily driven by the elimination of the benefit from the domestic production activities deduction and the one-time benefit recorded in the prior year related to the reduction in the Company’s deferred tax liability due to the change in the federal tax rate, both as a result of the Tax Act.
All of the income from discontinued operations, net of tax, during the fiscal 2018 quarter represents the results from the operations of Comnet Telecom Supply, Inc., a former subsidiary of the Company that was discontinued on October 31, 2018.
Net sales of $24.3 million decreased by 15%, or $4.2 million, for the six months ended April 30, 2019 (the “fiscal 2019 six month period”) when compared to the six months ended April 30, 2018 (the “fiscal 2018 six month period”).
The decrease in net sales is attributable to a decrease in net sales at the Company’s Custom Cabling segment.
Net sales for the fiscal 2019 six month period at the Company’s Custom Cabling segment decreased $5.4 million, or 24%, to $17.7 million when compared to the fiscal 2018 six month period net sales of $23.1 million.
The year-over-year decline in sales was a result of the largest series of orders that the Company has ever received, which orders it received in the year ago six month period ended April 30, 2018.
Net sales for the fiscal 2019 six month period at the RF Connector segment increased by $1.2 million, or 23%, to $6.6 million as compared to $5.4 million for the fiscal 2018 six month period.
The Company’s gross profit as a percentage of sales in the fiscal 2019 six month period decreased by 6% to 30% compared to 36% in the fiscal 2018 six month period due primarily to the substantially higher revenues at the Custom Cabling division in the fiscal 2018 six month period.
The decrease in selling and general expenses was primarily due to the higher compensation resulting from the higher net sales in the fiscal 2018 six month period.
Selling and general expenses as a percentage of sales increased to 18% for the fiscal 2019 six month period as compared to 17% for the fiscal 2018 six month period partially due to one-time costs of $100,000 related to the acquisition of C Enterprises in the fiscal 2019 quarter, and partially due to the absorption of the selling and general expenses of the newly acquired C Enterprises.
For the fiscal 2019 six month period, income (loss) from continuing operations for the Custom Cabling segment and the RF Connector segment was $1.6 million and $0.5 million, respectively, as compared to $5.0 million and $(0.6) million for the comparable six months last year.
The decrease in income from continuing operations at the Custom Cabling segment was primarily due to the higher sales in the fiscal 2018 six month period, while the increase at RF Connector was primarily due in part to the increase in sales and an increase in gross margins.
The decrease in the effective income tax rate from period to period was primarily driven by the elimination of the benefit from the domestic production activities deduction and the one-time benefit recorded in the prior year related to the reduction in the Company’s deferred tax liability due to the change in the federal tax rate, both as a result of the Tax Act.
