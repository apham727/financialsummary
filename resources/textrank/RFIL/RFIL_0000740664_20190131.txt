For the three months ended January 31, 2019, most of the Company’s revenues were generated from the Custom Cabling segment from the sale of fiber optics cable, copper cabling, custom patch cord assemblies, and wiring harnesses (which accounted for 69% of the Company’s total sales for the three months ended January 31, 2019).
Revenues from the RF Connector segment were generated from the sales of RF connector products and connector cable assemblies and accounted for 31% of the Company’s total sales for the three months ended January 31, 2019.
·As of January 31, 2019, the Company had $28.6 million in current assets and $3.8 million in current liabilities.
During the year ended October 31, 2018 (“fiscal year 2018”), the Company received an influx of sales orders from customers that resulted in a sharp increase in sales and backlog from the prior fiscal year ended October 31, 2017.
Since the end of fiscal year 2018, the Company has filled most of the October 31, 2018 backlog.
However, the Company has maintained a consistent volume of bookings and shipments during the first quarter ended January 31, 2019, resulting in a substantially unchanged backlog of $11 million.
Since purchase orders are submitted from customers based on the timing of their requirements, the Company’s ability to predict orders in future periods or trends in future periods is limited.
As a result of the Company’s backlog balance as of January 31, 2019, the Company’s liquidity and available capital resources are expected to continue to improve during the balance of the current fiscal year.
The Company used cash of $2.3 million during the three months ended January 31, 2019 due largely to an increase in sales, which resulted in increased inventory purchases and an increase in outstanding accounts receivables as of quarter-end.
In addition, during the three months ended January 31, 2019, the Company received $0.3 million from the exercise of stock options and paid out $0.2 million in dividends.
The Company does not anticipate needing material additional capital equipment in the next twelve months.
Management also believes that based on the Company’s current financial condition, its current backlog of unfulfilled orders and its anticipated future operations, the Company would be able to finance its expansion, if necessary.
On March 8, 2019, the Company announced that it has entered into a binding agreement to purchase all of the assets of C Enterprises, L.P., a California based designer, manufacturer, and distributor of fiber and copper custom cables and cable assembles, and other related products used in the data center, networking, and wireless markets.
The total cash outlay related to the purchase of C Enterprises is currently not expected to have a material impact on the Company’s liquidity and capital resources.
On October 31, 2018, the Company sold all of the shares of Comnet Telecom Supply, Inc (“Comnet”), a wholly-owned subsidiary that was part of the Company’s Custom Cabling segment.
Accordingly, the Company’s results of operations for the three months ended January 31, 2018 have been adjusted to remove the results of Comnet; the operating results of Comnet in 2018 are reported in the attached condensed consolidated financial statements as discontinued operations on the statement of operations.
During the first quarter of fiscal 2018, Comnet had net sales and income (loss) from continuing operations before provision for income taxes of $2.4 million and $0.2 million, respectively.
Net sales of $10.6 million increased by 34%, or $2.7 million, for the three months ended January 31, 2019 (the “fiscal 2019 quarter”) when compared to the three months ended January 31, 2018 (the “fiscal 2018 quarter”).
Net sales for the fiscal 2019 quarter at the Company’s Custom Cabling segment increased by $2.1 million, or 38%, when compared to the fiscal 2018 quarter as a result of increased sales of fiber optics cable, copper cabling, custom patch cord assemblies and wiring harnesses.
The Custom Cabling segment saw an increase in new sales due, in large part, to project work in the OEM and wireless carrier markets in addition to an increase in traditional run rate business.
Net sales for the fiscal 2019 quarter at the RF Connector segment increased by $0.6 million, or 24%, to $3.3 million as compared to $2.6 million for the fiscal 2018 quarter.
Selling and general expenses increased $0.2 million to $2.0 million compared to $1.8 million in the first quarter last year due to higher compensation expenses as a result of increased sales at the Custom Cabling segment.
Despite this increase in expenses, selling and general expenses as a percentage of sales declined to 19% of sales compared to 22% of sales in the first quarter last year, reflecting the Company’s focus on increased operational efficiencies.
For the fiscal 2019 quarter, income (loss) from continuing operations for the Custom Cabling segment and the RF Connector segment was $0.5 million and $0.3 million, respectively, as compared to $0.5 million and ($0.2) million for the comparable first quarter last year.
The income from continuing operations at the Custom Cabling segment remained consistent with the first quarter last year, while the RF Connector segment had an increase in income (loss) from continuing operations primarily due to the increase in sales.
The increase in the effective income tax rate from period to period was primarily driven by the elimination of the benefit from the domestic production activities deduction and the one-time benefit recorded in the prior year related to the reduction in the Company’s deferred tax liability due to the change in the federal tax rate, both as a result of the Tax Act.
