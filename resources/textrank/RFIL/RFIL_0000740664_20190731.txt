(“C Enterprises”), its newly formed subsidiary, the Company purchased the business and assets of C Enterprises L.P., a California based designer and manufacturer of quality connectivity solutions to telecommunications and data communications distributors.
For the nine months ended July 31, 2019, most of the Company’s revenues were generated from the Custom Cabling segment from the sale of fiber optics cable, copper cabling, custom patch cord assemblies, and wiring harnesses (which accounted for 75% of the Company’s total sales for the nine months ended July 31, 2019).
Revenues from the RF Connector segment were generated from the sales of RF connector products and connector cable assemblies and accounted for 25% of the Company’s total sales for the nine months ended July 31, 2019.
● As of July 31, 2019, the Company had $32.1 million in current assets and $5.4 million in current liabilities.
During the fiscal year ended October 31, 2018, the Company’s backlog increased significantly to $11 million as of October 31, 2018.
As a result, the Company had $8 million of backlog as of the current quarter ended July 31, 2019.
As a result of the Company’s backlog balance as of July 31, 2019, the Company’s liquidity and available capital resources are expected to continue to improve during the remainder of the current fiscal year.
The Company used cash of $3.0 million in operating activities during the nine months ended July 31, 2019 due largely to an increase in sales, which resulted in increased inventory purchases and an increase in outstanding accounts receivables as of quarter-end.
For example, on March 15, 2019, the Company purchased all of the assets of C Enterprises for $600,000 in cash and the assumption of certain liabilities.
Accordingly, the Company’s results of operations for the both three and nine month periods ended July 31, 2018 have been adjusted to remove the results of Comnet, and the operating results of Comnet in 2018 are reported in the attached condensed consolidated financial statements as discontinued operations on the statement of operations.
During the three months ended July 31, 2018, Comnet had net sales of $2.0 million and income from continuing operations before provision for income taxes of $0.1 million.
During the nine months ended July 31, 2018, Comnet had net sales of $6.3 million and income from continuing operations before provision for income taxes of $0.4 million.
Net sales of $15.5 million increased by 31%, or $3.7 million, for the three months ended July 31, 2019 (the “fiscal 2019 quarter”) when compared to the three months ended July 31, 2018 (the “fiscal 2018 quarter”).
Net sales for the fiscal 2019 quarter at the Company’s Custom Cabling segment increased by $3.4 million, or 39%, when compared to the fiscal 2018 quarter as a result of increased sales of fiber optics cable, copper cabling, custom patch cord assemblies and wiring harnesses.
Net sales for the fiscal 2019 quarter at the RF Connector segment increased by $0.3 million, or 10%, to $3.5 million as compared to $3.1 million for the fiscal 2018 quarter.
The increase in net sales reflects a full quarter of sales contribution from the Company’s acquisition of C Enterprises, as well as growth in both the Company’s traditional run rate business and its project work in the OEM and wireless carrier markets.
Selling and general expenses increased $0.8 million to $2.6 million (17% of sales) compared to $1.8 million (15% of sales) in the third quarter last year due to the absorption of the selling and general expenses of the newly acquired C Enterprises, increased compensation primarily due to timing of bonus accruals, increased marketing costs with the Company’s distributors, and costs related to the evaluation of possible strategic acquisition transactions.
For the fiscal 2019 quarter, income from continuing operations for the Custom Cabling segment and the RF Connector segment was $1.1 million and $0.2 million, respectively, as compared to $1.8 million and $0.2 million for the comparable third quarter last year.
The decrease in income from continuing operations at the Custom Cabling and RF Connector segments was primarily due to the decrease in gross margins during the fiscal 2019 quarter.
The increase in the effective income tax rate from period to period was primarily driven by the elimination of the benefit from the domestic production activities deduction and the one-time benefit recorded in the prior year related to the reduction in the Company’s deferred tax liability due to the change in the federal tax rate, both as a result of the Tax Act.
All of the income from discontinued operations, net of tax, during the fiscal 2018 quarter represents the results from the operations of Comnet Telecom Supply, Inc., a former subsidiary of the Company that we sold on October 31, 2018.
Net sales of $39.8 million decreased by 1%, or $0.5 million, for the nine months ended July 31, 2019 (the “fiscal 2019 nine month period”) when compared to the nine months ended July 31, 2018 (the “fiscal 2018 nine month period”) despite the additional sales derived in 2019 from the newly acquired C Enterprises subsidiary.
The decrease in net sales is attributable to a decrease in net sales at the Company’s Custom Cabling segment, which decreased by $2.1 million, or 7%, to $29.7 million when compared to the fiscal 2018 nine month period net sales of $31.8 million.
The year-over-year decline in sales was a result of the largest series of orders that the Company has ever received in the year ago nine month period ended July 31, 2018.
Net sales for the fiscal 2019 nine month period at the RF Connector segment increased by $1.6 million, or 18%, to $10.0 million as compared to $8.5 million for the fiscal 2018 nine month period.
The Company’s gross profit as a percentage of sales in the fiscal 2019 nine month period decreased to 29% compared to 35% in the fiscal 2018 nine month period due primarily to product mix at the Custom Cabling segment as well as increased production wages at both segments in order to reward and retain production workforce and, in some cases, to meet state mandated minimum wage requirements.
Engineering expenses decreased by $0.2 million in the fiscal 2019 nine month period to $1.0 million compared to $1.2 million for the fiscal 2018 nine month period due to higher engineering activities to support the higher net sales in the fiscal 2018 nine month period.
Selling and general expenses as a percentage of sales increased to 18% for the fiscal 2019 nine month period as compared to 16% for the fiscal 2018 nine month period.
For the fiscal 2019 nine month period, income (loss) from continuing operations for the Custom Cabling segment and the RF Connector segment was $2.7 million and $0.7 million, respectively, as compared to $6.8 million and $(0.4) million for the comparable nine months last year.
The decrease in income from continuing operations at the Custom Cabling segment in 2019 was primarily due to lower gross margins during the fiscal 2019 nine month period, while the increase at RF Connector was primarily due in part to the increase in sales and gross margins.
The increase in the effective income tax rate from period to period was primarily driven by the elimination of the benefit from the domestic production activities deduction and the one-time benefit recorded in the prior year related to the reduction in the Company’s deferred tax liability due to the change in the federal tax rate, both as a result of the Tax Act.
All of the income from discontinued operations, net of tax, during the fiscal 2018 nine month period represents the results from the operations of Comnet Telecom Supply, Inc., a former subsidiary of the Company that we sold on October 31, 2018.
