The earn-out was and will continue to be revalued quarterly using a present value approach, and any resulting increase or decrease will be recorded into selling and general expenses.
·As of April 30, 2018, the Company had $27.9 million in current assets and $10.4 million in current liabilities.
Subsequent to the fiscal year ended October 31, 2017, the Company experienced a substantial increase in orders for its products in the Custom Cabling Manufacturing and Assembly segment.
As a result of these increased orders, the Company’s backlog had increased to $20.2 million as of January 31, 2018.
During the quarter ended April 30, 2018, the Company filled a substantial amount of the January 31, 2018 backlog, which contributed to the large sales for the three months ended April 30, 2018.
Despite shipping most of the January 31, 2018 backlog in the three month period ended April 30, 2018, the Custom Cabling Manufacturing and Assembly segment backlog stood at $9.5 million as of April 30, 2018 as a result of additional new orders received during the second quarter.
The Company is unable to predict future orders for its products, but it currently anticipates that its net sales for second half of the current fiscal year will likely be less than the first half.
Nevertheless, the Company’s liquidity and available capital resources are expected to continue to improve during the balance of the current fiscal year.
The Company generated cash of $2.5 million during the six months ended April 30, 2018 due largely to the impact of increased sales, which resulted in net income of $3.7 million.
This net decrease in cash was partially offset by an increase in cash from noncash credits of $0.5 million primarily from depreciation and amortization related to the acquisitions of Comnet, Rel-Tech and CompPro, and $0.1 million of stock-based compensation expense.
In addition, during the quarter the Company received $0.4 million from the exercise of stock options and paid out $0.4 million in dividends.
The Company does not anticipate needing material additional capital equipment in the next twelve months.

Net sales for the fiscal 2018 quarter at the Company’s Custom Cabling Manufacturing and Assembly segment (Custom Cabling) increased by $14.6 million, or 292%, when compared to the fiscal 2017 quarter as a result of increased sales of fiber optics cable, copper cabling, custom patch cord assemblies and wiring harnesses.
The Custom Cabling Manufacturing and Assembly segment saw an increase in new sales due, in large part, to project work in the OEM and wireless carrier markets in addition to an increase in traditional run rate business.
Net sales for the fiscal 2018 quarter at the RF Connector and Cable Assembly segment (RF Connector) increased by $0.1 million, or 4%, to $2.7 million as compared to $2.6 million for the fiscal 2017 quarter.
Engineering expenses increased $0.4 million during the fiscal 2018 quarter to $0.6 million compared to $0.2 million for the fiscal 2017 quarter due to increased compensation expense related to engineering activities.
Selling and general expenses increased $1.7 million to $3.4 million compared to $1.7 million in the second quarter last year due to higher compensation related to the sales gains at Custom Cabling.
Despite this increase in expenses, selling and general expenses as a percentage of sales declined to 15% of sales compared to 22% of sales in the second quarter last year indicating the Company’s increased operational efficiencies.
For the fiscal 2018 quarter, income (loss) from continuing operations for the Custom Cabling segment and the RF Connector segment was $4.3 million and $(0.3) million, respectively, as compared to none and $0.1 million for the comparable second quarter last year.
The increase in income from continuing operations at the Custom Cabling segment was primarily due to the increase in sales while the decrease at the RF Connector segment was primarily due to corporate overhead allocations related to accrued bonuses as a result of the increased profitability of the Company overall.
All of the income from discontinued operations, net of tax, during the fiscal 2017 quarter was for royalty payments received under the agreement for the sale of the Company’s RadioMobile division.
Net sales of $32.7 million increased by 129%, or $18.4 million, for the six months ended April 30, 2018 (the “fiscal 2018 six month period”) when compared to the six months ended April 30, 2017 (the “fiscal 2017 six month period”).
Net sales for the fiscal 2018 six month period at the Company’s Custom Cabling increased $18.3 million, or 201%, when compared to the fiscal 2017 six month period due to increased sale of fiber optics cable, copper cabling, custom patch cord assemblies and wiring harnesses and other products.
Net sales for the fiscal 2018 six month period at the RF Connector and Cable Assembly segment increased by $0.3 million, or 6%, to $5.4 million as compared to $5.1 million for the fiscal 2017 six month period.
The Company’s gross profit as a percentage of sales in the fiscal 2018 six month period increased by 7% to 34% compared to 27% in the fiscal 2017 six month period due primarily to the increased revenues at the Custom Cabling division.
The improvement in gross margins was primarily due to the revenue increase at the Custom Cabling segment which had the effect of spreading certain fixed manufacturing costs over a larger revenue base.
Selling and general expenses increased by $1.9 million during the fiscal 2018 six month period to $5.6 million from $3.7 million in the 2017 fiscal period.
The increase in selling and general expenses was primarily due to increased compensation resulting from the increase in net sales.
