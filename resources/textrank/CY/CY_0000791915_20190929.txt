Pursuant to the terms of the Spansion Notes Indenture, a fundamental change will not be deemed to have occurred in the case of a person or group becoming the beneficial owner, directly or indirectly, of more than 50% of the Company’s common stock or in the case of a liquidation, consolidation or merger of the Company if, in either case, 90% of the consideration paid in such transaction consists of shares of common equity traded on The New York Stock Exchange or Nasdaq.

Such condition was met as of the last trading day of each of the Company's fiscal quarters ended June 30, 2019 and September 29, 2019 and, accordingly, the 2022 Notes were and will be convertible at the option of their holders during the third and fourth quarters of fiscal 2019.
During the three months ended September 29, 2019, the Company received conversion notices representing an immaterial principal amount of 2022 Notes from holders.
