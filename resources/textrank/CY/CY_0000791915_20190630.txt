In addition, the Company entered into fixed-for-floating interest rate forward swap agreements and has designated these swaps as hedging instruments.
The Company records changes in the intrinsic value of its cash flow hedges in accumulated other comprehensive income on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets, until the forecasted transaction occurs.
In the event the underlying forecasted transaction does not occur, or it becomes probable that it will not occur, the Company will reclassify the gain or loss on the related cash flow hedge from accumulated other comprehensive income to interest and other income, net in its Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations at that time.

("Deca") was other-than temporarily impaired due to significant delays in Deca's commercialization and achievement of scalable production of certain key products, and consequently we recognized an impairment charge of $41.5 million to write down the carrying value of our investment in Deca to $65.1 million (the estimated fair value of our investment as of the end of fiscal 2018).
•During the second quarter of fiscal 2019, we determined that our investment in Deca had become further impaired due to a significant reduction in orders from Deca's key customers, and based on other objective indicators of enterprise value.
Consequently, we recognized an additional impairment charge of $29.5 million to write down the carrying value of our investment in Deca to $28.6 million (the estimated fair value of our investment as of June 30, 2019).
If Deca is unable to (a) secure sufficient orders from its existing significant customers or new customers, (b) raise sufficient funding, if needed, for continuing its operations, or (c) complete a strategic transaction that allows realization of its economic value, we may be required to record further impairment charges to partially or fully write down the carrying value of our investment in Deca.
