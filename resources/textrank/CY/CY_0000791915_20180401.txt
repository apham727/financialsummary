The Company’s hedging policy is designed to mitigate the impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations on its operating results.

We use foreign currency forward contracts to reduce our foreign exchange exposure on our foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities.
We also hedge a percentage of our forecasted revenue denominated in Japanese yen with foreign currency forward contracts.
The objective of these contracts is to mitigate the impact of foreign currency exchange rate movements to our operating results on a short-term basis.
For those assets and liabilities, we evaluated the effects of a 10% shift in exchange rates between those currencies and the U.S. dollar.
