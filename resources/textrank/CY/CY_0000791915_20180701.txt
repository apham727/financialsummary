•inadequate levels of compliance with applicable anti-bribery laws, including the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. For example, our sales were impacted in the second quarter of 2018 when the U.S. Department of Commerce banned U.S. companies from providing exports to ZTE, a Chinese telecoms equipment manufacturer (which ban was subsequently lifted in the third quarter of 2018) in an export controls case.
•Some of our customers manufacture products containing our components for re-sale into the U.S. If the U.S. were to impose tariffs on the finished goods that our customers import into the U.S., such tariffs could negatively impact our customers' sales, thereby causing an indirect negative impact on our own sales.
•If China were to impose new tariffs on the products we sell in China, or on finished goods our end customers sell in China, such tariffs could directly or indirectly reduce demand for our products, negatively impacting our sales.
Our foundry partners and assembly and test subcontractors have operations in locations that may suffer the impact of certain natural disasters and political risk, which could impact their ability to provide us with our products.
