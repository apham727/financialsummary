In February 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued a new accounting standard on leasing.
The new standard will require companies to record most leased assets and liabilities on the balance sheet, and also proposes a dual model for recognizing expense.
This guidance will be effective in the first quarter of 2019 with early adoption permitted.
We have evaluated the impact of adopting this guidance and we are preparing for the changes to be made to our consolidated financial statements.
We expect the adoption of these accounting changes will not impact our assets and liabilities nor our net income or equity, as we currently do not lease any assets.
In March 2016, the FASB issued new accounting standard which simplified certain aspects of the accounting for stock-based payment transactions, including income taxes, classification of awards and classification in the statement of cash flows.
This guidance was effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016 and interim periods within those annual periods.
The adoption of this standard did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements and disclosures.
In May 2017, the FASB issued a new accounting standard which provides guidance about which changes to the terms or conditions of a share-based payment award require an entity to apply modification accounting in ASC Topic 718.
Under the new guidance, modification accounting is required only if the fair value, the vesting conditions, or the classification of the award (as equity or liability) changes as a result of the change in terms or conditions.
This guidance will be effective for the year ending December 31, 2019 and interim reporting periods within that year.
We expect the adoption of this guidance will not have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements.
The primary impact of adoption relates to additional disclosures and presentation of revenue by primary geographical market, major product line and the timing of revenue recognition.

The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the condensed consolidated financial statements, including the related notes, appearing in Item 1 of Part 1of this quarterly report on Form 10-Q, as well as our most recent annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2017.
Reserves for sales allowances and customer returns are established based upon historical experience and our estimates of future returns.
Sales returns for the three months ended March 31, 2018 and 2017 were $2,000 and $111,000, respectively.
The allowance for sales returns and doubtful accounts at March 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017 aggregated $42,000 and $40,000, respectively.
Inventory – Inventory, consisting principally of products held for resale, is recorded at the lower of cost (determined using the first in-first out method) or net realizable value.
We had inventory balances in the amount of $4,409,000 and $4,990,000 at March 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017, respectively, which is presented net of valuation allowances of $7,910,000 and $7,848,000, respectively.
We evaluate inventories to identify excess, high-cost, slow-moving or other factors rendering inventories as unmarketable at normal profit margins.
Due to the complexity of managing and maintaining a large inventory of product offerings, estimates are made regarding adjustments to the cost of inventories.
Based on our assumptions about future demand and market conditions, inventories are carried at the lower of cost or net realizable value.
If our assumptions about future demand change, or market conditions are less favorable than those projected, additional write-downs of inventories may be required.
In accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, we have classified inventory as a current asset in our March 31, 2018, condensed consolidated financial statements representing approximately 50% of current assets and 34% of total assets.
However, if all or a substantial portion of the inventory was required to be immediately liquidated, the inventory would not be as readily marketable or liquid as other items included or classified as a current asset, such as cash.
Therefore, it is possible that further declines in our carrying values of inventory may result.
Net sales in the first quarter of 2018 totaled $1,655,000 versus $2,167,000 in the comparable period for 2017, a decrease of $512,000 or 23.6% over the same period last year.
The decrease was primarily due material shortages, longer production lead times and lower valued per unit products shipped.
Gross profit for the first quarter of 2018 was $654,000 versus $873,000 in the comparable period for 2018, and gross margin percentage of net sales was 39.2% in the first quarter of 2018 versus 40.3% in the comparable period for 2017.
Selling, general and administrative expenses in the first quarter of 2018 totaled $560,000 versus $540,000 in the comparable period for 2017.
Other income, net of other expense, in the first quarter of 2018 was $48,000 versus $29,000 in the comparable period for 2017.
Net income was $59,000 for the first quarter of 2018 versus $299,000 in the comparable period for 2017, a decrease of $240,000 resulting from the decrease in net sales.
Cash flows provided by operating activities were $493,000 as opposed to $366,000 used for in the three months ended March 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively.
The increase of $859,000 in cash flows provided by operations compared with the prior period resulted from changes in operating assets and liabilities, primarily from inventory, accounts payables and accounts receivables compared to the prior period.
Cash flows used in financing activities were $139,000 and $138,000 for the three months ended March 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively.
Inventory is included in current assets; however, it will take over one year for the inventory to turn.
Hence, inventory would not be as readily marketable or liquid as other items included in current assets, such as cash.
We believe that funds generated from, or used in operations, in addition to existing cash balances are likely to be sufficient to finance our working capital and capital expenditure requirements for the foreseeable future.
If these funds are not sufficient, we may secure new sources of short-term commercial loans, asset-based lending on accounts receivables or issue debt or equity securities.
