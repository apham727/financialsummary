In February 2016, the FASB issued a new accounting standard on leasing.
The new standard will require companies to record most leased assets and liabilities on the balance sheet, and also proposes a dual model for recognizing expense.
This guidance was effective in our first quarter of 2019.
We have evaluated the impact of adopting this guidance and the adoption of these accounting changes have not impacted our assets and liabilities nor our net income or equity, as we currently do not lease any assets.
In January 2017, the FASB issued a new accounting standard which clarifies the definition of a business with the objective of adding guidance to assist entities with evaluating whether transactions should be accounted for as acquisitions or disposals of assets or businesses.

The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the condensed consolidated financial statements, including the related notes, appearing in Item 1 of Part 1 of this quarterly report on Form 10-Q, as well as our most recent annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018.
Reserves for sales allowances and customer returns are established based upon historical experience and our estimates of future returns.
Sales returns for the three months ended March 31, 2019 and 2018 were $3,000 and $2,000, respectively.
The allowance for sales returns and doubtful accounts at March 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018 aggregated $39,000 and $38,000, respectively.
In accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, we have classified inventory as a current asset in our March 31, 2019, condensed consolidated financial statements representing approximately 47% of current assets and 34% of total assets.
However, if all or a substantial portion of the inventory was required to be immediately liquidated, the inventory would not be as readily marketable or liquid as other items included or classified as a current asset, such as cash.
Net sales in the first quarter of 2019 totaled $1,384,000 versus $1,655,000 in the comparable period for 2018, a decrease of $271,000 or 16.4% over the same period last year.
The decrease was primarily driven by a decrease of ODM project sales volume.
Gross profit for the first quarter of 2019 was $683,000 versus $654,000 in the comparable period for 2018, and gross margin percentage of net sales was 49.4% in the first quarter of 2019 versus 39.5% in the comparable period for 2018.
The approximately 10% gross profit increase was driven by an increase of ODM project sales unit pricing contributing approximately 5% and shipments of new higher gross margin ODM products which contributed approximately 4% of the increase.
Selling, general and administrative expenses in the first quarter of 2019 totaled $530,000 versus $560,000 in the comparable period for 2018.
The $30,000 decrease was primarily driven by the decreases of $15,000 in professional services and $9,000 in commissions paid to our independent sales representatives.
Other income, net of other expense, in the first quarter of 2019 was $25,000 versus $48,000 in the comparable period for 2018.
Income tax provision was $1,000 for the first quarter of 2019 versus $2,000 in 2018, as we do not expect significant taxable income for the year ending December 31, 2019.
Net income was $184,000 for the first quarter of 2019 versus $59,000 in the comparable period for 2018, an increase of $125,000 resulting from the reasons discussed above.
We historically have satisfied our liquidity requirements through cash generated from operations, short-term commercial loans, subordinated related party promissory notes and issuance of equity securities.
Cash flows used for financing activities were $95,000 and $139,000 for the three months ended March 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively.
The decrease of $44,000 compared with the prior period was primarily due to $76,000 of stock options exercised and partially offset by $32,000 of increased cash dividend payments.
The increase to our cash dividends was based upon our November 2, 2018 announcement that our quarterly cash dividends increased by 20% from $0.025 per share to $0.03 per share.
We believe that funds generated from operations, existing cash balances and, if necessary, related party short-term loans, are likely to be sufficient to finance our working capital and capital expenditure requirements for the foreseeable future.
If these funds are not sufficient, we may secure new sources of asset-based lending on accounts receivables or issue debt or equity securities.
Otherwise, we may need to liquidate assets to generate the necessary working capital.
Inventory is included and classified as a current asset.
As of March 31, 2019, inventory represented approximately 47% of current assets and 34% of total assets.
However, it is likely to take over one year for the inventory to turn and therefore is likely not saleable within a one-year time frame.
Hence, inventory would not be as readily marketable or liquid as other items included in current assets, such as cash.
