Long-lived Asset Impairment Testing.
Based on management’s testing and evaluation, we determined that we did not design and maintain effective internal control over the step one goodwill impairment testing that we performed in accordance with ASC 350, Intangibles – Goodwill and Other and ASC 360, Property, Plant, and Equipment, as of April 30, 2017 and December 31, 2017, respectively.
Specifically, the Company’s review control did not operate at a sufficient level of precision to identify the improper assumptions used in our impairment analyses.
We concluded that this lack of review in sufficient detail of the analyses was a material weakness in our internal controls.
We wrote off the JDL reporting unit goodwill in the second quarter of 2017 and have no remaining recorded goodwill.
If we record goodwill in the future, however, we will need to implement and maintain internal controls to ensure we complete our goodwill impairment analysis in a timely manner and with adequate detail.
To address the above, we are in the process of designing new review controls to value our business units to ensure that goodwill and long-lived asset impairment analyses are completed in a timely manner and in enough detail to operate at a sufficient level of precision to identify improper assumptions.
