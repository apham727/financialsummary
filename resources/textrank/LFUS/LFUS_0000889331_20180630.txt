For the second quarter of 2018, the Company recognized net sales of $459.2 million compared to $313.4 million in the second quarter of 2017 representing an increase of $145.8 million, or 46.5%.
The increase was primarily driven by the acquisition of IXYS, which added $100.2 million in sales along with higher volume across all three segments.
Net sales for Electronics increased $130.0 million, or 76.7%, primarily due to the acquisition of IXYS and strong growth across all the business units and favorable changes in foreign exchange rates of $8.0 million.
Net sales for the Automotive segment increased $10.7 million, or 9.2% due to volume growth across all the segment’s business units.
Net sales in the Industrial segment increased $5.1 million or 18.7% due to volume growth across all the segment’s business units.
The Company recognized net income of $42.3 million, or $1.67 per diluted share, in the second quarter of 2018 compared to net income of $48.6 million, or $2.11 per diluted share in the second quarter of 2017.
The decrease in net income reflects the impact of $19.0 million of purchase accounting inventory charges, higher amortization expense of $7.2 million and foreign exchange losses of $3.2 million that were partially offset by the acquisition of IXYS and operating income increases across the Electronics and Industrial segments.
Additionally, the per share results reflect an increase in the weighted average diluted shares outstanding of 2.1 million resulting from the shares issued in conjunction with the acquisition of IXYS.
Net cash provided by operating activities was $140.9 million for the six months ended June 30, 2018 as compared to $93.6 million for the six months ended July 1, 2017.
The increase in net cash provided by operating activities reflected higher earnings and favorable working capital management that more than offset higher payments related to acquisition and integration costs and higher cash taxes.
The following table summarizes the Company’s consolidated results of operations for the periods presented.
The second quarter of 2018 includes $28.7 million of non-segment charges.
The charges related to the IXYS acquisition total $24.4 million ($63.2 million year-to-date) and include $19.0 million ($36.9 million year-to-date) of purchase accounting inventory charges, $2.3 million ($14.1 million year-to-date) in acquisition-related and integration costs primarily related to legal, accounting and other expenses associated with the acquisition of IXYS, $3.1 million ($5.6 million year-to-date) in backlog amortization costs, stock compensation expense recognized immediately upon close for converted IXYS options related to prior services periods of $4.5 million year-to-date and other charges of $2.1 million year-to-date.

The increase in gross profit reflects the IXYS acquisition and volume growth across all segments and expense leverage across all segments.

Operating margins decreased from 19.2% in the second quarter of 2017 to 13.0% in the second quarter of 2018.

In addition to the factors impacting comparative results for operating income discussed above, income before income taxes was impacted by increased unfavorable foreign exchange losses of $3.8 million primarily due to fluctuations in the Euro and Mexican peso against the U.S. dollar and increased interest expense of $2.5 million associated with the increased borrowings for the IXYS acquisition.
Additionally, partially offsetting the previously mentioned expense increases was an increase in other income of $1.9 million during the three months ended June 30, 2018 as compared to the three months ended July 1, 2017 primarily as a result of unrealized investment gains associated with our equity investments.

The Automotive segment net sales increased $29.0 million, or 12.9%, in the first six months of 2018 compared to the first six months of 2017 due to increased volume across all businesses with the commercial vehicle and sensor businesses having the most growth as well as favorable changes in foreign exchange rates of $11.9 million.
