Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements Under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 (“PSLRA”).
For the first quarter of 2018, the Company recognized net sales of $417.8 million compared to $285.4 million in the first quarter of 2017 representing an increase of $132.4 million, or 46.4%.
The increase was primarily driven by the acquisition of IXYS along with higher volume across all three segments.
Net sales for Electronics increased $110.6 million, or 72.0%, due to the acquisition of IXYS and U.S. Sensor and strong growth across all the business units and geographic regions.
Net sales for the Automotive segment increased $18.3 million, or 17.0% due to volume growth across all the segment’s business units and geographic regions.
Net sales in the Industrial segment increased $3.4 million or 14.4% due to volume growth in the power fuse and relay businesses.
The Company recognized net income of $36.0 million, or $1.45 per diluted share, in the first quarter of 2018 compared to net income of $38.9 million, or $1.69 per diluted share in the first quarter of 2017.
The decrease in net income reflects the impact of the acquisition and integration related costs of $39.5 million associated with the IXYS acquisition that were mostly offset by operating income increases across all three segments and foreign exchange gains.
Additionally, the per share results reflect an increase in the weighted average diluted shares outstanding of 1.5 million as a result of the shares issued in conjunction with the acquisition of IXYS.
Net cash provided by operating activities was $69.3 million for the three months ended March 31, 2018 as compared to $22.9 million for the three months ended April 1, 2017.
The increase in net cash provided by operating activities reflected higher earnings and favorable working capital management that more than offset higher payments related to acquisition and integration costs.
On January 17, 2018, the Company completed its acquisition of IXYS for total purchase consideration of $778.8 million, net of cash acquired.
IXYS is a global pioneer in the power semiconductor and integrated circuit markets with a focus on medium to high voltage power control semiconductors across the industrial, communications, consumer and medical markets.
IXYS has a broad customer base, serving more than 3,500 customers through its direct salesforce and global distribution partners.
The following table summarizes the Company’s consolidated results of operations for the periods presented.
The first quarter of 2018 includes $39.5 million of non-segment charges.
The charges related to the IXYS acquisition total $38.6 million and include $17.9 million of purchase accounting inventory charges, $11.7 million in acquisition-related and integration costs primarily related to legal, accounting and other expenses associated with the acquisition of IXYS, $4.5 million of stock compensation expense recognized immediately upon close for converted IXYS options related to prior services periods $2.5 million in backlog amortization costs and $2.1 million in other charges.
In addition, there were $0.8 million of restructuring charges related to certain operations in the Electronics segment.
The first quarter of 2017 includes approximately $1.5 million of non-segment charges.
These were primarily attributable to acquisition-related costs primarily related to legal and integration costs associated with the Company’s acquisitions in 2016 of the ON Portfolio and PolySwitch.
Net sales increased $132.4 million, or 46.4%, for the first quarter of 2018 compared to the first quarter of 2017 with increases of $86.3 million and $3.1 million resulting from incremental net sales related to the IXYS and U.S Sensor acquisitions, respectively.
The remaining increase in net sales was driven by higher volume across all businesses in the Electronics segment and Automotive segments as well as increases in the fuse and relay businesses in the Industrial segment.
Total operating expenses were $112.1 million, or 26.8% of net sales, for the first quarter of 2018 compared to $64.8 million, or 22.7% of net sales, for the first quarter of 2017.
The increase in operating expenses of $47.3 million is primarily due to incremental operating expenses related to the IXYS and US Sensor acquisitions as well as higher acquisition-related and integration costs of $20.1 million and an increase in amortization expense of $6.1 million resulting from the acquisition of IXYS.
Operating income was $37.6 million, a decrease of $11.3 million or 23.1% for the first quarter of 2018 compared to $48.9 million for the first quarter of 2017.
The decrease in operating income is primarily due to the purchase accounting inventory charges of $17.9 million along with the costs associated with the acquisition and integration of the IXYS acquisition as described above.
Operating margins decreased from 17.1% in the first quarter of 2017 to 9.0% in the first quarter of 2018.
The higher acquisition and integration charges negatively impacted operating margins by 9.0% in the first quarter of 2018.
Income before income taxes was $44.6 million, or 10.7% of net sales, for the first quarter of 2018 compared to $47.4 million, or 16.6% of net sales, for the first quarter of 2017.
In addition to the factors impacting comparative results for operating income, income before income taxes was impacted by favorable comparative foreign exchange gains that were partially offset by increased interest expense associated with the increased borrowings for the IXYS acquisition.
The effect of foreign exchange rate changes on various foreign currency transactions worldwide was approximately $10.6 million of unrealized income for the first quarter of 2018 compared to income of unrealized $1.6 million for the first quarter of 2017 primarily due to fluctuations in the euro and Philippine peso against the U.S. dollar.
Interest expense increased $2.3 million in the first quarter of 2018 primarily reflecting increased borrowings.
Additionally, other income increased by $1.9 million as a result of unrealized investment gains, primarily associated with our investment in Polytronics.
Net sales in the Americas increased $40.7 million, or 41.5%, in the first quarter of 2018 compared to the first quarter of 2017 driven by incremental sales from IXYS and U.S. Sensor acquisitions and increased volume across all businesses in the Electronics, Automotive and Industrial segments.
European net sales increased $40.9 million, or 69.4%, in the first quarter of 2018 compared to the first quarter of 2017.
The increase in net sales was primarily due to incremental sales from the IXYS acquisition and higher volumes across all businesses in the Electronics and Automotive segments and the relay business in the Industrial segment as well as favorable foreign currency effects of $9.5 million.
The Company has historically supported its liquidity needs through cash flows from operations.
Management expects that the Company’s (i) current level of cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities, (ii) current and forecasted cash flows from operations, (iii) availability under existing funding arrangements, and (iv) access to capital in the capital markets will provide sufficient funds to support the Company’s operations, capital expenditures, investments, and debt obligations on both a short-term and long-term basis.

The Company is also required to pay commitment fees on unused portions of the credit agreement ranging from 0.15% to 0.25%, based on the Consolidated Leverage Ratio, as defined.
