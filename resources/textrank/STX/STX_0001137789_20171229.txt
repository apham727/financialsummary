An analysis of our financial results comparing the December 2017 quarter to the September 2017 quarter and the December 2016 quarter.
During the December 2017 quarter, we shipped 88 exabytes of HDD storage capacity, generating revenue of approximately $2.9 billion and gross margin of 30%.
Compared to the December 2016 quarter, revenue in the December 2017 quarter increased modestly primarily due to increase in exabytes shipped, offset by price erosion.
Revenue for the six months ended December 2017 quarter decreased by $145 million from the six months ended December 2016 quarter as a result of price erosion, partially offset by an improved product mix.
Sales programs were approximately 12%, 11% and 11% of gross drive revenue for the December 2017 quarter, September 2017 quarter and December 2016 quarter, respectively.
Gross margin as a percentage of revenue for the December 2017 quarter increased by 200 basis points from the September 2017 quarter primarily driven by favorable product mix and improved absorption of factories due to higher demand for the Companys high capacity HDD product portfolio, partially offset by price erosion.
Compared to the corresponding three and six months ended December 2016 quarter, gross margin as a percentage of revenue for the three and six months ended December 2017 quarter decreased by 100 basis points in both periods, primarily driven by price erosion, partially offset by favorable product mix and improved factory utilization resulting from cost savings due to our workforce reductions and manufacturing consolidation activities.
Warranty cost related to new shipments was 1.4%, 1.3%, and 1.2% of revenue for each of the December 2017, September 2017 and December 2016 quarters, respectively.
Product development expense for the December 2017 quarter decreased by $13 million from the September 2017 quarter primarily due to a $4 million decrease in salaries and employee benefits as a result of the restructuring of our workforce in prior periods, a $13 million decrease due to related operational efficiencies, partially offset by an increase in variable compensation expense.
Compared to corresponding six months ended December 2016 quarter, product development expense decreased by $107 million primarily due to a $47 million decrease in salaries and employee benefits as a result of the restructuring of our workforce in prior periods, a $36 million decrease due to related operational efficiencies and a $24 million decrease in variable compensation and share-based compensation expenses.
Marketing and administrative expense for the December 2017 quarter decreased by $3 million from the September 2017 quarter primarily due to a decrease in salaries and related benefits as a result of the restructuring of our workforce in prior periods, partially offset by an increase in variable compensation expense.
Compared to the December 2016 quarter, Marketing and administrative expense decreased by $13 million, primarily due to a $9 million decrease in salaries and related benefits as a result of the restructuring of our workforce in prior periods, and a $4 million decrease in variable compensation expense.
Compared to corresponding six months ended December 2016 quarter, marketing and administrative expense decreased by $21 million primarily due to a $13 million decrease in salaries and related benefits as a result of the restructuring of our workforce in prior periods and a $8 million decrease in variable compensation expense.

Our cash and cash equivalents increased from June 30, 2017 as a result of an increase in the net cash provided by operating activities, partially offset by net cash outflows for dividends paid to our shareholders, repurchase of our ordinary shares, capital expenditures, and repayments of long-term debt.
