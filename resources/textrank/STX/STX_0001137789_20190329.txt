The Companys unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and all its wholly-owned and majority-owned subsidiaries, after elimination of intercompany transactions and balances.
The results of operations for the three and nine months ended March 29, 2019 are not necessarily indicative of the results of operations to be expected for any subsequent interim period or for the Companys fiscal year ending June 28, 2019.

The Company is in the process of assessing the impact of this ASU on its condensed consolidated financial statements.
The impact of applying the new accounting standard on the Companys condensed consolidated financial statements for the three and nine months ended March 29, 2019 was not material.
As of March 29, 2019, the Company had no material available-for-sale debt securities that had been in a continuous unrealized loss position for a period greater than 12 months.
The Company determined no available-for-sale debt securities were other-than-temporarily impaired as of March 29, 2019.

PIK income computed at the contractual rate is accrued into Interest income in the Companys Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations and added to the carrying value of the Investment in debt security on its Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets.
The Company recorded a loss of approximately $1 million and $3 million on repurchases during the three and nine months ended March 30, 2018, respectively, which is included in Other, net on the Companys Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations.
The Company recorded income tax provisions of $20 million and $52 million in the three and nine months ended March 29, 2019, respectively.

The Company did not record any impairment charge for the three months ended March 29, 2019.
The Company records all derivatives in its Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets at fair value.
At such time, the associated gains and losses deferred in Accumulated other comprehensive loss on the Companys Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets are reclassified immediately into earnings and any subsequent changes in the fair value of such derivative instruments are immediately reflected in earnings.
The Company recognized a net loss of $1 million and net gain of $1 million in Other expense, net related to the loss of hedge designation on discontinued cash flow hedges during the three and nine months ended March 29, 2019, respectively.
The Company did not recognize any net gains or losses related to the loss of hedge designation on discontinued cash flow hedges during the three and nine months ended March 30, 2018.
Other derivatives not designated as hedging instruments consist of foreign currency forward exchange contracts that the Company uses to hedge the foreign currency exposure on the investment in debt security and forecasted expenditures denominated in currency other than the U.S. dollar.
The Company recognizes gains and losses on these contracts, as well as the related costs in Other, net on its Condensed Consolidated Statement of Operations along with foreign currency gains and losses on investment in debt security, deferred gains of derivatives in Other current assets and deferred losses of derivatives in Accrued expenses on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets.
The Company is subject to equity market risks due to changes in the fair value of the notional investments selected by its employees as part of its Non-qualified Deferred Compensation Planthe Seagate Deferred Compensation Plan (the SDCP).
Rather, the Company records all changes in the fair value of the TRS to earnings to offset the market value changes of the SDCP liabilities.
As of March 30, 2018, the Company had no outstanding foreign currency forward exchange contracts and the gross fair value of the TRS reflected in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet was immaterial.
When determining the fair value measurements for assets and liabilities required to be recorded at fair value, the Company considers the principal or most advantageous market in which it would transact and it considers assumptions that market participants would use when pricing the asset or liability.

Revenue for the nine months ended March 29, 2019 decreased by $330 million from the nine months ended March 30, 2018 primarily due to price erosion, partially offset by an increase in exabytes shipped.

Our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our cash investment portfolio including investment in debt security in Toshiba Memory Corporation (TMC, formerly known as K.K. Pangea).
