We strive to remain competitive as a leader in high power energy conversion and transformer solutions through the design and manufacture of new and improved products by using advanced and “cutting edge” electronics technologies.
There is competition in all classes of products manufactured by the Company, ranging from divisions of the largest electronic companies, to many small companies.
The Company's sales do not represent a significant share of the industry's market for any class of its products.
The principal methods of competition for electronic products of both a military and industrial nature include, among other factors, price, product performance, the experience of the particular company and history of its dealings in such products.
In order to maintain a balanced business, we are continuing to place an emphasis on securing “build to print” opportunities, which will allow production work to go directly to the manufacturing floor, limiting the impact on our engineering staff.
This effort will keep our manufacturing team busy while engineering development designs transition to production.
Management expects revenues in fiscal year 2020 to approximate revenues during fiscal year 2019 and expects the gross profit margin to be higher in fiscal year 2020 than the gross profit margin during fiscal year 2019.
This expectation is driven primarily by orders already in our backlog that will be shipped in fiscal year 2020 with lower anticipated aggregate production costs than with the product mix shipped during fiscal 2019.
As factors such as engineering delays, competition and product costs impact gross profit margins, management will continue to evaluate our sales strategy, employment levels, and facility costs.
New orders received in the first three months of fiscal year 2020 were approximately $7.0 million as compared to $6.9 million of new orders received in the first three months of fiscal 2019.
It is presently anticipated that a minimum of $29.2 million of orders comprising the September 30, 2019 backlog will be filled during the fiscal year ending June 30, 2020.
The minimum of $29.2 million does not include any shipments, which may be made against orders subsequently received during the fiscal year ending June 30, 2020.
The estimate of the September 30, 2019 backlog to be shipped in fiscal year 2020 is subject to future events, which may cause the amount of the backlog actually shipped to differ from such estimate.
In addition to the backlog, the Company currently has outstanding opportunities representing approximately $55 million in the aggregate as of November 5, 2019 for both repeat and new programs.
However, there can be no assurance that the Company will acquire any of the anticipated orders described above, many of which are subject to allocations of the United States defense spending and factors affecting the defense industry.
A significant portion of the Company’s business is the production of military and industrial electronic equipment for use by the U.S. and foreign governments and certain industrial customers.
Net sales to three significant customers represented 56.7% of the Company’s total sales for the three-month period ended September 30, 2019.
Net sales to two significant customers represented 62.5% of the Company’s total sales for the three-month period ended September 30, 2018.
A loss of one of these customers or programs related to these customers could significantly impact the Company.
Historically, a small number of customers have accounted for a large percentage of the Company’s total sales in any given fiscal year.
Management believes our most critical accounting policies include revenue recognition and cost estimation on our contracts.
We assess each contract at its inception to determine whether it should be combined with other contracts.
When making this determination, we consider factors such as whether two or more contracts were negotiated and executed at or near the same time, or were negotiated with an overall profit objective.
We evaluate the products or services promised in each contract at inception to determine whether the contract should be accounted for as having one or more performance obligations.
We determine the transaction price for each contract based on the consideration we expect to receive for the products or services being provided under the contract.
The transaction price for each performance obligation is based on the estimated standalone selling price of the product or service underlying each performance obligation.
Transaction prices on our contracts subject to the Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR) are typically based on estimated costs plus a reasonable profit margin.
Balances for slow-moving and obsolete inventory are reviewed on a regular basis by analyzing estimated demand, inventory on hand, sales levels, market conditions, and other information and reduce inventory balances based on this analysis.
Inventoried work relating to contracts in process and work in process is valued at actual production cost, including factory overhead incurred to date.
Contract costs include material, subcontract costs, labor, and an allocation of overhead costs.
Work in process represents spare units and parts and other inventory items acquired or produced to service units previously sold or to meet anticipated future orders.
Provision for losses on contracts is made when the existence of such losses becomes probable and estimable.
The provision for losses on contracts is included in other accrued expenses on the Company’s balance sheet.
The costs attributed to units delivered under contracts are based on the estimated average cost of all units expected to be produced.
Certain contracts are expected to extend beyond twelve months.
Net sales decreased for the three months ended September 30, 2019 to $5,923,819 as compared to $8,337,399 for the same period in 2018.
The decrease in net sales is primarily due to a decrease in build to print sales.
Gross profits for the three months ended September 30, 2019 and 2018 were $1,136,348 and $992,934, respectively.
Gross profit as a percentage of sales was 19.2% and 11.9%, for the same periods, respectively.
The primary factors in determining the change in gross profit and net income are overall sales levels and product mix.
The gross profits on mature products and build to print contracts are typically higher as compared to products which are still in the engineering development stage or in early stages of production.
In the case of the latter, the Company can incur what it refers to as “loss contracts,” primarily on engineering design contracts in which the Company invests with the objective of developing future product sales.
In any given accounting period the mix of product shipments between higher margin programs and less mature programs, and expenditures associated with loss contracts, has a significant impact on gross profit and net income.
The gross profit percentage increased in the three months ended September 30, 2019 as compared to the same period in 2018 primarily due to the decrease in incurred spending related to a specific engineering design contract when compared to the same period in 2018.
Other income for the three months ended September 30, 2019 and 2018 was $47,489 and $76,070, respectively.
The decrease for the three months ended is primarily due to the reduction in investment securities offset, in part, by the gradual increase in the current yield percentages earned on the investment securities.
The Company’s effective tax rate for the three months ended September 30, 2019, was an expense of 17.9%, compared to a benefit of 3.7% for the three months ended September 30, 2018.
For the quarter ended September 30, 2018, the Company reported a benefit for income taxes resulting from a tax adjustment related to the exercise of stock options during the quarter.
Net income for the three months ended September 30, 2019, was $81,776 or $0.03 per share, basic and diluted, compared to $61,671 or $0.03 per share, basic and diluted, for the three months ended September 30, 2018.
The increase in net income in the current quarter resulted from the increase in the gross profit percentage primarily attributable to the decrease in incurred spending related to a specific engineering design contract, offset in part, by a decrease in sales.
In addition, the increase in net income in the current quarter was reduced by an increase in incurred selling, general, and administrative expenditures, lower other income and an increase in the provision for income taxes when compared to the same periods in 2018, all discussed above.
The Company's working capital as of September 30, 2019 and 2018 was approximately $28.0 million and $26.6 million, respectively.
The Company may at times be required to repurchase shares at the ESOP participants’ request at the fair market value.
During the three months ended September 30, 2019, the Company repurchased 333 shares previously held in the ESOP for $8,291.
During the three months ended September 30, 2018, the Company did not repurchase any shares held by the ESOP.
Under existing authorizations from the Company's Board of Directors, as of September 30, 2019, management is authorized to purchase an additional $823,118 of Company stock.
The Company currently believes that the cash flow generated from operations and when necessary, from cash and cash equivalents will be sufficient to meet its long-term funding requirements for the foreseeable future.
During the three months ended September 30, 2019 and 2018, the Company expended $94,070 and $611,995, respectively, for plant improvements and new equipment.
The Company has budgeted approximately $300,000 for new equipment and plant improvements in fiscal year 2020.
Management believes that the Company's reserve for bad debts of $3,000 is adequate given the customers with whom the Company does business.
