(the “Company” or “Badger Meter”) contain all adjustments (consisting only of normal recurring accruals except as otherwise discussed) necessary to present fairly the Company’s consolidated condensed financial position at June 30, 2018, results of operations for the three- and six-month periods ended June 30, 2018 and 2017, comprehensive income for the three- and six-month periods ended June 30, 2018 and 2017, and cash flows for the six-month periods ended June 30, 2018 and 2017.
During the three months ended June 30, 2018, in connection with the Company's ongoing activities to terminate the plan, lump-sum distributions to participants of the Plan exceeded the service and interest components of net periodic pension cost.
As a result, the company recorded a pre-tax settlement charge of $8.2 million during the second quarter of 2018 due for the most part to the initial transfer of pension funds to individuals who elected to rollover their accounts or transfer them to their plan.
The Company disclosed in its financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2017 that it was not required to make a minimum contribution to the defined benefit pension plan for the 2018 calendar year.
The Company made a $1.6 million payment in June 2018 related to the 2017 plan year.
The Company also disclosed in its financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2017 that it estimated it would pay $0.4 million in other postretirement benefits in 2018 based on actuarial estimates.
The Company continues to believe that its estimated payments for the full year are reasonable.
The total purchase consideration was approximately $12.0 million, which included $7.7 million in cash, a $0.3 million working capital adjustment, a balance sheet holdback of $0.7 million and settlement of $3.3 million of pre-existing Company receivables.
The working capital adjustment was settled in the second quarter of 2018 and the balance sheet holdback has been included as a payable on the Company's consolidated balance sheet.
The Company's preliminary allocation of the purchase price at June 30, 2018 included $3.8 million of receivables, $0.8 million of inventories, $0.1 million of machinery and equipment, $3.6 million of intangibles and $3.7 million of goodwill.
As of June 30, 2018, the Company had not completed its analysis for estimating the fair value of the assets acquired.
The total purchase consideration for the Carolina Meter assets was $6.2 million, which included $2.0 million in cash and settlement of $4.2 million of pre-existing Company receivables.
The Company's preliminary allocation of the purchase price at December 31, 2017 included $0.6 million of receivables, $0.3 million of inventories, $3.3 million of intangibles and $2.0 million of goodwill.
As of June 30, 2018, the Company had not completed its analysis for estimating the fair value of the assets acquired.
The Company's preliminary allocation of the purchase price included approximately $0.3 million in receivables, $0.6 million of inventories, $0.2 million in property, plant and equipment, $10.9 million of intangibles and $16.1 million of goodwill.
As of March 31, 2018, the Company completed its analysis for estimating the fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed with no additional adjustments.
The Company believes these items would be available from other sources, but that the loss of certain suppliers would result in a higher cost of materials, delivery delays, short-term increases in inventory and higher quality control costs in the short term.
For the six-months ended June 30, 2018 and 2017, the Company recognized discrete tax benefits related to a pension plan payment (2018 only) and the excess tax benefits from stock-based compensation of $0.5 million and $0.2 million, respectively.
The Company is subject to numerous other provisions of the Act that are effective for tax years starting after December 31, 2017.
The net impact of these provisions is not expected to have a material impact on the Company’s consolidated financial statements.
The Company applies the accounting standards for fair value measurements and disclosures for its financial assets and financial liabilities.
The adoption of this standard did not have an impact on the Company's consolidated financial statements.
Full retrospective application is prohibited.The Company plans to adopt the ASU beginning on the effective date of January 1, 2019.
The Company expects that upon adoption the consolidated balance sheet will increase for the recognition of right of use assets and lease liabilities for operating leases.
The Company is currently reviewing all of the available practical expedients for transition and is evaluating the impact that the adoption of this guidance will have on its financial condition, results of operations and the presentation of its consolidated financial statements.
The five steps are to identify the contract(s) with the customer, to identify the performance obligations in the contract, to determine the transaction price, to allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract and to recognize revenue when each performance obligation is satisfied.
Effective January 1, 2018, the Company adopted ASU 2014-09 using the modified retrospective method, which resulted in an immaterial impact.
On January 1, 2018, the Company adopted ASU 2014-09 using the modified retrospective method applied to those contracts that were not completed or substantially complete as of January 1, 2018.
Results for the reporting period beginning after January 1, 2018 are presented under Topic 606, while prior period amounts have not been adjusted and continue to be reported in accordance with the Company's historic accounting under Topic 605.
The Company recorded a net reduction to opening retained earnings of $0.1 million as of January 1, 2018 as a result of the cumulative impact of adopting Topic 606.
Contracts with each customer generally state the terms of the sale, including the description, quantity and price of each product or service.
Since the customer typically agrees to a stated rate and price in the contract that does not vary over the life of the contract, the majority of the Company's contracts do not contain variable consideration.
The Company establishes a provision for estimated warranty and returns as well as certain after sale costs as discussed in Note 2 "Additional Financial Information Disclosures." 
The balance of contract assets was immaterial as the Company did not have a significant amount of uninvoiced receivables in the three- and six-month periods ended June 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017.
The amount of revenue recognized in the three- and six-month periods ending June 30, 2018 that was included in the opening contract liability balance was $0.3 million and $0.6 million, respectively.
The difference between the opening and closing balances of the Company's contract liabilities was the result of a timing difference between the Company's performance and the customers' prepayments.
A performance obligation is a promise in a contract to transfer a distinct good or service to the customer, and is the unit of measurement in Topic 606.
At contract inception, the Company assesses the products and services promised in its contracts with customers.
The Company then identifies performance obligations to transfer distinct products or services to the customer.
In order to identify performance obligations, the Company considers all of the products or services promised in the contract regardless of whether they are explicitly stated or are implied by customary business practices.
The Company's performance obligations are satisfied at a point in time or over time as work progresses.
Revenue from products and services transferred to customers at a single point in time accounted for 97.3% and 97.4% of net sales for the three- and six-month periods ended June 30, 2018, respectively.
The majority of the Company's revenue recognized at a point in time is for the sale of municipal and flow instrumentation products.
Revenue from these contracts is recognized when the customer is able to direct the use of and obtain substantially all of the benefits from the product which generally coincides with title transfer during the shipping process.
Revenue from services transferred to customers over time accounted for 2.7% and 2.6% of sales of net sales for the three- and six-month periods ended June 30, 2018, respectively.
The majority of the Company's revenue that is recognized over time relates to the BEACON AMA software as a service.
As of June 30, 2018, the Company had entered into contracts where there were unsatisfied performance obligations.
For contracts recorded as long-term liabilities, $10.8 million was the aggregate amount of the transaction price allocated to performance obligations that were unsatisfied or partially unsatisfied as of the end of the reporting period.
The Company estimates that revenue recognized from satisfying those performance obligations will be approximately $1.2 million for the remainder of 2018, $2.5 million in each year from 2019 through 2021 and $2.1 million in 2022.
The Company records revenue for BEACON AMA services over time as the customer benefits from the data that is provided through the Company's software.
Control of an asset is therefore transferred to the customer over time, and the Company will recognize revenue for Beacon AMA services as service units are used by the customer.
The Company also has contracts that include both the sale and installation of flow meters as performance obligations.
In those cases, the Company records revenue for installed flow meters at the point in time when the flow meters have been accepted by the customer.
Therefore, for both the flow meter and the related installation, the Company has concluded that control is transferred to the customer upon customer acceptance of the installed flow meters.
The types and composition of the Company's revenue streams did not materially change during the three- and six-month periods ended June 30, 2018 from year end 2017.
For contracts with multiple performance obligations, the Company allocates the contract's transaction price to each performance obligation using the best estimate of the standalone selling price of each distinct good or service in a contract.

Municipal water, the largest category by sales volume, includes mechanical and ultrasonic (electronic) water meters and related technologies and services used by municipal water utilities as the basis for generating water and wastewater revenues.
The key market for the Company’s municipal water meter products is North America, primarily the United States, because most of the Company's meters are designed and manufactured to conform to standards promulgated by the American Water Works Association.
The majority of water meters sold by the Company continue to be mechanical in nature.
In recent years, the Company has made inroads in selling ultrasonic water meters.
The development of smaller diameter ultrasonic water meters combined with advanced radio technology now provides the Company with the opportunity to sell into other geographical markets, for example Europe, the Middle East and South America.
In the municipal water category, sales of water meters and related technologies and services are also commonly referred to as residential or commercial water meter sales, the latter referring to larger sizes of water meters.
The Company’s BEACON AMA Managed Solution is the latest in metering technology.
Water meter replacement and the adoption and deployment of new technology comprise the majority of water meter product sales, including radio products.
This conversion rate is accelerating and contributes to an increased water meter and radio solutions base of business.
The Company estimates that approximately 55% to 60% of water meters installed in the United States have been converted to a radio solutions technology.
The Company’s strategy is to fulfill customers’ metering expectations and requirements with its proprietary meter reading systems or other systems available through its alliance partners in the marketplace.
Flow instrumentation products serve flow measurement and control applications across a broad industrial spectrum, occasionally leveraging the same technologies used in the municipal water category.
The Company’s specific flow measurement and control applications and technologies serve the flow measurement market through both customized and standard flow instrumentation solutions.
An industry leader in both mechanical and electrical flow metering technologies, the Company offers one of the broadest flow measurement, control and communication portfolios in the market.
Customers rely on the Company for application-specific solutions that deliver accurate, timely and dependable flow data and control essential for product quality, cost control, safer operations, regulatory compliance, and more sustainable operations.
Although the Company does not sell products for electric market applications, the trend toward AMI affects the markets in which the Company does participate, particularly for those customers in the water utility market that are interested in more frequent and diverse data collection.
Specifically, AMI and AMA technologies enable water utilities to capture readings from each meter at more frequent and variable intervals.
On April 2, 2018, the Company acquired 100% of the outstanding stock of Innovative Metering Solutions, Inc.
The total purchase consideration was approximately $12.0 million, which included $7.7 million in cash, a $0.3 million working capital adjustment, a balance sheet holdback of $0.7 million and settlement of $3.3 million of pre-existing Company receivables.
The working capital adjustment was settled in the second quarter of 2018 and the balance sheet holdback has been included as a payable on the Company's consolidated balance sheet.
The Company's preliminary allocation of the purchase price at June 30, 2018 included $3.8 million of receivables, $0.8 million of inventories, $0.1 million of machinery and equipment, $3.6 million of intangibles and $3.7 million of goodwill.

The Company also assumed $4.9 million of liabilities as part of the acquisition.
In 2011, the Company introduced AMA as a hardware and software solution for water and gas utilities, and then in early 2014 launched its new BEACON AMA system, as a managed solution, which it believes will help maintain the Company's position as a market leader.
Since its inception, sales of BEACON AMA have continued to grow with large cities and private water utilities selecting BEACON AMA and the Company’s industry-leading water meters.
The Company also supports its product and technology sales with the sale of extended service programs that provide additional services beyond the standard warranty.
In recent years, the Company has sold ORION radio technology to natural gas utilities for installation on their gas meters.
The Company’s net sales for the three months ended June 30, 2018 increased $9.4 million, or 9.0%, to $113.6 million compared to $104.2 million during the same period in 2017.
The increase was due to higher prices and increased domestic volumes sold of newer technologies in meters and related radios as well as higher service revenue.
Flow instrumentation products represented 22.5% of sales for the three months ended June 30, 2018 compared to 23.2% during the same period in 2017.
These sales increased $1.5 million, or 6.2%, to $25.6 million from $24.1 million in the same period last year.
These sales increased $10.2 million, or 6.4%, to $168.5 million from $158.3 million in 2017 and were driven by higher prices and increased domestic volumes sold of newer technologies in meters and related radios as well as higher service revenue.
These sales increased $2.7 million, or 5.7%, to $50.2 million for the first six months in 2018 compared to $47.5 million in the same period last year due to higher sales into the oil and gas market as well as other targeted markets.
Selling, engineering and administration expenses for the six months ended June 30, 2018 increased $2.6 million, or 5.3%, to $51.9 million from $49.3 million in the same period in 2017.
Receivables increased from $58.2 million at December 31, 2017 to $65.3 million at June 30, 2018.
Generally, receivable balances are lower at year-end than at other times of the year due to seasonality in the Company’s business.
Intangible assets decreased to $59.1 million at June 30, 2018 from $59.3 million at December 31, 2017 due to normal amortization expense, offset by an increase of $3.7 million related to the acquisition of IMS.
The acquisition was also the main reason for the increase in goodwill from $67.4 million on December 31, 2017 to $71.1 million on June 30, 2018.
Accrued compensation and employee benefits decreased to $9.6 million at June 30, 2018 from $15.5 million at December 31, 2017 due to payments made in the first two quarters of 2018 related to 2017 earned employee incentives, offset somewhat by provisions made for 2018 employee incentives earned to date.
The overall increase in total shareholders’ equity from $277.5 million at December 31, 2017 to $288.5 million at June 30, 2018 was the net effect of net earnings and stock options exercised, offset by dividends paid and repurchased stock.
In June 2018, the Company amended its May 2012 credit agreement with its primary lender to extend until September 2021 the $125.0 million line of credit that supports commercial paper (up to $70.0 million) and includes $5.0 million of a Euro line of credit.
The Company believes that its operating cash flows, available borrowing capacity, and its ability to raise capital provide adequate resources to fund ongoing operating requirements, future capital expenditures and the development of new products.
The Company had $90.7 million of unused credit lines available at June 30, 2018.
