We remain focused on executing our strategy for growth while streamlining the organization and emphasizing continuous improvement in quality, delivery, cost and innovation as we drive the One Allied approach and expand our value proposition for our customers.
Solid strides continue to be made with our multi-product, fully integrated solutions that are leading to increased business.
Also, we continue to build a pipeline of exciting market-based application opportunities.
Sales cycles 
are long and the time from being selected for the solution development to full rate production can be longer, yet we believe we are building a scalable foundation which can deliver strong returns on those investments.
Sales to U.S. customers were 53% of total sales for the quarter compared with 54% for the same period last year, with the balance of sales to customers primarily in Europe, Canada and Asia.
The overall increase in revenue was due to an 18% volume increase and a 7% favorable currency impact.
EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are provided for information purposes only and are not measures of financial performance under GAAP.
The Company believes EBITDA is often a useful measure of a Companys operating performance and is a significant basis used by the Companys management to measure the operating performance of the Companys business because EBITDA excludes charges for depreciation, amortization and interest expense that have resulted from our debt financings, as well as our provision for income tax expense.
EBITDA is frequently used as one of the bases for comparing businesses in the Companys industry.
The Company also believes that Adjusted EBITDA provides helpful information about the operating performance of its business.
Adjusted EBITDA excludes stock compensation expense, as well as certain income or expenses which are not indicative of the ongoing performance of the Company.
EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA do not represent and should not be considered as an alternative to net income, operating income, net cash provided by operating activities or any other measure for determining operating performance or liquidity that is calculated in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.
The decrease in operating cash flows during the first quarter of 2018 compared to 2017 is due to increased working capital needs, related to both the acquisition of the Mavel OE Steering business, and organic growth.

Also during the first quarter of 2018, purchases of property and equipment were $2,222 compared to $1,288 for the first quarter of 2017.
Capital expenditures are expected to increase throughout 2018 to support our new contract wins along with our continued IT infrastructure enhancements.
The change in cash used in financing activities reflects the 2018 use of the revolver to partially finance the acquisition of the Mavel OE Steering business.
Also, during the first quarter of 2018, we made payments of $4,350 for our Revolving Facility, including $1,850 to completely pay off our foreign revolver.
At March 31, 2018, we had $63,462 of obligations under the Revolving Facility.
The Credit Agreement contains certain financial covenants related to minimum interest coverage and total leverage ratio at the end of each quarter.
The Credit Agreement also includes other covenants and restrictions, including limits on the amount 
of additional indebtedness, and restrictions on the ability to merge, consolidate or sell all or substantially all of our assets.
We were in compliance with all covenants at March 31, 2018.
There were no additional borrowings for the China Facility balance for the first quarter of 2018 from December 31, 2017.

Qualitative and Quantitative Disclosures about Market Risk 
We translate all assets and liabilities of our foreign operations, where the U.S. dollar is not the functional currency, at the period-end exchange rate and translate sales and expenses at the average exchange rates in effect during the period.
The net effect of these translation adjustments is recorded in the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements as Comprehensive Income.
The translation adjustment was a gain of approximately $600 and $700 for the first quarter of 2018 and 2017, respectively.
Translation adjustments are not adjusted for income taxes as they relate to permanent investments in our foreign subsidiaries.
Net foreign currency transaction gains and losses included in other income, net amounted to a loss of $138 and $70 for the first quarter of 2018 and 2017, respectively.
A hypothetical 10% change in the value of the U.S. dollar in relation to our most significant foreign currency net assets would have had an impact of approximately $6,300 on our foreign net assets as of March 31, 2018.

Our management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer (principal accounting officer), evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act)) as of March 31, 2018.
Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.
Management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives and management necessarily applies its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures.
Based on managements evaluation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of March 31, 2018, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that, as of such date, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective.
The Company implemented a financial reporting system, Hyperion Financial Management (HFM), as part of a multi-year plan to integrate and upgrade our systems and processes.
The implementation occurred in phases throughout 2017 and was substantially completed in the fourth quarter of 2017.
The Company utilized and relied on HFM during the first quarter of 2018.
As a result of the HFM implementation, certain changes to our processes and procedures have and will continue to occur.
These changes will result in changes to our internal control over financial reporting.
While HFM is designed to strengthen our internal financial controls by automating certain manual processes and standardizing business processes and reporting across our organization, management will continue to evaluate and monitor our internal controls as each of the affected areas evolve.
