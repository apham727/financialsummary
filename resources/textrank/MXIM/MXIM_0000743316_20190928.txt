The Company also elected an accounting policy in which it will not apply the recognition requirements to leases with an initial term of 12 months or less.
Effective June 30, 2019, the first day of adoption, the Company recognized $61.0 million of operating lease right-of-use assets and $65.2 million of operating lease liabilities on its Consolidated Balance Sheet.
Lease right-of-use (ROU) assets are recorded as other assets, short-term lease obligations are recorded as accrued expenses and long-term lease obligations are recorded as other liabilities on the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheet.
