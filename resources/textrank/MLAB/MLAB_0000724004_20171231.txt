Our Sterilization and Disinfection Control Division (formerly named the Biological Indicators Division) provides testing services, along with the manufacturing and marketing of both biological and cleaning indicators, and the marketing of chemical indicators used to assess the effectiveness of sterilization and disinfection processes in the hospital, dental, medical device and pharmaceutical industries.
In  May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued Accounting Standards Update ("ASU") 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606), which will replace most existing revenue recognition guidance in U.S. GAAP and is intended to improve and converge with international standards the financial reporting requirements for revenue from contracts with customers.
ASU 2014-09 also requires additional disclosures about the nature, timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from customer contracts, including significant judgments and changes in judgments.
We plan to adopt ASU 2014-09 and its amendments on a modified retrospective basis and are continuing to assess all future impacts of the guidance by reviewing our current contracts with customers to identify potential differences that could result from applying the new guidance.
As we continue our assessment, we are also identifying and preparing to implement minor changes to our accounting policies and practices, business processes, systems and controls to support the new revenue recognition and disclosure requirements.
During the nine months ended  December 31, 2017, revenues in our Cold Chain Packaging reporting segment decreased significantly as compared to the same period in the prior year primarily due to a significant decrease in revenues from our largest customer and the loss of the business of one of our larger customers.
During the three months ended  December 31, 2017 we completed a detailed review of the cold chain packaging business and concluded that long and difficult sales-cycles associated with this product set, when coupled with higher than previously contemplated costs for operating and expanding the necessary infrastructure to support revenues growth have resulted in a forecast of lower than expected revenues, gross margin percentages and overall profitability as compared to our original model for this business.
Based on these facts, we concluded that we had a triggering event requiring assessment of impairment for certain of our long-lived assets associated with the Cold Chain Packaging reporting segment.
As a result, we reviewed the long-lived assets associated with this reporting segment and recorded a $13,819,000 impairment charge related to goodwill, which is included in impairment loss on goodwill on the accompanying condensed consolidated statements of operations for the three and nine months ended  December 31, 2017.
In  July 2017, we completed the move from the Omaha facility and subsequently sold that building for $1,116,000 (net of commission costs) which resulted in a gain of $116,000 which is included in other expense, net in the accompanying condensed consolidated statements of operations for the nine months ended  December 31, 2017.
The assets associated with this facility are presented on the accompanying condensed consolidated balance sheets as of  December 31, 2017 as assets held for sale.
The Term Loan requires 20 quarterly principal payments (the first due date was  March 31, 2017) in the amount of $250,000 (increasing by $125,000 each year up to $750,000 in the fifth year).
The Credit Facility is secured by all of our assets and requires us to maintain a ratio of funded debt to our trailing four quarters of EBIDTA (the “Leverage Ratio”), as defined in the agreement, of less than 3.0 to 1.0, provided that, we  may once during the term of the Credit Facility, in connection with a Permitted Acquisition for which the aggregate consideration paid or to be paid in respect thereof equals or exceeds $20,000,000, elect to increase the maximum Leverage Ratio permitted hereunder to (i) 3.50 to 1.00 for a period of four consecutive fiscal quarters commencing with the fiscal quarter in which such Permitted Acquisition occurs (the “Initial Holiday Period”) and (ii) 3.25 to 1.00 for the period of four consecutive fiscal quarters immediately following the Initial Holiday Period.
The risk-free interest rate is based on the United States Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant for the estimated life of the stock option.
The total intrinsic value of stock options exercised was $4,243,000 and $4,701,000 for the nine months ended  December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively.
As of  December 31, 2017, we have issued 8,400 shares of restricted stock, with vesting periods ranging from five to seven years.
For both the three and nine months ended  December 31, 2017, 501,000 outstanding stock options were excluded from the calculation of diluted net (loss) income per share because their inclusion would have been anti-dilutive.
For the three and nine months ended  December 31, 2016, 3,000 and 110,000 outstanding stock options, respectively, were excluded from the calculation of diluted net (loss) income per share because their inclusion would have been anti-dilutive.
Under the terms of the PCD Agreement, we were required to pay contingent consideration if the cumulative revenues for our process challenge device business for the three years subsequent to the acquisition met certain levels.
We paid $150,000 of the contingent consideration during the year ended  March 31, 2016 (based upon the then current run rate projected over the entire three-year contingent consideration period).
Since the initial payment, the revenues for these products significantly increased and as a result, during the year ended  March 31, 2017 we recorded an additional $450,000 accrual (which was paid in our third quarter ending  December 31, 2016).
During the three months ended  June 30, 2017 revenues continued to increase and after revising our forecast for the process challenge device (“PCD”) product revenues through the end of the earn-out period, we recorded an additional $300,000 accrual, which is included in other income, net in the accompanying condensed consolidated statement of operations for the nine months ended  December 31, 2017.
Our effective income tax rate was (5.3) percent and 16.2 percent for the three months ended  December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively, and (18.0) percent and 18.6 percent for the nine months ended  December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively.
The effective tax rate for the three and nine months ended  December 31, 2017 differed from the statutory federal rate of 30.9 percent primarily due to the impact of the impairment of non-deductible goodwill, the TCJA, share-based payment awards for employees (which was significant for the nine months ended  December 31, 2017), state income taxes, domestic manufacturing deductions and foreign rate differential.
In  January 2018, our Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.16 per share of common stock, payable on  March 15, 2018, to shareholders of record at the close of business on  February 28, 2018.
Any of the attacks, breaches or other disruptions or damage described above could interrupt our operations, delay production and shipments, result in theft of our and our customers’ intellectual property and trade secrets, damage customer and business partner relationships and our reputation or result in defective products or services, legal claims and proceedings, liability and penalties under privacy laws and increased costs for security and remediation, each of which could adversely affect our business and consolidated financial statements.
Any problems caused by these third parties, including those resulting from breakdowns or other disruptions in communication services provided by a vendor, failure of a vendor to handle current or higher volumes or cyber-attacks and security breaches at a vendor could adversely affect our ability to deliver products and services to our customers and otherwise conduct our business.

During the year ending March 31, 2018, we continue to build our infrastructure to prepare for future growth, including the relocation of our Omaha, Traverse City and old Bozeman manufacturing facilities into the new Bozeman building, the addition of key personnel to our operations, sales and marketing, and research and development teams and the rollout of phase three of our ERP implementation project (European operations).
Overall revenues declined one percent, while organic revenues declined four percent, for the three months ended December 31, 2017, resulting from organic decreases of nine and 36 percent from the Instruments and Cold Chain Packaging Divisions, respectively, partially offset by increases of seven and three percent for the Sterilization and Disinfection Control and Cold Chain Monitoring Divisions, respectively.
Overall revenues were flat, while organic revenues declined two percent, for the nine months ended December 31, 2017 resulting from organic decreases of four, four and 36 percent from the Instruments, Cold Chain Monitoring and Cold Chain Packaging Divisions, respectively, partially offset by an increase of nine percent for the Sterilization and Disinfection Control Division.
During the three months ended June 30, 2017, we elected to discontinue for sale certain products in our Instruments, Cold Chain Monitoring and Sterilization and Disinfection Control Divisions due to the recent introduction of new or modified products and the consolidation of other product sets.
During both the three months ended September 30, 2017 and December 31, 2017, we subjected additional inventories to our liquidation program due to the discontinuance or winding-down of additional older product sets resulting from the release of our new ViewPoint operating platform.
Company-wide gross margin percentage for the three and nine months ended December 31, 2017 was 54 and 56 percent, respectively but would have been 61 and 59 percent, respectively without the impact of these additional inventory reserves.
During the nine months ended December 31, 2017, revenues in our Cold Chain Packaging Division decreased significantly as compared to the same period in the prior year primarily due to a significant decrease in revenues from our largest customer and the loss of the business of one of our larger customers.

Sterilization and Disinfection Control revenues for the three and nine months ended December 31, 2017 increased primarily due to the 2018 Acquisitions and organic growth of seven and nine percent, respectively which was achieved through existing customers, expansion into new markets, price increases and the continued strengthening of the Euro.
Instruments revenues for the three and nine months ended December 31, 2017 decreased due to organic decreases of nine and four percent, respectively.
The decrease for both the three and nine months ended December 31, 2017 was primarily due to the slower than expected adoption of an updated medical product.
Cold Chain Monitoring revenues for the three months ended December 31, 2017 increased primarily due to organic growth of three percent and the FreshLoc Acquisition.
Cold Chain Monitoring revenues for the nine months ended December 31, 2017 increased primarily due to the FreshLoc Acquisition, partially offset by organic decreases of four percent.
Sterilization and Disinfection Control gross profit margin percentage increased for the three and nine months ended December 31, 2017 primarily due to volume based efficiencies associated with increased revenues and the impact of using internally manufactured biological indicators for our dental sterilizer testing business as opposed to the prior year where we were contractually committed to purchase a significant portion of those biological indicators from an outside supplier at a significantly higher price.
Selling expense for the three and nine months ended December 31, 2017 decreased primarily due to reductions of selling personnel, trade show activities and outside commissions.
As a percentage of revenues, selling expense was eight and 10 percent for the three and nine months ended December 31, 2017, respectively as compared to 10 and 11 percent for the three and nine months ended December 31, 2016.
General and administrative expenses for the three months ended December 31, 2017 increased primarily due to acquisition related and amortization expenses, partially offset by a decrease in personnel expenses.
General and administrative expenses for the nine months ended December 31, 2017 increased primarily due to increased personnel, employee moving, acquisition related and amortization expenses, partially offset by decreases in professional services expenses.
Research and development expenses for the three and nine months ended December 31, 2017 decreased due to a streamlining of the necessary engineers and materials and supplies required to support existing businesses during the three and nine months ended December 31, 2017.
Impairment loss on goodwill for the three and nine months ended December 31, 2017 is associated with our Packaging Division.
Other expense for the three months ended December 31, 2017 is comprised primarily of interest expense associated with our Credit Facility.
Other expense for the nine months ended December 31, 2017 is comprised primarily of interest expense associated with our Credit Facility and $300,000 related to an additional accrual for the PCD earn-out (see Liquidity and Capital Resources for additional discussion), partially offset by a $116,000 gain from the sale of our Omaha facility.
Net income for the nine months ended December 31, 2017 was also significantly impacted by a $13,819,000 impairment loss on goodwill  (see General Trends and Outlook above for additional discussion), $772,000 of facility relocation costs (see Liquidity and Capital Resources), $300,000 in PCD earn-out accruals, $256,000 of employee moving expenses not related to the Bozeman facility relocation and a $2,106,000 expense related to a reserve for inventory due to operational decisions to end of life certain products and other slow moving inventory.
Otherwise, net income for the nine months ended December 31, 2017 varied with the changes in revenues, gross profit and operating expenses (which includes $5,062,000 of non-cash amortization of intangible assets).
We estimate that the total costs of the relocation will be $2,100,000 (which is comprised primarily of facility moving expenses, retention bonuses for existing personnel and payroll costs for duplicative personnel during the transition period) of which $725,000 was incurred during the year ended March 31, 2017 and $772,000 was incurred during the nine months ended December 31, 2017, which is reflected in cost of revenues in the accompanying condensed consolidated statements of operations (other than $269,000 which is included in general and administrative).
Net cash provided by operating activities for the nine months ended December 31, 2017 increased primarily due to a $1,414,000 decrease of inventories (net of the impact of increases in the reserve for inventory) and, in the previous period, the payment of $5,076,000 of contingent consideration and an increase of $4,401,000 in accrued liabilities and taxes payable, partially offset by an increase in prepaid expenses and other.
Net cash used in investing activities for the nine months ended December 31, 2017 resulted from $15,433,000 associated with the 2018 Acquisitions and the purchase of $2,540,000 of property, plant and equipment, partially offset by $1,133,000 of proceeds associated with the sale of the Omaha facility.
Net cash used in investing activities for the nine months ended December 31, 2016 resulted from $6,618,000 associated with the 2017 Acquisitions and the purchase of $9,367,000 of property, plant and equipment.
Net cash provided by financing activities for the nine months ended December 31, 2017 resulted from borrowings under our Credit Facility of $11,000,000 and proceeds from the exercise of stock options of $2,346,000, partially offset by the repayment of debt of $9,750,000 and the payment of dividends of $1,807,000.
