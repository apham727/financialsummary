The Company adopted ASC 842 on May 1, 2019, using the modified retrospective method and utilized the optional transition method under which the Company continues to apply the legacy guidance in ASC 840, Leases, including its disclosure requirements, in the comparative period presented.
Subscription fees include SaaS revenues for the right to use the software for a limited period of time in an environment hosted by the Company or by a third party.
The underlying arrangements typically include a single fee for the service that is billed monthly, quarterly or annually.
The Company’s SaaS solutions represent a series of distinct services that are substantially the same and have the same pattern of transfer to the customer.
Services are typically optional to our customers, and are distinct from our software.
Fees for our services are separately priced and are generally billed on an hourly basis, and revenue is recognized over time as the services are performed.
The total amount of expense reimbursement included in professional services and other revenue was approximately $0.5 million 
Revenue is derived from maintenance under which we provide customers with telephone consulting, product updates on a when and if available basis, and releases of new versions of products previously purchased by the customer, as well as error reporting and correction services.
Revenue related to maintenance is generally paid in advance and recognized ratably over the term of the agreement since the Company is standing ready to provide a series of maintenance services that are substantially the same each period over the term; therefore, time is the best measure of progress.
Judgment is required to determine whether each product and service is considered to be a distinct performance obligation that should be accounted for separately under the contract.
We estimate SSP primarily based on the prices charged to customers for products or services sold on a standalone basis, or by using information such as market conditions and other observable inputs.
Therefore, we estimate SSP for software licenses using the residual approach, determined based on total transaction price less the SSP of other products and services promised in the contract.
When performing relative selling price allocations, we use the contract price as the estimate of SSP if it falls within the Company’s range estimate of SSP, since any point within the range would be a valid price point on a standalone basis.
Timing of invoicing to customers may differ from timing of revenue recognition and these timing differences result in receivables, contract assets (unbilled accounts receivable), or contract liabilities (deferred revenue) on the Company’s Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets.
Deferred revenue consists of amounts collected prior to having completed the performance of maintenance, SaaS, hosting, and managed services.
During the three months ended October 31, 2019, we recognized $14 million of revenue that was included in the deferred revenue balance as of July 31, 2019.
During the six months ended October 31, 2019, we recognized $23 million of revenue that was included in the deferred revenue balance as of April 30, 2019.
A performance obligation is a promise in a contract to transfer a distinct good or service to the customer and is the unit of account under Topic 606.
The transaction price is allocated to each distinct performance obligation and recognized as revenue when, or as, the performance obligation is satisfied by transferring the promised good or service to the customer.
As of October 31, 2019, the aggregate amount of the transaction price allocated to remaining performance obligations was approximately $76 million.
The Company expects to recognize revenue on approximately two-thirds of the remaining performance obligations over the next 12 months, with the remainder recognized thereafter.
The current and non-current portions of deferred commissions are included in prepaid expenses and deferred sales commissions—noncurrent, respectively, in the Company’s Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets.
Amortization of sales commissions was $0.4 million and $0.7 million for the three and six months ended October 31, 2019, respectively, which is included in sales and marketing expense in the accompanying Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations.
While each of the leases includes renewal options, the Company has only included the base lease term in its calculation of lease assets and liabilities.
The impact of the Company's leases on Condensed Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows is presented in the operating activities section, which mainly consisted of cash paid for operating lease liabilities of approximately $0.5 million and the amortization of the right of use assets and operating lease obligations of $10,000 during the six months ended October 31, 2019.
On August 21, 2019, our Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.11 per share of our Class A and Class B common stock.
This allocation is based on management’s judgment after considering the dividend rights of the two-classes of common stock, the control of the Class B shareholders and the convertibility rights of the Class B shares to Class A shares.
For the three and six months ended October 31, 2019, we excluded options to purchase 12,174 and 330,620 Class A Common Shares, respectively, and for the three and six months ended October 31, 2018, we excluded options to purchase 12,000 and 6,065 Class A Common Shares, respectively, from the computation of diluted earnings per Class A Common Shares.
We excluded these option share amounts because the exercise prices of those options were greater than the average market price of the Class A Common Shares during the applicable period.
During the six months ended October 31, 2019 and 2018, we granted options for 1,063,000 and 1,189,000 shares of Class A common stock, respectively.

We recorded stock option compensation cost of approximately $0.9 million and $0.8 million and income tax benefits of approximately $0.5 million and $0.3 million from option exercises during the six months ended October 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively.
During the six months ended October 31, 2019 and 2018, we issued 650,943 and 343,713 shares of Class A common stock, respectively, resulting from the exercise of stock options.
The total intrinsic value of options exercised during the six months ended October 31, 2019 and 2018 based on market value at the exercise dates was approximately $3.2 million and $1.9 million, respectively.
As of October 31, 2019, unrecognized compensation cost related to unvested stock option awards approximated $7.0 million, which we expect to recognize over a weighted average period of 2.03 years.
No single customer accounted for more than 10% of total revenues for the three and six months ended October 31, 2019 and 2018.
On November 12, 2019, our Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.11 per share of our Class A and Class B common stock.
