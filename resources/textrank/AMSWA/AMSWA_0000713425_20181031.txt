Diluted earnings per share for Class B shares under the two-class method are $0.04 and $0.08 for the three months ended October 31, 2018 and 2017, and $0.09 and $0.17 for the six months ended October 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively.
The Companys total revenue impact is $1.2 million, with approximately 70% impacting the fiscal year ending April 30, 2019, which is the result of recognizing revenue for the license component of its term licenses and certain perpetual license contracts that were previously recognized over time due to the lack of vendor-specific objective evidence (VSOE) of fair value at the point-in-time at which control of the software license is transferred to the customer, rather than ratably over the term of the contract.
Subscription fees include SaaS revenues for the right to use the software for a limited period of time in an environment hosted by the Company or by a third party.
Fees for our services are separately priced and are generally billed on an hourly basis, and revenue is recognized over time as the services are performed.
The total amount of expense reimbursement included in professional services and other revenue was approximately $388,000 and $719,000 for the three and six months ended October 31, 2018, respectively, and approximately $421,000 and $947,000 for the three and six months ended October 31, 2017, respectively.
Revenue is derived from maintenance under which we provide customers with telephone consulting, product updates on a when and if available basis, and releases of new versions of products previously purchased by the customer, as well as error reporting and correction services.
Revenue related to maintenance is generally paid in advance and recognized ratably over the term of the agreement since the Company is standing ready to provide a series of maintenance services that are substantially the same each period over the term; therefore, time is the best measure of progress.
Judgment is required to determine whether each product and service is considered to be a distinct performance obligation that should be accounted for separately under the contract.
We estimate SSP primarily based on the prices charged to customers for products or services sold on a standalone basis, or by using information such as market conditions and other observable inputs.
Therefore, we estimate SSP for software licenses using the residual approach, determined based on total transaction price less the SSP of other products and services promised in the contract.
Deferred revenue consists of amounts collected prior to having completed the performance of maintenance, SaaS, hosting, and managed services.
During the six months ended October 31, 2018, we recognized $13 million of revenue that was included in the deferred revenue balance as of April 30, 2018, as adjusted for Topic 606, at the beginning of the period.
A performance obligation is a promise in a contract to transfer a distinct good or service to the customer and is the unit of account under Topic 606.
The transaction price is allocated to each distinct performance obligation and recognized as revenue when, or as, the performance obligation is satisfied by transferring the promised good or service to the customer.
Remaining performance obligations represent the transaction price of orders for which products have not been delivered or services have not been performed.
As of October 31, 2018, the aggregate amount of the transaction price allocated to remaining performance obligations was approximately $54 million.
The Company expects to recognize revenue on approximately three-quarters of the remaining performance obligations over the next 12 months, with the remainder recognized thereafter.
-The Company does not evaluate a contract for a significant financing component if payment is expected within one year or less from the transfer of the promised items to the customer.
-The Company does not disclose the value of unsatisfied performance obligations for contracts for which the Company recognizes revenue at the amount to which it has the right to invoice for services performed (apply to time-and-material engagements).
Amortization of sales commissions was $0.4 million for the three months ended October 31, 2018 and $0.6 million for the six months ended October 31, 2018, which is included in sales and marketing expense in the accompanying condensed consolidated statements of operations.
In addition, this method assumes the dilutive effect if Class A stock options are converted to Class A Common Shares and the undistributed earnings are allocated evenly to both Class A and B Common Shares including Class A Common Shares issued pursuant to those converted stock options.
This allocation is based on managements judgment after considering the dividend rights of the two classes of common stock, the control of the Class B shareholders and the convertibility rights of the Class B Common Shares into Class A Common Shares.
For the three and six months ended October 31, 2018, we excluded options to purchase 12,000 and 6,065 Class A Common Shares, respectively, and for the three and six months ended October 31, 2017, we excluded options to purchase 1,184,124 and 1,105,521 Class A Common Shares, respectively, from the computation of diluted earnings per Class A Common Shares.
We excluded these option share amounts because the exercise prices of those options were greater than the average market price of the Class A Common Shares during the applicable period.
During the six months ended October 31, 2018 and 2017, we granted options for 1,189,000 and 884,000 shares of Class A common stock, respectively.
We recorded stock option compensation cost of approximately $443,000 and $477,000 and income tax excess benefits of approximately $12,000 and shortfall of $47,000 from option exercises during the three months ended October 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively.
We recorded stock option compensation cost of approximately $841,000 and $793,000, and income tax excess benefits of approximately $286,000 and $80,000 from option exercises during the six months ended October 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively.
During the six months ended October 31, 2018 and 2017, we issued 343,000 and 482,000 shares of Class A common stock, respectively, resulting from the exercise of stock options.
The total intrinsic value of options exercised during the six months ended October 31, 2018 and 2017 based on market value at the exercise dates was approximately $1.9 million and $1.3 million, respectively.
As of October 31, 2018, unrecognized compensation cost related to unvested stock option awards approximated $5.4 million, which we expect to recognize over a weighted average period of 2.04 years.
