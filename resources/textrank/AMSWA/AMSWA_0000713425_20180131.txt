Diluted earnings per share for Class B shares under the two-class method are $0.18 and $0.08 for the three months ended January 31, 2018 and 2017, and $0.35 and $0.15 for the nine months ended January 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively.
Revenue derived from maintenance contracts primarily includes telephone consulting, product updates, and releases of new versions of products previously purchased by the customer, as well as error reporting and correction services.
In accordance with the other presentation matters within the Revenue Recognition Topic of the FASBs Accounting Standards Codification, we recognize amounts received for reimbursement of travel and other out-of-pocket expenses incurred as revenue in the condensed consolidated statements of operations under services and other.
Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) revenues include fees for the right to use the software for a limited period of time in a hosted environment by the Company or by a third party and the customer accesses and uses the software on an as-needed basis over the Internet or via a dedicated line; however, the customer has no ability to take delivery of the software.
Deferred revenue represents advance payments or billings for software licenses, services, and maintenance billed in advance of the time revenue is recognized.
The unbilled receivable balance consists of amounts generated from license fee and services revenues.
At January 31, 2018 and April 30, 2017, unbilled license fees were approximately $384,000 and $1.0 million, respectively, and unbilled services revenues were approximately $2.3 million and $1.8 million, respectively.
Unbilled license fee accounts receivable represents revenue that has been recognized, but under the terms of the license agreement, which include specified payment terms that are considered normal and customary, certain payments have not yet been invoiced to the customers.
Unbilled services revenues primarily occur due to the timing of the respective billings, which occur subsequent to the end of each reporting period.
On November 15, 2017, our Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.11 per share of our Class A and Class B Common Stock.
The calculation of diluted earnings per share is similar to the calculation of basic earnings per share, except that the calculation includes the dilutive effect of the assumed exercise of options issuable under our stock incentive plans.
For our diluted earnings per share calculation for Class B Common Shares, we use the two-class method.
In addition, this method assumes the dilutive effect if Class A stock options were converted to Class A Common Shares and the undistributed earnings are allocated evenly to both Class A and B Common Shares including Class A Common Shares issued pursuant to those converted stock options.
This allocation is based on managements judgment after considering the dividend rights of the two classes of common stock, the control of the Class B shareholders and the convertibility rights of the Class B Common Shares into Class A Common Shares.
For the three and nine months ended January 31, 2018, we excluded options to purchase 12,130 and 57,598 Class A Common Shares, respectively, and for the three and nine months ended January 31, 2017, we excluded options to purchase 374,439 and 337,500 Class A Common Shares, respectively, from the computation of diluted earnings per Class A Common Shares.
We excluded these option share amounts because the exercise prices of those options were greater than the average market price of the Class A Common Shares during the applicable period.
We account for business combinations using the acquisition method of accounting and accordingly, the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed are recorded based upon managements estimates of current fair values as of the acquisition date.
The results of operations of acquired businesses are included in the condensed consolidated financial statements from the acquisition date.
Under the terms of the Purchase Agreement, the Company acquired the assets of Halo for cash consideration paid of approximately $9.25 million, which represents a purchase price of approximately $9.95 million net of a $700,000 negative working capital adjustment, subject to certain post-closing adjustments, which included an additional negative working capital adjustment of $113,000 (recorded as a receivable), thus resulting in an adjusted purchase price consideration of $9.14 million.
The Company incurred acquisition costs of approximately $73,000 and $91,000 during the three and nine months ended January 31, 2018, respectively.
During the nine months ended January 31, 2018 and 2017, we granted options for 1,196,000 and 342,000 shares of common stock, respectively.
We recorded stock option compensation cost of approximately $314,000 and $333,000 and related income tax benefits of approximately $138,000 and $124,000 during the three months ended January 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively.
We recorded stock option compensation cost of approximately $1.1 million and $1.1 million and related income tax benefits of approximately $413,000 and $409,000 during the nine months ended January 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively.
During the nine months ended January 31, 2018 and 2017, we issued 778,129 and 593,082 shares of common stock, respectively, resulting from the exercise of stock options.
The total intrinsic value of options exercised during the nine months ended January 31, 2018 and 2017 based on market value at the exercise dates was approximately $2.2 million and $1.9 million, respectively.
No one customer accounted for more than 10% of total revenues for the three and nine months ended January 31, 2018 and 2017.
On February 15, 2018, our Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.11 per share of our Class A and Class B Common Stock.

Our cost of revenue for licenses includes amortization of technology intangibles and capitalized computer software development costs, royalties paid to third-party software vendors, and agent commission expenses related to license revenues generated by the indirect channel, primarily from DMI.
Costs for maintenance and services include the cost of personnel to conduct implementations and customer support, consulting, other personnel-related expenses, and agent commission expenses related to maintenance revenues generated by the indirect channel, primarily from DMI.
We monitor the net realizable value of our capitalized software on a quarterly basis based on an estimate of future product revenues.
We currently expect to fully recover the value of the capitalized software asset recorded on our consolidated balance sheet; however, if future product revenues are less than managements current expectations, we may incur a write-down of capitalized software costs.
The 14% increase in revenues over the three months ended January 31, 2018 when compared to the same period last year was attributable primarily to a 50% increase in license fee revenues and, to a lesser extent, a 9% increase in services and other revenues and a 5% increase in maintenance revenues.
The increase in license fee revenues was attributable to entering into several license fee agreements during the quarter in our SCM segment, due to an increase in general economic activity and higher overall business information technology spending from the US tax reform.
The primary reason for the increase in services and other revenues in the three months ended January 31, 2018 was an increase in implementation and cloud services in our SCM segment partially offset by a decrease in our IT consulting services due to decreased demand for IT temporary staff.
International revenues represented approximately 20% and 17% of total revenues in the three months ended January 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively.
For the three and nine months ended January 31, 2018, license fee revenues increased 50% and 6%, respectively, when compared to the same periods in the prior year.

For the three months ended January 31, 2018 and 2017, our margins after commissions on direct sales were approximately 88% and 87%, respectively.
For the three months ended January 31, 2018 and 2017, our margins after commissions on indirect sales were approximately 32% and 41%, respectively.
For the nine months ended January 31, 2018 and 2017, our margins after commissions on indirect sales were approximately 36% and 44%, respectively.
These margin calculations include only commission expense for comparative purposes and do not include other costs of license fees such as amortization of capitalized software.
For the three and nine months ended January 31, 2018, services revenue increased by 9% and 4%, respectively, primarily due to increased services revenues from our SCM business unit partially offset by a decrease in our IT consulting business unit.
For the three and nine months ended January 31, 2018, a 24% and 17% increase, respectively, at our SCM business unit was due to services revenue related to our Logility cloud services area and an increase in utilization from project implementation services from higher license fees in prior periods.
For the three and nine months ended January 31, 2018, our IT Consulting segments revenues decreased 11% and 12%, respectively, when compared to the same periods in the prior year due lower project work.

For the three months ended January 31, 2018, cloud services Annual Contract Value (ACV) increased approximately 125% to $10.9 million compared to $4.9 million in the same period of the prior year.
ACV is a forward-looking operating measure used by management to better understand cloud services (SaaS and other related cloud services) revenue trends within our business, as it reflects our current estimate of revenue to be generated under existing client contracts in the forward 12-month period.
For the three and nine months ended January 31, 2018, maintenance revenues increased 5% and 3%, respectively, when compared to the same periods in the prior year, due primarily to increased license fees in recent periods.
Our SCM Segment accounted for 97% and 96% of total maintenance revenues for the three and nine months ended January 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively.
For the three and nine months ended January 31, 2018, our total gross margin percentage increased when compared to the same periods in the prior year primarily due to a higher license fee margin from higher license fees and for the nine months ended January 31, 2018, to a lesser extent, due to an increase in gross margins in services and other and maintenance revenues.
License fee gross margin percentage for the three and nine months ended January 31, 2018 increased when compared to the same periods in the prior year due to higher license fees.
License fee gross margin percentage tends to be directly related to the level of license fee revenues due to the relatively fixed cost of computer software amortization expense, amortization of acquired software and the sales mix between our direct and indirect channels.
For the nine months ended January 31, 2018, the gross margin percentage on services and other revenue increased by seven percentage points when compared to the same periods in the prior year primarily due to an increase in our Logility cloud services area which has higher margin services and related implementation services.
For the nine months ended January 31, 2018 and 2017, the gross margin percentage had a slight uptick to 79% from 77%, respectively, primarily due to increased maintenance revenue and cost containment efforts.
For the three and nine months ended January 31, 2018, gross product research and development costs increased 5% and 1%, respectively when compared to the same periods in the previous year due increased headcount and related expenses.
Capitalized software development costs increased 20% and 48%, respectively, for the three and nine months ended January 31, 2018 when compared to the same period last year due to timing of capitalizable project work.
Sales and marketing expenses for the three months ended January 31, 2018 and 2017 remained flat at 18% as a percentage of revenue.
For the nine months ended January 31, 2018 and 2017, we had a slight reduction in sales and marketing expenses to 18% from 19% as a percentage of revenue, respectively.
For the three and nine months ended January 31, 2018, general and administrative expenses increased when compared to the same periods a year ago due to the purchase of Halo and variable compensation.
Our SCM segments operating income increased by 63% and 78% for the three and nine months ended January 31, 2018, respectively, compared to same period last year primarily due to higher overall revenues and higher margin cloud services.
Our IT Consulting segment operating income decreased 44% and increased 11% for the three and nine months ended January 31, 2018, respectively, when compared to the prior year due to lower revenues for the three month period and improved gross margins for the nine month period.
Our Other segment operating loss increased 26% and 14% in the three and nine months ended January 31, 2018, respectively, compared to the same period in the prior year primarily due to higher corporate variable compensation and lower revenues.
For the three months ended January 31, 2018, the increase in other income was due primarily to a 1) higher unrealized gains on investments, 2) higher interest income and 3) an exchange rate gain of approximately $75,000 for the three months ended January 31, 2018 when compared to a loss of approximately $56,000 in the same period last year.
Our effective tax rates were lower in both the three and nine months ended January 31, 2018 than the same period last year because of the Act.
The changes in net cash that our operating activities provide generally reflect the changes in net earnings and non-cash operating items plus the effect of changes in operating assets and liabilities, such as investment trading securities, trade accounts receivable, trade accounts payable, accrued expenses and deferred revenue.
The increase in cash used in investing activities when compared to the same period in the prior year was due primarily to the acquisition of Halo in the current quarter compared to the acquisition of AdapChain, Inc. in the prior year period and higher capitalized computer software development costs, partially offset by a decrease in purchases of property and equipment.
Our total activities used more cash and investments during the nine months ended January 31, 2018, when compared to the prior year period, due primarily to the operating results and changes in operating assets and liabilities as noted above.
We defer maintenance revenues, including those sold with the initial license fee, based on VSOE, and recognize the revenue ratably over the maintenance contract period.
SaaS revenues are recognized ratably over the subscription term as the customer has no ability to take delivery of the software, and the underlying arrangements typically include a single fee for the service that is billed monthly, quarterly or annually.
We amortize capitalized computer software development costs ratably based on the projected revenues associated with the related software or on a straight-line basis over three years, whichever method results in a higher level of amortization.
Amortization of capitalized computer software development costs is included in the cost of license revenues in the condensed consolidated statements of operations.
Amortization of current technology is recorded in cost of revenues-license and amortization of all other intangible assets is recorded in amortization of acquisition-related intangibles.
