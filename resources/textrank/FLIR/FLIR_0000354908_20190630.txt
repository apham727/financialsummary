Revenue is recognized upon transfer of control of promised products or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration the Company expects to receive in exchange for those products or services.
The Company regularly enters into contracts that can include various combinations of products and services, which are generally capable of being distinct and accounted for as separate performance obligations.
However, for certain contracts that include highly customized components, if performance does not create an asset with an alternative use and termination for convenience clauses provide an enforceable right to payment for performance completed to date, revenue is recognized over time as the performance obligation is satisfied.
The Company's products are sold with warranty provisions that require it to remedy deficiencies in quality or performance of the Company's products over a specified period of time, generally twelve to twenty-four months, at no cost to its customers.
Warranty liabilities are established at the time that revenue is recognized at levels that represent the Company's estimate of the costs that will be incurred to fulfill those warranty requirements.

The fair value of the Company’s foreign currency contracts as of June 30, 2019 and December 31, 2018, and the interest rate swap contract as of June 30, 2019 are disclosed in Note 6, "Derivative Financial Instruments," and are based on Level 2 inputs.

The Company enters into foreign currency forward contracts not formally designated as hedges to manage the consolidated exchange rate risk associated with the remeasurement of non-functional currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities.
The Company is managing its interest rate risk related to certain floating rate debt through a floored amortizing interest rate swap (“floored swap”) in which the Company receives floating rate payments subject to a floor of zero percent and makes fixed rate payments.
The floored swap is designated and effective as a cash flow hedge with individual swap cash flows recorded as an asset or liability in the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheets at fair value.
The net fair value carrying amount of the Company's floored swap was an unrealized loss of $2.1 million, which has been recorded in prepaid expenses and other current assets, other current liabilities and pension and other long-term liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheet as of June 30, 2019.
Operating lease right-of-use assets ("ROU assets") represent the Company’s right to use an underlying asset for the lease term and operating lease liabilities represent the obligation to make lease payments arising from the lease.
As most of the leases do not provide an implicit rate, the Company uses its incremental borrowing rate based on the information available at commencement date in determining the present value of lease payments.

While there still remains uncertainty related to estimating the costs associated with a potential remedy and number of units which may require such remedy, the Company currently estimates the range of potential loss on remaining units to be between $5.1 million and $11.7 million.
As no single amount within the range is a better estimate than any other amount within the range, the Company has recorded an accrual of $5.1 million in other current liabilities as of June 30, 2019.
Pointing to the Company’s 2015 settlement with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission of alleged United States Foreign Corrupt Practices Act violations and 2018 settlement with United States Department of State of alleged export control violations, the complaint alleges that the Company’s directors breached their fiduciary duties by failing to ensure that the Company had internal controls in place that would have prevented the alleged underlying misconduct and these settlements.
