Beginning in January 2018, CTS adopted the provisions of Accounting Standards Update ("ASU") 2014-09, "Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606)" under the modified retrospective method, which requires a cumulative effect adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings on the date of adoption.
Variable consideration is included in the transaction price if, in our judgment, it is probable that a significant future reversal of cumulative revenue under the contract will not occur.
During the three and six months ended June 30, 2018, we recognized a decrease of revenues of $46 and an increase in revenues of $86, respectively, that were included in contract liabilities at the beginning of the period.
The increase in contract liabilities as of June 30, 2018 is primarily due to net increases in estimated future discounts and price concessions, offset by net settlements of products sold with rights of return.
Costs associated with exit and restructuring activities are recorded in the Condensed Consolidated Statement of Earnings as a separate component of Operating earnings.
The total restructuring liability related to severance and other one-time benefit arrangements under the June 2016 Plan was $1,223 at June 30, 2018, and $1,460 at December 31, 2017.
The remaining restructuring liability related to the April 2014 Plan was $433 at June 30, 2018, and $453 at December 31, 2017.
In the opinion of management, based upon presently available information relating to such matters, adequate provision for probable and estimable costs have been recorded.
These costs are included in interest expense in our Condensed Consolidated Statement of Earnings.
The use of derivative financial instruments exposes the Company to credit risk, which relates to the risk of nonperformance by a counterparty to the derivative contracts.
The effective portion of derivative gains and losses are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive (loss) income until the hedged transaction affects earnings upon settlement, at which time they are reclassified to cost of goods sold or net sales.
If it is probable that an anticipated hedged transaction will not occur by the end of the originally specified time period, we reclassify the gains or losses related to that hedge from accumulated other comprehensive (loss) income to other income (expense).
In January of 2016, we began using forward contracts to mitigate currency risk related to a portion of our forecasted foreign currency revenues and costs.
The currency forward contracts are designed as cash flow hedges and are recorded in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets at fair value.
At June 30, 2018, we had a net unrealized gain of $59 in accumulated other comprehensive (loss) income, of which $5 is expected to be reclassified to income within the next 12 months.
At June 30, 2017 we had a net unrealized gain of $428 in accumulated other comprehensive (loss) income.
The notional amount of foreign currency forward contracts outstanding was $21.1 million at June 30, 2018.
Unrealized gains (losses) on hedges relate to interest rate swaps to convert the revolving credit facility's variable rate of interest into a fixed rate and foreign currency forward contracts used to hedge our exposure to changes in exchange rates affecting certain revenues and costs denominated in foreign currencies.
These hedges are designated as cash flow hedges, and we have deferred income statement recognition of gains and losses until the hedged transactions occur, at which time amounts are reclassified into earnings.
Further information related to our derivative financial instruments is included in Note 12 - Derivative Financial Instruments and Note 16 – Fair Value Measurements.
We are required to translate the subsidiary functional currency financial statements to dollars using a combination of historical, period-end, and average foreign exchange rates.
Transaction losses for the three and six months ended June 30, 2018 were $2,194 and $918, respectively and transaction gains for the three and six months ended June 30, 2017 were $1,162 and $1,557, respectively, which have been included in other income (expense) in the Condensed Consolidated Statement of Earnings.
During 2015 and 2016, the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors of the Company (the “Committee”) granted a total of 350,000 performance-based stock option awards (“Performance-Based Option Awards”) for certain employees under the 2014 Plan, of which 285,000 remain outstanding after considering forfeitures.
The Performance-Based Option Awards have an exercise price of $18.37, a term of five years, and generally will become exercisable (provided the optionee remains employed by the Company or an affiliate) upon our attainment of at least $600,000 in revenues during any of our trailing four quarterly periods (as determined by the Committee) during the term.
for the six-month periods ended June 30, 2018 and 2017, since the revenue target was not deemed likely to be attained based on our current forecast.
At June 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017 we had 17,248 and 14,082 cash-settled RSUs outstanding, respectively.
At June 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017, liabilities of $184 and $241, respectively were included in Accrued liabilities on our Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets.
We use interest rate swaps to convert our Revolving Credit Facility’s variable rate of interest into a fixed rate and foreign currency forward contracts to hedge the effect of foreign currency changes on certain revenues and costs denominated in foreign currencies.
The fair value of our interest rate swaps and foreign currency hedges were measured using standard valuation models using market-based observable inputs over the contractual terms, including forward yield curves, among others.
The purchase price of $19,121, net of cash acquired of $199, has been allocated to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed on the acquisition date based on their fair values.
Goodwill recorded in connection with this acquisition represents the value we expect to be created by combining the operations of the acquired business with our existing operations, including the expansion into markets within our existing business, access to new customers, and potential cost savings and synergies.
This ASU is meant to improve the accounting for the income tax effect of intra-entity transfers of assets other than inventory.
This ASU will now require companies to recognize the income tax effect of an intra-entity asset transfer (other than inventory) when the transaction occurs.
This ASU is effective for public companies, for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019 and interim periods within those annual reporting periods.
The ASU requires companies to record an asset and liability on the balance sheet for leases that were formerly designated as operating leases as well as leases designated as financing leases.
The liability recorded for a lease is meant to recognize the lease payments and the asset as a right to use the underlying asset for the lease, including optional periods if it is reasonably certain the option will be exercised.
Recording of the liability should be based on the present value of the lease payments.
If a lease term is less than twelve months, a company is allowed to elect not to record the asset and liability.
Expense related to these leases are to be amortized on a straight-line basis over the expected term of the lease.
We expect certain operating leases to be recognized as assets and liabilities as a result of adopting the standard.

Sales were $118,021 in the second quarter of 2018, an increase of $12,335 or 11.7% from the second quarter of 2017.
The Noliac acquisition, which was completed in May 2017, added $2,508 in sales in the second quarter of 2018 and $1,543 in the second quarter of 2017.
Changes in foreign exchange rates increased sales by $1,794 year-over-year due to the U.S. Dollar depreciating compared to the Euro and Chinese Renminbi and relating mostly to sales of transportation products.
Gross margin as a percent of sales was 35.4% in the second quarter of 2018 compared to 33.9% in the second quarter of 2017.
The second quarter of 2017 also included costs related to certain production rework issues resolved in the first quarter of 2017.
Research and development expenses were $6,476 or 5.5% of sales in the second quarter of 2018 compared to $6,049 or 5.7% of sales in the comparable quarter of 2017.

Other expense in the second quarter of 2018 was principally driven by foreign currency translation losses, mainly due to the appreciation of the U.S. Dollar compared to the Chinese Renminbi and Euro during the quarter.
Our effective income tax rate was 37.7% and 28.4% in the second quarters of 2018 and 2017, respectively.
The increase in the effective tax rate for the three months ended June 30, 2018, compared with the same period in 2017, was primarily attributed to tax expense of $1,703 related to a one-time cash distribution from Taiwan, offset by a reduction in our statutory tax rate as a result of the 2017 Tax and Jobs Act.
Sales were $231,551 in the six months ended June 30, 2018, an increase of $25,711 or 12.5% from the six months ended June 30, 2017.
Changes in foreign exchange rates increased sales by $4,558 year-over-year due to the U.S. Dollar depreciating compared to the Euro and Chinese Renminbi and relating mostly to sales of transportation products.
Gross margin as a percent of sales was 34.7% in the first half of 2018 compared to 34.0% in the first half of 2017.
The first half of 2017 also included costs related to certain production rework issues resolved in the first quarter of 2017.
Research and development expenses were $12,983 or 5.6% of sales in the six months ended June 30, 2018 compared to $12,052 or 5.9% of sales in the comparable prior year period.
Interest expense decreased in the first six months of 2018 versus the same period of 2017 mainly as a result of the reduction in debt year-over-year.
Other expense in the first six months of 2018 was principally driven by foreign currency translation losses, mainly due to the appreciation of the U.S. Dollar compared to the Chinese Renminbi and Euro during the first half of the year.
The increase in the effective tax rate for the six months ended June 30, 2018, compared with the same period in 2017, was primarily attributed to tax expense of $1,703 related to a one-time cash distribution from Taiwan, offset by a reduction in our statutory tax rate as a result of the 2017 Tax and Jobs Act.
Working capital decreased by $4,283 during the six months ended June 30, 2018, primarily due the decrease in cash and cash equivalents as well as the increase in accounts payable, which were partially offset by higher accounts receivable and inventory.
We have historically funded our capital and operating needs primarily through cash flows from operating activities, supported by available credit under our Revolving Credit Facility.
We believe that cash flows from operating activities and available borrowings under our Revolving Credit Facility will be adequate to fund our working capital needs, capital expenditures, and debt service requirements for at least the next twelve months.
We utilize actuaries from consulting companies in each applicable country to develop our discount rates that match high-quality bonds currently available and expected to be available during the period to maturity of the pension benefit in order to provide the necessary future cash flows to pay the accumulated benefits when due.
After considering the recommendations of our actuaries, we have assumed a discount rate, expected rate of return on plan assets and a rate of compensation increase in determining our annual pension income and expense and the projected benefit obligation.
During the fourth quarter of each year, we review our actuarial assumptions in light of current economic factors to determine if the assumptions need to be adjusted.
We recognize an impairment charge for the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the reporting unit's fair value, but only to the extent of goodwill recognized.
Under the "Income Approach — Discounted Cash Flow Method", the key assumptions include sales, cost of sales, and operating expense projections through the year 2021.
These assumptions were determined by management utilizing our internal operating plan and assuming growth rates for revenues, operating expenses, and gross margin assumptions.
If the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds the reporting unit's fair value, we perform the second step of the goodwill impairment test to determine the amount of impairment loss, if any.
If we believe that one or more indicators of impairment have occurred, we perform a recoverability test by comparing the carrying amount of an asset or asset group to the sum of the undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and the eventual disposition of the asset or asset group.
