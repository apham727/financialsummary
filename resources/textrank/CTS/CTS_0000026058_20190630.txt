Beginning in January 2019, CTS adopted the provisions of Accounting Standards Update ("ASU") 2016-02, "Leases (Topic 842)" under the optional transition method, which requires, if necessary, a cumulative effect adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings.
The lease liability is based on the present value of minimum lease payments discounted using our secured incremental borrowing rate at the date of adoption.
Existing deferred rent liabilities, resulting from our historical practice of using the straight line method for recognizing lease expense, were reclassified upon adoption to reduce the measurement of the lease assets.
During the three and six months ended June 30, 2019, we recognized revenues of $37 and $106, respectively, for amounts that were included in contract liabilities at the beginning of the period.
Costs associated with exit and restructuring activities are recorded in the Condensed Consolidated Statement of Earnings as a separate component of Operating earnings.
These costs are included in interest expense in our Condensed Consolidated Statement of Earnings.
The use of derivative financial instruments exposes the Company to credit risk, which relates to the risk of nonperformance by a counterparty to the derivative contracts.
We manage our credit risk by entering into derivative contracts with only highly rated financial institutions and by using netting agreements.
We use forward contracts to mitigate currency risk related to a portion of our forecasted foreign currency revenues and costs.
The currency forward contracts are designed as cash flow hedges and are recorded in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets at fair value.
At June 30, 2019, we had a net unrealized gain of $784 in accumulated other comprehensive (loss) income, of which $784 is expected to be reclassified to income within the next 12 months.
Unrealized gains (losses) on hedges relate to interest rate swaps to convert our revolving credit facility's variable rate of interest into a fixed rate and foreign currency forward contracts used to hedge our exposure to changes in exchange rates affecting certain revenues and costs denominated in foreign currencies.
These hedges are designated as cash flow hedges, and we have deferred income statement recognition of gains and losses until the hedged transactions occur, at which time amounts are reclassified into earnings.
Further information related to our derivative financial instruments is included in Note 12 - Derivative Financial Instruments and Note 16 – Fair Value Measurements.
We are required to translate the subsidiary functional currency financial statements to dollars using a combination of historical, period-end, and average foreign exchange rates.
This combination of rates creates the foreign currency translation adjustment component of other comprehensive income.
Changes in exchange rates between the functional currency and the currency in which a transaction is denominated are foreign exchange transaction gains or losses.
Transaction losses for the three months and six months ended June 30, 2019 were $829 and $355, respectively and transaction losses for the three and six months ended June 30, 2018 were $2,194 and $918, respectively, which have been included in other income (expense) in the Condensed Consolidated Statement of Earnings.
During the six months ended June 30, 2019, 179,966 shares of common stock were repurchased for approximately $5,002, of which $567 was repurchased under the previous program and $4,435 was repurchased under the most recent board-authorized share repurchase plan.
The number of awards that were anti-dilutive for the six month periods ended June 30, 2019 and June 30, 2018 were 108,894 and 72,658, respectively.
There were no outstanding anti-dilutive awards impacting the three month periods ended June 30, 2019 and June 30, 2018.
The Performance-Based Option Awards have an exercise price of $18.37, a term of five years, and generally will become exercisable (provided the optionee remains employed by the Company or an affiliate) upon our attainment of at least $600,000 in revenues during any of our trailing four quarterly periods (as determined by the Committee) during the term.
We have not recognized any expense on these Performance-Based Option Awards for the six-month periods ended June 30, 2019 and 2018, since the revenue target was not deemed likely to be attained based on our current forecast.
At June 30, 2019 and December 31, 2018, liabilities of $211 and $300, respectively were included in Accrued liabilities on our Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets.
We use interest rate swaps to convert our Revolving Credit Facility’s variable rate of interest into a fixed rate and foreign currency forward contracts to hedge the effect of foreign currency changes on certain revenues and costs denominated in foreign currencies.
The fair value of our interest rate swaps and foreign currency hedges were measured using standard valuation models using market-based observable inputs over the contractual terms, including forward yield curves, among others.
The fair value of long-term debt approximates carrying value and was determined by valuing a similar hypothetical coupon bond and attributing that value to our long-term debt under the Revolving Credit Facility.
Our effective income tax rate was 25.1% and 37.7% in the second quarters of 2019 and 2018, respectively.
The tax rate in the second quarter of 2019 was higher than the U.S. statutory federal tax rate primarily due to state taxes and foreign earnings that are taxed at higher rates.
The tax rate in the second quarter of 2018 was higher than the U.S. statutory federal tax rate primarily due to foreign withholding taxes, state taxes and foreign earnings that are taxed at higher rates.
Our effective income tax rate was 22.7% and 30.2% for the six months ended June 30, 2019 and 2018, respectively.
The tax rate in the second quarter of 2019 was higher than the U.S. statutory federal tax rate primarily due to higher foreign tax rates applicable on foreign earnings offset by tax benefits recorded upon vesting of restricted stock units.
The tax rate in the second quarter of 2018 was higher than the U.S. statutory federal tax rate primarily due to foreign withholding taxes, state taxes and higher foreign tax rates applicable on foreign earnings.
Operating lease liabilities represent the present value of lease payments over the lease term, discounted using an estimate of our secured incremental borrowing rate because none of our leases contain a rate implicit in the lease arrangement.
The operating lease assets and liabilities are adjusted to include the impact of any lease incentives and non-lease components.
We have elected not to record leases with an initial term of 12 months or less on the balance sheet and instead recognize those lease payments on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
In August 2018, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued Accounting Standards Update ("ASU") No. 2018-14, "Compensation - Retirement Benefits - Defined Benefit Plans - General." This ASU modifies the disclosure requirements for defined benefit and other postretirement plans.
This ASU eliminates certain disclosures associated with accumulated other comprehensive income, plan assets, related parties, and the effects of interest rate basis point changes on assumed health care costs; while other disclosures have been added to address significant gains and losses related to changes in benefit obligations.
The amendments in this ASU are effective for fiscal years ending after December 15, 2020 and for interim periods therein with early adoption permitted.
This ASU is meant to improve the accounting for the income tax effect of intra-entity transfers of assets other than inventory.
This ASU will now require companies to recognize the income tax effect of an intra-entity asset transfer (other than inventory) when the transaction occurs.
Early adoption is permitted and is to be applied on a modified retrospective basis through a cumulative-effect adjustment to retained earnings as of the beginning of the period of adoption.
In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-13, Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments, which amends the current accounting guidance and requires the measurement of all expected losses based on historical experience, current conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts.
For trade receivables, loans, and other financial instruments, we will be required to use a forward-looking expected loss model rather than the incurred loss model for recognizing credit losses which reflects losses that are probable.
We plan to adopt this standard on the effective date and are currently evaluating the impact of this new standard on our financial statements.

Changes in foreign exchange rates decreased sales by $1,861 year-over-year due to the U.S. Dollar appreciating compared to the Chinese Renminbi and Euro and relating mostly to sales of products to the transportation end market.
Gross margin as a percent of sales was 34.1% in the second quarter of 2019 compared to 35.4% in the second quarter of 2018.
Research and development expenses were $6,257 or 5.2% of sales in the second quarter of 2019 compared to $6,476 or 5.5% of sales in the comparable quarter of 2018.
Restructuring charges were $911 or 0.8% of sales in the second quarter of 2019.
Restructuring charges were $1,172 or 1.0% of sales in the second quarter of 2018.
Operating earnings were $17,083 or 14.2% of sales in the second quarter of 2019 compared to operating earnings of $14,544 or 12.3% of sales in the second quarter of 2018.
Interest expense decreased mainly as a result of the reduction in debt year-over-year and a reduction in interest related to interest rate swaps.
Other expense in the second quarter of 2019 was principally driven by foreign currency translation losses, mainly due to the appreciation of the U.S. Dollar compared to the Chinese Renminbi during the quarter, as well as pension expense.
The decrease in the effective tax rate for the three months ended June 30, 2019, compared with the same period in 2018, was primarily attributed to the 2018 withholding tax payment of $1,703 on a one-time distribution from Taiwan.
Sales were $238,308 in the six months ended June 30, 2019, an increase of $6,757 or 2.9% from the six months ended June 30, 2018.
Changes in foreign exchange rates decreased sales by $3,632 year-over-year due to the U.S. Dollar appreciating compared to the Chinese Renminbi and Euro and relating mostly to sales of products to the transportation end market.
Gross margin as a percent of sales was 34.3% in the six months ended June 30, 2019 compared to 34.7% for the six months ended June 30, 2018.
Research and development expenses were $13,048 or 5.5% of sales in the six months ended June 30, 2019 compared to $12,983 or 5.6% of sales in the six months ended June 30, 2018.

Interest expense decreased mainly as a result of the reduction in debt year-over-year and a reduction in interest related to interest rate swaps.
Other expense in the six months ended June 30, 2019 was principally driven by foreign currency translation losses, mainly due to the appreciation of the U.S. Dollar compared to the Chinese Renminbi during the first six months of the year, as well as pension expense.
Our effective income tax rate was 22.7% and 30.2% in the six months ended June 30, 2019 and 2018, respectively.
The decrease in the effective tax rate for the six months ended June 30, 2019, compared with the same period in 2018, was primarily attributed to the 2018 withholding tax payment of $1,703 on a one-time distribution from Taiwan.
Working capital increased by $18,738 during the six months ended June 30, 2019, primarily due to the increase in cash and accounts receivable and the decrease of accrued payroll and benefits and accrued liabilities.
We have historically funded our capital and operating needs primarily through cash flows from operating activities, supported by available credit under our Revolving Credit Facility.
We believe that cash flows from operating activities and available borrowings under our Revolving Credit Facility will be adequate to fund our working capital needs, capital expenditures, and debt service requirements for at least the next twelve months.
We evaluate our warranty obligations at least quarterly and adjust our accruals if it is probable that future costs will be different than our current reserve.
Over the last three years, product warranty reserves have ranged from 0.5% to 2.4% of total sales.
We utilize actuaries from consulting companies in each applicable country to develop our discount rates that match high-quality bonds currently available and expected to be available during the period to maturity of the pension benefit in order to provide the necessary future cash flows to pay the accumulated benefits when due.
After considering the recommendations of our actuaries, we have assumed a discount rate, expected rate of return on plan assets and a rate of compensation increase in determining our annual pension income and expense and the projected benefit obligation.
During the fourth quarter of each year, we review our actuarial assumptions in light of current economic factors to determine if the assumptions need to be adjusted.
If a quantitative assessment is required, we estimate the fair value of each reporting unit using a combination of discounted cash flow analysis and market-based valuation methodologies.
Determining fair value using a quantitative approach requires significant judgment, including judgments about projected revenues, operating expenses, working capital investment, capital expenditures, and cash flows over a multi-year period.
The discount rate applied to our forecasts of future cash flows is based on our estimated weighted average cost of capital.
Changes in these estimates and assumptions could materially affect the determination of fair value and impact the goodwill impairment assessment.
If we believe that one or more indicators of impairment have occurred, we perform a recoverability test by comparing the carrying amount of an asset or asset group to the sum of the undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and the eventual disposition of the asset or asset group.
During the six months ended June 30, 2019 quarter we recognized impairment charges of $892 related to the June 2016 Restructuring Plan.
No other indicators of impairment were identified during the quarter ended June 30, 2019.

Legal Proceedings
Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds
On February 7, 2019 the Board of Directors authorized a new stock repurchase program with a maximum dollar limit of $25 million.
This program authorizes us to make repurchases of our common stock from time to time on the open market, but does not obligate us to make repurchases, and has no expiration date.
