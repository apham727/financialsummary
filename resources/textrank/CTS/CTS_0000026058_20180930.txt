Beginning in January 2018, CTS adopted the provisions of Accounting Standards Update ("ASU") 2014-09, "Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606)" under the modified retrospective method, which requires a cumulative effect adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings on the date of adoption.
During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2018, we recognized a decrease of revenues of $18 and an increase of $68, respectively, that were included in contract liabilities at the beginning of the period.
The increase in contract liabilities as of September 30, 2018 is primarily due to net increases in estimated future discounts and price concessions, offset by net settlements of products sold with rights of return.
Costs associated with exit and restructuring activities are recorded in the Condensed Consolidated Statement of Earnings as a separate component of Operating earnings.
The total restructuring liability related to severance and other one-time benefit arrangements under the June 2016 Plan was $1,044 at September 30, 2018, and $1,460 at December 31, 2017.
These costs are included in interest expense in our Condensed Consolidated Statement of Earnings.
The use of derivative financial instruments exposes the Company to credit risk, which relates to the risk of nonperformance by a counterparty to the derivative contracts.
No recognition of ineffectiveness was recorded in our Condensed Consolidated Statement of Earnings for the nine months ended September 30, 2018.
In January of 2016, we began using forward contracts to mitigate currency risk related to a portion of our forecasted foreign currency revenues and costs.
The currency forward contracts are designed as cash flow hedges and are recorded in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets at fair value.
At September 30, 2018, we had a net unrealized gain of $867 in accumulated other comprehensive (loss) income, of which $644 is expected to be reclassified to income within the next 12 months.
Unrealized gains (losses) on hedges relate to interest rate swaps to convert the revolving credit facility's variable rate of interest into a fixed rate and foreign currency forward contracts used to hedge our exposure to changes in exchange rates affecting certain revenues and costs denominated in foreign currencies.
These hedges are designated as cash flow hedges, and we have deferred income statement recognition of gains and losses until the hedged transactions occur, at which time amounts are reclassified into earnings.
We are required to translate the subsidiary functional currency financial statements to dollars using a combination of historical, period-end, and average foreign exchange rates.
Transaction losses for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2018 were $1,740 and $2,658, respectively and transaction gains for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2017 were $960 and $2,517, respectively, which have been included in other income (expense) in the Condensed Consolidated Statement of Earnings.
During 2015 and 2016, the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors of the Company (the “Committee”) granted a total of 350,000 performance-based stock option awards (“Performance-Based Option Awards”) for certain employees under the 2014 Plan, of which 285,000 remain outstanding after considering forfeitures.
The Performance-Based Option Awards have an exercise price of $18.37, a term of five years, and generally will become exercisable (provided the optionee remains employed by the Company or an affiliate) upon our attainment of at least $600,000 in revenues during any of our trailing four quarterly periods (as determined by the Committee) during the term.
for the nine-month periods ended September 30, 2018 and 2017, since the revenue target was not deemed likely to be attained based on our current forecast.
At September 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017, liabilities of $321 and $241, respectively were included in Accrued liabilities on our Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets.
We use interest rate swaps to convert our Revolving Credit Facility’s variable rate of interest into a fixed rate and foreign currency forward contracts to hedge the effect of foreign currency changes on certain revenues and costs denominated in foreign currencies.
The fair value of our interest rate swaps and foreign currency hedges were measured using standard valuation models using market-based observable inputs over the contractual terms, including forward yield curves, among others.
The decrease in the effective tax rate for the nine months ended September 30, 2018, compared with the same period in 2017, was primarily attributed to the previously mentioned statutory tax rate reduction resulting from the Tax Act. The tax rate in the first nine months of 2018 was higher than the U.S. statutory federal tax rate primarily due to state taxes, foreign withholding taxes including the impact of the one-time cash distribution from Taiwan, higher non-deductible currency losses, and foreign earnings taxed at higher rates.
The tax rate in the first nine months of 2017 was lower than the U.S. statutory federal tax rate primarily due to tax benefits recorded upon vesting of restricted stock units, a release of valuation allowances recorded against realizable foreign NOLs, and favorable tax rates on foreign earnings, offset by the impact of state taxes, tax expense for withholding taxes on the anticipated distribution of earnings in China, and other various permanent items.
The purchase price of $19,121, net of cash acquired of $199, has been allocated to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed on the acquisition date based on their fair values.
Goodwill recorded in connection with this acquisition represents the value we expect to be created by combining the operations of the acquired business with our existing operations, including the expansion into markets within our existing business, access to new customers, and potential cost savings and synergies.
In August 2018, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued Accounting Standards Update ("ASU") No. 2018-14, "Compensation - Retirement Benefits - Defined Benefit Plans - General." This ASU modifies the disclosure requirements for defined benefit and other postretirement plans.
This ASU eliminates certain disclosures associated with accumulated other comprehensive income, plan assets, related parties, and the effects of interest rate basis point changes on assumed health care costs; while other disclosures have been added to address significant gains and losses related to changes in benefit obligations.
The amendments in this ASU are effective for fiscal years ending after December 15, 2020 and for interim periods therein with early adoption permitted.
This ASU will impact our financial statement disclosures but will not have an impact on our consolidated financial position, results of operations, or cash flows.
This ASU is meant to improve the accounting for the income tax effect of intra-entity transfers of assets other than inventory.
This ASU will now require companies to recognize the income tax effect of an intra-entity asset transfer (other than inventory) when the transaction occurs.
This ASU is effective for public companies, for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019 and interim periods within those annual reporting periods.
Early adoption is permitted and is to be applied on a modified retrospective basis through a cumulative-effect adjustment to retained earnings as of the beginning of the period of adoption.
We adopted this ASU as of January 1, 2018 and it did not have an impact on our financial statements.
The liability recorded for a lease is meant to recognize the lease payments and the asset as a right to use the underlying asset for the lease, including optional periods if it is reasonably certain the option will be exercised.
If a lease term is less than twelve months, a company is allowed to elect not to record the asset and liability.
This amendment allows companies to elect to record a cumulative effect adjustment to beginning retained earnings on the date of adoption.
The provisions of this ASU are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018 and early adoption is permitted.
We expect certain operating leases to be recognized as assets and liabilities as a result of adopting the standard.

Changes in foreign exchange rates decreased sales by $375 year-over-year due to the U.S. Dollar appreciating compared to the Chinese Renminbi and Euro and relating mostly to sales of products to the transportation end market.
Gross margin as a percent of sales was 35.4% in the third quarter of 2018 compared to 35.3% in the third quarter of 2017.

Restructuring charges were $1,435 or 1.4% of sales in the third quarter of 2017.
The loss on sale of assets in the third quarter of 2017 was driven by the sale of vacant land adjacent to our Hopkinton, Massachusetts facility in September 2017.
Operating earnings were $16,118 or 13.6% of sales in the third quarter of 2018 compared to operating earnings of $13,111 or 12.3% of sales in the comparable quarter of 2017.
Other expense in the third quarter of 2018 was principally driven by foreign currency translation losses, mainly due to the appreciation of the U.S. Dollar compared to the Chinese Renminbi during the quarter.

Gross margin as a percent of sales was 34.9% in the nine months of 2018 compared to 34.5% in the first nine months of 2017.
Major drivers for the improvement include savings related to product line transfers and favorable foreign exchange impact, partially offset by tariff and material cost increases.
The first nine months of 2017 also included costs related to certain production rework issues resolved in the first quarter of 2017.
Research and development expenses were $19,500 or 5.6% of sales in the nine months ended September 30, 2018 compared to $18,432 or 5.9% of sales in the comparable prior year period.
Interest expense decreased in the first nine months of 2018 versus the same period of 2017 mainly as a result of the reduction in debt year-over-year.
Other expense in the first nine months of 2018 was principally driven by foreign currency translation losses, mainly due to the appreciation of the U.S. Dollar compared to the Chinese Renminbi during the first nine months of the year.
The decrease in the effective tax rate for the nine months ended September 30, 2018, compared with the same period in 2017, was primarily attributed to the previously mentioned statutory tax rate reduction resulting from the Tax Act, which was partially offset by tax expense related to the one-time cash distribution from Taiwan and higher non-deductible currency losses.
Working capital increased by $2,141 during the nine months ended September 30, 2018, primarily due to the increases in accounts receivable and inventory, which were partially offset by the decrease in cash and increase in accounts payable.
In the second quarter of 2012, we entered into four separate interest rate swap agreements to fix interest rates on $50,000 of long-term debt for the periods January 2013 to January 2017.
In the third quarter of 2012, we entered into four additional interest rate swap agreements to fix interest rates on $25,000 of long-term debt for the periods January 2013 to January 2017.
In the third quarter of 2016, we entered into three additional forward-starting interest rate swap agreements to fix interest rates on $50,000 of long-term debt for the periods August 2017 to August 2020.
We have historically funded our capital and operating needs primarily through cash flows from operating activities, supported by available credit under our Revolving Credit Facility.
We believe that cash flows from operating activities and available borrowings under our Revolving Credit Facility will be adequate to fund our working capital needs, capital expenditures, and debt service requirements for at least the next twelve months.
We utilize actuaries from consulting companies in each applicable country to develop our discount rates that match high-quality bonds currently available and expected to be available during the period to maturity of the pension benefit in order to provide the necessary future cash flows to pay the accumulated benefits when due.
After considering the recommendations of our actuaries, we have assumed a discount rate, expected rate of return on plan assets and a rate of compensation increase in determining our annual pension income and expense and the projected benefit obligation.
During the fourth quarter of each year, we review our actuarial assumptions in light of current economic factors to determine if the assumptions need to be adjusted.
Under the "Income Approach — Discounted Cash Flow Method", the key assumptions include sales, cost of sales, and operating expense projections through the year 2021.
These assumptions were determined by management utilizing our internal operating plan and assuming growth rates for revenues, operating expenses, and gross margin assumptions.
If the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds the reporting unit's fair value, we perform the second step of the goodwill impairment test to determine the amount of impairment loss, if any.
If we believe that one or more indicators of impairment have occurred, we perform a recoverability test by comparing the carrying amount of an asset or asset group to the sum of the undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and the eventual disposition of the asset or asset group.
