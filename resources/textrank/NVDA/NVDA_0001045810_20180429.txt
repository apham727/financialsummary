Except for the accounting policy for revenue recognition, which was updated as a result of adopting a new accounting standard related to revenue recognition, there have been no material changes to our significant accounting policies in Note 1 - Organization and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended January 28, 2018.
For products sold with a right of return, we record a reduction to revenue by establishing a sales return allowance for estimated product returns at the time revenue is recognized, based primarily on historical return rates.
However, if product returns for a fiscal period are anticipated to exceed historical return rates, we may determine that additional sales return allowances are required to properly reflect our estimated exposure for product returns.
In February 2016, the FASB issued an accounting standards update regarding the accounting for leases by which we will begin recognizing lease assets and liabilities on the balance sheet for lease terms of more than 12 months.
The update will be effective for us beginning in the first quarter of fiscal year 2020.
The impact of applying the new standard on our consolidated financial statements for the quarter ended April 29, 2018 was not significant.
Refer to Note 15 of these Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information, including disaggregated revenue disclosures.
Of the total fair value of equity awards granted during the first quarters of fiscal years 2019 and 2018, we estimated that the stock-based compensation expense related to equity awards that are not expected to vest was $18 million and $27 million, respectively.
The 1.00% Convertible Senior Notes Due 2018, or the Convertible Notes, are included in the calculation of diluted net income per share.
The Convertible Notes have a dilutive impact on net income per share if our average stock price for the reporting period exceeds the adjusted conversion price of $20.0296 per share.
The warrants associated with our Convertible Notes, or the Warrants, outstanding are also included in the calculation of diluted net income per share.
For the first quarter of fiscal year 2019, our average stock price was $235.10, which exceeded the adjusted conversion price, causing the Convertible Notes to have a dilutive impact.
The denominator for diluted net income per share does not include any effect from the convertible note hedge transactions, or the Note Hedges, that we entered into concurrently with the issuance of the Convertible Notes, as its effect would be anti-dilutive.
We recognized income tax expense of $67 million and $29 million for the first quarter of fiscal years 2019 and 2018, respectively.
Income tax expense as a percentage of income before income tax was 5.1% and 5.5% for the first quarter of fiscal years 2019 and 2018, respectively.
The decrease in our effective tax rate in the first quarter of fiscal year 2019 as compared to the same period in the prior fiscal year is primarily due to a decrease in the U.S. statutory tax rate from 35% to 21%, partially offset by a decrease in the impact of tax benefits from stock-based compensation.
For the first quarter of fiscal years 2019 and 2018, there were no other-than-temporary impairment losses and net realized gains were not significant.
The amortized cost and estimated fair value of cash equivalents and marketable securities as of April 29, 2018 and January 28, 2018 are shown below by contractual maturity.
There were no significant transfers between Levels 1 and 2 financial assets and liabilities for the first quarter of fiscal year 2019.
The increase in gross carrying amount of intangible assets is primarily due to purchases of licensed technology during the first quarter of fiscal year 2019.
Amortization expense associated with intangible assets was $11 million and $15 million for the first quarter of fiscal years 2019 and 2018, respectively.
Future amortization expense related to the net carrying amount of intangible assets as of April 29, 2018 is estimated to be $18 million for the remainder of fiscal year 2019, $20 million in fiscal year 2020, $11 million in fiscal year 2021, $3 million in fiscal year 2022, and $3 million in fiscal year 2023 and beyond.
Therefore, the change in fair value of these contracts is recorded in other income or expense and offsets the change in fair value of the hedged foreign currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities, which is also recorded in other income or expense.
We record a reduction to revenue for estimated product returns at the time revenue is recognized primarily based on historical return rates.
The estimated product returns and estimated product warranty liabilities was $15 million as of April 29, 2018 and January 28, 2018.
In fiscal year 2014, we issued $1.50 billion of 1.00% Convertible Senior Notes due 2018.
Through the first quarter of fiscal year 2019, we had settled an aggregate of $1.49 billion of the Convertible Notes.
For example, during any fiscal quarter, if the last reported sale price of the common stock for at least 20 trading days during a period of 30 consecutive trading days ending on the last trading day of the immediately preceding fiscal quarter is greater than or equal to 130% of the conversion price on each applicable trading day, the Convertible Notes become convertible at the holders' option.
During the first quarter of fiscal year 2019, we repurchased a total of 3 million shares for $655 million and paid $91 million in cash dividends to our shareholders.
