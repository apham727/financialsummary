In  June 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-13, “Financial Instruments – Credit Losses: Measurements of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments.” This standard requires the measurement and recognition of expected credit losses held at amortized cost.
This new standard replaces the use of forward-looking information to estimate credit losses and requires credit losses for available for sale debt securities to be recorded through an allowance for credit losses rather than a reduction in the amortized cost basis.
In  August 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-14, “Compensation – Retirement Benefits – Defined Benefit Plans – General.” This standard removes certain disclosures that are not considered cost beneficial, clarifies certain required disclosures and added additional disclosures.
The table below represents the basic and diluted earnings per share and sets forth the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding and potential common stock equivalents for the three and six month periods ending  September 30, 2018 and 2019.
We primarily use forward contracts, with maturities generally less than four months, designated as cash flow hedges, to protect against the foreign currency exchange rate risks inherent in our forecasted transactions related to purchase commitments and sales, denominated in various currencies.
Fair values for all of our derivative financial instruments are valued by adjusting the market spot rate by forward points, based on the date of the contract.
We have been identified by the United States Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”), state governmental agencies or other private parties as a potentially responsible party (“PRP”) under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (“CERCLA”), or equivalent non-U.S., state or local laws, for clean-up and response costs associated with certain sites at which remediation is required with respect to prior contamination.
Because CERCLA or such state statutes authorize joint and several liability, the EPA or non-U.S., state or local regulatory authorities could seek to recover all clean-up costs from any one of the PRPs at a site despite the involvement of other PRPs. At certain sites, financially responsible PRPs other than AVX also are, or have been, involved in site investigation and clean-up activities.
As is customary, the orders and decrees regarding sites where the PRPs are not themselves implementing the chosen remedy contain provisions allowing the EPA to reopen the agreement and seek additional amounts from settling PRPs in the event that certain contingencies occur, such as the discovery of significant new information about site conditions.
On  June 3, 2010, AVX entered into an agreement with the EPA and the City of New Bedford, pursuant to which AVX is required to perform environmental remediation at a site referred to as the “Aerovox Site” (the “Site”), located in New Bedford, Massachusetts.
AVX has submitted its proposed remedy, but until the state has approved such proposal, AVX cannot determine if additional groundwater and soil remediation will be required, if substantial material will have to be disposed of offsite, or if additional remediation techniques will be required, any of which could result in a more extensive and costly plan of remediation.
During the year ended  March 31, 2019 we increased our estimated accrual for work to be done at the Site by $8,312 pursuant to discussions with the Massachusetts Department of Environmental Protection and our environmental engineers.
We have a remaining accrual of $21,279 at  September 30, 2019, representing our current estimate of the potential liability related to the remaining performance of environmental remediation actions at the Site and neighboring properties using certain assumptions regarding the plan of remediation.
On  April 19, 2016, the Canadian Ministry of the Environment and Climate Change (the “MoE”) issued a Director’s Order naming AVX Corporation, and others, as responsible parties with respect to a location in Hamilton, Ontario that was at one time the site of operations of Aerovox Canada, a former subsidiary of Aerovox Corporation, a predecessor of AVX.
On  April 25, 2013, AVX was named as a defendant in a patent infringement case filed in the United States District Court for the District of Delaware captioned Greatbatch, Inc. v.
In a new trial, the amount of damages (excluding interest) was determined by a jury to be $22,100 on  January 15, 2019 resulting in a favorable accrual adjustment of $13,900 for the year ended in  March 31, 2019.
Additionally, during the three months ended  September 30, 2019, the Company made a payment of $5,646, representing pre-judgement interest, to an escrow account which is classified within "Other assets".
On  September 2, 2014, a subsidiary of AVX, American Technical Ceramics (“ATC”), was named as a defendant in a patent infringement case filed in the United States District Court of the Southern District of California captioned Presidio Components, Inc. v.
Subsequently, on  October 21, 2016, the Federal Circuit Court granted AVX’s request for a stay of the permanent injunction whereby ATC was allowed to continue to sell the disputed product until  March 17, 2017 to anyone who was a customer prior to  June 17, 2016.
During calendar year 2014, AVX was named as a co-defendant in a series of cases filed in the United States and in the Canadian provinces of Quebec, Ontario, British Columbia, Saskatchewan and Manitoba alleging violations of United States, state and Canadian antitrust laws asserting that AVX and numerous other companies were participants in alleged price-fixing in the capacitor market.
Comprehensive income (loss) represents changes in equity during a period except those resulting from investments by and distributions to shareholders.
The specific components include net income, pension liability and other post-retirement benefit adjustments, deferred gains and losses resulting from foreign currency translation adjustments and unrealized gains and losses on qualified foreign currency cash flow hedges.
Amounts reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) into net income include those that pertain to the Company’s pension and postretirement benefit plans and realized gains and losses on derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges.
Please see Note 11 for additional information related to the amortization of prior service cost and the recognized actuarial losses, which amounts are reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) into net income and are included in selling, general and administrative expenses in the statement of operations during the three and six month periods ended  September 30, 2018 and 2019.
Please see Note 12 for additional information related to realized gains and losses on derivative instruments reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) into net income during the three and six month periods ended  September 30, 2018 and 2019.
Based on current actuarial computations, during the six months ended  September 30, 2019, we made contributions of $791 to the international plans.
We made no contributions to the U.S. plans during the six months ended  September 30, 2019.
We use derivative instruments (forward contracts) to hedge certain foreign currency exposures as part of our risk management strategy.
The objective is to offset gains and losses resulting from these exposures with gains and losses on the forward contracts used to hedge them, thereby reducing volatility of earnings or protecting fair values of assets and liabilities.
We primarily use forward contracts, with maturities less than four months, to protect against the foreign currency exchange rate risks inherent in our forecasted transactions related to purchase commitments and sales denominated in various currencies.
For these derivatives designated as cash flow hedging instruments, during the three and six month periods ended  September 30, 2019, net pre-tax gains of $116 and $628, respectively, were recognized in other comprehensive income (loss).
In addition, during the three and six month periods ended  September 30, 2019, net pre-tax losses of $1,026 and $1,418, respectively, were reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) into cost of sales (for hedging purchases), and net pre-tax gains of $531 and $1,224, respectively, were reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) into sales (for hedging sales) in the accompanying statement of operations.
Derivatives not designated as cash flow hedging instruments consist primarily of forwards used to hedge foreign currency balance sheet exposures.
The gains and losses on these foreign currency forward contracts are recognized in other income (loss) in the same period as the remeasurement gains and losses of the related foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities and thus naturally offset these gains and losses.
For these derivatives not designated as cash flow hedging instruments during the three and six month periods ended  September 30, 2019, losses of $716 and $773, respectively, on hedging contracts were recognized in other income (loss), along with the approximately $503 and $780, respectively, in exchange losses that were recognized in other income (loss) in the accompanying statement of operations.
At  March 31, 2019 and  September 30, 2019, we had outstanding foreign exchange contracts with notional amounts totaling $216,555 and $239,603, respectively, denominated primarily in Euros, Czech Korunas, British Pounds, and Japanese Yen.

The decrease in revenue was attributable to lower sales volumes resulting from weaker global market conditions, and reflects a slowdown in the Asian markets resulting from a weaker Chinese economy in addition to reduced automotive manufacturing across all regions.
Additionally, inventory levels in the sales channel remain high, particularly at our distribution customers in the Americas and Europe, contributing to lower overall demand, primarily in the automotive, cellular, and consumer markets.
Sales were unfavorably impacted by approximately $2.1 million as a result of currency movement due to the strengthening of the U.S. Dollar as compared to the Japanese Yen and Euro when compared to the same period last year.
Electronic Components sales decreased $75.6 million, or 22.8% to $256.6 million in the three month period ended September 30, 2019 compared to sales of $332.2 million during the same period last year driven by unfavorable global macro-economic conditions partially offset by increased electronic content in automobiles, global defense spending, and technological advances across a broad range of IoT products.
The decrease is due to lower demand, primarily in Asia, resulting from the slowdown in the Chinese economy, in addition to weaker demand in the distribution channel as distributors realign their inventories to meet current market conditions.
Interconnect, Sensing and Control Devices product sales decreased $3.5 million to $120.6 million in the three month period ended September 30, 2019 compared to $124.1 million during the same period last year.
This decrease is primarily attributable to a decrease of automotive manufacturing across all regions in addition to unfavorable currency movement due to the stronger U.S. Dollar compared to the Euro.
Overall sales decreased as a result of the weaker Chinese economy and weaker automotive markets compared to the same three month period last year.
Sales in the Asian, American, and European markets represented 30%, 28% and 42% of total sales, respectively, for the three month period ended September 30, 2019.
This compares to 32%, 28% and 40% of total sales for the Asian, American, and European regions in the same period last year, respectively.
Our sales to independent electronic distributor customers represented 36% of total sales for the three month period ended September 30, 2019, compared to 43% for the three month period ended September 30, 2018.
Overall, distributor sales activity decreased when compared to the same period last year as inventory remains higher than normal within the distribution channel resulting from the slower global economy and shortened lead times for certain products making distributors reluctant to take on additional inventory particularly in the Americas and Europe.
Such allowance charges were $5.3 million, or 3.9% of gross sales to distributor customers for the three month period ended September 30, 2019, and $7.1 million, or 3.7% of gross sales to distributor customers, for the three month period ended September 30, 2018.

Costs due to currency movement were favorably impacted by $11.4 million when compared to the same period last year.
Selling, general and administrative expenses in the three month period ended September 30, 2019 were $42.1 million, or 11.2% of net sales, compared to $40.8 million, or 8.9% of net sales, in the three month period ended September 30, 2018.
When compared to the same quarter last year, the overall increase in these expenses is primarily due to higher legal fees partially offset by lower selling expenses as a result of the lower sales.
Income from operations was $37.4 million in the three month period ended September 30, 2019 compared to $85.6 million in the three month period ended September 30, 2018.

This compares to 32%, 26% and 42% of total sales for the Asian, American, and European regions in the same period last year, respectively.
Our sales to independent electronic distributor customers represented 37.0% of total sales for the six month period ended September 30, 2019, compared to 41.2% for the six month period ended September 30, 2018.
Overall, distributor sales activity decreased when compared to the same period last year as inventory levels remained high and our distribution customers realign their inventories to meet current market conditions.
Such allowance charges were $10.6 million, or 3.7% of gross sales to distributor customers, for the six month period ended September 30, 2019, and $13.5 million, or 3.6% of gross sales to distributor customers, for the six month period ended September 30, 2018.

Gross profit in the six month period ended September 30, 2019 was 23.1% of sales, or $180.2 million, compared to a gross profit of 25.8% of sales, or $234.8 million, in the six month period ended September 30, 2018.
This overall decrease in dollars and margin percentage is primarily the result of weaker demand for our products from the slower global economy when compared to the same quarter last year.
Costs due to currency movement were favorably impacted by $19.4 million when compared to the same period last year.
Selling, general and administrative expenses in the six month period ended September 30, 2019 were $84.0 million, or 10.8% of net sales, compared to $81.2 million, or 8.9% of net sales, in the six month period ended September 30, 2018.

The provision for income tax for the six month period ended September 30, 2019 was $16.1 million compared to $31.7 million for the six month period ended September 30, 2018.
Our effective tax rate for the six month period ended September 30, 2019 was approximately 15% compared to approximately 18% for the six months ended September 30, 2018.
This decrease in the effective tax rate is due to discrete tax benefits occurring during the six months ended September 30, 2019.
Excluding these adjustments, the effective tax rate would have been approximately 20% for the six months ended September 30, 2019.
As of September 30, 2019, we had a current ratio of 6.0 to 1, $774.5 million of cash, cash equivalents, and investments in securities, $2.4 billion of stockholders’ equity, and no borrowings.
