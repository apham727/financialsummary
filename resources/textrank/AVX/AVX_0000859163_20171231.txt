In  February 2016, FASB issued ASU 2016-02, “Leases.” This guidance changes the requirements for inclusion of certain right-of-use assets and the associated lease liabilities to be included in a statement of financial position.
Regarding finance leases, lessees are required to 1) recognize a right-of-use asset and a lease liability, initially measured at the present value of the lease payments, in the statement of financial position, 2) recognize interest on the lease liability separate from the amortization of the right-of-use asset in the statement of comprehensive income, and 3) classify repayments of the principal portion of the lease liability within financing activities and payments of interest on the lease liability and variable lease payments within operating activities in the statement of cash flows.
Regarding operating leases, lessees are required to 1) recognize a right-of-use asset and a lease liability, initially measured at the present value of the lease payments, in the statement of financial position, 2) recognize a single lease cost, calculated so that the cost of the lease is allocated over the lease term on a generally straight-line basis, and 3) classify all cash payments within operating activities in the statement of cash flows.
This guidance is effective for public companies for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after  December 15, 2018.
In  March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-09, “Compensation — Stock Compensation.” The standard is intended to simplify several areas of accounting for share-based compensation arrangements, including the income tax impact, classification on the statement of cash flows and forfeitures.
The guidance is effective for public companies for annual reporting periods beginning after  December 15, 2016, and interim periods within those annual periods.
The standard became effective for the interim reporting period ending  June 30, 2017 and has not had a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.
In  August 2017, the FASB issued ASU 2017-12, “Derivatives and Hedging.” The standard aims to align the designation and measurement guidance for qualifying hedging relationships and the presentation of hedge results for cash flow and fair value hedge accounting with risk management activities.
The guidance is effective for public companies for annual reporting periods beginning after  December 15, 2018, and interim periods within those annual periods.
During the three and nine month periods ended  December 31, 2016 and 2017, there have been no transfers of assets or liabilities between levels within the fair value hierarchy.
We primarily use forward contracts, with maturities generally less than four months, designated as cash flow hedges, to protect against the foreign currency exchange rate risks inherent in our forecasted transactions related to purchase commitments and sales, denominated in various currencies.
These derivatives are used to offset currency changes in the fair value of the hedged assets and liabilities.
Fair values for all of our derivative financial instruments are valued by adjusting the market spot rate by forward points, based on the date of the contract.
The amortized cost and estimated fair value of held-to-maturity investments at  December 31, 2017, by contractual maturity, are shown below.
We have been identified by the United States Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”), state governmental agencies or other private parties as a potentially responsible party (“PRP”) under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (“CERCLA”), or equivalent state or local laws, for clean-up and response costs associated with certain sites at which remediation is required with respect to prior contamination.
Because CERCLA or such state statutes authorize joint and several liability, the EPA or state regulatory authorities could seek to recover all clean-up costs from any one of the PRPs at a site despite the involvement of other PRPs. At certain sites, financially responsible PRPs other than AVX also are, or have been, involved in site investigation and clean-up activities.
AVX has submitted its proposed remedy, but until the state has approved such proposal, AVX cannot determine if additional groundwater and soil remediation will be required, if substantial material will have to be disposed of offsite, or if additional remediation techniques will be required, any of which could result in a more extensive and costly plan of remediation.
We have a remaining accrual of $14,270 at  December 31, 2017, representing our current estimate of the potential liability related to the remaining performance of environmental remediation actions at the Site and neighboring properties using certain assumptions regarding the plan of remediation.
We had total reserves of approximately $19,181 and $18,773 at  March 31, 2017 and  December 31, 2017, respectively, related to various environmental matters and sites, including those discussed above.
On  September 2, 2014, a subsidiary of AVX, American Technical Ceramics (“ATC”), was named as a defendant in a patent infringement case filed in the United States District Court of the Southern District of California captioned Presidio Components, Inc. v.
During calendar year 2014, AVX was named as a co-defendant in a series of cases filed in the United States and in the Canadian provinces of Quebec, Ontario, British Columbia, Saskatchewan and Manitoba alleging violations of United States, state and Canadian antitrust laws asserting that AVX and numerous other companies were participants in alleged price-fixing in the capacitor market.
Comprehensive income (loss) represents changes in equity during a period except those resulting from investments by and distributions to shareholders.
The specific components include net income, pension liability and other post-retirement benefit adjustments, deferred gains and losses resulting from foreign currency translation adjustments and unrealized gains and losses on qualified foreign currency cash flow hedges.
Amounts reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) into net income (loss) include those that pertain to the Company’s pension and postretirement benefit plans and realized gains and losses on derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges.
Please see Note 11 for additional information related to the amortization of prior service cost and the recognized actuarial losses, which amounts are reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) into net income (loss) and are included in selling, general and administrative expenses in the statement of operations during the three and nine month periods ended  December 31, 2016 and 2017.
Please see Note 12 for additional information related to realized gains and losses on derivative instruments reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) into net income (loss) during the three and nine month periods ended  December 31, 2016 and 2017.
Based on current actuarial computations, during the nine months ended  December 31, 2017, we made contributions of $4,648 to the international plans.
We made $261 in contributions to the U.S. plans during the nine months ended  December 31, 2017.
We use derivative instruments (forward contracts) to hedge certain foreign currency exposures as part of our risk management strategy.
The objective is to offset gains and losses resulting from these exposures with gains and losses on the forward contracts used to hedge them, thereby reducing volatility of earnings or protecting fair values of assets and liabilities.
We primarily use forward contracts, with maturities less than four months, to protect against the foreign currency exchange rate risks inherent in our forecasted transactions related to purchase commitments and sales, denominated in various currencies.
For these derivatives designated as cash flow hedging instruments, during the three and nine month periods ended  December 31, 2017, net pre-tax losses of $(130) and $(943), respectively, were recognized in other comprehensive income.
In addition, during the three and nine month periods ended  December 31, 2017, net pre-tax gains (losses) of $ (805) and $1,608, respectively, were reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) into cost of sales (for hedging purchases), and net pretax gains (losses) of $244 and $(1,774), respectively, were reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) into sales (for hedging sales) in the accompanying statement of operations.
Derivatives not designated as cash flow hedging instruments consist primarily of forwards used to hedge foreign currency balance sheet exposures.
These hedging instruments are used to offset foreign currency changes in the fair values of the underlying assets and liabilities.
The gains and losses on these foreign currency forward contracts are recognized in other income in the same period as the remeasurement gains and losses of the related foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities and thus naturally offset these gains and losses.
For these derivatives not designated as cash flow hedging instruments during the three and nine month periods ended  December 31, 2017, gains (losses) of $101 and $(777), respectively on hedging contracts were recognized in other income, along with the approximately $(1,277) and $(2,601), respectively, in exchange losses that were recognized in other income in the accompanying statement of operations.
At  March 31, 2017 and  December 31, 2017, we had outstanding foreign exchange contracts with notional amounts totaling $193,156 and $182,680, respectively, denominated primarily in Euros, Czech Korunas, British Pounds, and Japanese Yen.
On  February 7, 2018, the Board of Directors of the Company declared a $0.115 dividend per share of common stock with respect to the quarter ended  December 31, 2017.
Our net loss for the three months ended December 31, 2017 was $93.2 million, or $0.55 per share, compared to net income of $35.5 million, or $0.21 per share, for the three months ended December 31, 2016.
Passive Components sales decreased $1.5 million, or 0.6% to $229.5 million in the three month period ended December 31, 2017 compared to sales of $231.0 million during the same period last year.
Sales increases for our Ceramic and Tantalum component groups were due to increased demand for our products across most markets resulting from favorable global market conditions and increased demand for our electronic component products resulting from technological advances across a broad range of IoT products.
These increases were offset by sales decreases in our Advanced component group primarily due to a reduction in sales of certain advanced ceramic capacitors which were the subject of intellectual property litigation whereby our sales of those products generally ended in March of 2017.
KDP and KCD Resale sales decreased $5.7 million, or 7.8%, to $68.2 million in the three month period ended December 31, 2017 compared to $73.9 million during the same period last year.
This decrease is primarily a result of the gradual phase out of KDP and KCD Resale products resulting from the previously announced decision by Kyocera to market its manufactured passive component and interconnect products globally using Kyocera’s sales force rather than continuing to have AVX resell such products starting January 1, 2018.
Income from operations was $45.3 million in the three month period ended December 31, 2017 compared to $50.9 million in the three month period ended December 31, 2016.
The provision for income tax for the three month period ended December 31, 2017 was $140.8 million compared to $16.8 million for the three month period ended December 31, 2016.
On December 22, 2017, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the “Act”) was enacted in the U.S. Among numerous other provisions, the Act reduced the statutory U.S. corporation income tax rate from 35% to 21%, effective January 1, 2018.
This was the primary reason for a change in AVX’s global tax rate estimate for the fiscal year ending March 2018, resulting in a blended estimated global tax rate of 27% for fiscal 2018.
The transition is accompanied by a one-time tax, effective December 31, 2017, on all U.S.-based corporate groups’ accumulated foreign earnings as yet untaxed by the U.S., assessed at a 15.5% rate on all such earnings held in cash or liquid asset positions and at an 8% rate on all other non-liquid asset positions.
This estimated one-time tax was recorded in the results for the quarter ended December 31, 2017, and was approximately $75.6 million, which is payable in installments over an eight-year period beginning in 2018.
Accordingly, in addition to the one-time tax estimate noted above, we also provided for estimated foreign withholding taxes of approximately $13.6 million related to the potential distribution of such foreign earnings.
Other provisions in the Act resulted in an estimated net decrease in the valuation of U.S. net current and deferred tax assets and liabilities of $24.7 million, which is also reflected in this quarter’s tax provision.
In addition, on December 21, 2017, the French Parliament enacted the Finance Law for 2018, which reduces France’s statutory corporate tax rate from its present 33.33% to 25%, in stages over the next five years.
This rate decrease resulted in an estimated net decrease in AVX’s French net deferred tax assets and liabilities of $14.3 million, which is also reflected as a discrete charge in this quarter’s tax provision.
As a result of the factors discussed above, net loss for the three month period ended December 31, 2017 was $93.2 million compared to net income of $35.5 million for the same three month period last year.
Our net loss for the nine months ended December 31, 2017 was $26.9 million, or $0.16 per share, compared to net income of $91.9 million, or $0.55 per share, for the nine months ended December 31, 2016.
Passive Components sales increased $33.3 million, or 5.1% to $689.4 million in the nine month period ended December 31, 2017 compared to sales of $656.1 million during the same nine month period last year.
The increase in Passive Components product sales was driven by increased volume in our Ceramic and Tantalum Components across most markets resulting from favorable global market conditions and increased demand for our electronic component products resulting from technological advances across a broad range of IoT products.
These increases were offset by sales decreases in our Advanced component group primarily due to a reduction in sales of certain advanced ceramic capacitors which were the subject of intellectual property litigation whereby our sales of those products ended in March of 2017.
KDP and KCD Resale sales decreased $4.8 million, or 2.2%, to $212.0 million in the nine month period ended December 31, 2017 compared to $216.8 million during the same period last year.
This decrease is primarily a result of the gradual phase out of KDP and KCD Resale products resulting from the previously announced decision by Kyocera to market its manufactured passive component and interconnect products globally using Kyocera’s sales force rather than continuing to have AVX resell such products starting January 1, 2018.
Our sales to independent electronic distributor customers represented 45.0% of total sales for the nine month period ended December 31, 2017, compared to 45.1% for the nine month period ended December 31, 2016.
Overall, distributor sales activity increased when compared to the same nine month period last year as distributors increased order activity during the past several quarters in response to good end-market demand and extended product delivery lead times during the nine month period ended December 31, 2017.
Such allowance charges were $22.6 million, or 4.5% of gross sales to distributor customers, for the nine month period ended December 31, 2017, and $19.6 million, or 4.4% of gross sales to distributor customers, for the nine month period ended December 31, 2016.
Applications under such programs for the nine month period ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 were approximately $21.9 million and $16.4 million, respectively.
Income from operations was $132.5 million in the nine month period ended December 31, 2017 compared to $118.5 million in the nine month period ended December 31, 2016.
Other income, net was $8.4 million for the nine month period ended December 31, 2017 compared to $9.2 million for the same nine month period last year.
This decrease was primarily due to higher foreign exchange gains resulting from currency fluctuations and a gain on the sale of an idle facility of $1.6 million for the nine month period ended December 31, 2016, partially offset by interest of $2.3 million related to refunded income taxes in the prior quarter ended September 30, 2017.
The provision for income tax expense for the nine month period ended December 31, 2017 was $167.8 million compared to $35.8 million for the nine month period ended December 31, 2016.
On December 22, 2017, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act was enacted in the U.S. Among numerous other provisions, the Act reduced the statutory U.S. corporation income tax rate from 35% to 21%, effective January 1, 2018.
This was the primary reason for a change in AVX’s U.S. global taxable income tax rate estimate for our fiscal year ending March 2018, resulting in a blended estimated statutory global tax rate of 31.5% for fiscal 2018.
The transition is accompanied by a one-time tax, effective December 31, 2017, on all U.S.-based corporate groups’ accumulated foreign earnings as yet untaxed by the U.S., assessed at a 15.5% rate on all such earnings held in cash or liquid asset positions and at an 8% rate on all other non-liquid asset positions.
This estimated one-time tax was recorded in the results for the quarter ended December 31, 2017, and was approximately $75.6 million, which is payable in eight annual installments over an eight-year period beginning in 2018.
Accordingly, in addition to the one-time tax estimate noted above, we also provided for estimated foreign withholding taxes of approximately $13.6 million related to the potential distribution of such foreign earnings.
Other provisions in the Act resulted in an estimated net decrease in the valuation of U.S. net current and deferred tax assets and liabilities of $24.7 million, which is also reflected in this quarter’s tax provision.
In addition, on December 21, 2017, the French Parliament enacted the Finance Law for 2018, which reduces France’s statutory corporate tax rate from its present 33.33% to 25%, in stages over the next five years.
This rate decrease resulted in an estimated net decrease in AVX’s French net deferred tax assets and liabilities of $14.3 million, which is also reflected as a discrete charge in this quarter’s tax provision.
As a result of the factors discussed above, net loss for the nine month period ended December 31, 2017 was $26.9 million compared to net income of $91.9 million for the same nine month period last year.
Kyocera notified AVX pursuant to the Products Supply and Distribution Agreement in December 2016 of its intent, effective January 1, 2018, to market its manufactured passive component and interconnect products globally using Kyocera’s sales force rather than continuing to have AVX resell such products in the Americas, Europe and Asia.
Kyocera will pay commissions to AVX on sales by Kyocera, in the applicable territories, of products designed into customer applications by AVX prior to January 1, 2018 of 2.0% in calendar year 2018, 1.5% in calendar year 2019, and 1.0% in calendar year 2020.
Sales of Kyocera resale products were $68.2 million and $212.0 million and the related operating profit was $4.7 million and $14.0 million for the three and nine month periods ended December 31, 2017.
AVX notified Kyocera pursuant to the Products Supply and Distribution Agreement in February 2017 of its intent, effective April 1, 2018, to market its manufactured products in Japan using AVX’s sales force rather than continuing to have Kyocera resell such products in this territory.
AVX will pay commissions to Kyocera on sales by AVX, in the applicable territory, of products designed into customer applications by Kyocera prior to April 1, 2018 of 2.0% in fiscal year 2019, 1.5% in fiscal year 2020, and 1.0% in fiscal year 2021.
Sales of AVX resale products by Kyocera were $6.3 million and $16.4 million for the three and nine month periods ended December 31, 2017.
In addition, we translate sales and other results denominated in foreign currencies into U.S. Dollars for our financial statements.
Our reported international sales and earnings could be negatively impacted during periods of foreign currency fluctuation compared to the U.S. Dollar.
Purchases of property and equipment were $65.2 million in the nine month period ended December 31, 2017 and $45.6 million in the nine month period ended December 31, 2016.
We have assessed the condition of our financial resources and our current business and believe that, based on our financial condition as of December 31, 2017, cash on hand and cash expected to be generated from operating activities and investment income from cash, cash equivalents, and investments in securities will be sufficient to satisfy our anticipated financing needs for working capital, capital expenditures, environmental clean-up costs, expenses related to ongoing litigation, pension plan funding, research, development, and engineering expenses, the acquisition of Ethertronics, Inc., and dividend payments or stock repurchases to be made during the next twelve months.
We maintain disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”), is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.
As of the end of the period covered in this report, we carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures, as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Exchange Act. Based upon that evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that as of the end of the period covered by this report, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms, and is accumulated and communicated to our management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures.
We did not make any repurchases in the three month period ended December 31, 2017.
