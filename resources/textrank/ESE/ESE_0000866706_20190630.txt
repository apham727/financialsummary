The Company’s results for the three and nine-month periods ended June 30, 2019 are not necessarily indicative of the results for the entire 2019 fiscal year.
On October 1, 2018, we adopted ASU No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (ASC 606).
We adopted ASC 606 using the modified retrospective transition method applied to contracts that were not substantially complete at the end of fiscal year 2018.
We recorded a $4.2 million adjustment to increase retained earnings to reflect the cumulative impact of adopting this standard at the beginning of fiscal year 2019, primarily related to certain long-term contracts our Filtration and Technical Packaging segments have that converted to the cost-to-cost method for revenue recognition.
A reconciliation of the financial statement line items impacted for the three and nine months ended June 30, 2019 under ASC 606 to the prior accounting standards is provided in Note 14.
Revenue is recognized when control of the goods or services promised under the contract is transferred to the customer either at a point in time (e.g., upon delivery) or over time (e.g., as we perform under the contract).
We account for a contract when it has approval and commitment from both parties, the rights and payment terms of the parties are identified, the contract has commercial substance and collectability of consideration is probable.
A performance obligation is a promise to transfer a distinct good or service to a customer and represents the unit of accounting for revenue recognition.
For contracts with multiple performance obligations, the expected consideration, or the transaction price, is allocated to each performance obligation identified in the contract based on the relative standalone selling price of each performance obligation.
Revenue is then recognized for the transaction price allocated to the performance obligation when control of the promised goods or services underlying the performance obligation is transferred.
The Company does not adjust the promised amount of consideration for the effects of significant financing components based on the expectation that the period between when the Company transfers a promised good or service to a customer and when the customer pays for that good or service will be one year or less.
Arrangements with customers that include payment terms extending beyond one year are not significant.
Approximately 52% of the segment’s revenues (approximately 19% of consolidated revenues) are accounted for over time as the product does not have an alternative use and the Company has an enforceable right to payment for costs incurred plus a reasonable margin or the inventory is owned by the customer.
The related contracts are primarily cost-plus or fixed price contracts related to the design, development and manufacture of complex fluid control products, quiet valves, manifolds, shock and vibration dampening, thermal insulation and systems primarily for the commercial aerospace and military (U.S. Government) markets.
The contracts may contain multiple products, which are capable of being distinct as the customer could benefit from each product on its own or together with other readily available resources.
Therefore, each product is distinct in context of the contract and will be accounted for as a separate performance obligation.
Contracts with the U.S. Government generally contain clauses that provide lien rights to work-in-process along with clauses that allow the customer to unilaterally terminate the contract for convenience, pay us for costs incurred plus a reasonable profit and take control of any work-in-process.
Due to the continuous transfer of control to the U.S. Government, we recognize revenue over the time that we perform under the contract.
Selecting the method to measure progress towards completion for the commercial and military contracts requires judgment and is based on the nature of the products or service to be provided.
We generally use the cost-to-cost method to measure progress for our Filtration segment contracts the rate at which costs are incurred to fulfill a contract best depicts the transfer of control to the customer.
Under this measure, the extent of progress towards completion is measured based on the ratio of costs incurred to date to the estimated costs at completion of the performance obligation, and revenue is recorded proportionally as costs are incurred based on an estimated profit margin.
Under the typical payment terms of our long term fixed price contracts, the customer pays us either performance-based or progress payments.
Because of the timing difference of revenue recognition and customer billing, these contracts will often result in revenue recognized in excess of billings and billings in excess of costs incurred, which we present as contract assets and contract liabilities, respectively, in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.
For short term fixed price and cost-type contracts, we are generally paid within a short period of time.
Approximately 75% of the segment’s revenues (approximately 17% of consolidated revenues) are recorded over time as the product does not have an alternative use and the Company has an enforceable right to payment for costs incurred plus a reasonable margin.
The goods and services related to each installed test chamber are not distinct due to the significant amount of integration provided and each installed chamber is accounted for as a single performance obligation.
Selecting the method to measure progress towards completion for these contracts requires judgment and is based on the nature of the products and service to be provided.
We use milestones to measure progress for our Test segment contracts because it best depicts the transfer of control to the customer that occurs as we incur costs on our contracts.
For arrangements that are accounted for under this guidance, the Company estimates profit as the difference between total revenue and total estimated cost of a contract and recognizes these revenues and costs based primarily on contract milestones.
The transaction price for our contracts represents our best estimate of the consideration we will receive and includes assumptions regarding variable consideration as applicable.
Under the typical payment terms of our fixed price contracts, the customer pays us either performance-based or progress payments.
Because of the timing difference of revenue recognition and customer billing, these contracts result in revenue recognized in excess of billings and billings in excess of costs incurred, which we present as contract assets and contract liabilities, respectively, in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.
Approximately 20% of the segment’s revenues (approximately 6% of consolidated revenues) are recognized over time as services are performed.
Selecting the method to measure progress towards completion for these contracts requires judgment and is based on the nature of the products and service to be provided.
We will recognize revenue as a series of distinct services based on each day of providing services (straight-line over the contract term) for our USG segment contracts.
The transaction price for our contracts represents our best estimate of the consideration we will receive and includes assumptions regarding variable consideration as applicable.
Under the typical payment terms of our service contracts, the customer pays us in advance of when services are performed.
Because of the timing difference of revenue recognition and customer payment, which is typically received upon commencement of the contract, these contracts result in deferred revenue, which we present as contract liabilities, in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.
Included in this category, approximately 8% of the segment’s revenues (approximately 2% of consolidated revenues) are recognized based on the terms of the software contract.
For contracts that transfer a software license to the customer, revenue will be recognized at a point in time.
These type of software contracts represent a right to use the software, or a functional license, in which revenue should be recognized upon transfer of the license.
For contracts in software as a service (SaaS) arrangements, revenue will be recognized over time.
We will recognize revenue based on each day of providing access (straight-line over the contract term).
The transaction price for our contracts represent our best estimate of the consideration we will receive and includes assumptions regarding variable consideration as applicable.
Under the typical payment terms of our software contracts, the customer pays us in advance of when services are performed.
Because of the timing difference of revenue recognition and customer payment, these contracts result in deferred revenue, which we present as contract liabilities, in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.
Contract assets arise from contracts when revenue is recognized over time and the amount of revenue recognized, including our estimate of variable consideration that has been included in the transaction price, exceeds the amount billed to the customer.
These amounts are included in contract assets until the right to payment is no longer conditional on events other than the passage of time.
Contract liabilities include deposits, deferred revenue, upfront payments and billings in excess of revenue recognized.
The Company classified $20.9 million as the current portion of long-term debt as of June 30, 2019, as the Company intends to repay this amount within the next twelve month period; however, the Company has no contractual obligation to repay such amount during the next twelve month period.
Income tax expense in the third quarter of 2019 and first nine months of 2019 was also favorably impacted by additional tax benefits on share-based compensation that vested during the quarter decreasing the effective tax rate by 1.8% and 0.7%, respectively.
A non-automatic accounting method change filed with the 2018 tax return was approved by the Internal Revenue Service during the third quarter of 2019 and favorably impacted the third quarter and year-to-date effective tax rate by 1.0% and 0.4%, respectively.
In the first quarter of 2018, the Company recorded a $2.3 million provisional estimate of the income tax effects of the future repatriation of the cumulative earnings of its foreign subsidiaries which unfavorably impacted the year-to-date effective tax rate by 4.7%.
This favorable adjustment, net of the $0.3 million unfavorable impact to the 2017 Domestic Production Deduction, favorably impacted the year-to-date effective tax rate by 1.6%.
A favorable adjustment, net of the $0.3 million unfavorable impact to the 2018 Domestic Production deduction, favorably impacted the third quarter and year-to-date effective tax rate by 2.9% and 1.4%, respectively.
The income tax expense in the third quarter and first nine months of 2018 was favorably impacted by return to provision true-ups decreasing the third quarter and year-to-date effective tax rate by 1.4% and 0.7%, respectively.
Income tax expense in the third quarter and first nine months of 2018 was also favorably impacted by additional tax benefits on share-based compensation that vested during the quarter decreasing the effective tax rate by 1.9% and 0.9%, respectively.
The Company is exposed to market risk related to changes in interest rates and selectively uses derivative financial instruments, including forward contracts and swaps, to manage these risks.
In addition, the Company’s Canadian subsidiary Morgan Schaffer enters into foreign exchange contracts to manage foreign currency risk as a portion of their revenue is denominated in U.S. dollars.
Assets and liabilities related to our contracts with customers are reported on a contract-by-contract basis at the end of each reporting period.
At June 30, 2019, contract assets and liabilities totaled $99.5 million and $53.8 million, respectively.
Upon adoption of ASC 606 on October 1, 2018, contract assets and liabilities related to our contracts with customers were $87 million and $51 million, respectively.
During the first nine months of 2019, we recognized approximately $35 million in revenues that were included in the contract liabilities balance at the adoption date.
These updates require lessees to recognize a lease liability and a lease asset for all leases, including operating leases, with a term greater than 12 months on its balance sheet.
Based upon the analysis and preliminary evaluation of the standard, we estimate the adoption will result in the addition of assets and liabilities of less than $30 million to our consolidated balance sheet, with no significant change to our consolidated statements of operations or cash flows.
There was no significant impact to the Company’s consolidated financial statements as a result of adopting this new standard.
