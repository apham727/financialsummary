The Company’s results for the three and nine-month periods ended June 30, 2018 are not necessarily indicative of the results for the entire 2018 fiscal year.
On March 14, 2018, the Company acquired the assets of Manta Test Systems Inc.
Since the date of acquisition, the operating results for Manta have been included as a product line of Doble Engineering Company within the Company’s USG segment.
Based on the preliminary purchase price allocation, the Company recorded approximately $0.4 million of accounts receivable, $1.1 million of inventory, $0.2 million of property, plant and equipment, $0.4 million of accounts payable and accrued expenses, $3.5 million of goodwill, $1.2 million of tradenames and $3.5 million of amortizable intangible assets consisting of customer relationships with a weighted average life of 13 years.
The Company provides compensation benefits to certain key employees under several share-based plans providing for performance-accelerated restricted shares (restricted shares), and to non-employee directors under a non-employee directors compensation plan.
Compensation expense related to the restricted share awards was $0.9 million and $3.1 million for the three and nine-month periods ended June 30, 2018, respectively, and $1.0 million and $3.3 million for the corresponding periods of 2017.
The Company believes that the presentation of EBIT provides important supplemental information to investors to facilitate comparisons with other companies, many of which use similar non-GAAP financial measures to supplement their GAAP results.
However, the Company’s non-GAAP financial measures may not be comparable to other companies’ non-GAAP financial performance measures.
At June 30, 2018, the Company had approximately $180 million available to borrow under the Credit Facility, and a $250 million increase option subject to lender approval, in addition to $43.3 million cash on hand.
At June 30, 2018, the Company had $262 million of outstanding borrowings under the Credit Facility in addition to outstanding letters of credit of $8.3 million.
The Company classified $20.0 million as the current portion of long-term debt as of June 30, 2018, as the Company intends to repay this amount within the next twelve month period; however, the Company has no contractual obligation to repay such amount during the next twelve month period.
The terms of the facility provide that interest on borrowings may be calculated at a spread over the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) or based on the prime rate, at the Company’s election.
At June 30, 2018, the Company was in compliance with all debt covenants.
SAB 118 allows registrants to record provisional amounts of the income tax effects of the TCJA where the information necessary to complete the accounting under ASC Topic 740 is not available but the amounts are based on reasonable estimates.
The Company expects it will be subject to this tax.
At its January 10, 2018 meeting, the FASB staff indicated that companies should make and disclose a policy election as to whether they will recognize deferred taxes for basis differences expected to reverse as GILTI or whether they will account for GILTI as period costs if and when incurred.
Because there are interpretative questions associated with the approach that involves recognizing deferred taxes, the Company is in the process of evaluating and will make the accounting policy election during the SAB 118 measurement period.
Market risks relating to the Company’s operations result primarily from changes in interest rates and changes in foreign currency exchange rates.
The Company is exposed to market risk related to changes in interest rates and selectively uses derivative financial instruments, including forward contracts and swaps, to manage these risks.
During 2016, the Company entered into several forward contracts to purchase pounds sterling (GBP) to hedge two deferred payments due in connection with the acquisition of Plastique.
During the first quarter of 2018, the Company entered into three interest rate swaps with a notional amount of $150 million to hedge some of its exposure to variability in future LIBOR-based interest payments on variable rate debt.
In addition, the Company’s Canadian subsidiary Morgan Schaffer enters into foreign exchange contracts to manage foreign currency risk as a portion of their revenue is denominated in U.S. dollars.
The Company expects hedging gains or losses to be essentially offset by losses or gains on the related underlying exposures.
For derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges, the gain or loss on the derivative is deferred in accumulated other comprehensive income until recognized in earnings with the underlying hedged item.
The interest rate swaps entered into during the first quarter of 2018 were not designated as cash flow hedges and, therefore, the gain or loss on the derivative is reflected in earnings each period.
·Level 2 – inputs to the valuation methodology include quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets, and inputs that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly, for substantially the full term of the financial instrument.
The Company has estimated the fair value of its financial instruments as of June 30, 2018 and September 30, 2017 using available market information or other appropriate valuation methodologies.
In March 2017, the FASB issued ASU 2017-07, Improving the Presentation of Net Periodic Pension Cost and Net Periodic Postretirement Benefit Cost, which updates ASC 715, Compensation – Retirement Benefits.
This update permits only the service cost component of net periodic pension and postretirement expense to be reported with other compensation costs, while all other components are required to be reported separately in other deductions, outside any subtotal of operating income.
These updates are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, with early adoption permitted, and must be adopted on a retrospective basis.
The updates change presentation only and will not impact the Company’s results of operations.
In August 2017, the FASB issued ASU 2017-12, Targeted Improvements to Accounting for Hedge Activities, which updates ASC 815, Derivatives and Hedging.
This update is intended to amend the hedge accounting model to enable entities to better align the economics of risk management activities and financial reporting.
The updates eliminate the requirement to separately measure and report hedge ineffectiveness and simplify hedge documentation and effectiveness assessment requirements.
These updates are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, with early adoption permitted, and must be adopted using a modified retrospective approach.
These updates are not expected to materially impact the Company’s results of operations.
In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-062, Leases (Topic 842), which, among other things, requires an entity to recognize lease assets and lease liabilities on the balance sheet and disclose key information about leasing arrangements.
The standard is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018 and mandates a modified retrospective transition period for all entities.
The Company is currently assessing the impact of this standard on its consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.
The new standard will be effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, and interim periods within those annual periods.
The Company has selected the cumulative effect method of transition to the new standard.
Because the new standard impacts the Company’s business processes, systems and controls, we developed a project plan to guide the implementation.
This project plan included analyzing the standard’s impact on our contract portfolio, comparing our historical accounting policies and practices to the requirements of the new standard, and identifying differences from applying the requirements of the new standard to our contracts.
The adoption of ASU 2014-09 will have one primary impact on our portfolio of contracts and our Consolidated Financial Statements which is that more of our contracts within our Filtration and Technical Packaging segments will recognize revenue and earnings over time as the work progresses versus at a single point of time.
The Company is currently in the process of finalizing the effect that ASU 2014-09 will have on its consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.
