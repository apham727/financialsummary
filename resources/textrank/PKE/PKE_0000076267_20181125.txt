The Company’s total net sales from continuing operations worldwide in the 13 weeks ended November 25, 2018 increased to $12.9 million from $10.2 million in the 13 weeks ended November 26, 2017.
The Company’s total net sales from continuing operations worldwide in the 39 weeks ended November 25, 2018 increased to $34.5 million from $30.3 million in the 39 weeks ended November 26, 2017.

The decreases in such expenses during the 13 weeks and 39 weeks ended November 25, 2018 were primarily the result of lower payroll, travel and entertainment and stock option expenses.

Interest income decreased 46% and 51%, respectively, for the 13 weeks and 39 weeks ended November 25, 2018 primarily as a result of lower average balances of marketable securities held by the Company in the 13 weeks and 39 weeks ended November 25, 2018, compared to last fiscal year's comparable periods, partially offset by higher weighted average interest rates.

The Company’s net earnings from discontinued operations were higher in the 13 weeks ended November 25, 2018 compared to the 13 weeks ended November 26, 2017 primarily as a result of lower restructuring charges and a gain of $2,945 realized on the sale of its New England Laminates Co., Inc. facility located in Newburgh, New York.
The Company’s net earnings from discontinued operations were higher in the 39-week period ended November 25, 2018 than in last fiscal year’s comparable period, primarily as a result of lower restructuring charges and higher sales, compared to last year’s comparable period, and a one-time litigation expense of $375,000 in the 39-week period ended November 26, 2017.
The restructuring expenses were $61,000 and $231,000 during the 13-week and 39-week periods ended November 25, 2018, respectively, and $360,000 and $4.4 million during the 13-week and 39-week periods ended November 26, 2017, respectively.

This compared to basic and diluted earnings per share from continuing operations of $0.02 and $0.06 in the 13 weeks and 39 weeks ended November 26, 2017, respectively.
