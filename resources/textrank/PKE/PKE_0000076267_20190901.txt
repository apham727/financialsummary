Level 1 inputs are quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the Company has the ability to access at the measurement date.
Certain assets and liabilities of the Company are required to be recorded at fair value on either a recurring or non-recurring basis.
On a recurring basis, the Company records its marketable securities at fair value using Level 1 or Level 2 inputs.
The Company’s non-financial assets measured at fair value on a non-recurring basis include goodwill and any long-lived assets written down to fair value.
To measure fair value of such assets, the Company uses Level 3 inputs consisting of techniques including an income approach and a market approach.
With respect to goodwill, the Company first assesses qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that fair value is less than carrying value.
Renewal options are included in the lease term to the extent the Company is reasonably certain to exercise the option.
The exercise of lease renewal options is at the Company’s sole discretion.
The leases typically contain renewal options for periods ranging from one year to ten years and require the Company to pay real estate taxes and other operating costs.
The latest land lease expiration is 2068 assuming exercise of all applicable renewal options by the Company.
The Company’s existing leases are not subject to any restrictions or covenants which preclude its ability to pay dividends, obtain financing or exercise its available renewal options.
The above payment schedule includes renewal options that the Company is reasonably likely to exercise.
The above payment schedule does not include lease payments of $395 in 2020 and $463 in 2021 for the Company’s idle facility in Fullerton, California that have been accrued on the condensed consolidated balance sheets in accrued liabilities.
