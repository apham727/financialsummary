Level 1 inputs are quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the Company has the ability to access at the measurement date.
The fair value of the Company’s cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable and accrued liabilities approximate their carrying value due to their short-term nature.
Due to the variable interest rates periodically adjusting with the current LIBOR, the carrying value of outstanding borrowings under the Company’s long-term debt approximates its fair value.
Certain assets and liabilities of the Company are required to be recorded at fair value on either a recurring or non-recurring basis.
On a recurring basis, the Company records its marketable securities at fair value using Level 1 or Level 2 inputs.
The Company’s non-financial assets measured at fair value on a non-recurring basis include goodwill and any long-lived assets written down to fair value.
To measure fair value of such assets, the Company uses Level 3 inputs consisting of techniques including an income approach and a market approach.
With respect to goodwill, the Company first assesses qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that fair value is less than carrying value.
The Plan was approved by the Company’s shareholders and provided for the grant of stock options to directors and key employees of the Company.
All options granted under the Plan have exercise prices equal to the fair market value of the underlying common stock of the Company at the time of grant, which, pursuant to the terms of the Plan, is the reported closing price of the common stock on the New York Stock Exchange on the date preceding the date the option is granted.

In the 2004 fiscal year, the Company reduced the book value of the building to zero, and the Company intends to sell it during the 2019 fiscal year.
On  January 8, 2015, the Company announced that its Board of Directors authorized the Company’s purchase, on the open market and in privately negotiated transactions, of up to 1,250,000 shares of its common stock, representing approximately 6% of the Company’s 20,945,634 total outstanding shares as of the close of business on  January 7, 2015.
The Company did not purchase any shares of its common stock during the 13 weeks ended  May 27, 2018 or during the 13 weeks ended  May 28, 2017.
As a result of such evaluations, the Company repatriated $5,750, $135,300 and $6,800 in cash from the Company’s subsidiary in Singapore in the 2019 fiscal year first quarter and in the 2018 and 2017 fiscal years, respectively.
The Company and certain of its subsidiaries have been named by the Environmental Protection Agency (the “EPA”) or a comparable state agency under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (the “Superfund Act”) or similar state law as potentially responsible parties in connection with alleged releases of hazardous substances at three sites.
The insurance carriers which provided general liability insurance coverage to the Company and its subsidiaries for the years during which the Company’s subsidiaries’ waste was disposed at these sites have in the past reimbursed the Company and its subsidiaries for 100% of their legal defense and remediation costs associated with two of these sites.
The total costs incurred by the Company and its subsidiaries in connection with these sites, including legal fees incurred by the Company and its subsidiaries and their assessed share of remediation costs and excluding amounts expected to be reimbursed by insurance carriers, were approximately $1 and $1 during the 13 weeks ended  May 27, 2018 and  May 28, 2017, respectively.
The Company does not record environmental liabilities and related legal expenses for which the Company believes that it and its subsidiaries have general liability insurance coverage for the years during which the Company’s subsidiaries’ waste was disposed at two sites for which certain subsidiaries of the Company have been named as potentially responsible parties.
Pursuant to such general liability insurance coverage, three insurance carriers reimburse the Company and its subsidiaries for 100% of the legal defense and remediation costs associated with the two sites.
The Company has adopted the guidance effective  February 26, 2018, the first day of the 2019 fiscal year, and the adoption of this guidance did not have an impact on its consolidated results of operations, cash flows, financial position or disclosures.
In  February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842), intended to increase transparency and comparability among companies by requiring most leases to be included on the balance sheet and by expanding disclosure requirements, effective for public business entities for fiscal years beginning after  December 15, 2018, including interim periods within those fiscal years (i.e.,  January 1, 2019, for a calendar year entity).
The Company is currently evaluating the impact that this new guidance  may have on its consolidated results of operations, cash flows, financial position and disclosures.
There have been no material changes in the risk factors as previously disclosed in the Company’s Form 10-K Annual Report for the fiscal year ended February 25, 2018.
