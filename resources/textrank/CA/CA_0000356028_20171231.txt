At December 31, 2017 and March 31, 2017, the total amount of restricted cash included in “Other noncurrent assets, net” in the Company’s Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets was approximately $3 million and $1 million, respectively.
ASU 2016-09 was adopted by the Company when effective in the first quarter of fiscal year 2018.
A retrospective method of adoption was required for this change, which resulted in the reclassification of cash outflows of approximately $34 million from operating activities to financing activities within the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows for the nine months ended December 31, 2016.
As permitted by ASU 2016-09, although not material, the Company elected to retrospectively reclassify cash flows related to excess tax benefits on share-based compensation expense as an operating activity within the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows, which were previously presented as a financing activity.
The Company currently plans to adopt Topic 606 in the first quarter of fiscal year 2019 using the modified retrospective method.
While the Company is continuing to determine the full effect of the new standard, it currently anticipates that this standard will have a material effect on its consolidated financial statements and related disclosures, and currently believes the most significant effect relates to the timing of the recognition of its software license revenue.
Specifically, under the new standard, the Company currently expects to recognize license revenue for its Mainframe Solutions and Enterprise Solutions products at the point-in-time the licensed software is transferred to the customer, rather than ratably over the term of the customer contract as required by existing GAAP for most of the Company’s software arrangements.
As a result, a significant portion of the Company’s revenue backlog (i.e., deferred revenue and future billings on committed contracts) relating to the license component of customer contracts at March 31, 2018 under existing GAAP will not be recognized as revenue in future periods but instead will be included as part of the cumulative effect adjustment within retained earnings upon adoption of Topic 606.
Such cumulative effect adjustment will primarily result from (i) the significant reduction in deferred revenue relating to the license component of customer contracts as mentioned above, (ii) the establishment of a significant contract asset related to the Company’s contractual right to consideration for completed performance obligations not yet billed or collected (i.e., license revenue recognized in advance of billings), (iii) the increase in deferred tax liabilities arising from the increase in contract assets, and (iv) the increase in income taxes payable from both the increase in contract assets as a result of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act enacted on December 22, 2017 (the “Tax Act”) and the portion of deferred revenue included in the cumulative effect adjustment that has not been previously included as taxable income on a tax return.
While the Company has not finalized its assessment of the impact arising from the Topic 606 adoption and finalization of the assessment could result in revisions to these estimates, which could be material, the Company currently estimates additional income tax payments in the range of approximately $100 million to $150 million per year over a four-year period, beginning in fiscal year 2019.
The Company currently expects these additional income tax payments will be largely offset by the benefit from the reduced U.S. corporate tax rate enacted by the Tax Act. The Company believes that taken together, the incremental income tax payments resulting from the Topic 606 adoption and enactment of the Tax Act will be approximately $25 million to $50 million, on average, per year for the next four years, beginning in fiscal year 2019.
The Company does not currently expect Topic 606 will have a significant effect on the timing of revenue recognition for its maintenance, Software-as-a-Service and professional services contracts.
The Company is currently evaluating the effect of this requirement on its consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.
ASU 2016-02 will be effective for the Company’s first quarter of fiscal year 2020 and requires the modified retrospective method of adoption.
Although the Company is currently evaluating the timing of adoption and the effect that ASU 2016-02 will have on its consolidated financial statements and related disclosures, the Company currently expects that most of its operating lease commitments will be subject to the new standard and recognized as operating lease liabilities and right-of-use assets upon adoption.
ASU 2016-16 will be effective for the Company’s first quarter of fiscal year 2019 and requires a modified retrospective method of adoption.
The Company does not currently expect the adoption of ASU 2016-16 to have a material effect on its consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.
ASU 2017-04 will be effective for the Company’s first quarter of fiscal year 2021 and requires a prospective method of adoption.
The Company is currently evaluating the timing of adoption and the effect that ASU 2017-04 will have on its consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.
ASU 2017-12 will be effective for the Company’s first quarter of fiscal year 2020 and requires a prospective method of adoption for the amended presentation and disclosure guidance.
The Company is currently evaluating the timing of adoption and the effect that ASU 2017-12 will have on its consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.
The net fair value of these contracts at December 31, 2017 was a net liability of approximately $4 million, of which approximately $8 million is included in “Other current assets” and approximately $12 million is included in “Accrued expenses and other current liabilities” in the Company’s Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet.
The net fair value of these contracts at March 31, 2017 was a net asset of approximately $1 million, of which approximately $2 million is included in “Other current assets” and approximately $1 million is included in “Accrued expenses and other current liabilities” in the Company’s Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet.
For the three months ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively, approximately 2 million shares and 1 million shares of Company common stock underlying restricted stock awards (RSAs) and options to purchase common stock were excluded from the calculation because their effect on income per share was anti-dilutive during the respective periods.
For the nine months ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively, approximately 2 million shares and 2 million shares of Company common stock underlying RSAs and options to purchase common stock were excluded from the calculation because their effect on income per share was anti-dilutive during the respective periods.

A number of important factors could cause actual results or events to differ materially from those indicated by such forward-looking statements, including: the ability to achieve success in the Company’s business strategy by, among other things, ensuring that any new offerings address the needs of a rapidly changing market while not adversely affecting the demand for the Company’s traditional products or the Company’s profitability to an extent greater than anticipated, enabling the Company’s sales force to accelerate growth of sales to new customers and expand sales with existing customers, including sales outside of the Company’s renewal cycle and to a broadening set of purchasers outside of traditional information technology operations (with such growth and expansion at levels sufficient to offset any decline in revenue and/or sales in the Company’s Mainframe Solutions segment and in certain mature product lines in the Company’s Enterprise Solutions segment), effectively managing the strategic shift in the Company’s business model to develop more easily installed software, provide additional Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) offerings and refocus the Company’s professional services and education engagements on those engagements that are connected to new product sales, without affecting the Company’s financial performance to an extent greater than anticipated, and effectively managing the Company’s pricing and other go-to-market strategies, as well as improving the Company’s brand, technology and innovation awareness in the marketplace; the failure to innovate or adapt to technological changes and introduce new software products and services in a timely manner; competition in product and service offerings and pricing; the ability of the Company’s products to remain compatible with ever-changing operating environments, platforms or third party products; global economic factors or political events beyond the Company’s control and other business and legal risks associated with global operations; the failure to expand partner programs and sales of the Company’s solutions by the Company’s partners; the ability to retain and attract qualified professionals; general economic conditions and credit constraints, or unfavorable economic conditions in a particular region, business or industry sector; the ability to successfully integrate acquired companies and products into the Company’s existing business; risks associated with sales to government customers; breaches of the Company’s data center, network and software products, and the IT environments of the Company’s business partners and customers; the ability to adequately manage, evolve and protect the Company’s information systems, infrastructure and processes; the failure to renew license agreement transactions on a satisfactory basis; fluctuations in foreign exchange rates; changes in generally accepted accounting principles, which includes adoption of revenue recognition requirements under Accounting Standards Codification Topic 606; discovery of errors or omissions in the Company’s software products or documentation and potential product liability claims; the failure to protect the Company’s intellectual property rights and source code; access to software licensed from third parties; risks associated with the use of software from open source code sources; third-party claims of intellectual property infringement and/or royalty payments; fluctuations in the number, terms and duration of the Company’s license agreements, as well as the timing of orders from customers and partners; potential tax liabilities; changes in market conditions or the Company’s credit ratings; events or circumstances that would require the Company to record an impairment charge relating to the Company’s goodwill or capitalized software and other intangible assets balances; successful and secure outsourcing of various functions to third parties; and other factors described more fully in this Form 10-Q and the Company’s other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
Excluding our Automic and Veracode acquisitions, Enterprise Solutions new product sales decreased by a percentage in the high single digits primarily due to a decrease in our renewal portfolio, since renewals typically provide an increased opportunity to generate new product sales.
•We expect fiscal 2018 renewal bookings to decrease by a percentage in the high teens compared with fiscal 2017 primarily due to the large system integrator transaction that occurred in the first quarter of fiscal 2017 with an incremental contract value in excess of $475 million.
Our management looks within total bookings at renewal bookings, which we define as bookings attributable to the renewable value of a prior contract (i.e., the maintenance value and, in the case of non-perpetual licenses, the license value), and at total new product sales, which we define as sales of mainframe and enterprise solutions products and mainframe solutions capacity that are new or in addition to sales of products or mainframe solutions capacity previously contracted for by a customer.
Renewal bookings, as we report them, do not include new product or capacity sales or professional services arrangements and are reflected as subscription and maintenance bookings in the period (for which revenue is recognized ratably over the term of the contract).
Total revenue for the third quarter of fiscal 2018 increased compared with the third quarter of fiscal 2017 primarily due to an increase in software fees and other revenue and, to a lesser extent, an increase in subscription and maintenance revenue.

Of these amounts, $318 million resulted from preliminary estimates of the impact of changes in tax law in the United States resulting from the Tax Act. As more fully disclosed in Note A, “Accounting Policies,” within the Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements, upon adoption of Accounting Standard Codification Topic 606 (Topic 606), a significant portion of our revenue backlog (i.e., deferred revenue and future billings on committed contracts) relating to the license component of customer contracts at March 31, 2018 under existing GAAP will not be recognized as revenue in future periods but instead will be included as part of the cumulative effect adjustment within retained earnings upon adoption.

Mainframe Solutions operating margin for the first nine months of fiscal 2018 increased compared with the first nine months of fiscal 2017 primarily due to a decrease in corporate overhead costs and the Mainframe Solutions portion of the litigation settlement costs incurred during the second quarter of fiscal 2017.
Enterprise Solutions revenue for the third quarter and first nine months of fiscal 2018 increased compared with the third quarter and first nine months of fiscal 2017, respectively, primarily due to revenue generated from our Automic and Veracode acquisitions of $62 million and $161 million in the third quarter and first nine months of fiscal 2018, respectively.
The revenue generated from our Automic and Veracode acquisitions for the first nine months of fiscal 2018 was partially offset by a decline in revenue from our Enterprise Solutions products recognized on an upfront basis.

Amounts billed or collected as a result of a single installment for the entire contract value, or a substantial portion of the contract value, rather than being invoiced and collected over the life of the license agreement, are reflected in the liability section of our Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets as “Deferred revenue (billed or collected).” Amounts received from either a customer or a third-party financial institution that are attributable to later years of a license agreement have a positive impact on billings and cash provided by operating activities in the current period.
The 7% decrease in total revenue backlog at December 31, 2017 compared with March 31, 2017 was primarily due to a lower level of bookings during the first nine months of fiscal 2018.
