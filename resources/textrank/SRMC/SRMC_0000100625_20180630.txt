The Company’s FieldServer family of protocol gateways, routers, and network explorers targets facility automation requirements, and is used by original equipment manufacturers (“OEMs”) and system integrators to enable local and remote monitoring and control of assets and facilities.
The FieldServer family of products works with the SMC Cloud portal; a cloud-based service that registers and manages FieldServer products, provides secure remote access to the local web-based applications that run on FieldServer products, and integrates with third-party applications over REST APIs. With more than 200,000 installed gateways supporting over 140 protocols such as BACnet, LonWorks, MODBUS, and XML in commercial and industrial facilities, FieldServer is the industry’s leading multi-protocol gateway brand and is delivered in a variety of form factors appropriate to the asset being interfaced.
The intellectual property in FieldServer products is embodied in the proprietary embedded software that runs on a variety of customized hardware platforms with different connectivity options such as Serial, Ethernet, Wi-Fi, or cellular.
Additionally, the embedded software enables the assets or devices in the facility to securely connect to third-party clouds and to the Company’s own SMC Cloud portal.
The adoption did not have a material impact to the nature and timing of its revenues, condensed statements of operations, condensed statements cash flows and condensed balance sheets.
The Company’s revenues are derived from the sale of FieldServer products, FieldServer products services, Gas Detection and Environment Control products, and Gas Detection and Environment Control products services.
The Company accounts for a contract with a customer when there’s approval and commitment from both parties, the rights of the parties are identified, payment terms are identified, the contract has commercial substance and collectability of consideration is probable.
FieldServer services consist of orders for custom development of protocol drivers.
Generally, customers place orders for FieldServer products concurrently with their order for protocol drivers.
However, if custom development of the protocol driver is required, the product order is not processed until development of the protocol driver is complete.
When development of the driver is complete the customer is notified and can proceed with a FieldServer product.
Revenues for protocol driver development are recognized at a point in time when the control of the product is transferred to the customer generally occurring upon shipment or delivery of the related product that includes the developed protocol drivers (as noted in FieldServer Products above).
Recent accounting pronouncements discussed in the notes to the December 31, 2017 audited financial statements, filed previously with the SEC in our Annual Report on Form 10-K on April 2, 2018, that are required to be adopted during the year ended December 31, 2018, did not have or are not expected to have a significant impact on the Company’s 2018 financial statements.
This ASU will also require disclosures to help investors and other financial statement users better understand the amount and timing of cash flows arising from leases.
The ASU is effective for the Company for the year ending December 31, 2019 and interim reporting periods within that year, and early adoption is permitted.
Management has not yet determined the effect of this ASU on the Company’s financial statements.
In April 2016 and in May 2016, the Company’s Board of Directors and the Company’s shareholders, respectively, approved the Company’s 2016 Equity Incentive Plan (the “2016 Stock Plan”) and reserved a total of (i) 279,680 shares, plus (ii) 2,550,320 shares that remained available for issuance under the 2006 Stock Plan immediately prior to its expiration, plus (iii) any shares subject to stock options or restricted stock granted under the 2006 Stock Plan that, on or after the date the 2016 Stock Plan became effective, expired or otherwise terminated without having been exercised in full, or were forfeited to or repurchased by the Company, with the maximum number of shares to be added to the 2016 Stock Plan pursuant to clauses (ii) and (iii) equal to 2,668,320.
Options granted under our 2006 Stock Plan and 2016 Stock Plan are at the fair market value of our common stock at the grant date, typically vest ratably over four years, and expire ten years from the grant date.
All share-based payments to employees (incentive stock options) are recognized in the financial statements based on their fair values at the date of grant.
The calculated fair value is recognized as expense (net of any capitalization) over the requisite service period, net of estimated forfeitures, using the straight-line method.
The modified prospective method of application requires compensation expense to be recognized in the financial statements for all unvested stock options beginning in the quarter of award.
The cost is based on the grant date fair value of the stock option.
Compensation expense recognized in future periods for share-based compensation will be adjusted for the effects of estimated forfeitures.
For the six-month periods ended June 30, 2018 and 2017, general and administrative expenses included stock-based compensation expense of $93,766 and $165,792, respectively, decreasing the Company’s income and increasing loss before provision for income taxes and resulting from the recognition of compensation expense associated with employee stock options.
There was no material impact on the Company’s basic and diluted net loss per share as a result of recognizing the employee stock-based compensation expense.
The Company did not modify the terms of any previously granted stock options during the six-month periods ended June 30, 2018 and 2017.

Contract liabilities consist of only advance payments, where the Company has unsatisfied performance obligations.
For certain products or services and customer types, payment is required before the products or services are delivered to the customer.
There were no significant changes in estimates during the period that would affect the contract balances.

Our domestic sales are generally made on an open account basis unless specific experience or knowledge of the customer’s potential inability or unwillingness to meet the payment terms dictates secured payments.
Our international sales are generally made based on secure payments, including cash wire advance payments and letters of credit.
International sales are made on open account terms where sufficient historical experience justifies the credit risks involved.
In many of our larger sales, the customers are construction contractors who are in need of our field services to complete their work and obtain payment.
Management’s ability to manage the credit terms and utilize the leverage provided by the clients’ need for our services is critical to the effective application of credit terms and minimization of accounts receivable losses.
