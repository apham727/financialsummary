We believe 2018 will be another year of strong growth and investment, consistent with our Strategy and Capital Allocation Framework, and anticipate that segment net sales will reach approximately $11.3 billion, an increase from prior expectations of $11.0 billion.
In the Optical Communications segment, we expect sales to increase in the high-teen percentage range with organic growth improving by a low-teen percentage range with an additional $200 million from the acquisition of 3M’s Communications Market Division, driven by strong demand from carrier and enterprise network customers.
We are increasing our expectation of sales growth to the mid-teen percentage range in our Environmental Technologies segment, driven by continued strength in automotive product sales, on-going improvements in the heavy-duty diesel market and from the commercial launch of gas-particulate filters.
