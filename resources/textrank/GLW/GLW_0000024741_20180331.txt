In October 2015, Corning announced a strategy and capital allocation framework (the “Framework”) that reflects the Company’s financial and operational strengths, as well as its ongoing commitment to increasing shareholder value.
Corning is concentrating approximately 80% of its research, development and engineering investment and capital spending on a cohesive set of three core technologies, four manufacturing and engineering platforms, and five market-access platforms.
Net sales in the three months ended March 31, 2018 were $2,500 million, compared to $2,375 million in the same period in 2017.
The increase was driven by higher sales in the Optical Communications, Environmental Technologies and Life Sciences segments, up $68 million, $47 million and $22 million, respectively.
The translation impact of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, including the impact of hedges realized in the current quarter, did not materially impact Corning’s consolidated net loss in the three months ended March 31, 2018 when compared to the same period in 2017.
We believe 2018 will be another year of strong growth and investment, consistent with our Strategy and Capital Allocation Framework, and anticipate that segment net sales will grow to approximately $11 billion.
We anticipate Corning’s LCD glass volume will grow faster than the expected LCD glass market growth of mid-single digits, driven by the ramp of our Gen 10.5 facility in China.
In the Optical Communications segment, we expect sales to increase by about 10%, excluding any contribution from the pending acquisition of 3M’s Communications Market Division, driven by strong demand from carrier and enterprise network customers, supported by our planned capacity additions.
We expect sales growth of approximately 10% in our Environmental Technologies segment, driven by continued strength in automotive product sales, on-going improvements in the heavy-duty diesel market and from the commercial launch of gas-particulate filters.
·    An increase of $22 million in the Life Sciences segment, driven by higher sales in North America and China.
Movements in foreign exchange rates impacted Corning’s consolidated net sales in the amount of $87 million in the three months ended March 31, 2018, when compared to the prior year.
·    An increase of $18 million in corporate spending primarily related to new information technology platforms and outside legal fees.
For the three months ended March 31, 2018, research, development and engineering expenses increased by $39 million, or 19%, when compared to the same period last year, driven by higher costs associated with new product launches and our emerging businesses.
As a percentage of sales, these expenses increased slightly in the first quarter, when compared to the same period last year.
Equity in earnings of affiliated companies decreased by $41 million, driven largely by the absence of a $46 million gain recorded in the first quarter of 2017 resulting from the modification of long-term sales agreements with a customer of HSG.
The translation impact of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, including the impact of hedges realized in the current quarter, did not materially impact Corning’s consolidated loss before income taxes in the three months ended March 31, 2018 when compared to the same period in 2017.
For the three months ended March 31, 2018 comprehensive (loss) income decreased by $890 million when compared to the same period in 2017, due to a decrease in net income of $675 million, the negative impact of the change in foreign currency translation gains and losses of $186 million, driven primarily by the Japanese yen and the euro, and a decrease in net unrealized gains of designated hedges of $26 million.
In the three months ended March 31, 2018, we generated core earnings of $299 million or $0.31 per share, compared to core earnings generated in the three months ended March 31, 2017 of $376 million, or $0.36 per share.
The decrease of $77 million was primarily due to lower net income in the Display Technologies and Specialty Materials segments, down $60 million and $11 million, respectively, as well as lower earnings in emerging businesses, down $14 million.
An increase in net income of $8 million in the Environmental Technologies segment partially offset the decrease.
Included in core earnings for the three months ended March 31, 2018 and 2017 is net periodic pension expense in the amounts of $12 million and $13 million, respectively.
Net sales in the Display Technologies segment decreased by $37 million, or 5%, in the first quarter of 2018, when compared to the first quarter of 2017.
The decrease was driven by LCD glass price declines in the high-single digits in percentage terms, partially offset by an increase in volume in the mid-single digits in line with the overall glass market.
Net income decreased by $60 million, or 24%, due to the LCD glass price declines described above and an increase of $12 million in manufacturing costs primarily driven by the impact of the start-up of our facility in Hefei, China.
Net sales in the Optical Communications segment increased by $68 million, or 8%, in the first quarter of 2018, due to higher sales of carrier and enterprise network products, up $49 million and $19 million, respectively.
Net income in the first quarter of 2018 decreased by $1 million, or 1%, driven by costs associated with our planned capacity expansions, plus investments in new customers and technology, offset by the increase in sales described above.
In the second quarter, Optical Communications sales are expected to increase by a low-teens percentage on a year-over-year basis.
Net sales in the Environmental Technologies segment increased $47 million, or 17%, in the first quarter of 2018 when compared to the same period in 2017.
Automotive product sales increased by $22 million, due to market strength in Europe, China and North America, and continued sales growth of gas particulate filters.
Diesel product sales increased $25 million, driven by higher demand for heavy-duty diesel products in North America and Europe.
Movements in foreign exchange rates impacted net sales in the amount of $20 million when compared to the same period in 2017.
Net income in the first quarter of 2018 increased by $8 million, or 18%, driven by the sales increase outlined above and improved manufacturing efficiencies.
Movements in foreign exchange rates impacted net income in the amount of $3 million when compared to the same period in 2017.
In the second quarter, we expect sales to increase in the high-teens in percentage terms.
Net sales in the Life Sciences segment increased by $22 million, or 10%, in the first quarter of 2018 when compared to the same period in 2017, driven by higher sales in North America and China.
Movements in foreign exchange rates impacted net sales in the amount of $9 million in the three months ended March 31, 2018 when compared to the same period in 2017.
Net income in the first quarter of 2018 increased by $3 million, or 13%, driven by the increase in sales described above.
Movements in foreign exchange rates did not materially impact net income in the three months ended March 31, 2018 when compared to the same period in 2017.
Net sales of this segment increased by $14 million, or 39%, in the three months ended March 31, 2018, when compared to the same period in 2017, driven by an increase in sales in our emerging businesses.
The increase in the net loss in the first quarter of $14 million, or 23%, reflects higher losses in our development projects.
There were no significant items that impacted Corning’s financing and capital resources in the three months ended March 31, 2018 and 2017.
On February 7, 2018, Corning’s Board of Directors declared a 16% increase in the Company’s quarterly common stock dividend, which increased the quarterly dividend from $0.155 to $0.18 per share of common stock, beginning with the dividend to be paid in the first quarter of 2018.
During 2017, Corning repurchased 84.4 million shares for approximately $2.4 billion through accelerated share repurchase agreements and open market repurchases under the 2016 Repurchase Program.

Capital spending totaled $655 million and $364 million in the three months ended March 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively.
We expect our 2018 capital expenditures to be slightly more than $2.0 billion, driven by expansions related to the Gen 10.5 glass manufacturing facility, the addition of capacity to support the new gas-particulate filters business in the Environmental Technologies segment and investment to support growth in customer demand in the Optical Communications and Specialty Materials segments.
Net cash provided by operating activities increased by $129 million in the three months ended March 31, 2018 when compared to the same period last year, driven by customer deposits received of $276 million and a decrease of $94 million in accounts receivable in the Specialty Materials segment, partially offset by an increase in payments for variable compensation, a decrease of $34 million in dividends received from affiliated companies and an increase in inventory of $69 million in the Specialty Materials segment.
Net cash used in investing activities increased by $318 million in the three months ended March 31, 2018 when compared to the same period last year, driven by an increase of $291 million in capital expenditures largely due to capacity expansion projects in our Display Technologies and Optical Communications segments.
We are currently party to two interest rate swaps that are designated as fair value hedges and economically exchange a notional amount of $550 million of previously issued fixed rate long-term debt to floating rate debt.
This review considers all of the Company’s precious metals that are either in place in the production process; in reclamation, fabrication, or refinement in anticipation of re-use; or awaiting use to support increased capacity.
