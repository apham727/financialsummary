In October 2015, Corning announced a strategy and capital allocation framework (the “Framework”) that reflects the Company’s financial and operational strengths, as well as its ongoing commitment to increasing shareholder value.
Net sales for the three months ended March 31, 2019 were $2.8 billion, compared to $2.5 billion in the same period in 2018.
The increase was led by the Optical Communications segment, which increased $178 million, due to higher sales of carrier network products in North America, an increase in sales of enterprise network products from growth in hyper-scale data centers and sales from our acquisition of 3M’s Communication Markets Division (“CMD”).
Net sales in the Display Technologies segment increased by $73 million for the three months ended March 31, 2019, with volumes exceeding the display glass market’s growth and more than offsetting price declines.
The Specialty Materials segment net sales increased by $31 million resulting from strong demand for Gorilla Glass and Advanced Optics products.
Net sales for Environmental Technologies increased $40 million driven primarily by sales growth of gas particulate filters.
Life Sciences sales increased by $11 million.
·    Higher segment net income in all our business segments and All Other segment, up $68 million.
Diluted earnings per share increased by $1.27 per share when compared to the first quarter of 2018, driven by the increase in net income described above, coupled with the repurchase of 55.5 million shares of common stock over the last twelve months.
The translation impact of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, related to the impact of hedges realized in the current quarter, did not materially impact Corning’s consolidated net income in the three months ended March 31, 2019 when compared to the same period in 2018.
In the Optical Communications segment, we expect sales to increase approximately ten percent, including the impact of a full year of sales from the acquisition of CMD.

·    An increase of $25 million in the Optical Communications segment, driven largely by the acquisition of CMD in June 2018.
Equity in earnings of affiliated companies decreased by $14 million, driven by the absence of a gain recorded in the first quarter of 2018 resulting from a legal settlement.

For the three months ended March 31, 2019 comprehensive income increased by $667 million when compared to the same period in 2018, due to an increase in net income of $1.1 billion.
The increase in net income was offset by the negative impacts of the change in foreign currency translation gains and losses of $374 million, driven primarily by the Japanese yen and the Korean won, and $53 million related to the adoption of the new standard for reclassification of stranded tax effects in AOCI.
Corning utilizes constant currency reporting for our Display Technologies and Specialty Materials segments for the Japanese yen, South Korean won, Chinese yuan and new Taiwan dollar currencies.
Effective January 1, 2019, Corning also began using constant currency reporting for our Environmental Technologies and Life Sciences segments for the euro, Japanese yen and Chinese yuan.
