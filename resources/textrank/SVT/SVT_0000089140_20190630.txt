The CPG consumer products are marketed throughout the United States and in select foreign markets.
Consumer sales are moderately seasonal.
The CPG also sells knives and tools, principally machetes, bayonets, survival knives and kitchen knives, to various branches of the United States Government which accounted for less than 2% of the Company’s consolidate revenues in the three and six months ended June 30, 2019 and 2018.
The Company’s consolidated revenues from operations increased approximately $3,565,000 or 15.8% for the six month period ended June 30, 2019 when compared to the same period in 2018.
During this period both the ATG and CPG increased commercial shipments by approximately $2,920,000 and $234,000, respectively.
In addition, the ATG increased government shipments by approximately $437,000.
This was partially offset by the CPG government shipments decrease of approximately $26,000.
The Company’s consolidated revenues from operations increased approximately $2,121,000 or 17.8% for the three month period ended June 30, 2019 when compared to the same period in 2018.
During this period both the ATG and CPG increased commercial shipments by approximately $1,642,000 and $293,000, respectively.
In addition, the ATG increased government shipments by approximately $235,000.
This was partially offset by the CPG government shipments decrease of approximately $49,000.
The Company’s consolidated gross margin for the six month period ended June 30, 2019 increased approximately $368,000 or 7.4% when compared to the same period in 2018.
Gross margin increased in the six month period ended June 30, 2019 due to the increase in units shipped of approximately $740,000 at the ATG.
In addition, the increase is due to average prices and mix of product sold of approximately $230,000 at the ATG and approximately $851,000 at the CPG as compared to the same period of 2018.
This is partially offset by a decrease in units shipped of approximately $1,453,000 at the CPG as compared to the same period of 2018.
The Company’s consolidated gross margin for the three month period ended June 30, 2019 increased approximately $345,000 or 11.8% when compared to the same period in 2018.
Net income for the six month period ended June 30, 2019 decreased approximately $226,000.
This decrease is primarily the result of increases in revenue at both the ATG and CPG business segments offset by increases in selling, general and administrative expenses at both business segments.
Net income for the three month period ended June 30, 2019 increased approximately $7,000, when compared to the same periods in 2018.
This increase is primarily the result of increases in revenue at both the ATG and CPG business segments partially offset by increases in selling, general and administrative expenses at both business segments.
The Company generated approximately $638,000 in cash from operations during the six month period ended June 30, 2019 as compared to a usage of cash of approximately $237,000 during the same period in 2018.
Cash was generated primarily through net income of approximately $812,000, adjustments to reconcile net income to net cash of approximately $677,000 and timing of accounts payable of approximately $1,195,000.
The primary use of cash for the Company’s operating activities for the six month period ended June 30, 2019 include working capital requirements, mainly an increase in accounts receivables and inventories of approximately $356,000 and $1,780,000, respectively.
Cash generated and used in operations is consistent with sales volume, customer expectations and competitive pressures.
The Company’s primary generation of cash in its financing and investing activities in the six month period ended June 30, 2019 included approximately $601,000 of proceeds from equipment financing.
This is offset by the usage of cash due to approximately $274,000 of principal payments on long-term debt, approximately $149,000 for the purchase of treasury shares, as well as capital expenditures of approximately $1,140,000 to increase production requirements at the ATG.
The loan term for the equipment covered by the agreement is 60 months.
There was approximately $601,000 outstanding at June 30, 2019 and no balance outstanding at December 31, 2018.
