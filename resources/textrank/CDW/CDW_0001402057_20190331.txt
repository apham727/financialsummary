The Company enters into operating lease contracts, as assessed at contract inception, primarily for real estate, data centers and equipment.
On the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheets, Operating lease assets are included in Operating lease right-of-use assets and Operating lease liabilities are included in Other current liabilities and Operating lease liabilities.
At the lease commencement date, the Company records Operating lease liabilities based on the present value of the future lease payments.
In determining the present value of future lease payments, the Company uses its incremental borrowing rate based on the information available at the commencement date.
For real estate and data center contracts, the Company accounts for the lease and non-lease components as a single lease component.
For certain equipment leases, the Company applies a portfolio approach to account for the right-of-use asset and operating lease liability.
In assessing the lease term, the Company includes options to renew only when it is reasonably certain that it will be exercised; a determination which is at the sole discretion of the Company.
Generally, for leases with an initial term of 12 months or less, the Company has elected to not record a right-of-use asset and lease liability.
For equipment leases used in revenue generating activities, the Company will record a right-of-use asset and lease liability for leases with a term of 12 months or less.
The Company records lease expense on a straight-line basis over the lease term beginning on the commencement date.
The adoption of the standard resulted in the recognition of right-of-use assets and additional lease liabilities of $81 million as of January 1, 2019, mainly related to operating leases for the Company's real estate portfolio.
For additional details regarding the impact to the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheets from adopting this standard, see Note 9 (Leases).

The Company also has a variable rate senior secured asset-based revolving credit facility (the "Revolving Loan") that is denominated in US dollars.
The Revolving Loan is used by the Company for borrowings, issuances of letters of credit and floorplan financing.
As of March 31, 2019, the Revolving Loan had less than $1 million of undrawn letters of credit, $436 million reserved for the floorplan sub-facility and a borrowing base of $1.8 billion, which is based on the amount of eligible inventory and accounts receivable balances as of February 28, 2019.
As of March 31, 2019, the Company could have borrowed up to an additional $938 million under the Revolving Loan.
The CDW UK term loan agreement imposes restrictions on CDW UK's ability to transfer funds to the Company through the payment of dividends, repayment of intercompany loans, advances or subordinated debt that require, among other things, the maintenance of a minimum net leverage ratio.
The Company has operating leases primarily for real estate, data centers and equipment.

These sales have an unfavorable impact on DSO as the receivable is recognized on the Consolidated Balance Sheets on a gross basis while the corresponding sales amount in the Consolidated Statement of Operations is recorded on a net basis.
This also results in a favorable impact on DPO as the payable is recognized on the Consolidated Balance Sheets without a corresponding Cost of sales in the Statement of Operations because the cost paid to the vendor or third-party service provider is recorded as a reduction to Net sales.
Net cash used in investing activities increased by $72 million in the three months ended March 31, 2019 compared to the same period of the prior year.
