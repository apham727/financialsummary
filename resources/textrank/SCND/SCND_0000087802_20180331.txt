The FASB issued this update to increase transparency and comparability among organizations by recognizing lease assets and lease liabilities on the balance sheet and disclosing key information about leasing arrangements.
The updated guidance is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within those fiscal years.
This update provides guidance on how to record eight specific cash flow issues.
This update is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, and interim periods within those fiscal years.
Early adoption is permitted and a retrospective transition method to each period should be presented.
The Company is currently evaluating the effect of this update on its consolidated financial statements.
In November 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-18, “Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230)”, requiring that the statement of cash flows explain the change in the total cash, cash equivalents, and amounts generally described as restricted cash or restricted cash equivalents.
This guidance is effective for fiscal years, and interim reporting periods therein, beginning after December 15, 2017 with early adoption permitted.
The adoption of this ASU had no impact on the Company's Condensed Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.
Accounts receivable of $245,400 was reclassified from current to long-term assets on the balance sheet as of June 30, 2017 to conform to the current period's presentation.
Approximately 53% and 54% of net benchtop laboratory equipment sales (39% and 40% of total revenues) for the three month periods ended March 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively, were derived from the Company’s main product, the Vortex-Genie 2 mixer, excluding accessories.
Approximately 21% of total benchtop laboratory equipment sales (16% of total revenues) were derived from the Torbal Scales Division for both the three months ended March 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively.
For the three months ended March 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively, two customers accounted in the aggregate for approximately 17% and 15% of net sales of the Benchtop Laboratory Equipment Operations (13% and 11% of the Company’s total revenues).
Approximately 51% and 53% of net benchtop laboratory equipment sales (43% and 37% of total revenues) for the nine month periods ended March 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively, were derived from the Company’s main product, the Vortex-Genie 2 mixer, excluding accessories.
Approximately 22% and 23% of total benchtop laboratory equipment sales (19% and 16% of total revenues) were derived from the Torbal Scales Division for the nine months ended March 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively.
For the nine months ended March 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively, two customers accounted in the aggregate for approximately 16% of net sales of the Benchtop Laboratory Equipment Operations (14% and 11% of the Company’s total revenues).
The FASB defines the fair value of financial instruments as the amount that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date.
Fair value measurements do not include transaction costs.
Level 1 - Inputs that are based upon unadjusted quoted prices for identical instruments traded in active markets.
Level 2 - Quoted prices in markets that are not considered to be active or financial instruments for which all significant inputs are observable, either directly or indirectly.
In valuing assets and liabilities, the Company is required to maximize the use of quoted market prices and minimize the use of unobservable inputs.
The Company calculated the fair value of its Level 1 and 2 instruments based on the exchange traded price of similar or identical instruments where available or based on other observable instruments.
The Company has not changed its valuation techniques in measuring the fair value of any financial assets and liabilities during the period.
The fair value of the contingent consideration obligations are based on a probability weighted approach derived from the estimates of earn-out criteria and the probability assessment with respect to the likelihood of achieving those criteria.
The measurement is based on significant inputs that are not observable in the market, therefore, the Company classifies this liability as Level 3 in the following tables.
As of March 31, 2018, estimated future amortization expense related to intangible assets is $60,200 for the remainder of the fiscal year ending June 30, 2018, $185,800 for fiscal 2019, $65,400 for fiscal 2020, $48,000 for fiscal 2021, $27,000 for fiscal 2022, and $12,800 thereafter.

The Company reflected a loss before income tax benefit of $83,900 for the three months ended March 31, 2018 compared to income before tax expense of $82,900 for the three months ended March 31, 2017, primarily due to increase in contingent consideration liability resulting from increased royalty revenues for the Bioprocessing Systems Operations.
The Company reflected a loss before income tax benefit of $374,100 for the nine months ended March 31, 2018 compared to income before income tax expense of $78,200 for the nine months ended March 31, 2017 mainly due to the increase in contingent consideration liability for the Bioprocessing Systems Operations and reduced income from the Catalyst Research Instruments Operations resulting from decreased catalyst research instrument sales.
The results reflected total non-cash amounts for depreciation, amortization and contingent consideration liability adjustments totaling $521,700 and $675,800 for the three and nine month periods ended March 31, 2018 compared to $87,100 and $276,500 for the corressponding three and nine month periods in 2017.
Net revenues for the three months ended March 31, 2018 increased $188,400 (9.9%) to $2,099,300 from $1,910,900 for the three months ended March 31, 2017, reflecting an increase of $297,600 in royalty revenues earned by the Bioprocessing Systems Operations, $139,900 increase in net sales of benchtop laboratory equipment, partially offset by a $249,100 decrease in catalyst research instruments sales due to decreased orders from Original Equipment Manufacturer ("OEM") customers and lack of large orders.
As of March 31, 2018, the order backlog for catalyst research instruments was $1,175,800, all of which is expected to be shipped during fiscal year ending June 30, 2018, compared to $431,200 as of March 31, 2017.
The overall gross profit percentage for the three months ended March 31, 2018 was 36.6% compared to 44.8% for the three months ended March 31, 2017 due to adjustment for increased contingent consideration from increased royalty revenues for the Bioprocessing Systems Operations.
General and administrative expenses increased by $35,100 (8.1%) to $470,200 for the three months ended March 31, 2018 compared to $435,100 for the three months ended March 31, 2017 due to various incremental increases across the three operational segments.

Research and development expenses increased by $45,200 (13.5%) to $379,700 for the nine months ended March 31, 2018 compared to $334,500 for the nine months ended March 31, 2017, primarily due to increased new product development costs incurred by the Benchtop Laboratory Equipment Operations related to the Torbal Scales Division.
Total other income decreased by $7,200 (52.9%) to $6,400 for the nine months ended March 31, 2018 from $13,600 for the nine months ended March 31, 2018 due to a gain on a sale of investment securities last year.
The Company reflected an income tax benefit of $22,600 for the nine months ended March 31, 2018 compared to $16,000 tax expense for the nine months ended March 31, 2017, primarily due to the loss for the period.

The current period reflected increased inventories due to new products and work in process for catalyst research instruments partially offset by an adjustment to the fair value of contingent consideration liability and customer advances.
Net cash used in investing activities was $88,600 for the nine months ended March 31, 2018 compared to $38,600 used during the nine months ended March 31, 2017 principally due to new capital equipment purchased during the current year period by the Benchtop Laboratory Equipment Operations.
The Company used $107,700 in financing activities in the nine months ended March 31, 2018 compared to $199,900 in the nine months ended March 31, 2017, principally because the Company paid a dividend last year, and paid more in contingent consideration in last year’s same period.
Management believes that the Company will be able to meet its cash flow needs during the 12 months ending June 30, 2018 from its available financial resources including its line of credit, its cash and investment securities, and operations.
