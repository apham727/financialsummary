The FASB issued this update to increase transparency and comparability among organizations by recognizing lease assets and lease liabilities on the balance sheet and disclosing key information about leasing arrangements.
The updated guidance is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within those fiscal years.
The Company is currently evaluating the effect of the new standard.
This update is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, and interim periods within those fiscal years.
The Company is currently evaluating the effect of this update on its consolidated financial statements.
In November 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-18, “Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230)”, requiring that the statement of cash flows explain the change in the total cash, cash equivalents, and amounts generally described as restricted cash or restricted cash equivalents.
This guidance is effective for fiscal years, and interim reporting periods therein, beginning after December 15, 2017 with early adoption permitted.
The Company is currently evaluating the impact of the new standard and does not expect the adoption will have a material effect on its consolidated financial statements and disclosures.
Approximately 31% and 55% of net benchtop laboratory equipment sales (48% and 30% of total revenues) for the three month periods ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively, were derived from the Company’s main product, the Vortex-Genie 2 mixer, excluding accessories.
Approximately 12% and 21% of total benchtop laboratory equipment sales (19% and 11% of total revenues) were derived from the Torbal Scales Division for the three months ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively.
Approximately 36% and 52% of net benchtop laboratory equipment sales (46% and 36% of total revenues) for the six month periods ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively, were derived from the Company’s main product, the Vortex-Genie 2 mixer, excluding accessories.
Approximately 16% and 23% of total benchtop laboratory equipment sales (21% and 16% of total revenues) were derived from the Torbal Scales Division for the six months ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively.
For the six months ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively, two customers accounted in the aggregate for approximately 11% and 16% of net sales of the Benchtop Laboratory Equipment Operations (15% and 11% of the Company’s total revenues).
The FASB defines the fair value of financial instruments as the amount that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date.
Level 1 - Inputs that are based upon unadjusted quoted prices for identical instruments traded in active markets.
Level 2 - Quoted prices in markets that are not considered to be active or financial instruments for which all significant inputs are observable, either directly or indirectly.
In valuing assets and liabilities, the Company is required to maximize the use of quoted market prices and minimize the use of unobservable inputs.
The Company calculated the fair value of its Level 1 and 2 instruments based on the exchange traded price of similar or identical instruments where available or based on other observable instruments.
The Company has not changed its valuation techniques in measuring the fair value of any financial assets and liabilities during the period.
The fair value of the contingent consideration obligations are based on a probability weighted approach derived from the estimates of earn-out criteria and the probability assessment with respect to the likelihood of achieving those criteria.
The measurement is based on significant inputs that are not observable in the market, therefore, the Company classifies this liability as Level 3 in the following tables.
Total amortization expense was $61,100 and $76,200 for the three months ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively and $122,200 and $154,100 for the six months ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively.
