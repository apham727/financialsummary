We offer revenue management, customer experience, and digital monetization solutions for every stage of the customer lifecycle so service providers can deliver an outstanding customer experience that adapts to their customers’ rapidly changing demands.
Additionally, during the first quarter of 2019 we generated approximately 86% of our revenues from the Americas region, approximately 10% of our revenues from the Europe, Middle East and Africa region, and approximately 4% of our revenues from the Asia Pacific region.
Revenues for the first quarter of 2019 were $244.8 million, a 21% increase when compared to revenues of $201.7 million for the first quarter of 2018, with the increase mainly attributed to the additional revenues generated from the acquisitions of Forte on October 1, 2018 and Business Ink on February 28, 2018, and the continued growth in our cloud solutions and managed service arrangements.
Operating income for the first quarter of 2019 was $32.1 million, or a 13.1% operating margin percentage, compared to $25.8 million, or a 12.8% operating margin percentage for the first quarter of 2018.
The increase in operating income is primarily a result of the higher revenues generated in the first quarter of 2019, as reflected by our relatively consistent operating margin percentage.
Comcast continues to be our largest client, generating 22% of our total revenues for the first quarter of 2019.
Additionally, under the terms of the agreement, Comcast has the right to exercise an additional one-year renewal option no later than January 1, 2020, to extend the term of the Agreement through June 30, 2021.
Cloud and Related Solutions Revenues.
Cloud and related solutions revenues for the first quarter of 2019 were $219.6 million, a 24% increase when compared to $177.5 million for the first quarter of 2018.
The increase in cloud and related solutions revenues between periods is primarily due to the additional revenues generated from the acquired Business Ink and Forte businesses, discussed above, and to a lesser degree, the execution of and performance under managed services and Ascendon arrangements.
Software and services revenues for the first quarter of 2019 were $13.0 million, a 9% increase when compared to $12.0 million for the first quarter of 2018, with the increase mainly attributed to the timing of work performed and execution of software license agreements.
Cost of Revenues.
Cost of Cloud and Related Solutions (Exclusive of Depreciation).
The cost of cloud and related solutions for the first quarter of 2019 increased 32% to $114.7 million, from $86.9 million for the first quarter of 2018.
This increase can be mainly attributed to the cloud and related solutions expense of the acquired Business Ink and Forte businesses included in our results, to include acquisition amortization, and increased employee-related costs.
Total cloud and related solutions cost as a percentage of cloud and related solutions revenues for the first quarters of 2019 and 2018 were 52.2% and 49.0%, respectively (with the first quarter of 2019 reflective of the transaction fees of $17.1 million).
The cost of software and services for the first quarter of 2019 was $8.8 million, a slight increase from $8.5 million for the first quarter of 2018.
Total software and services cost as a percentage of our software and services revenues for the first quarters of 2019 and 2018 were 67.9% and 71.4%, respectively.
The cost of maintenance for the first quarter of 2019 was $5.5 million, a slight decrease from $5.7 million for the first quarter of 2018.
Total cost of maintenance as a percentage of our maintenance revenues for the first quarters of 2019 and 2018 were 44.8% and 46.2%, respectively.
Depreciation expense for the first quarter of 2019 increased 31% to $5.1 million, from $3.9 million for the first quarter of 2018.
This increase can be primarily attributed to the increased level of capital expenditures we have made over the last twelve months on items such as technology, security, infrastructure, and modernization of equipment, and to a lesser degree, the depreciation expense from the acquired Business Ink and Forte assets.
Operating income for the first quarter of 2019 was $32.1 million, or 13.1% of total revenues, compared to $25.8 million, or 12.8% of total revenues for the first quarter of 2018.
The increase in operating income is a result of the higher revenues generated in the first quarter of 2019, as reflected by our relatively consistent operating margin percentage.
In March 2018, we refinanced our 2015 Credit Agreement, and as a result, we incurred a loss of $0.8 million related to the write-off of unamortized debt issuance costs.
As of March 31, 2019, our principal sources of liquidity included cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments of $141.9 million, as compared to $162.9 million as of December 31, 2018.
As part of our 2018 Credit Agreement, we have a $200 million senior secured revolving loan facility with a syndicate of financial institutions that expires in March 2023.
As of March 31, 2019, we had $3.0 million of cash restricted as to use primarily to collateralize outstanding letters of credit.
Cash flows from operating activities for the first quarters of 2019 and 2018 reflect the negative impacts of the payment of the 2018 and 2017 year-end accrued employee incentive compensation in the first quarter subsequent to the year-end accrual for these items.
Additionally, cash flows from operating activities for the first quarter of 2019 were negatively impacted by the timing around a certain recurring client payment at quarter-end.
Accrued employee compensation decreased $9.6 million to $51.5 million as of March 31, 2019, from $61.1 million as of December 31, 2018, due primarily to the payment of the 2018 employee incentive compensation that was fully accrued at December 31, 2018, offset to a certain degree by the accrual for the 2019 employee incentive compensation.
During the first quarters of 2019 and 2018, we repurchased 0.2 million and 0.1 million shares of our common stock, respectively, under the guidelines of our Stock Repurchase Program for $9.3 million and $5.7 million, respectively.
During the first quarter of 2018, we refinanced our 2015 Credit Agreement and as a result, we repaid the outstanding principal balance of $120.0 million and borrowed $150.0 million under the 2018 Credit Agreement, resulting in a net increase of available cash of $30.0 million.
As of March 31, 2019, we had a $200 million revolving loan facility (2018 Revolver).
As of March 31, 2019, we had no borrowing outstanding on our 2018 Revolver and had the entire $200 million available to us.
During the first quarter of 2019, we repurchased 0.2 million shares of our common stock for $9.3 million (weighted-average price of $37.37 per share).
During the first quarter of 2019, the Board declared dividends totaling $7.4 million.
On October 1, 2018, we acquired Forte, a leading provider of advanced payment solutions headquartered in Allen, Texas for a purchase price of approximately $93 million, (approximately $85 million, excluding cash acquired), and held back approximately $13 million in cash subject to certain tax filings.
The purchase agreement includes provisions for $18.8 million of potential future earn-out payments over a four-year measurement period.
In the first quarter of 2019, we made an additional $4 million investment in a payment technology and services company that enables omni-channel digital payments in Latin America.
As a result, we expect our required debt service cash outlay during the next twelve months for the 2016 Convertible Notes to be limited to interest payments of $9.8 million.
Our 2018 Credit Agreement mandatory repayments and the cash interest expense (based upon current interest rates) for the next twelve months is $7.5 million, and $6.3 million, respectively.
