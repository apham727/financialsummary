From time-to-time, we are involved in litigation relating to claims arising out of our operations in the normal course of business.

We are one of the world’s leading revenue management and digital monetization, customer experience, and payment solutions providers, and a trusted partner to some of the most well-known communications, media, and entertainment companies around the globe.
We offer revenue management, customer experience, and digital monetization solutions for every stage of the customer lifecycle so service providers can deliver an outstanding customer experience that adapts to their customers’ rapidly changing demands.
Additionally, during the nine months ended September 30, 2019 we generated 87% of our revenues from the Americas region, 9% of our revenues from the Europe, Middle East and Africa region, and 4% of our revenues from the Asia Pacific region.
In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842) (“ASC 842”), which requires lessees to recognize a lease liability and a right-of-use asset for all leases, including operating leases, with a term greater than twelve months on its balance sheet.
While the adoption of this standard resulted in a material gross-up of our Balance Sheet assets and liabilities, it did not have a material impact on our Income Statement or Statement of Cash Flows.
Because we control the integrated service provided under our payment services client contracts, these transaction fees are presented gross, and not netted against revenues.
Revenues for the third quarter of 2019 were $251.4 million, an 18% increase when compared to revenues of $213.1 million for the third quarter of 2018, with the increase mainly attributed to the additional revenues generated from the acquisition of Forte on October 1, 2018, and the continued growth in our cloud solutions and managed service arrangements.
The increase in operating income is primarily a result of higher revenues generated in the third quarter of 2019.
As of September 30, 2019, we had cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments of $172.0 million, as compared to $131.5 million as of June 30, 2019 and $162.9 million as of December 31, 2018.
Our cash flows from operating activities for the quarter ended September 30, 2019 were $79.1 million.
A large percentage of our historical revenues have been generated from our two largest clients, which are Comcast and Charter Corporation Inc.
In November 2018, Comcast exercised the first of their two one-year renewal options extending the term of their agreement through June 30, 2020.
Additionally, under the terms of the agreement, Comcast has the right to exercise an additional one-year renewal option no later than January 1, 2020, to extend the term of the Agreement through June 30, 2021.
We continue to transition our focus towards more predictable recurring revenues models with our managed services arrangements and delivery of our cloud-based solutions and away from large transactional software and services deals with related maintenance agreements.
In March 2018, we refinanced our 2015 Credit Agreement, and as a result, we incurred a loss of $0.8 million related to the write-off of unamortized debt issuance costs.
As of September 30, 2019, our principal sources of liquidity included cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments of $172.0 million, as compared to $131.5 million as of June 30, 2019 and $162.9 million as of December 31, 2018.
We generally invest our excess cash balances in low-risk, short-term investments to limit our exposure to market and credit risks.
As part of our 2018 Credit Agreement, we have a $200 million senior secured revolving loan facility with a syndicate of financial institutions that expires in March 2023.
As of September 30, 2019, and the date of this filing, we believe that we are in compliance with the provisions of the 2018 Credit Agreement.
We generally have ready access to substantially all of our cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investment balances, but may face limitations on moving cash out of certain foreign jurisdictions due to currency controls.
As of September 30, 2019, we had $2.8 million of cash restricted as to use primarily to collateralize outstanding letters of credit.
Our financing activities typically consist of activities associated with our common stock and our long-term debt.
During the nine months ended September 30, 2019 and 2018, we repurchased approximately 485,000 and 395,000 shares of our common stock, respectively, under the guidelines of our Stock Repurchase Program for $20.6 million and $16.9 million, respectively, and paid $21.0 million and $16.8 million, respectively, through September 30, 2019 and 2018 (with the differences attributed to the timing of share settlement ).
During the first quarter of 2018, we refinanced our 2015 Credit Agreement and as a result, we repaid the outstanding principal balance of $120.0 million and borrowed $150.0 million under the 2018 Credit Agreement, resulting in a net increase of available cash of $30.0 million.
Operating Cash Flows.
As described in the Liquidity section above, we believe we have the ability to generate strong cash flows to fund our operating activities and act as a source of funds for our capital resource needs.
As of September 30, 2019, we had no borrowing outstanding on our 2018 Revolver and had the entire $200 million available to us.
Our long-term debt obligations are discussed in more detail in Note 4 to our Financial Statements.
During the nine months ended September 30, 2019, we repurchased 0.5 million shares of our common stock for $20.6 million (weighted-average price of $42.37 per share).
During the nine months ended September 30, 2019, the Board declared dividends totaling $22.0 million.
Going forward, we expect to pay cash dividends each year in March, June, September, and December, with the amount and timing subject to the Board’s approval.
On October 1, 2018, we acquired Forte, a leading provider of advanced payment solutions headquartered in Allen, Texas for a purchase price of approximately $93 million, (approximately $85 million, excluding cash acquired), and held back approximately $13 million in cash subject to certain tax filings, which was paid in July 2019.
The purchase agreement includes provisions for $18.8 million of potential future earn-out payments over a four-year measurement period.
In the first quarter of 2019, we made an additional $4 million investment in a payment technology and services company that enables omni-channel digital payments in Latin America.
As of September 30, 2019, we held an 8% noncontrolling interest with a carrying value of $6.6 million.
During the nine months ended September 30, 2019, we spent $27.7 million on capital expenditures.
In 2014, we issued Stock Warrants with an exercise price of $26.68 per warrant to Comcast as an incentive for Comcast to convert new customer accounts to ACP.
Once vested, Comcast may exercise the Stock Warrants and elect either physical delivery of common shares or net share settlement (cashless exercise).
Alternatively, the exercise of the Stock Warrants may be settled with cash based solely on our approval, or if Comcast were to beneficially own or control in excess of 19.99% of our common stock or voting of the Company.
As of September 30, 2019, 1.4 million Stock Warrants are outstanding, of which 0.4 million are vested.
The Stock Warrants are discussed in more detail in Note 8 to our Financial Statements.
As a result, we expect our required debt service cash outlay during the next twelve months for the 2016 Convertible Notes to be limited to interest payments of $9.8 million.
Our 2018 Credit Agreement mandatory repayments and the cash interest expense (based upon current interest rates) for the next twelve months is $9.4 million, and $5.4 million, respectively.

See Note 4 to our Financial Statements for further details of our long-term debt.
We are exposed to market risk associated with cash held on behalf of our clients related to our payment processing services.
As of September 30, 2019 and December 31, 2018, we had $112.8 million and $124.6 million, respectively, of cash collected on behalf of our clients which is held for an established holding period until settlement with the client.
The holding period is generally one to four business days depending on the payment model and contractual terms with the client.
During the holding period, cash is held in accounts with various major financial institutions in the U.S. in an amount equal to at least 100% of the aggregate amount owed to our clients.
The fair value of our convertible debt is exposed to market risk.
We do not carry our convertible debt at fair value but present the fair value for disclosure purposes (see Note 2 to our Financial Statements).
Generally, the fair value of our convertible debt is impacted by changes in interest rates and changes in the price and volatility of our common stock.
As of September 30, 2019, the fair value of the 2016 Convertible Notes was estimated at $261.1 million, using quoted market prices.
