As discussed in Note 2 to our Financial Statements, in January 2018 we adopted ASC 606, a single comprehensive model which supersedes nearly all existing revenue recognition guidance under U.S. GAAP, utilizing the cumulative effect approach.
Investments in client contracts on our Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows have been reclassified to operating activities from investing activities.
As discussed in Note 5 to our Financial Statements, on February 28, 2018 we acquired Business Ink, a multi-channel communications company based in Austin, Texas, for approximately $70 million, excluding acquisition-related expenses.
For the third quarter and nine months ended September 30, 2018, Business Ink contributed cloud and related solutions revenues of $13.9 million and $34.9 million, respectively, and was slightly dilutive to our year-to-date operating results when factoring in acquired amortization expense.
As discussed in Note 5 to our Financial Statements, on October 1, 2018, we acquired Forte, a leading provider of advanced payment solutions headquartered in Allen, Texas.
We acquired Forte for a purchase price of approximately $85 million ($80 million, net of cash acquired), and held back approximately $13 million in cash subject to certain tax filings.
In addition, the stock purchase agreement includes provisions for $18.8 million of potential future earn-out payments over a four-year measurement period.
At this time, for the remainder of 2018 we expect that Forte will contribute approximately $20 million of revenues and be dilutive to our U.S. GAAP operating results, due to acquisition amortization and acquisition-related costs.
Our revenues for the third quarter of 2018 were $213.1 million, a 7% increase when compared to revenues of $199.2 million for the third quarter of 2017, with the increase mainly attributed to the acquisition of Business Ink on February 28, 2018.
Operating income for the third quarter of 2018 was $25.7 million, or a 12.0% operating margin percentage, compared to $28.4 million, or a 14.2% operating margin percentage for the third quarter of 2017, with the decrease in operating margin percentage reflective of costs associated with the integration of Business Ink and the continuation of planned investments aimed at generating future long-term growth in our business.
As of September 30, 2018, we had cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments of $199.3 million, as compared to $186.4 million as of June 30, 2018 and $261.4 million as of as of December 31, 2017.
Our cash flows from operating activities for the quarter ended September 30, 2018 were $47.1 million.
In March 2018, we refinanced our 2015 Credit Agreement (see Note 4 to our Financial Statements).
As of September 30, 2018, our principal sources of liquidity included cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments of $199.3 million, as compared to $186.4 million as of June 30, 2018 and $261.4 million as of as of December 31, 2017.
We generally invest our excess cash balances in low-risk, short-term investments to limit our exposure to market and credit risks.
The 2018 Credit Agreement increased our liquidity and capital resources position by approximately $30 million.
As part of our 2018 Credit Agreement, we have a $200 million senior secured revolving loan facility with a syndicate of financial institutions that expires in March 2023.
Our short-term investments as of September 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017 were $2.1 million and $139.1 million, respectively.
The significant decrease in our short-term investments between periods is due primarily to the acquisition of Business Ink in February 2018 for approximately $70 million and positioning of cash as of September 30, 2018 for the acquisition of Forte, which closed on October 1, 2018 for a purchase price of approximately $85 million (approximately $80 million, net of cash acquired), less approximately $13 million in cash subject to certain tax filings (see Note 5 to our Financial Statements for additional discussion of our acquisitions).
As of September 30, 2018, we had $3.0 million of cash restricted as to use primarily to collateralize outstanding letters of credit.
Cash flows from operating activities for the second quarter of 2018 was negatively impacted primarily by the increase in the accounts receivable balance mainly related to the timing of a recurring payment from a significant client that was delayed and received subsequent to quarter-end.
Other current and non-current assets increased $10.3 million to $49.6 million as of September 30, 2018, from $39.3 million as of December 31, 2017, due primarily to the timing of payments of various prepaid items, mainly, prepaid software and hardware maintenance fees.
Additionally, as illustrated in Note 2 to our Financial Statements, as a result of the application of ASC 606, an additional $10.2 million of client contract costs are now being included in operating activities as changes in other current and non-current assets for the nine months ended September 30, 2018.
As a result of the application of ASC 606, $7.3 million of investments in client contracts have been included in operating activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2018.
During the nine months ended September 30, 2018 and 2017, we repurchased 0.4 million shares of our common stock in each period under the guidelines of our Stock Repurchase Program for $16.8 million and $15.6 million, respectively.
During the first quarter of 2018, we refinanced our 2015 Credit Agreement and as a result, we repaid the outstanding principal balance of $120.0 million and borrowed $150.0 million under the 2018 Credit Agreement, resulting in a net increase of available cash of $30.0 million.
In March 2018, we refinanced our 2015 Credit Agreement and as a result, we repaid the outstanding term loan principal balance of $120.0 million and borrowed $150.0 million, resulting in a net increase in cash of $30 million (the 2018 Credit Agreement).
The 2018 Credit Agreement also includes a $200 million revolving loan facility (2018 Revolver).
As of September 30, 2018, we had no borrowing outstanding on our 2018 Revolver and had the entire $200 million available to us.
Our long-term debt obligations are discussed in more detail in Note 4 to our Financial Statements.
In September 2018, we announced an increase in our planned share repurchases of up to $150 million under our Stock Repurchase Program over the next three years.

During the nine months ended September 30, 2018, the Board declared dividends totaling $21.2 million.
In February 2018, we acquired Business Ink, a privately-held multi-channel business communications company based in Austin, Texas for approximately $70 million.
On October 1, 2018, we acquired Forte, a leading provider of advanced payment solutions headquartered in Allen, Texas for a purchase price of approximately $85 million, (approximately $80 million, net of cash acquired), and held back approximately $13 million in cash subject to certain tax filings.
The purchase agreement includes provisions for $18.8 million of potential future earn-out payments over a four-year measurement period.
During the nine months ended September 30, 2018, we spent $44.0 million on capital expenditures.
As of September 30, 2018, we had committed to purchase approximately $9 million of equipment.
As of September 30, 2018, approximately 1.4 million Stock Warrants are outstanding, of which 0.4 million are vested.
The Stock Warrants are discussed in more detail in Note 10 to our Financial Statements.
As a result, we expect our required debt service cash outlay during the next twelve months for the 2016 Convertible Notes to be limited to interest payments of $9.8 million.
Our 2018 Credit Agreement mandatory repayments and the cash interest expense (based upon current interest rates) for the next twelve months is $7.5 million, and $6.1 million, respectively.
