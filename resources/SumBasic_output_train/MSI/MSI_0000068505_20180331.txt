The reorganization of business accruals at March 31, 2018 were $48 million, of which $39 million relate to employee separation costs that are expected to be paid within one year and $9 million of accruals related primarily to lease termination obligations that are expected to be paid over a number of years.

Operating cash flows in the first quarter of 2018, as compared to the first quarter of 2017, were negatively impacted by the $500 million contribution to our U.S. pension plan, higher incentive payments, higher tax payments and the recovery of financial receivables owed to us in the first quarter of 2017.
To complete the acquisition of Avigilon during the quarter ended March 31, 2018, we entered into a term loan for $400 million and a maturity date of March 26, 2021 (the “Term Loan”).Management believes that these financial instruments should not subject us to undue risk due to foreign exchange movements because gains and losses on these contracts should generally offset gains and losses on the underlying assets, liabilities and transactions.We have made appropriate changes to our internal controls over financial reporting as we have implemented the new system.
