Auto segment revenue decreased 19% from the year-ago quarter, primarily due to the ongoing PND market contraction.
Cost of goods sold increased 7% in absolute dollars compared to the prior year quarter.
The outdoor segment increase in cost of goods sold as a percent of revenue primarily resulted from increased promotional activity during the second quarter of 2018.
The total absolute dollar increase was driven primarily by increased cooperative advertising associated with higher sales.
The auto segment increase as a percent of revenues in the second quarter of 2018 was primarily attributable to accelerated amortization of an intangible asset related to a previous acquisition.
