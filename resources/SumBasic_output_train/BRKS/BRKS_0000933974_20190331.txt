GENEWIZ was acquired during the three months ended December 31, 2018 and therefore the misclassifiation did not impact any other historical periods.
Changes in estimates are recorded in the period in which they occur and become known.
In March 2019, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued ASU 2019-01 “Leases (Topic 842) - Codification Improvements”, which makes targeted changes to lessor accounting and clarifies interim transition disclosure requirements.
The ASU clarifies that companies are exempt from making the interim period transition disclosures required by ASC 250, Accounting Changes and Error Corrections, for the period in which a change in accounting principle is made as a result of adopting ASC 842.
In August 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-14, Disclosure Framework — Changes to the Disclosure Requirements for Defined Benefit Plans, which amends ASC 715 to add, remove, and clarify disclosure requirements related to defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans.
The amendment removes disclosure requirement for accumulated other comprehensive income expected to be recognized over the next year, information about plan assets to be returned to the entity, and the effects of a one-percentage-point change on the assumed health care costs and the effect of this change in rates on service cost, interest cost, and the benefit obligation for postretirement health care benefits.
The guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, and interim periods within those fiscal years.
The new guidance introduces a new "expected loss" impairment model which applies to most financial assets measured at amortized cost and certain other instruments, including trade and other receivables, loans, held-to-maturity debt securities and other financial assets.·    Overview.
