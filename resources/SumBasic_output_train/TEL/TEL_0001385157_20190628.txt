In management’s opinion, the unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements contain all normal recurring adjustments necessary for a fair presentation of interim results.
Our revenues are generated principally from the sale of our products.
Revenue is recognized as performance obligations under the terms of a contract, such as a purchase order with a customer, are satisfied; generally this occurs with the transfer of control.
Since our performance obligations to deliver products are part of contracts that generally have original durations of one year or less, we have elected to use the optional exemption to not disclose the aggregate amount of transaction prices associated with unsatisfied or partially satisfied performance obligations as of June 28, 2019.
We limit our warranty to the replacement or repair of defective parts, or a refund or credit of the price of the defective product.
We do not account for these warranties as separate performance obligations.
We estimate these amounts in the same period revenue is recognized based on the expected value to be provided to customers and reduce revenue accordingly.
