The interim financial statements are unaudited, but reflect all adjustments which are, in the opinion of management, of a normal, recurring nature necessary to provide a fair statement of results for the interim periods presented.
The Company uses a 52- to 53-week fiscal year ending on the Saturday nearest March 31.
The quarters ended December 29, 2018 and December 30, 2017 each consisted of 13 weeks.
The authoritative guidance provides a five-step process for recognizing revenue that depicts the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled, in exchange for those goods or services.
The Company implemented internal controls and certain system functionality to enable the preparation of financial information on adoption.
Previously, revenue was recognized upon reported resale of the product by the distributors to their customers (sell-through) as reduced by actual allowances for distributor price adjustments.
Revenue from software license agreements, software license renewals, and other contracts are recognized at point of sales, whereas previously these were deferred and recognized over the contractual term before the implementation of the authoritative guidance.
Revenue recognition related to the Company's other revenue streams, such as direct customers, remains unchanged.
In January 2016, the FASB issued final authoritative guidance regarding how companies measure equity investments that do not result in consolidation and are not accounted for under the equity method and how they present changes in the fair value of financial liabilities measured under the fair value option that are attributable to their own credit.
The authoritative guidance does not change the guidance for classifying and measuring investments in debt securities and loans.
In October 2016, the FASB issued authoritative guidance on income taxes which eliminates the deferred tax effects of intra-entity asset transfers other than inventory.
As a result, a reporting entity would recognize the tax expense from the sale of an asset in the seller’s tax jurisdiction when the transfer occurs, even though the pre-tax effects of that transaction are eliminated in consolidation.
The authoritative guidance is effective for public business entities in fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017 and requires the adoption be applied on a modified retrospective basis through a cumulative-effect adjustment to retained earnings.
Accordingly, $13.8 million of prepaid taxes associated with prior period intra-entity asset transfers was reclassified to retained earnings.
The new authoritative guidance requires the recognition of assets and liabilities arising from lease transactions on the balance sheet and will also require significant additional disclosures about the amount, timing and uncertainty of cash flows from leases.
Accordingly, a lessee will recognize a lease asset for its right to use the underlying asset and a lease liability for the corresponding lease obligation.
The amendments do not change the existing disclosure requirements in current GAAP.

The reader should not place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements.
The excess of the fair value of purchase consideration over the fair value of these assets acquired and liabilities assumed is recorded as goodwill.
When determining the fair values of assets required and liabilities acquired, management makes significant estimates and assumptions, especially with respect to intangible assets.
Critical estimates in valuing intangible assets include, but are not limited to, expected future cash flows, which includes consideration of future growth and margins, future changes in technology, expected cost and time to develop in-process research and development, brand awareness and discount rates.
