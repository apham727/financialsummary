In 1989, we were formed and incorporated in California.
We maintain a majority-owned subsidiary in Mexico (since 1998) and two divisions in each of Taiwan (since 1997) and China (since 2005).
Our China location also serves as the engineering design support center responsible for arranging pre-production scheduling and mass production runs with joint venture partners for our projects, making component datasheets and test specifications, preparing samples, monitoring quality of shipments and performing failure analysis reports.
Operating results for the interim periods are not necessarily indicative of financial results for the full year.
These unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018.
The new standard will require companies to record most leased assets and liabilities on the balance sheet, and also proposes a dual model for recognizing expense.
Under the new guidance, modification accounting is required only if the fair value, the vesting conditions, or the classification of the award (as equity or liability) changes as a result of the change in terms or conditions.

The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the condensed consolidated financial statements, including the related notes, appearing in Item 1 of Part 1 of this quarterly report on Form 10-Q, as well as our most recent annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018.
References to “Taitron,” the “Company,” “we,” “our” and “us” refer to Taitron Components Incorporated and its wholly owned and majority-owned subsidiaries, unless the context otherwise specifically defines.
Revenue Recognition – Revenue is recognized upon shipment of the products, which is when legal transfer of title occurs and control of the product is transferred to the customer.
The allowance for sales returns and doubtful accounts at June 30, 2019 and December 31, 2018 aggregated $40,000 and $38,000, respectively.
Inventory – Inventory, consisting principally of products held for resale, is recorded at the lower of cost (determined using the first in-first out method) or net realizable value.
In any case, actual amounts could be different from those estimated.
We are primarily focused on supplying ODM products for our OEM customer’s multi-year turn-key projects.
In accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, we have classified inventory as a current asset in our June 30, 2019, condensed consolidated financial statements representing approximately 45% of current assets and 32% of total assets.
The decrease was primarily driven by a decrease of ODM project sales volume.
Gross profit for the second quarter of 2019 was $835,000 versus $979,000 in the comparable period for 2018, and gross margin percentage of net sales was 47.1% in the second quarter of 2019 versus 45.5% in the comparable period for 2018.
The $66,000 increase was primarily driven by an increase in salaries for severance pay incurred during the second quarter of 2019.
Income tax provision was $1,000 for both the second quarter of 2019 and 2018, as we do not expect significant taxable income for the year ending December 31, 2019.
Six Months Ended June 30, 2019 versus Six Months Ended June 30, 2018.
Selling, general and administrative expenses in the six months ended June 30, 2019 totaled $1,146,000 versus $1,110,000 in the comparable period for 2018, an increase of $36,000 or 3.2% over the same period last year.
