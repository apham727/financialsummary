In 1989, we were formed and incorporated in California.
We maintain a majority-owned subsidiary in Mexico (since 1998) and two divisions in each of Taiwan (since 1997) and China (since 2005).
Operating results for the interim periods are not necessarily indicative of financial results for the full year.
These unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018.
In February 2016, the FASB issued a new accounting standard on leasing.
The new standard will require companies to record most leased assets and liabilities on the balance sheet, and also proposes a dual model for recognizing expense.
Under the new guidance, modification accounting is required only if the fair value, the vesting conditions, or the classification of the award (as equity or liability) changes as a result of the change in terms or conditions.
Revenue is recognized at the point at which control of the underlying products are transferred to the customer.

The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the condensed consolidated financial statements, including the related notes, appearing in Item 1 of Part 1 of this quarterly report on Form 10-Q, as well as our most recent annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018.
References to “Taitron,” the “Company,” “we,” “our” and “us” refer to Taitron Components Incorporated and its wholly owned and majority-owned subsidiaries, unless the context otherwise specifically defines.
Revenue Recognition – Revenue is recognized upon shipment of the products, which is when legal transfer of title occurs and control of the product is transferred to the customer.
The allowance for sales returns and doubtful accounts at September 30, 2019 and December 31, 2018 aggregated $40,000 and $38,000, respectively.
Inventory – Inventory, consisting principally of products held for resale, is recorded at the lower of cost (determined using the first in-first out method) or net realizable value.
We had inventory balances in the amount of $4,207,000 and $4,597,000 at September 30, 2019 and December 31, 2018, respectively, which is presented net of valuation allowances of $7,319,000 and $7,189,000, respectively.
In any case, actual amounts could be different from those estimated.
We are primarily focused on supplying ODM products for our OEM customer’s multi-year turn-key projects.
In accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, we have classified inventory as a current asset in our September 30, 2019, condensed consolidated financial statements representing approximately 42% of current assets and 30% of total assets.
The decrease was primarily driven by a decrease of ODM project sales volume.
Gross profit for the third quarter of 2019 was $888,000 versus $846,000 in the comparable period for 2018, and gross margin percentage of net sales was 53.6% in the third quarter of 2019 versus 44.5% in the comparable period for 2018.
The $22,000 increase was primarily driven by an increase in salaries.
Other income for the three months ended September 30, 2019 was primarily derived from the gain on sale of our Mexico property of $160,000 and rental income of excess office space at our headquarters in Valencia, CA.
Income tax provision was $2,000 for both the third quarter of 2019 and 2018, as we do not expect significant taxable income for the year ending December 31, 2019.
