In accordance with ASC 606, Teradyne recognizes revenues, when or as control is transferred to a customer.
Teradyne determines performance obligations by assessing whether the products or services are distinct from the other elements of the contract.
Teradyne considers the amount stated on the face of the purchase order to be the transaction price.
In order to determine the appropriate timing for revenue recognition, Teradyne first determines if the transaction meets any of three criteria for over time recognition.
Teradyne uses input variables such as hours or months utilized or costs incurred to determine the amount of revenue to recognize in a given period.
Input variables are used as they best align consumption with benefit to the customer.
Teradyne has concluded that revenue should be recognized when shipped or delivered based on contractual terms.
In cases where acceptance is not deemed a formality, Teradyne will defer revenue recognition until customer acceptance.
The following table provides information about disaggregated revenue by primary geographical market, major product line and timing of revenue recognition.
Customers have the option to purchase an extended warranty, which extends the warranty period for systems and robots beyond the one-year standard warranty.
