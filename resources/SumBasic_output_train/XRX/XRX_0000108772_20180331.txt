You should read these Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements included in our 2017 Annual Report.
Accordingly, we revised our previously issued consolidated financial statements for the first quarter of 2017.
The effect of the revision on our previously issued financial statements is provided in the tables below.
Amounts throughout the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto have been adjusted to incorporate the revised amounts, where applicable.
On January 1, 2018 we adopted ASU 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (ASC Topic 606), which superseded nearly all existing revenue recognition guidance under U.S. GAAP.
ASC Topic 606 defines a five step process to recognize revenue and requires more judgment and estimates within the revenue recognition process than required under previous U.S. GAAP, including identifying performance obligations in the contract, estimating the amount of variable consideration to include in the transaction price and allocating the transaction price to each separate performance obligation.
We adopted this standard using the modified retrospective method of adoption.
Additionally, the unit of accounting, that is, the identification of performance obligations, is consistent with prior revenue recognition practice.
Accordingly, in 2018 these revenues are now reported as part of Sales.
We generate revenue through the sale of equipment, supplies and maintenance and printing services.
As a result of the application of this practical expedient for the substantial portion of our revenue, the disclosure of the value of unsatisfied performance obligations for our services is not required.
location, revenue is normally recognized when the equipment has been delivered and installed at the customer location.
Revenue from the equipment performance obligation also includes certain analyst training services performed in connection with the installation or delivery of the equipment.

Throughout this document, references to “we,” “our,” the “company,” and “Xerox” refer to Xerox Corporation and its subsidiaries.
This impact is calculated for all countries where the functional currency is the local country currency.
Currency impact can be determined as the difference between actual growth rates and constant currency growth rates.
These additional adjustments and misstatements were to the previously reported net income of Fuji Xerox for the period from 2010 through 2017 and are incremental to the items identified by the IIC noted above.
These incremental adjustments primarily relate to Fuji Xerox’s Asia Pacific subsidiaries and involve improper revenue recognition, including revenue associated with leasing transactions, additional provisions for bad debt allowances and other asset impairments.
These impacts were partially offset by lower equity income from unconsolidated affiliates and higher income taxes.
Operating cash flow from continuing operations for the three months ended March 31, 2018 was $216 million, as compared to $132 million for the prior year period.
Post sale revenue primarily reflects contracted services, equipment maintenance, supplies and financing.
These revenues decreased 0.8%, with a 4.3-percentage point favorable impact from currency.
•Financing revenue is generated from financed equipment sale transactions.
•18% increase in black-and-white multifunction devices, driven largely by higher activity for low-end devices in developing markets.
•16% increase in mid-range color installs, reflecting higher demand for recently launched products.
