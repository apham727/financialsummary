All significant intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.

Furthermore, results of operations can be impacted favorably or unfavorably based on weather patterns, primarily during the Summer and Winter selling seasons.
The excess, if any, of the carrying amount of our investment over our ownership percentage in the underlying net assets of the investee is attributed to certain fair value adjustments with the remaining portion recognized as goodwill.
Certain reclassifications of prior year amounts have been made to conform to the 2018 presentation.
The standard is principle-based and provides a five-step model to determine the measurement of revenue and timing of when it is recognized.
Most prominent among the changes to the standard is the requirement that changes in the fair value of equity investments, with certain exceptions, be recognized through net income rather than other comprehensive income.
A cumulative-effect adjustment captured the previously held unrealized losses of $301 related to our equity investment carried at fair value.
In May 2017, the FASB issued guidance to clarify when to account for a change to the terms or conditions of a share-based payment award as a modification.
In August 2017, the FASB issued guidance to simplify the accounting for hedging derivatives.
In February 2016, the FASB issued guidance on accounting for leases, which requires lessees to recognize most leases on their balance sheets for the rights and obligations created by those leases.
Under this updated standard, an entity should recognize an impairment charge for the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the reporting units fair value, but the loss recognized should not exceed the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit.
We adopted the New Revenue Standard on January 1, 2018 using the modified retrospective approach.
Results for reporting periods beginning on and after January 1, 2018 are presented under the New Revenue Standard, while prior period results have not been adjusted and continue to be reported under the accounting standards in effect for those periods.
We satisfy our performance obligations for services when we render the services within the agreed-upon service period.
