In July 2018, the FASB issued updated guidance that provides an additional transition method of adoption that allows entities to initially apply the standard at the adoption date and recognize a cumulative-effect adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings.
Under this updated standard, an entity should recognize an impairment charge for the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the reporting units fair value, but the loss recognized should not exceed the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit.
Results for reporting periods beginning on and after January 1, 2019 are presented under the New Lease Standard, while prior period results have not been adjusted and continue to be reported under the accounting standards in effect for those periods.
We elected the package of practical expedients not to reassess 1) whether existing contracts contain embedded leases, 2) lease classification for existing leases and 3) whether initial direct costs for existing leases would qualify for capitalization under the New Lease Standard.
We have operating leases for real property, vehicles and equipment and finance leases primarily for vehicles.
Operating leases are included in operating lease right-of-use assets, current portion of long-term obligations, and operating lease liabilities in our consolidated balance sheet.
ROU assets represent our right to use an underlying asset for the lease term, and lease liabilities represent our obligation to make lease payments arising from the lease.
As most of our leases do not provide an implicit rate, we use our incremental borrowing rate based on the information available at commencement dates of the respective leases in determining the present value of the applicable lease payments.
Our leases have remaining lease terms of 1-9 years, some of which include options to extend the leases for up to five years.
Certain real property lease agreements have lease and non-lease components, which are generally accounted for as a single lease component.
