The Company records its allowance for doubtful accounts based upon its assessment of various factors.
The Company assesses property, plant and equipment and intangible assets, which are considered definite-lived assets, for impairment.

This analysis requires significant judgments, including estimation of future cash flows, which is dependent on internal forecasts, estimation of the long-term rate of growth for our business, estimation of the useful life over which cash flows will occur, and determination of our weighted average cost of capital.
