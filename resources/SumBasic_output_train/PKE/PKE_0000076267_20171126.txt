Item 2.
The lower gross profit margin for the 13 weeks ended November 26, 2017 compared to the 13 weeks ended November 27, 2016 was due principally to operating inefficiencies in connection with the consolidation of the Company’s Nelco Products, Inc. and Neltec, Inc. electronics Business Units located in California and Arizona, respectively, partially offset by higher sales of the Company’s aerospace composite materials, structures and assemblies.
The lower gross profit margin for the 39 weeks ended November 26, 2017 compared to the 39 weeks ended November 27, 2016, was principally a result of lower sales and production levels of printed circuit materials products in Asia and North America, duplicate costs in connection with the consolidation of the Company’s Nelco Products, Inc. and Neltec, Inc. electronics Business Units, and the inefficiencies mentioned above, partially offset by higher sales of aerospace materials, structures and assemblies.
In the 13 weeks ended November 26, 2017, the Company’s sales in North America, Asia and Europe were 63%, 28% and 9%, respectively, of the Company’s total net sales worldwide compared to 49%, 41% and 10%, respectively, in the 13 weeks ended November 27, 2016.
The Company’s sales in North America increased 27%, its sales in Asia decreased 32% and its sales in Europe decreased 15% in the 13-week period ended November 26, 2017 compared to the 13-week period ended November 27, 2016, and its sales in North America increased 9%, its sales in Asia decreased 21% and its sales in Europe decreased 10% in the 39-week period ended November 26, 2017 compared to the 39-week period ended November 27, 2016.
The decrease in such expenses during the 39 weeks ended November 26, 2017 was primarily the result of lower payroll, profit sharing and stock option expenses.
During the 39 weeks ended November 26, 2017, selling, general and administrative expenses included the advisory fees mentioned above and a one-time litigation expense of $375,000.
For the reasons set forth above, the Company’s earnings from operations were $801,000 and $867,000, respectively, for the 13 weeks and 39 weeks ended November 26, 2017, which included the aforementioned restructuring charges of $472,000 and $4.7 million, respectively, and the $375,000 litigation expense in the 39-week period, compared to $1.9 million and $7.4 million, respectively, for the 13 weeks and 39 weeks ended November 27, 2016, which included the aforementioned restructuring charges of $113,000 and $206,000, respectively.
