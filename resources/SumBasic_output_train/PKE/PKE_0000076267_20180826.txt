The Company has a limited number of long-term contracts.
Long-term contracts are primarily requirements based and do not guarantee quantities.
The lower gross profit margin from continuing operations for the 13 weeks ended August 26, 2018 compared to the 13 weeks ended August 27, 2017 was principally due to the lower sales in the 13 weeks ended August 26, 2018 compared to the 13 weeks ended August 27, 2017.
Selling, general and administrative expenses from continuing operations included stock option expenses of $199,000 and $400,000, respectively, for the 13 weeks and 26 weeks ended August 26, 2018, compared to stock option expenses of $235,000 and $475,000, respectively, for the 13 weeks and 26 weeks ended August 27, 2017.
Other interest rate options were available to the Company under the agreement.
During the 26 weeks ended August 26, 2018, the Company earned interest income principally from its investments, which consisted primarily of short-term instruments and money market funds.
The Company’s net earnings from discontinued operations were higher in the 26-week period ended August 26, 2018 than in last fiscal year’s comparable period, primarily as a result of lower restructuring charges and higher sales, compared to last year’s comparable period, and a one-time litigation expense of $375,000 in the 26-week period ended August 27, 2017.
During the 2018 fiscal year, the Company consolidated its Nelco Products, Inc. Electronics Business Unit located in Fullerton, California and its Neltec, Inc. Electronics Business Unit located in Tempe, Arizona.
The restructuring expenses were $117,000 and $169,000 during the 13-week and 26-week periods ended August 26, 2018, respectively, and $2.8 million and $4.1 million during the 13-week and 26-week periods ended August 27, 2017, respectively.
The net impact of the tax benefit described above increased basic and diluted earnings per share by $0.04 in each of the 13 weeks and 26 weeks ended August 26, 2018.
Of the $108.3 million of cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities at August 26, 2018, $107.0 million was owned by certain of the Company’s wholly owned foreign subsidiaries.
income taxes payable decreased by 8% at August 26, 2018 compared to February 25, 2018 primarily due to income tax payments made during the 26 weeks ended August 26, 2018.
The decrease in working capital at August 26, 2018 compared to February 25, 2018 was due principally to the decrease in accounts receivable, partially offset by the decrease in accounts payable.
The Company's current ratio (the ratio of current assets to current liabilities) was 32.7 to 1.0 at August 26, 2018 compared to 28.0 to 1.0 at February 25, 2018.
During the 26 weeks ended August 26, 2018, the Company's net earnings, before depreciation and amortization, stock-based compensation, amortization of bond premium and changes in operating assets and liabilities, were $1.6 million.
The Company believes its financial resources will be sufficient, through the 12 months following the filing of this Form 10-Q Quarterly Report and for the foreseeable future thereafter, to provide for continued investment in working capital and property, plant and equipment and for general corporate purposes.
The Company’s financial resources are also available for purchases of the Company's common stock, appropriate acquisitions and other expansions of the Company's business.
The increase in working capital at August 26, 2018 compared to February 25, 2018 was due principally to the increase in inventory levels.
