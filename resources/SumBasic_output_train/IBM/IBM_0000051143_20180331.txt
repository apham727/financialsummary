In June 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued guidance for credit impairment based on an expected loss model rather than an incurred loss model.
The guidance is effective January 1, 2020 with a one year early adoption permitted.
The guidance requires lessees to recognize right-of-use assets and lease liabilities for most leases in the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position.
The guidance makes some changes to lessor accounting, including the elimination of the use of third-party residual value guarantee insurance in the capital lease test, and overall aligns with the new revenue recognition guidance.
There are certain practical expedients that can be elected which the company is currently evaluating for application.
A cross-functional implementation team has been established which is evaluating the lease portfolio, system, process and policy change requirements.
The company is currently planning on electing the package of practical expedients to not reassess prior conclusions related to contracts containing leases, lease classification and initial direct costs and is evaluating the other practical expedients available under the guidance.
Certain equity investments are now measured at fair value with changes recognized in net income.
The amendment also simplified the impairment test of equity investments that lack readily determinable fair value.
The FASB issued guidance on the recognition of revenue from contracts with customers in May 2014 with amendments in 2015 and 2016.

The operating (non-GAAP) gross margin of 43.7 percent decreased 0.7 points.
