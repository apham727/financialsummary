The second quarter of 2019 includes $7.2 million ($12.2 million year-to-date) of non-segment charges, of which $5.7 million ($8.4 million year-to-date) of restructuring charges are primarily related to employee termination costs and $1.5 million ($3.8 million year-to-date) of acquisition related and integration charges are primarily related to the IXYS acquisition.

Operating margins increased from 13.0% in the second quarter of 2018 to 13.2% in the second quarter of 2019 driven by the factors mentioned above.
In addition to the factors impacting comparative results for operating income discussed above, income before taxes was impacted by foreign exchange gains of $3.6 million during the three months ended June 29, 2019 compared to foreign exchange losses of $3.2 million during the three months ended June 30, 2018, and interest income of $1.3 million during  three months ended June 29, 2019 compared to $0.3 million during the three months ended June 30, 2018.

Net sales decreased $18.5 million, or 14.6%, in the second quarter of 2019 compared to the second quarter of 2018 due to decreased volume primarily in the passenger car and automotive sensor businesses and unfavorable changes in foreign exchange rates of $3.3 million.
Net sales decreased $11.4 million, or 4.0%, in the first six months of 2019 compared to the first six months of 2018 primarily due to lower volume in semiconductor business within the Electronics segment, lower volume across all businesses in the Automotive segment, the exit of the Custom business within Industrial segment during the second quarter of 2018 and unfavorable changes in foreign exchange rates of $0.6 million, partially offset by higher volume in the electronics products within the Electronics segment.
