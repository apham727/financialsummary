Founded in 1927, Littelfuse is a global leader in circuit protection products with advancing platforms in power control and sensor technologies, serving customers in the electronics, automotive, and industrial markets.
The increase was primarily driven by the acquisition of IXYS along with higher volume across all three segments.
Net sales in the Industrial segment increased $3.4 million or 14.4% due to volume growth in the power fuse and relay businesses.
The Company recognized net income of $36.0 million, or $1.45 per diluted share, in the first quarter of 2018 compared to net income of $38.9 million, or $1.69 per diluted share in the first quarter of 2017.
IXYS has a broad customer base, serving more than 3,500 customers through its direct salesforce and global distribution partners.
The following table summarizes the Company’s consolidated results of operations for the periods presented.
In addition, there were $0.8 million of restructuring charges related to certain operations in the Electronics segment.
Income before income taxes was $44.6 million, or 10.7% of net sales, for the first quarter of 2018 compared to $47.4 million, or 16.6% of net sales, for the first quarter of 2017.
In addition to the factors impacting comparative results for operating income, income before income taxes was impacted by favorable comparative foreign exchange gains that were partially offset by increased interest expense associated with the increased borrowings for the IXYS acquisition.
