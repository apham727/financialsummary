Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements Under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 (“PSLRA”).
"Risk Factors" of the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 29, 2018.
Founded in 1927, Littelfuse is a global manufacturer of leading technologies in circuit protection, power control and sensing.
Sold in over 150 countries, the Company’s products are found in automotive and commercial vehicles, industrial applications, data and telecommunications, medical devices, consumer electronics and appliances.
For the third quarter of 2019, the Company recognized net sales of $362.0 million compared to $439.2 million in the third quarter of 2018 representing a decrease of $77.2 million, or 17.6%.
The Company recognized net income of $35.6 million, or $1.44 per diluted share, in the third quarter of 2019 compared to net income of $53.5 million, or $2.10 per diluted share in the third quarter of 2018.
The Company continues to take actions to improve its cost structure and drive the synergies from the integration of IXYS.
The Company expects to realize cost savings from the restructuring activities taken during 2019 including the reorganization of certain manufacturing, selling and administrative functions across all segments and the closure of a European manufacturing facility in the automotive sensors business within the Automotive segment.
The following table summarizes the Company’s unaudited condensed consolidated results of operations for the periods presented.
The third quarter of 2019 includes $5.7 million ($17.9 million year-to-date) of non-segment charges, of which $2.5 million ($11.0 million year-to-date) of restructuring charges are primarily related to employee termination costs and other restructuring charges and $3.2 million ($6.9 million year-to-date) of acquisition-related and integration charges are primarily related to the IXYS acquisition and other contemplated acquisitions.
The third quarter of 2018 includes approximately $10.1 million ($75.6 million year-to-date) of charges related to the IXYS acquisition, which include $36.9 million year-to-date of purchase accounting inventory step-up charges previously recorded during the first and second quarters of 2018, $2.4 million ($16.1 million year-to-date) in acquisition-related and integration costs primarily related to legal, accounting and other expenses, $3.1 million ($8.7 million year-to-date) in backlog amortization costs, $4.6 million ($7.3 million year-to-date) of employee termination costs and other restructuring charges, and $4.5 million year-to-date stock compensation expense recognized immediately upon close for converted IXYS options related to prior service periods and $2.1 million year-to-date change in control expense related to IXYS.
In 2018 the IXYS purchase accounting inventory step-up charge of $36.9 million negatively impacted the 2018 gross margin by 2.8%.
Operating margins decreased from 17.4% in the third quarter of 2018 to 13.0% in the third quarter of 2019 driven by the factors mentioned above.
Operating margins increased from 13.2% in the first nine months of 2018 to 13.8% in the first nine months of 2019 driven by lower operating expenses discussed above.
In addition to the factors impacting comparative results for operating income discussed above, income before taxes was primarily impacted by increased foreign exchange losses of $4.0 million during the three months ended September 28, 2019 compared to the three months ended September 29, 2018, unrealized investment gains of $2.0 million associated with our equity investments during the three months ended September 28, 2019 compared to unrealized losses of $2.6 million during the three months ended September 29, 2018, and increased interest income of $1.0 million during  three months ended September 28, 2019 compared to the three months ended September 29, 2018.
The effective tax rate for the 2019 period is lower than the effective tax rate for the 2018 period primarily due to lower taxes in certain non-US jurisdictions , including the impact of a tax holiday in China which was applicable in the 2019 period but not the 2018 period.
Net sales decreased $9.7 million, or 8.5%, in the third quarter of 2019 compared to the third quarter of 2018 due to decreased volume primarily in the passenger car and automotive sensor businesses from a decline in global auto production and unfavorable changes in foreign exchange rates of $1.9 million.
The decrease in net sales was primarily due to lower volume in semiconductor business within the Electronics segment, lower volume in passenger car products and commercial vehicle businesses within the Automotive segment and unfavorable changes in foreign exchange rates of $3.2 million, partially offset by higher volume in electronics products within the Electronics segment and higher volume across all businesses within Industrial segments.
The Company has historically supported its liquidity needs through cash flows from operations.
Management expects that the Company’s (i) current level of cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities, (ii) current and forecasted cash flows from operations, (iii) availability under existing funding arrangements, and (iv) access to capital in the capital markets will provide sufficient funds to support the Company’s operations, capital expenditures, investments, and debt obligations on both a short-term and long-term basis.
In addition, the Company had the ability, from time to time, to increase the size of the Revolving Credit Facility and the Term Loan by up to an additional $150.0 million, in the aggregate, in each case in minimum increments of $25.0 million, subject to certain conditions and the agreement of participating lenders.
Term Loans may be made in up to two advances.
The first advance of $125.0 million occurred on October 13, 2017 and the second advance of $75.0 million occurred on January 16, 2018.
For the Term Loan, the Company is required to make quarterly principal payments of 1.25% of the original term loan ($2.5 million quarterly) through maturity, with the remaining balance due on October 13, 2022.
Outstanding borrowings under the Credit Agreement bear interest, at the Company’s option, at either LIBOR, fixed for interest periods of one, two, three or six-month periods, plus 1.00% to 2.00%, or at the bank’s Base Rate, as defined, plus 0.00% to 1.00%, based upon the Company’s Consolidated Leverage Ratio, as defined.
