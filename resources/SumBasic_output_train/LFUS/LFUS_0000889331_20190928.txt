The following table summarizes the Company’s unaudited condensed consolidated results of operations for the periods presented.
The third quarter of 2019 includes $5.7 million ($17.9 million year-to-date) of non-segment charges, of which $2.5 million ($11.0 million year-to-date) of restructuring charges are primarily related to employee termination costs and other restructuring charges and $3.2 million ($6.9 million year-to-date) of acquisition-related and integration charges are primarily related to the IXYS acquisition and other contemplated acquisitions.
The third quarter of 2018 includes approximately $10.1 million ($75.6 million year-to-date) of charges related to the IXYS acquisition, which include $36.9 million year-to-date of purchase accounting inventory step-up charges previously recorded during the first and second quarters of 2018, $2.4 million ($16.1 million year-to-date) in acquisition-related and integration costs primarily related to legal, accounting and other expenses, $3.1 million ($8.7 million year-to-date) in backlog amortization costs, $4.6 million ($7.3 million year-to-date) of employee termination costs and other restructuring charges, and $4.5 million year-to-date stock compensation expense recognized immediately upon close for converted IXYS options related to prior service periods and $2.1 million year-to-date change in control expense related to IXYS.
In 2018 the IXYS purchase accounting inventory step-up charge of $36.9 million negatively impacted the 2018 gross margin by 2.8%.
Operating margins decreased from 17.4% in the third quarter of 2018 to 13.0% in the third quarter of 2019 driven by the factors mentioned above.
Operating margins increased from 13.2% in the first nine months of 2018 to 13.8% in the first nine months of 2019 driven by lower operating expenses discussed above.
In addition to the factors impacting comparative results for operating income discussed above, income before taxes was primarily impacted by increased foreign exchange losses of $4.0 million during the three months ended September 28, 2019 compared to the three months ended September 29, 2018, unrealized investment gains of $2.0 million associated with our equity investments during the three months ended September 28, 2019 compared to unrealized losses of $2.6 million during the three months ended September 29, 2018, and increased interest income of $1.0 million during  three months ended September 28, 2019 compared to the three months ended September 29, 2018.
The effective tax rate for the 2019 period is lower than the effective tax rate for the 2018 period primarily due to lower taxes in certain non-US jurisdictions , including the impact of a tax holiday in China which was applicable in the 2019 period but not the 2018 period.
Net sales decreased $9.7 million, or 8.5%, in the third quarter of 2019 compared to the third quarter of 2018 due to decreased volume primarily in the passenger car and automotive sensor businesses from a decline in global auto production and unfavorable changes in foreign exchange rates of $1.9 million.The Company’s Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to 1,000,000 shares of the Company’s common stock under a program for the period May 1, 2018 to April 30, 2019 (the "2018 program").
