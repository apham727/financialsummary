The adoption of ASU 2016-09 resulted in the presentation of cash flows for employee taxes paid by withholding shares of restricted stock as a financing activity within the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows, which were previously presented as an operating activity.
In addition, as permitted by ASU 2016-09, the Company elected to continue to estimate forfeitures expected to occur to determine the amount of share-based compensation expense to be recognized in each period.
2016-15 (ASU 2016-15), Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments (Topic 230), which is intended to reduce diversity in practice on how certain cash receipts and cash payments are classified and presented in the statements of cash flows.
ASU 2016-18 requires amounts generally described as restricted cash to be included with cash and cash equivalents when reconciling the beginning-of-period and end-of-period total amounts shown on the statements of cash flows.

The Company has established a cross-functional implementation team consisting of representatives across the organization and a third-party service provider to develop a project plan, including the evaluation of customer contracts across the organization, the development of policies, processes and tools to report financial results, the consideration of new performance measurements, and the implementation and evaluation of the Company’s internal controls over financial reporting that will be necessary under the new standard.
While the Company has not finalized its assessment of the impact arising from the Topic 606 adoption and finalization of the assessment could result in revisions to these estimates, which could be material, the Company currently estimates additional income tax payments in the range of approximately $100 million to $150 million per year over a four-year period, beginning in fiscal year 2019.
Although the Company continues to evaluate the items listed above, it does not currently expect Topic 606 to have a significant effect on its customer billings and cash collections from customer billings.
The Company currently believes that the point-in-time recognition requirement of the new standard will increase the variability of its revenue and overall net income period-to-period.
