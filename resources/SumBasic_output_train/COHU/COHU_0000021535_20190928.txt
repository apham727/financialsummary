Risk Factors.
Cohu acquired Xcerra Corporation (“Xcerra”) on October 1, 2018, at which time Xcerra became a wholly owned subsidiary of Cohu (the “Merger”).
The integration process may disrupt our business and, if implemented ineffectively or delayed, could restrict the realization of the full expected benefits.
Although we have completed the Merger, we have incurred, and will continue to incur, significant transaction costs in connection with the Merger, including restructuring expenses and the payment of certain fees and expenses incurred in connection with the Merger and related financing transactions.
Any delays in implementing such headcount reductions, or increased costs to implement, would materially impact the cost synergies achieved.
Cohu’s ability to utilize Xcerra’s net operating loss and credit carryforwards is severely limited.
These annual limitations will result in the inability of Cohu to utilize a substantial portion of these carryforwards.
However, Cohu cannot give any assurance that the Merger will actually be accretive to Cohu’s earnings per share.
In addition to the uncertainties that underlie any financial forecast, Cohu will account for the Merger as an acquisition under Accounting Standards Codification Topic 805, “Business Combinations,” or “ASC 805”.
The total cost of the Merger will be allocated to the underlying identifiable net tangible and intangible assets and liabilities based on their respective estimated fair values.
That estimate could materially change.
