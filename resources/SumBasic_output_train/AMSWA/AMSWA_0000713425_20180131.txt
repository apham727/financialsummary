We discuss certain factors in greater detail in Business Overview below.
The terms fiscal 2018 and fiscal 2017 refer to our fiscal years ending April 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively.
Corporate capital spending trends and commitments are the primary determinants of the size of the market for business software.
In January 2018, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) provided an update to the World Economic Outlook (WEO) for the 2018 and 2019 world economic growth forecast.
The update noted that, Global economic activity continues to firm up.
Global output is estimated to have grown by 3.7 percent in 2017, which is 0.1 percentage point faster than projected in the fall and  1⁄2 percentage point higher than in 2016.
The pickup in growth has been broad based, with notable upside surprises in Europe and Asia.
Overall information technology spending is improving as a result of the current global economic environment.
We believe information technology spending will incrementally improve over the long term as increased global competition forces companies to improve productivity by upgrading their technology systems.
Customers continue to take long periods to evaluate discretionary software purchases.
We believe the improvement in economic conditions may be driving some businesses to invest in achieving more process and efficiency enhancements in their operations and to invest in solutions that improve operating margins, rather than make large infrastructure-type technology purchases.
We provide our software solutions through three major business segments, which are further broken down into a total of six major product and service groups.
The SCM segment, consists of Logility, which provides supply chain optimization and advance retail planning solutions, as an integrated suite of sales and operations planning, demand optimization, inventory optimization, manufacturing planning and scheduling, supply optimization, retail allocation and merchandise planning and transportation optimization, as well as (i) DMI, which provides collaborative supply chain solutions to streamline and optimize the forecasting, inventory, production, supply, allocation, distribution and management of products between trading partners, (ii) New Generation Computing (NGC), which provides cloud solutions for supply chain management, product lifecycle management, quality control, vendor compliance and enterprise resource planning for both retailers and manufacturers in the apparel, sewn products and furniture industries, and, (iii) Halo, which provides advanced analytics and business intelligence solutions for the supply chain market.
