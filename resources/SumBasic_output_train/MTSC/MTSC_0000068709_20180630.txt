As a result, we recorded $739 and $1,340 of pre-tax restructuring expense in the three and nine months ended June 30, 2018, respectively.
See Note 16 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 1 of Part I of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for additional information on restructuring and related costs.
Test revenue decreased $8,304 primarily driven by a decline in equipment volume resulting from weakness in the ground vehicles sector that continues to operate in a rapidly changing environment.
Excluding the impact of currency translation, the prior year PCB acquisition inventory adjustment, prior year PCB acquisition integration expenses, and restructuring costs incurred in both fiscal years, gross profit declined 5.4% and the gross margin rate declined 0.5 percentage points.
Income from operations for the nine months ended June 30, 2018 increased 16.7% primarily driven by leverage on volume growth in Sensors, prior year China investigation expenses of $8,980, prior year impact from the PCB acquisition inventory adjustment of $7,975, and prior year non-recurring PCB acquisition integration expenses of $2,955.
The increase was partially offset by the lower gross margin contribution from product mix, unfavorable leverage on lower Test revenue volume, and an increase in professional fees.
General and administrative expense for the three months ended June 30, 2018 increased 7.0% primarily due to increased professional fees and the unfavorable impact of currency translation.
The decrease was partially offset by cost containment measures.
Excluding the impact of currency translation, revenue increased 10.7% and 10.3%, respectively.
