There is a concerted effort underway to optimize our portfolio of solutions and integrate powerful capabilities — such as built in data, analytics, artificial intelligence, payment processing and tailored user-specific experiences — to bring even greater value and performance to our customers.
We recently introduced Blackbaud Grantmaking™, our newest and most comprehensive grants management solution.
Our next generation cloud offering for grantmaking evolves the experience previously available with a product we acquired with MicroEdge called GIFTS Online®.
We also recently announced the integration of AcademicWorks® with our Blackbaud SKY powered solutions, bolstering our customers' ability to grant and manage scholarships.
Donors funding scholarships, for example, will now have improved visibility given the integration with our digital marketing solutions.
This saves our customers time through automation, and provides them with a more robust set of tools to better enable their organizations for success.
Our focus is on driving improved productivity within our existing salesforce through common procedures, training, key operating metrics, compensation plans, and reporting.
