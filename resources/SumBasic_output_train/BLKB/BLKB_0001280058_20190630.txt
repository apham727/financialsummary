The early adopter program for our Cloud Solution for Faith Communities is on track and we expect to soon announce the general availability of Blackbaud Church Management™.
We’ve spent a considerable amount of time working with churches to fully understand their processes and workflows to gain additional insight into the capabilities they need to be successful, and we continue to incorporate that feedback to optimize our platform specifically for their needs.
We have heard from our early adopter customers that our solution stands out as intuitive and easy-to-use with a mobile responsive user experience.
Churches can also add other Blackbaud capabilities from the Cloud Solution for Faith Communities as their needs scale—all through one integrated experience, which is powered by the Blackbaud SKY platform.
Bringing this solution to market is a significant step toward addressing several challenges in the church market and a substantial opportunity for Blackbaud.
We're excited about the opportunity to disrupt the market landscape by providing this peer-to-peer solution, which is fully integrated across our portfolio of best-in-class cloud solutions.
The market response to this new solution has been positive, with a growing number of customers going live with active campaigns.
