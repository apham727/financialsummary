1.Delight Customers with Innovative Cloud Solutions This strategy reflects our relentless focus on driving value and outcomes for our customers through our solutions.
Our Blackbaud SKY™ platform is a core tenant of this strategy and continues to power an elevated level of innovation by our engineers.
It is also enabling our growing ecosystem of partners who are also passionate about social good, to create new capabilities that often look and feel like Blackbaud-built capabilities.
Among the many product and innovation updates across all of our vertical markets, we recently announced the general availability of Blackbaud Church Management™, which is already transforming the church technology landscape.

Bringing this solution to market is a significant step toward addressing several challenges in the church market and a substantial opportunity for Blackbaud.

Our early adopter customers have a significant role in shaping our new solutions and our SKY platform enables us to rapidly iterate based on their feedback before releasing the solutions to the market.
