In February 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued Accounting Standards Update ("ASU") No.
The difference between the initial right of use asset and lease liability balances recognized upon adoption of ASC Topic 842 is primarily due to accrued lease incentive balances at December 31, 2018.
On December 20, 2018, the Company received sale proceeds of $45,500 and concurrently leased-back its former manufacturing site in Santa Clara, California, under a short-term arrangement, to raze the buildings.
The transactions did not qualify as a completed sale and leaseback under previous GAAP.

The MD&A should be read in conjunction with our Consolidated Condensed Financial Statements and accompanying Notes included in Item 1.
"Risk Factors," filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on February 15, 2019.
Since 1985, we have pursued a business strategy of growth through focused research and development and acquisitions.
Through this strategy, we have grown to become one of the world’s largest manufacturers of discrete semiconductors and passive components.
We expect to continue our strategy of acquisitions while also maintaining a prudent capital structure.
We are focused on enhancing stockholder value and improving earnings per share.
During 2018 we reacted quickly to the opportunities created by the enactment of the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (“TCJA”) in December 2017.
In June 2018, we used the net proceeds from issuing $600 million principal amount of new convertible senior notes to repurchase some of our outstanding convertible senior debentures, which had become less tax-efficient because of the TCJA.
As a result of these transactions, we reduced the principal amount of outstanding convertible senior debentures due 2040, 2041, and 2042 from $575 million to $36.6 million.
We continued to re-shape our capital structure in 2019.
We replaced our existing credit agreement that was due to expire in December 2020 with a new agreement that will expire June 5, 2024.
For several years, we implemented aggressive cost reduction programs.
See further discussion in “Financial Metrics” and “Financial Condition, Liquidity, and Capital Resources” below.
This decrease has negatively impacted almost all key financial metrics, including net revenues.
The net earnings attributable to Vishay stockholders for the fiscal quarter ended June 29, 2019 were $44.5 million, or $0.31 per diluted share, compared to $75.5 million, or $0.52 per diluted share for the fiscal quarter ended March 30, 2019, and $103.1 million, or $0.65 per diluted share for the fiscal quarter ended June 30, 2018.
These non-GAAP measures should not be viewed as alternatives to GAAP measures of performance or liquidity.
Management believes that adjusted net earnings and adjusted earnings per share are meaningful because they provide insight with respect to our intrinsic operating results.
