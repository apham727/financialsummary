The four fiscal quarters in 2018 ended on March 31, 2018, June 30, 2018, September 29, 2018, and December 31, 2018, respectively.
In February 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued Accounting Standards Update ("ASU") No.
2016-02 and all related ASUs is codified in Accounting Standard Codification (“ASC”) Topic 842, Leases.
The difference between the initial right of use asset and lease liability balances recognized upon adoption of ASC Topic 842 is primarily due to accrued lease incentive balances at December 31, 2018.
On December 20, 2018, the Company received sale proceeds of $45,500 and concurrently leased-back its former manufacturing site in Santa Clara, California, under a short-term arrangement, to raze the buildings.
Upon adoption of ASC Topic 842, the Company was required to reassess the accounting for these transactions.
The transactions did not qualify as a completed sale and leaseback under previous GAAP.
See Note 3.

The MD&A should be read in conjunction with our Consolidated Condensed Financial Statements and accompanying Notes included in Item 1.
"Risk Factors," filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on February 15, 2019.
Since 1985, we have pursued a business strategy of growth through focused research and development and acquisitions.
Through this strategy, we have grown to become one of the world’s largest manufacturers of discrete semiconductors and passive components.
We expect to continue our strategy of acquisitions while also maintaining a prudent capital structure.
During 2018 we reacted quickly to the opportunities created by the enactment of the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (“TCJA”) in December 2017.
For several years, we implemented aggressive cost reduction programs.
See further discussion in “Financial Metrics” and “Financial Condition, Liquidity, and Capital Resources” below.
There is a substantial increase of inventory in the supply chain, which has negatively impacted several key financial metrics.
Net revenues for the fiscal quarter ended March 30, 2019 were $745.2 million, compared to $775.9 million and $716.8 million for the fiscal quarters ended December 31, 2018 and March 31, 2018, respectively.
The net earnings attributable to Vishay stockholders for the fiscal quarter ended March 30, 2019 were $75.5 million, or $0.52 per diluted share, compared to $102.4 million, or $0.69 per diluted share for the fiscal quarter ended December 31, 2018, and $62.4 million, or $0.39 per diluted share for the fiscal quarter ended March 31, 2018.
We define free cash as the cash flows generated from continuing operations less capital expenditures plus net proceeds from the sale of property and equipment.
The reconciliations below include certain financial measures which are not recognized in accordance with GAAP, including adjusted net earnings, adjusted earnings per share, and free cash.
These non-GAAP measures should not be viewed as alternatives to GAAP measures of performance or liquidity.
Management believes that adjusted net earnings and adjusted earnings per share are meaningful because they provide insight with respect to our intrinsic operating results.
Although the term "free cash" is not defined in GAAP, each of the elements used to calculate free cash for the year-to-date period is presented as a line item on the face of our consolidated condensed statement of cash flows prepared in accordance with GAAP and the quarterly amounts are derived from the year-to-date GAAP statements as of the beginning and end of the respective quarter.
Gross profit is generally net revenues less costs of products sold, but also deducts certain other period costs, particularly losses on purchase commitments and inventory write-downs.
