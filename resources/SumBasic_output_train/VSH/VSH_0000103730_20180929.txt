The Company reports interim financial information for 13-week periods beginning on a Sunday and ending on a Saturday, except for the first fiscal quarter, which always begins on January 1, and the fourth fiscal quarter, which always ends on December 31.

In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued ASU No.
2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606).
The ASU is the result of a convergence project between the FASB and the International Accounting Standards Board to clarify the principles for recognizing revenue and to develop a common revenue standard for GAAP and International Financial Reporting Standards.
The ASU removes inconsistencies and weaknesses in revenue requirements; provides a more robust framework for addressing revenue issues; improves comparability of revenue recognition practices across entities, industries, jurisdictions, and capital markets; provides more useful information to users of financial statements through expanded disclosure requirements; and simplifies the preparation of financial statements by reducing the number of requirements to which an entity must refer.
The Company retrospectively adopted the ASU on January 1, 2018.
Upon adoption of the ASU, the Company will recognize lease assets and liabilities for its operating leases which are not currently reported on its consolidated balance sheets.
ASU 2014-09 introduces the concept of service-type warranties, which represent separate performance obligations.

Since 1985, we have pursued a business strategy of growth through focused research and development and acquisitions.
Through this strategy, we have grown to become one of the world's largest manufacturers of discrete semiconductors and passive components.
We expect to continue our strategy of acquisitions while also maintaining a prudent capital structure.
We are focused on enhancing stockholder value and improving earnings per share.
In addition to our growth plan, we also have opportunistically repurchased our stock.
The quarterly cash dividend was increased by 26% to $0.085 per share in the second fiscal quarter of 2018.
We recognized a loss of $17.3 million due to the early extinguishment of the repurchased convertible senior debentures.
As part of the amendment and restatement of the revolving credit facility in December 2015, we completed an evaluation of our anticipated domestic cash needs over the next several years and our most efficient use of liquidity, with consideration of the amount of cash that can be repatriated to the U.S. efficiently with lesser withholding taxes in foreign jurisdictions.
As a result of the enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act ("TCJA") in December 2017, we terminated the aforementioned cash repatriation plan and replaced it with a plan to repatriate approximately $1.1 billion of unremitted foreign earnings in Israel, Germany, Austria, and France in the fourth fiscal quarter of 2017.
For several years, we implemented aggressive cost reduction programs.
See additional information regarding our competitive strengths and key challenges as disclosed in Part 1 of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2017, filed with the SEC on February 16, 2018.
See further discussion in "Financial Metrics" and "Financial Condition, Liquidity, and Capital Resources" below.
In the first fiscal quarter of 2018, we retrospectively adopted two new accounting standards, which impacted previously reported net revenues, gross profit margin, and segment operating income.
We continued to experience excellent business conditions in virtually all end-markets in the third fiscal quarter of 2018.
Net revenues continued to increase and are significantly higher than the prior year quarter.
