Significant changes to our accounting policies as a result of adopting ASU-2014-09 “Revenue from Contracts with Customers” (Topic 606) are discussed below.
Control is generally transferred at time of shipment when title and risk of ownership passes to the customer.
For customer contracts with multiple performance obligations, the Company allocates the transaction price and any discounts to each performance obligation based on relative standalone selling prices.
Payment terms are typically within 30 to 90 days from the shipping date, depending on our terms with the customer.
Installation is a separate performance obligation, except for our digital signage products.
The Company disaggregates the revenue from contracts with customers by the timing of revenue recognition because the Company believes it best depicts the nature, amount, and timing of our revenue and cash flows.
The table presents a reconciliation of the disaggregation by reportable segments.
Legacy products include lighting fixtures utilizing light sources other than LED technology and printed two and three dimensional graphic products.
Turnkey services and other includes installation services along with shipping and handling charges.We are in the business of designing, manufacturing and marketing lighting, graphics and technology solutions for both indoor and outdoor applications.
Adjusted fiscal 2019 second quarter operating income of $1.5 million decreased $3.1 million or 66% from adjusted fiscal 2018 operating income of $4.6 million.
Both fiscal years recorded goodwill impairment charges in the Lighting Segment.
There was a $20.2 million goodwill impairment charge in fiscal 2019 and a $28 million goodwill impairment charge in fiscal 2018.
Also contributing to the period-over-period results is a one-time adjustment to the Company’s paid-time-off policy in fiscal 2019 which resulted in a favorable pre-tax adjustment to earnings of $1.2 million.
The Company believes it is appropriate to evaluate its performance after making adjustments to the as-reported U.S. GAAP operating income, net income, and earnings per share.
Adjusted operating income, net income and earnings per share, which exclude the impact of goodwill impairment, severance costs, transition and re-alignment costs, and restructuring and plant closure costs, are non-GAAP financial measures.
We believe that these adjusted supplemental measures are useful in assessing the operating performance of our business.
Below is a reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures to operating income, net income, and earnings per share for the periods indicated.During the last twelve months, the sales price of our common stock, as reported on the Nasdaq Global Select Market, declined from a high of $8.69 in February 2018 to a low of $3.17 on January 30, 2019.
