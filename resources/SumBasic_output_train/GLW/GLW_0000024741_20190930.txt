Diluted earnings per share increased by $0.21 per share when compared to the same period in 2018, driven by the increase in net income described above, coupled with the repurchase of 34.7 million shares of common stock over the last twelve months.

Equity in earnings of affiliated companies for the nine months ended September 30, 2019 decreased by $21 million, primarily driven by the absence of a gain recorded in the first quarter of 2018 resulting from a legal settlement.
For the nine months ended September 30, 2019 comprehensive income increased by $71 million when compared to the same period in 2018, primarily due to an increase in net income of $154 million offset by $53 million related to the adoption of the new standard for reclassification of stranded tax effects in AOCI.
