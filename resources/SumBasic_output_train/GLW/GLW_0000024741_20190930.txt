This interim MD&A should be read in conjunction with the MD&A in our 2018 Form 10-K.
The Framework outlined our leadership priorities and articulated the opportunities we saw across our businesses.
We designed the Framework to create significant value for shareholders by focusing our portfolio and leveraging our financial strength.

On June 14, 2019, Corning introduced its 2020-2023 Strategy and Growth Framework.

Higher translation losses on Japanese yen-denominated debt of $30 million.
Diluted earnings per share increased by $0.21 per share when compared to the same period in 2018, driven by the increase in net income described above, coupled with the repurchase of 34.7 million shares of common stock over the last twelve months.
In the Optical Communications segment, we expect sales to decrease three to five percent year-over-year.
We expect sales growth in our Environmental Technologies and Life Sciences segments in the mid-teens and mid-single-digit percentages, respectively.
Movements in foreign exchange rates did not materially impact Corning’s consolidated net sales in the three months ended September 30, 2019, when compared to the prior year.
Selling, general and administrative expenses declined as a percentage of sales by 2% for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2019.
As a percentage of sales, these expenses were similar when compared to the same periods last year.
Equity in earnings of affiliated companies for the nine months ended September 30, 2019 decreased by $21 million, primarily driven by the absence of a gain recorded in the first quarter of 2018 resulting from a legal settlement.
For the nine months ended September 30, 2019 comprehensive income increased by $71 million when compared to the same period in 2018, primarily due to an increase in net income of $154 million offset by $53 million related to the adoption of the new standard for reclassification of stranded tax effects in AOCI.
Refer to Note 13 (Shareholders’ Equity) to the consolidated financial statements for additional information.
Core performance measures are not prepared in accordance with GAAP.
These measures are not, and should not be viewed as a substitute for GAAP reporting measures.
As a result, the Company is unable to provide outlook information on a GAAP basis.
Effective July 1, 2019, we have replaced the term “Core Earnings” with “Core Net Income”.
The terms are interchangeable and the underlying calculations remain the same.
For a reconciliation of non-GAAP performance measures to their most directly comparable GAAP financial measure, please see “Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Measures”.
For the three months ended September 30, 2019, we generated core net income of $397 million, or $0.44 per share, compared to core net income generated in the three months ended September 30, 2018 of $476 million, or $0.51 per share.
