This interim MD&A should be read in conjunction with the MD&A in our 2018 Form 10-K.
The Framework outlined our leadership priorities and articulated the opportunities we saw across our businesses.
We designed the Framework to create significant value for shareholders by focusing our portfolio and leveraging our financial strength.
Under the Framework, we targeted generating $26 billion to $30 billion of cash through 2019, returning more than $12.5 billion to shareholders and investing $10 billion to extend our leadership positions and deliver growth.
On June 14, 2019, Corning introduced its 2020-2023 Strategy and Growth Framework.
From 2020 to 2023, the company plans to invest $10 billion to $12 billion for growth and to return $8 billion to $10 billion to shareholders.
Sales in carrier networks were down in the three months and up in the six months ended June 30, 2019.
Net sales in the Display Technologies segment increased by $68 million and $141 million, respectively, for the three and six months ended June 30, 2019, with volume increases in the mid-teens in percentage terms more than offsetting moderate price declines.
Higher costs of $33 million, primarily accelerated depreciation, within the Display Technologies segment.
Diluted earnings per share decreased by $0.69 per share when compared to the second quarter of 2018, driven by the decrease in net income described, offset by the repurchase of 35.8 million shares of common stock over the last twelve months.
We anticipate Corning’s display glass volume will grow by high-single digits driven by television screen size growth and the ramp of our Gen 10.5 facility in Hefei, China.
An increase of $26 million in the Life Sciences segment.
When compared to the second quarter of 2018, selling, general and administrative expenses were similar in the three months ended June 30, 2019.
As a percentage of sales, these expenses decreased by 1% and remained constant, respectively, when compared to the same periods last year.
The translation impact of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, including the impact of hedges realized in the current quarter, did not materially impact Corning’s consolidated income before income taxes in the three and six months ended June 30, 2019 when compared to the same periods in 2018.
The company expects to make a payment before the end of the year of approximately $40 million for the 2013-2014 tax audit settlements with the IRS.
As of June 30, 2019, the company is not expecting any significant movements in the uncertain tax benefits in the next twelve months.Environmental Litigation.
