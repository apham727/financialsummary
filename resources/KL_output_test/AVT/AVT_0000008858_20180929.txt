All such adjustments are of a normal recurring nature.
Certain reclassifications have been made in prior periods to conform to the current period presentation including reclassifications as a result of recently adopted accounting pronouncements.
In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (the “FASB”) issued Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) No.
2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606) (“ASU 2014-09”, and collectively with its related subsequent amendments, “Topic 606”).
Topic 606 supersedes previous revenue recognition guidance and requires the Company to recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the Company expects to be entitled in exchange for such goods or services.
The adoption of Topic 606 did not have a material impact on the Company’s consolidated financial statements as of the adoption date and as of and for the three months ended September 29, 2018.Sales taking into account these adjustments are referred to as “organic sales.” Management believes that providing this additional information is useful to readers to better assess and understand operating performance, especially when comparing results with prior periods or forecasting performance for future periods, primarily because management typically monitors the business both including and excluding these adjustments to GAAP results.
Management also uses these non-GAAP measures to establish operational goals and, in many cases, for measuring performance for compensation purposes.
However, any analysis of results on a non-GAAP basis should be used as a complement to, and in conjunction with, results presented in accordance with GAAP.
