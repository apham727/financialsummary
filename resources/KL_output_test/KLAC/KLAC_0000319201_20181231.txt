Basis of Presentation.
Certain reclassifications have been made to the prior year’s Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements to conform to the current year presentation.
Management Estimates.
Actual results could differ from those estimates.
Under ASC 606, revenue is recognized when a customer obtains control of promised goods or services in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services.
We adopted the ASC 606 as of July 1, 2018 in our first quarter of our fiscal year ending June 30, 2019, using the modified retrospective transition approach.
In October 2016, the FASB issued an accounting standard update to recognize the income tax consequences of intra-entity transfers of assets other than inventory when they occur.
This eliminates the exception to postpone recognition until the asset has been sold to an outside party.
In January 2017, the FASB issued an accounting standard on clarifying the definition of a business, with the objective of adding guidance to assist entities with evaluating whether transactions should be accounted for as acquisitions (or disposals) of assets or businesses.
Under the update, goodwill impairment will be calculated as the amount by which a reporting unit’s carrying value exceeds our fair value.
We early adopted this update in the second quarter of our fiscal year ending June 30, 2019 under the modified retrospective approach.
The cumulative effect adjustment for the elimination of the ineffectiveness was not material to our condensed consolidated financial statements.
As a result of the adoption, we made a reclassification from AOCI to beginning retained earnings of approximately $10.7 million related to the stranded tax effects.
In July 2018, the FASB issued an amendment to the standard which provide us an option to apply the practical expedient allowed in the standard retrospectively with the cumulative effect recognized as of the date of adoption.
The update is effective for us beginning in the first quarter of our fiscal year ending June 30, 2020.
We are currently evaluating the impact of this accounting standard update on our condensed consolidated financial statements.
Under the update, credit losses for certain types of financial instruments will be estimated based on expected losses.

The semiconductor equipment industry and other industries that we serve are constantly developing and changing over time.
•The mix and type of customers, and sales to any single customer, may vary significantly from quarter to quarter and from year to year, which exposes our business and operating results to increased volatility tied to individual customers.
•As a result of this consolidation, the customers that survive the consolidation represent a greater portion of our sales and, consequently, have greater commercial negotiating leverage.
Any of these changes could negatively impact our prices, customer orders, revenues and gross margins.
•The highly concentrated business environment also increases our exposure to risks related to the financial condition of each of our customers.
We believe that once a semiconductor manufacturer selects a particular supplier’s process control and yield management equipment, the manufacturer generally relies upon that equipment for that specific production line application for an extended period of time.
Accordingly, we expect it to be more difficult to sell our products to a given customer for that specific production line application and other similar production line applications if that customer initially selects a competitor’s equipment.
Similarly, we expect it to be challenging for a competitor to sell our products to a given customer for a specific production line application if that customer initially selects our equipment.
