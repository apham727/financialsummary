Basis of Presentation.
On July 15, 2019 we changed our corporate name from “KLA-Tencor Corporation” to “KLA Corporation”.
The results of operations for the three months ended September 30, 2019 are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for any other interim period or for the full fiscal year ending June 30, 2020.
Certain reclassifications have been made to the prior year’s Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements to conform to the current year presentation.
Acquisition of Orbotech, Ltd. On February 20, 2019 (the “Closing Date” or “Acquisition Date”), we completed the acquisition of Orbotech, Ltd. (“Orbotech”) for total consideration of $3.26 billion.
The acquisition of Orbotech is referred to as the “Orbotech Acquisition”.
The Orbotech Acquisition was accounted for by applying the acquisition method of accounting for business combinations.
The unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements in this report include the financial results of Orbotech prospectively from the Acquisition Date.
For additional details, refer to Note 6 “Business Combinations” of the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements.
Management Estimates.
Actual results could differ from those estimates.
We updated our accounting policies for Leases.
Under ASC 842, a contract is or contains a lease when we have the right to control the use of an identified asset for a period of time.
On the commencement date leases are evaluated for classification and assets and liabilities are recognized based on the present value of lease payments over the lease term.
We used the incremental borrowing rate on June 30, 2019 for all leases that commenced on or prior to that date.
For leases with a term of one year or less, we have elected not to record the ROU asset or liability.

The industries that we serve, including the semiconductor, flat panel display and printed circuit board industries, are constantly developing and changing over time.
•The mix and type of customers, and sales to any single customer, may vary significantly from quarter to quarter and from year to year, which exposes our business and operating results to increased volatility tied to individual customers.
•As a result of this consolidation, the customers that survive the consolidation represent a greater portion of our sales and, consequently, have greater commercial negotiating leverage.
Any of these changes could negatively impact our prices, customer orders, revenues and gross margins.
•The highly concentrated business environment also increases our exposure to risks related to the financial condition of each of our customers.
We believe that once a semiconductor manufacturer selects a particular supplier’s process control and yield management equipment, the manufacturer generally relies upon that equipment for that specific production line application for an extended period of time.
Accordingly, we expect it to be more difficult to sell our products to a given customer for that specific production line application and other similar production line applications if that customer initially selects a competitor’s equipment.
Similarly, we expect it to be challenging for a competitor to sell its products to a given customer for a specific production line application if that customer initially selects our equipment.
