Our fiscal quarter ends on the Saturday nearest the end of the quarter-ending month.
The unaudited consolidated financial statements presented herein include the accounts of our wholly owned subsidiaries.
The financial information contained in this report should be read in conjunction with our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 2, 2018, that we filed on August 2, 2018.
2014-09 (“ASU 2014-09”), Revenue from Contracts with Customers, which amends guidance for revenue recognition.
In August 2015, the FASB issued an amendment to defer the effective date for all entities by one year.
Companies have the option of using either a full or modified retrospective approach in applying this standard.
The adoption of this standard did not impact the timing of revenue recognition for our customer sales.
The adoption did not result in the recognition of a cumulative adjustment to beginning retained earnings, nor did it have a material impact on the condensed consolidated financial statements.
For the Company, the most significant impact of the new standard is the addition of required disclosures within the notes to the financial statements.
During the fourth quarter of each fiscal year, our goodwill balances are reviewed for impairment using the first day of our fourth quarter as the measurement date.
If after reviewing the totality of events or circumstances, we determine that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount, then we test for impairment through the application of a fair value based test.
Intangible assets are initially recorded at their fair market values determined on quoted market prices in active markets, if available, or recognized valuation models.
The manufacturing business does not include a separate service bundled with the product sold or sold on top of the product.
The Company recognizes services revenue when the repair, installation or training is performed.
Based on our analysis of services revenue, ASU 2014-09 has an immaterial impact on the timing, amount or characterization of services revenue recognized by the Company.
The services we provide are relatively short in duration, typically completed in one to two weeks, thus, at each reporting date, the amount of unbilled work performed is insignificant.
Prior to accepting a customer purchase order, we review the credit worthiness of the customer.
Purchase orders are deemed to meet the collectability criterion once the customer’s credit is approved.
The Company receives advances or deposits from our customers before revenue is recognized, resulting in contract liabilities.
Each accepted purchase order identifies a distinct good or service as the performance obligation.
