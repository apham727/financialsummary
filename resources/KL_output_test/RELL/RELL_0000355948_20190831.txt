The accompanying unaudited consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with United States Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (“GAAP”) for interim financial information and the instructions to Form 10-Q and Article 10 of Regulation S-X.
Accordingly, they do not include all the information and notes required by GAAP for complete financial statements.
Our fiscal quarter ends on the Saturday nearest the end of the quarter-ending month.
The unaudited consolidated financial statements presented herein include the accounts of our wholly owned subsidiaries.
The financial information contained in this report should be read in conjunction with our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 1, 2019, that we filed on August 5, 2019.
2014-09 (“ASU 2014-09”), Revenue from Contracts with Customers, which amends guidance for revenue recognition.
The core principle of the guidance is that entities should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods and services.
In August 2015, the FASB issued an amendment to defer the effective date for all entities by one year.
Companies have the option of using either a full or modified retrospective approach in applying this standard.
The adoption of this standard did not impact the timing of revenue recognition for our customer sales.
The adoption did not result in the recognition of a cumulative adjustment to beginning retained earnings, nor did it have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements.
For the Company, the most significant impact of the new standard is the addition of required disclosures within the notes to the financial statements.
The Company recognizes services revenue when the repair, installation or training is performed.
Based on our analysis of services revenue, ASU 2014-09 has an immaterial impact on the timing, amount or characterization of services revenue recognized by the Company.
Therefore, at each reporting date, the amount of unbilled work performed is insignificant.
Prior to accepting a customer purchase order, we review the credit worthiness of the customer.
Purchase orders are deemed to meet the collectability criterion once the customer’s credit is approved.
The Company receives advance payments or deposits from our customers before revenue is recognized, resulting in contract liabilities.
