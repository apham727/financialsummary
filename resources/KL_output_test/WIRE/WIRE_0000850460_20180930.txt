The FASB issues an Accounting Standard Update (“ASU”) to communicate changes to the codification.
The following are those ASUs that are relevant to the Company.
In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU No.
Upon completing our implementation assessment of ASC 606, we concluded that no adjustment was required to the opening balance of retained earnings at the date of initial application.
Lessor accounting remains largely consistent with existing U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.
The new standard will be effective for us beginning January 1, 2019.
Companies that elect this option would record a cumulative-effect adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings on the date of adoption.

The following discussion and analysis relate to factors that have affected the operating results of the Company for the quarters and nine months ended September 30, 2018 and 2017.
Net sales were $340.7 million in the third quarter of 2018 compared to $292.0 million in the third quarter of 2017.
Cost of goods sold was $286.2 million, or 84.0% of net sales, in the third quarter of 2018, compared to $252.9 million, or 86.6% of net sales, in the third quarter of 2017.
Gross profit increased to $54.5 million, or 16.0% of net sales, in the third quarter of 2018 from $39.1 million, or 13.4% of net sales, in the third quarter of 2017.
The percentage change on sales is on a higher nominal dollar amount than on purchases and, therefore, spreads change on a nominal dollar basis.
The margin changes were due primarily to the competitive pricing environment in the industry.
Total raw materials cost, including the LIFO adjustment, decreased to 73.2% of net sales in the third quarter of 2018, from 74.8% of net sales in the third quarter of 2017.
Increased overhead costs added to the increase in total cost of sales dollars, although decreasing as a percent of net sales.
Overheads contain some fixed and semi-fixed components which do not fluctuate as much as sales dollars fluctuate.
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost, using the last-in, first out (LIFO) method, or market.
