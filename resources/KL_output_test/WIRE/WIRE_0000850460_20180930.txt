The following discussion and analysis relate to factors that have affected the operating results of the Company for the quarters and nine months ended September 30, 2018 and 2017.
Net sales were $340.7 million in the third quarter of 2018 compared to $292.0 million in the third quarter of 2017.
Cost of goods sold was $286.2 million, or 84.0% of net sales, in the third quarter of 2018, compared to $252.9 million, or 86.6% of net sales, in the third quarter of 2017.
Gross profit increased to $54.5 million, or 16.0% of net sales, in the third quarter of 2018 from $39.1 million, or 13.4% of net sales, in the third quarter of 2017.

The margin changes were due primarily to the competitive pricing environment in the industry.Item 1A.
