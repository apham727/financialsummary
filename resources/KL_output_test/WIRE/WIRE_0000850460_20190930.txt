The FASB issues an Accounting Standard Update (“ASU”) to communicate changes to the codification.
The following are those ASUs that are relevant to the Company.
The Company has a minimal number of leases, all of which are classified as operating.
As a result of the adoption of ASU No.
We will evaluate any future lease commitments in conformance with ASU No.
In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU No.
This ASU requires immediate recognition of management’s estimates of current expected credit losses.
Under the prior model, losses were recognized only as they were incurred, which FASB has noted delayed recognition of expected losses that might not yet have met the threshold of being probable.
The new standard will be effective for the Company beginning January 1, 2020.
ASU 2016-13 permits only a modified retrospective approach without restatement.
