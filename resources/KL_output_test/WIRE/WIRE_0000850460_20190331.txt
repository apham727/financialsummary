Financial Statements.
The FASB issues an Accounting Standard Update (“ASU”) to communicate changes to the codification.
The following are those ASUs that are relevant to the Company.
In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU No.
No adjustment was required to the opening balance of retained earnings at the date of initial application.
The Company has a minimal number of leases, all of which are classified as operating.
As a result of the adoption of ASU No.
We will evaluate any future lease commitments in conformance with ASU No.
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost, determined by the last-in, first-out (LIFO) method, or market.
LIFO pools are established at the end of each fiscal year.
In the first quarter of 2019, LIFO adjustments were recorded, increasing cost of sales by $3.8 million, versus LIFO adjustments increasing cost of sales by $2.0 million in the first quarter of 2018.

Copper, a commodity product, is the principal raw material used by the Company in manufacturing its products.
The acquisition of copper cathode by copper ETFs may materially decrease or interrupt the availability of copper for immediate delivery in the United States, which could materially increase the Company’s cost of copper.
In addition to rising copper prices and potential supply shortages, we believe that ETFs and similar copper-backed derivative products could lead to increased price volatility for copper.
Historically, the Company has not engaged in hedging strategies for raw material purchases.
The tables below highlight the range of closing prices of copper on a per pound basis on the Comex exchange for the periods shown.
Net sales were $314.7 million in the first quarter of 2019 compared to $291.4 million in the first quarter of 2018.
This 8.0% increase in net sales dollars is primarily the result of a 13.5% increase in copper wire unit volume shipped, offset somewhat by a 5.9% decrease in the average selling price of copper wire.
Unit volume is measured in pounds of copper contained in the wire shipped during the period.
Cost of goods sold was $273.4 million, or 86.9% of net sales, in the first quarter of 2019, compared to $253.9 million, or 87.1% of net sales, in the first quarter of 2018.
Gross profit increased to $41.3 million, or 13.1% of net sales, in the first quarter of 2019 from $37.5 million, or 12.9% of net sales, in the first quarter of 2018.
The increase in gross profit margin percentage was driven principally by the increase of the copper wire spread.
The spread increased as a result of the average sales price per pound of copper sold decreasing 5.9% while the per pound cost of raw copper purchased decreased 9.6%.
The margin changes were due primarily to the competitive pricing environment in the industry.
On April 8, 2019, the U.S. Commerce Department imposed preliminary countervailing duties on imports of aluminum wire from China at rates ranging from 11.57 to 164.16 percent.
Total raw materials cost, including the LIFO adjustment, decreased to 75.0% of net sales in the first quarter of 2019, from 76.5% of net sales in the first quarter of 2018.
