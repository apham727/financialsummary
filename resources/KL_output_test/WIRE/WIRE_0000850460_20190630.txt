Net sales were $336.9 million in the second quarter of 2019 compared to $336.8 million in the second quarter of 2018.

Unit volume is measured in pounds of copper contained in the wire shipped during the period.
Cost of goods sold was $291.0 million, or 86.4% of net sales, in the second quarter of 2019, compared to $292.3 million, or 86.8% of net sales, in the second quarter of 2018.
Gross profit increased to $45.9 million, or 13.6% of net sales, in the second quarter of 2019 from $44.5 million, or 13.2% of net sales, in the second quarter of 2018.
