Refer to Note 16 – Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (Loss) for further information.
Interim results are not necessarily indicative of results for a full year.
Intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated.
In general, investments with original maturities of greater than three months and remaining maturities of less than one year are classified as short-term investments.
Changes in fair value, excluding other-than-temporary impairments, are recorded in other comprehensive income (“OCI”).
Debt investments are impaired when a decline in fair value is judged to be other-than-temporary.
Fair value is calculated based on publicly available market information or other estimates determined by management.
We employ a systematic methodology on a quarterly basis that considers available quantitative and qualitative evidence in evaluating potential impairment of our investments.
Changes in value are recorded in other income (expense), net.
Derivative instruments are recognized as either assets or liabilities and measured at fair value.
For derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges, the effective portion of the gains and losses are initially reported as a component of OCI and subsequently recognized in revenue when the hedged exposure is recognized in revenue.
For derivative instruments that are not designated as hedges, gains and losses from changes in fair values are primarily recognized in other income (expense), net.
Level 1 – inputs are based upon unadjusted quoted prices for identical instruments in active markets.
Our Level 1 investments include U.S. government securities, common and preferred stock, and mutual funds.

Our ability to remain competitive depends on our success in making innovative products, devices, and services that appeal to businesses and consumers.
Establishing significant scale in the marketplace is necessary to achieve and maintain attractive margins.
We face significant competition from firms that provide competing platforms.

We also offer some vertically-integrated hardware and software products and services.
We face significant competition from competing platforms developed for new devices and form factors such as smartphones and tablet computers.
Users are increasingly turning to these devices to perform functions that in the past were performed by personal computers.
