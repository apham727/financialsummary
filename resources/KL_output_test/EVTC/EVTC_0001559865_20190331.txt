We serve 26 countries in the region from our base in Puerto Rico.
We believe our business is well-positioned to continue to expand across the fast-growing Latin American region.
We provide these services through scalable, end-to-end technology platforms that we manage and operate in-house and that generates significant operating efficiencies that enable us to maximize profitability.
Our revenue is predominantly recurring in nature because of the mission-critical and embedded nature of the services we provide.
EVERTEC, Inc. ("EVERTEC", formerly known as Carib Latam Holdings, Inc.) is a Puerto Rico corporation organized in April 2012.
On April 17, 2012, EVERTEC Group was converted from a Puerto Rico corporation to a Puerto Rico limited liability company (the “Conversion”) for the purpose of improving its consolidated tax efficiency by taking advantage of changes to the Puerto Rico Internal Revenue Code, as amended (the “PR Code”), that permit limited liability companies to be treated as partnerships that are pass-through entities for Puerto Rico tax purposes.
On May 1, 2017, the automatic stay expired.
Promptly after the expiration of the stay, creditors of the Puerto Rico government filed various lawsuits involving defaults on more than $70 billion of bonds issued by Puerto Rico, having failed to reach a negotiated settlement on such defaults with the Puerto Rico government during the period of the automatic stay.
On May 3, 2017, the Oversight Board filed a voluntary petition of relief on behalf of the Commonwealth pursuant to Title III of PROMESA for the restructuring of the Commonwealth’s debt.
Title III is an in-court debt restructuring proceeding similar to protections afforded debtors under Chapter 11 of the United States Code (the “Bankruptcy Code”); the Bankruptcy Code is not available to the Commonwealth or its instrumentalities.
In addition to the macroeconomic trends described above, Management currently estimates that we will continue to experience a revenue attrition in Latin America of approximately $3 million to $4 million for previously disclosed migrations anticipated in 2019.
The clients' decisions, which were made prior to 2015, for these anticipated migrations were driven by a variety of historical factors, most importantly customer service experience.
Total revenues in the first quarter of 2019 increased by $8.6 million or 8% to $118.8 million.
Additionally, revenue growth was a result of an increase in network services related to new managed services projects, as well as, a one-time revenue related to an electronic benefits contract of approximately $2.7 million.
Cost of revenues amounted to $50.0 million, an increase of $2.6 million or 5% when compared with the prior year period.
The increase is mainly related to higher capital expenditures in prior year as well as impact from development projects going into production.
Non-operating expenses increased by $0.4 million to $6.9 million when compared with the prior year period.
The increase is mainly related to a $0.6 million decrease in Other income, net due to a decrease in foreign exchange gains relative to the same quarter in 2018.
Income tax expense amounted to $3.8 million, relatively flat when compared with the prior year period.
The effective tax rate for the quarter was 12.5%, compared with 14.5% in the 2018 period.
For card issuer processing, revenues are primarily dependent upon the number of cardholder accounts on file, transactions and authorizations processed, the number of cards embossed and other processing services.
For EBT services, revenues are primarily derived from the number of beneficiaries on file.
