We serve 26 countries in the region from our base in Puerto Rico.
We believe our business is well-positioned to continue to expand across the fast-growing Latin American region.
Our revenue is predominantly recurring in nature because of the mission-critical and embedded nature of the services we provide.
EVERTEC, Inc. ("EVERTEC", formerly known as Carib Latam Holdings, Inc.) is a Puerto Rico corporation organized in April 2012.
Our main operating subsidiary, EVERTEC Group, LLC (formerly known as EVERTEC, LLC and EVERTEC, Inc., hereinafter “EVERTEC Group”), was organized in Puerto Rico in 1988.
Additionally, Popular granted us a right of first refusal on the development of certain new financial technology products and services for the duration of the MSA.
We also benefit from the trend of financial institutions and government agencies outsourcing technology systems and processes.
Many medium- and small-size institutions in the Latin American markets in which we operate have outdated computer systems and updating these IT legacy systems is financially and logistically challenging, which presents a business opportunity for us.
The Oversight Board has broad budgetary and financial powers over Puerto Rico’s budget, laws, financial plans and regulations, including the power to approve restructuring agreements with creditors, file petitions for restructuring and reform the electronic system for the tax collection.
In addition, PROMESA imposes an automatic stay on all litigation against Puerto Rico and its instrumentalities, as well as any other judicial or administrative actions or proceedings to enforce or collect claims against the Puerto Rico government.
On May 1, 2017, the automatic stay expired.
On May 3, 2017, the Oversight Board filed a voluntary petition of relief on behalf of the Commonwealth pursuant to Title III of PROMESA for the restructuring of the Commonwealth’s debt.
In addition, we are currently negotiating with Popular in connection with a disagreement with respect to certain pricing terms under the MSA.
If we are unable to reach an agreement, the parties may pursue the dispute resolution mechanism under the MSA.
Total revenues in the third quarter of 2019 increased by $6.8 million or 6% to $118.8 million when compared with the prior year period.
Revenue increase in the quarter reflected growth across all segments and included benefits from value added solutions, new managed services and other pricing actions.
Additionally, increased revenue was driven by the completion of projects for approximately $2.0 million.
Cost of revenues amounted to $51.9 million, an increase of $2.4 million or 5% when compared with the prior year period.
The increase is primarily related to an increase in salaries and compensation as the prior year includes a significant reversal in share-based compensation expense in connection with a former executive's forfeiture for unvested RSUs, partially offset by lower professional fees and other operating expenses.
Depreciation and amortization expense amounted to $17.0 million, an increase of $1.2 million or 7% when compared with the prior year period.
Non-operating expenses increased by $0.3 million to $6.3 million when compared with the prior year period.
The increase is mainly related to a $0.9 million decrease in Other income (expenses) due to higher foreign exchange losses relative to the same quarter in 2018.
The effective tax rate for the quarter was 13.0%, compared with 12.5% in the 2018 period.
