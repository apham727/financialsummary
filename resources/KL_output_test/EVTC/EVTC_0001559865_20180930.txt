Item 2.
The following Management’s Discussion and Analysis (“MD&A”) covers: (i) the results of operations for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2018 and 2017 and (ii) the financial condition as of September 30, 2018.
We serve 26 countries in the region from our base in Puerto Rico.
We believe our business is well-positioned to continue to expand across the fast-growing Latin American region.
Our revenue is predominantly recurring in nature because of the mission-critical and embedded nature of the services we provide.
EVERTEC, Inc. (formerly known as Carib Latam Holdings, Inc.) is a Puerto Rico corporation organized in April 2012.
On April 17, 2012, EVERTEC Group was converted from a Puerto Rico corporation to a Puerto Rico limited liability company (the “Conversion”) for the purpose of improving its consolidated tax efficiency by taking advantage of changes to the Puerto Rico Internal Revenue Code, as amended (the “PR Code”), that permit limited liability companies to be treated as partnerships that are pass-through entities for Puerto Rico tax purposes.
We also benefit from the trend for financial institutions and government agencies to outsource technology systems and processes.
On June 30, 2016, the U.S. President signed into law PROMESA.
On May 1, 2017, the automatic stay expired.
Promptly after the expiration of the stay, creditors of the Puerto Rico government filed various lawsuits involving defaults on more than $70 billion of bonds issued by Puerto Rico, having failed to reach a negotiated settlement on such defaults with the Puerto Rico government during the period of the automatic stay.
On May 3, 2017, the Oversight Board filed a voluntary petition of relief on behalf of the Commonwealth pursuant to Title III of PROMESA for the restructuring of the Commonwealth’s debt.
Title III is an in-court debt restructuring proceeding similar to protections afforded debtors under Chapter 11 of the United States Code (the “Bankruptcy Code”); the Bankruptcy Code is not available to the Commonwealth or its instrumentalities.
In addition to the macroeconomic trends described above, Management currently estimates that we will continue to experience a revenue attrition in Latin America of approximately $3 million to $6 million for previously disclosed migrations anticipated in 2019.
The clients decisions, which were made prior to 2015, for these anticipated migrations were driven by a variety of historical factors, most importantly customer service experience.Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.of the Company’s 2017 Form 10-K.
