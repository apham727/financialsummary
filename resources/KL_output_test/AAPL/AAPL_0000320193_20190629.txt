The accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Apple Inc. and its wholly owned subsidiaries (collectively “Apple” or the “Company”).
Intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated.
Certain prior period amounts in the condensed consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes have been reclassified to conform to the current period’s presentation.
2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606) (“ASU 2014-09”), and additional ASUs issued to clarify the guidance in ASU 2014-09 (collectively the “new revenue standard”), which amends the existing accounting standards for revenue recognition.
The Company did not restate total net sales in the prior periods presented, as adoption of the new revenue standard did not have a material impact on previously reported amounts.
Additionally, beginning in the first quarter of 2019, the Company classified the amortization of the deferred value of Maps, Siri® and free iCloud® services, which are bundled in the sales price of iPhone®, Mac®, iPad® and certain other products, in services net sales.
As a result, products and services net sales information for the third quarter and first nine months of 2018 was reclassified to conform to the 2019 presentation.
Potentially dilutive securities representing 1.5 million and 20.5 million shares of common stock were excluded from the computation of diluted earnings per share for the three- and nine-month periods ended June 29, 2019, respectively, because their effect would have been antidilutive.
Net sales consist of revenue from the sale of iPhone, Mac, iPad, services and other products.
The Company recognizes revenue at the amount to which it expects to be entitled when control of the products or services is transferred to its customers.
Payment for products and services net sales is collected within a short period of time following transfer of control or commencement of delivery of services, as applicable.
The first performance obligation, which represents the substantial portion of the allocated sales price, is the hardware and bundled software delivered at the time of sale.
Because the Company lacks observable prices for the undelivered performance obligations, the allocation of revenue is based on the Company’s estimated SSPs.
Revenue allocated to the delivered hardware and bundled software is recognized when control has transferred to the customer, which generally occurs when the product is shipped.
Revenue allocated to the product-related bundled services and unspecified software upgrade rights is deferred and recognized on a straight-line basis over the estimated period they are expected to be provided.
Cost of sales related to delivered hardware and bundled software, including estimated warranty costs, are recognized at the time of sale.

All information presented herein is based on the Company’s fiscal calendar.
The Company assumes no obligation to revise or update any forward-looking statements for any reason, except as required by law.
Total net sales increased 1% or $544 million during the third quarter of 2019 compared to the same quarter in 2018, primarily driven by higher Wearables, Home and Accessories and Services net sales, partially offset by lower iPhone net sales.
Historically, the Company classified the amortization of these amounts in products net sales consistent with its management reporting framework.

The outcome of litigation is inherently uncertain.
The following discussion of risk factors contains forward-looking statements.
These risk factors may be important to understanding other statements in this Form 10-Q.
The Company has international operations with sales outside the U.S. representing a majority of the Company’s total net sales.
In addition, consumer confidence and spending could be adversely affected in response to financial market volatility, negative financial news, conditions in the real estate and mortgage markets, declines in income or asset values, changes to fuel and other energy costs, labor and healthcare costs and other economic factors.
In addition to an adverse impact on demand for the Company’s products, uncertainty about, or a decline in, global or regional economic conditions could have a significant impact on the Company’s suppliers, contract manufacturers, logistics providers, distributors, cellular network carriers and other channel partners.
A downturn in the economic environment could also lead to increased credit and collectibility risk on the Company’s trade receivables; the failure of derivative counterparties and other financial institutions; limitations on the Company’s ability to issue new debt; reduced liquidity; and declines in the fair value of the Company’s financial instruments.
Global markets for the Company’s products and services are highly competitive and subject to rapid technological change, and the Company may be unable to compete effectively in these markets.
In contrast, many of the Company’s competitors seek to compete primarily through aggressive pricing and very low cost structures, and emulating the Company’s products and infringing on its intellectual property.
