Accordingly, certain information and notes required by generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America (“GAAP”) for complete financial statements are not included herein.
The December 31, 2018 Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet is derived from audited financial statements, but does not include all disclosures required by GAAP.
Actual amounts could differ significantly from these estimates.
When we dispose of excess and obsolete inventories, the related disposals are charged against the inventory reserve.
Correction of Immaterial Misstatements.
The Company corrected this misstatement by recognizing a $0.8 million out-of-period adjustment during the three months ended June 30, 2019, which increased its excess and obsolete inventory reserve and cost of goods sold for the period.
These criteria focus on the transfer of control of the underlying lease asset.
This standard and related updates were effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, and interim periods within those fiscal years.
As a lessee, the adoption of this standard did not have a material impact on our Condensed Consolidated Statement of Income or Statement of Cash Flow.
See Note 11 for additional information.
As a lessor, the adoption of this standard did not have a material impact on the Company’s Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet, Condensed Consolidated Statement of Income or Condensed Statement of Cash Flow.
Contingent liabilities with a fair value totaling $1.2 million were recognized at the acquisition date, the payments of which were dependent upon SmartRG achieving future revenue, EBIT or customer purchase order milestones during the first half of 2019.
The required milestones were not achieved and, therefore, we recognized a gain of $1.2 million upon the reversal of these liabilities during the second quarter of 2019.
We recorded goodwill of $3.5 million as a result of this acquisition, which represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of net assets acquired.
We recorded a bargain purchase gain, net of income taxes, of $11.3 million during the first quarter of 2018, which represents the difference between the fair-value of the net assets acquired over the cash paid.

The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the related notes that appear in Part I, Item 1 of this document.

See Note 14 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Part I, Item 1 of this report for further information regarding these segments and revenue categories.
Many of our customers require prompt delivery of products.
This requires us to maintain sufficient inventory levels to satisfy anticipated customer demand.
In the second quarter of 2019, we had three 10% of revenue customers geographically diversified in Latin America (“LATAM”), Europe, and the U.S. For the third and fourth quarter of 2019, our current expectations include the effect of a temporary slowdown in capital spending in one of these regions for access at a Tier-1 European carrier customer for the remainder of 2019, however the full effect of this slowdown has not yet been determined.
We believe that normal spending should resume at the beginning of 2020.
Under the new policy, we establish reserves for estimated excess and obsolete inventory equal to the difference between the cost of the inventory and the estimated net realizable value of the inventory based on historical usage, known trends, inventory age, and market conditions.
When we dispose of excess and obsolete inventories, the related disposals are charged against the inventory reserve.

We maintain depository investments with certain financial institutions.
Although these depository investments may exceed government insured depository limits, we have evaluated the credit-worthiness of these financial institutions, and determined the risk of material financial loss due to exposure of such credit risk to be minimal.

Furthermore, management has determined that controls were not effectively designed and maintained over the determination of the estimated reserve for excess and obsolete inventory, including the review of significant inputs and assumptions used to determine our excess and obsolete inventory reserve, and to ensure the completeness and accuracy of key reports and related data used in the calculation of this reserve.
Specifically, the Company has begun redesigning and enhancing additional controls and procedures to ensure the completeness of our cycle count program and the completeness and accuracy of key reports and related data used to monitor the results of this cycle count program.
