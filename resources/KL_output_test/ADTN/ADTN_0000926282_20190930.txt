Accordingly, certain information and notes required by generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America (“GAAP”) for complete financial statements are not included herein.
The December 31, 2018 Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet is derived from audited financial statements, but does not include all disclosures required by GAAP.
Actual amounts could differ significantly from these estimates.
During the three months ended June 30, 2019, the Company revised the methodology used in estimating its excess and obsolete inventory reserves.
When we dispose of excess and obsolete inventories, the related disposals are charged against the inventory reserves.
See Note 8 for additional information.
During the three months ended June 30, 2019, the Company determined that there was an immaterial misstatement of its excess and obsolete inventory reserves in its previously issued annual and interim financial statements.
The Company corrected this misstatement by recognizing a $0.8 million out-of-period adjustment during the three months ended June 30, 2019, which increased its excess and obsolete inventory reserves and cost of goods sold for the period.
For the six months ended June 30, 2019, the out-of-period adjustment was a cumulative $0.2 million reduction in the Company’s excess and obsolete inventory reserves and cost of goods sold.
These criteria focus on the transfer of control of the underlying lease asset.
This standard and related updates were effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, and interim periods within those fiscal years.
As a lessee, the adoption of this standard did not have a material impact on our Condensed Consolidated Statement of Income or Statement of Cash Flows.
See Note 12 for additional information.
As a lessor, the adoption of this standard did not have a material impact on the Company’s Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet, Condensed Consolidated Statement of Income or Condensed Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows.
Contingent liabilities with a fair value totaling $1.2 million were recognized at the acquisition date, the payments of which were dependent upon SmartRG achieving future revenue, EBIT or customer purchase order milestones during the first half of 2019.
The required milestones were not achieved and, therefore, we recognized a gain of $1.2 million upon the reversal of these liabilities during the second quarter of 2019.

Many of our customers require prompt delivery of products.
This requires us to maintain sufficient inventory levels to satisfy anticipated customer demand.
Our third quarter 2019 revenue was negatively impacted by a pause in shipments to a Tier 1 customer in Latin America (“LATAM”) and the continued slowdown in spending at another international Tier 1 customer.
For the fourth quarter of 2019, our current expectations include a continued impact from a decline in sales related to these two customers.
For the international Tier 1 customer, we believe that normal spending should resume in 2020.
During the three months ended June 30, 2019, the Company changed the manner in which it estimates its excess and obsolete inventory reserves.
Under the new policy, we establish reserves for estimated excess and obsolete inventory equal to the difference between the cost of the inventory and the estimated net realizable value of the inventory based on historical usage, known trends, inventory age, and market conditions.
Amounts may not foot due to rounding.
