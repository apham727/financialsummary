The allocation of the purchase price to the assets acquired was based upon the estimated fair values at the date of acquisition.Municipal water, the largest sales category, is comprised of either mechanical or static (ultrasonic) water meters along with the related radio and software technologies and services used by municipal water utilities as the basis for generating their water and wastewater revenues.
Meters equipped with radio technology (endpoints) receive flow measurement data from battery-powered encoder registers attached to the water meter, which is encrypted and transmitted via radio frequency to a receiver that collects and formats the data appropriately for water utility usage and billing systems.
AMI systems eliminate the need for utility personnel to drive through service territories to collect data from the meters.
These systems provide the utilities with more frequent and diverse data from their meters at specified intervals.
The ORIONÂ® branded family of radio endpoints provides water utilities with a range of industry-leading options for meter reading.
It also allows for consumer engagement tools that permit end water users (such as homeowners) to view and manage their water usage activity.
Water meter replacement and the adoption and deployment of new technology comprise the majority of water meter product sales, including radio products.
Over the last decade, there has been a growing trend in the conversion from manually read water meters to meters with radio technology.
This conversion rate is accelerating, with the Company estimating that approximately 60% of water meters installed in the United States have been converted to a radio solution technology.
