Employees are eligible to receive postretirement healthcare benefits upon meeting certain age and service requirements.
No employees hired after October 31, 2004 are eligible to receive these benefits.
This plan requires employee contributions to offset benefit costs.
As of September 30, 2019, $0.3 million of such benefits have been paid.
The amount of benefits paid in calendar year 2019 will not impact the expense for postretirement benefits for 2019.
This accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) component resulted from an international pension plan settlement.
The working capital adjustment was settled in the second quarter of 2018 and the balance sheet holdback was paid in the second quarter of 2019.
The allocation of the purchase price to the assets acquired was based upon the estimated fair values at the date of acquisition.
Expenditures for compliance with environmental control provisions and regulations during 2018 and the first three quarters of 2019 were not material.
The carrying amounts of cash, receivables and payables in the financial statements approximate their fair values due to the short-term nature of these financial instruments.
Because of its short-term nature, the carrying amount of the short-term debt also approximates fair value.
The carrying amounts of these insurance policies approximate their fair value.
The effects of conditions that existed at the balance sheet date are recognized in the financial statements.

Municipal water, the largest sales category, is comprised of either mechanical or static (ultrasonic) water meters along with the related radio and software technologies and services used by municipal water utilities as the basis for generating their water and wastewater revenues.
Meters equipped with radio technology (endpoints) receive flow measurement data from battery-powered encoder registers attached to the water meter, which is encrypted and transmitted via radio frequency to a receiver that collects and formats the data appropriately for water utility usage and billing systems.
AMI systems eliminate the need for utility personnel to drive through service territories to collect data from the meters.
These systems provide the utilities with more frequent and diverse data from their meters at specified intervals.
The ORION® branded family of radio endpoints provides water utilities with a range of industry-leading options for meter reading.
It also allows for consumer engagement tools that permit end water users (such as homeowners) to view and manage their water usage activity.
Water meter replacement and the adoption and deployment of new technology comprise the majority of water meter product sales, including radio products.
Over the last decade, there has been a growing trend in the conversion from manually read water meters to meters with radio technology.
This conversion rate is accelerating, with the Company estimating that approximately 60% of water meters installed in the United States have been converted to a radio solution technology.
This portfolio carries respected brand names including Recordall®, Hedland®, Dynasonics®, Blancett®, and Research Control®, and includes eight of the ten major flow meter technologies.
Specifically, AMI technology enables water utilities to capture readings from each meter at more frequent and variable intervals.
In addition, the water utility industry is beginning the conversion from mechanical to static (ultrasonic) meters.
As of March 31, 2019, the Company had completed its analysis for estimating the fair value of the assets acquired with no additional adjustments.
This acquisition is further described in Note 5 "Acquisition" in the Unaudited Notes to Consolidated Condensed Financial Statements.
