Pegasystems Inc. (together with its subsidiaries, the Company) has prepared the accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements pursuant to the rules and regulations of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) regarding interim financial reporting.

2016-13, Financial InstrumentsCredit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments, which requires measurement and recognition of expected credit losses for financial assets measured at amortized cost, including accounts receivable, upon initial recognition of that financial asset using a forward-looking expected loss model, rather than an incurred loss model.
Credit losses relating to available-for-sale debt securities should be recorded through an allowance for credit losses when the fair value is below the amortized cost of the asset, removing the concept of other-than-temporary impairments.
2016-02, Leases (Topic 842), which requires lessees to record most leases on their balance sheets, recognizing a lease liability for the obligation to make lease payments and a right-of-use asset for the right to use the underlying asset for the lease term.

This change primarily impacts the Companys contracts related to multi-year cloud offerings, maintenance on term and perpetual licenses, and long-term term and perpetual licenses with client usage rights that increase over time.
Receivables, Contract Assets, and Deferred Revenue, Note 5.
As of September 30, 2018, remaining maturities of marketable securities ranged from October 2018 to August 2021, with a weighted-average remaining maturity of approximately 1.5 years.
Unbilled receivables are the amounts due from clients where the only condition to the right of payment is the passage of time.
As of September 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017, the allowance for doubtful accounts was not material.
Contract assets are amounts under client contracts where revenue recognized exceeds the amount billed to the client and the right to payment is subject to conditions other than the passage of time, such as the completion of a related performance obligation.
