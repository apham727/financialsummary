Our operating results for the three months ended March 31, 2018 are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for the year ending December 31, 2018.
There have been no other significant changes in our accounting policies during the three months ended March 31, 2018 compared to the significant accounting policies described in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2017.
Accounts receivable are recorded net of allowances for doubtful accounts.
Our allowance for doubtful accounts is based on historical experience.
Unbilled receivables represent amounts for which revenue has been recognized but which have not yet been invoiced to the customer.
Under this method, we evaluated all contracts that were in effect at the beginning of 2018 as if those contracts had been accounted for under the new revenue standard.
A cumulative catch-up adjustment was recorded to beginning retained earnings to reflect the impact of all existing arrangements under the new revenue standard.
We do not expect the impact of the adoption of the new standard to be material to our annual net income on an ongoing basis.
Our historical net cash flows are not impacted by this accounting change.
The guidance requires lessees to recognize most lease liabilities on their balance sheets but recognize the expenses on their income statements in a manner similar to current practice.
We are currently evaluating the effect that the updated standard will have on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.
We do not expect to adopt the new standard prior to the required effective date.
Revenue is recognized upon transfer of control of the promised products or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration we expect to receive in exchange for those products or services.
Product revenues are primarily generated from the sale of off-the-shelf modular test and measurement hardware components and related drivers, and application software licenses.
Sales of most hardware components may also include optional extended hardware warranties, which typically provide additional service-type coverage for three years from the purchase date.
Our software licenses typically provide for a perpetual right to use our software.

We are not currently a party to any material litigation.
However, in the ordinary course of our business, we are involved in a limited number of legal actions, both as plaintiff and defendant, and could incur uninsured liability in any one or more of them.
In addition to the other information set forth in this Form 10-Q, you should carefully consider the risk factors discussed below.
The risks described below are not the only risks that we face.
Uncertainty about global and regional economic conditions poses a risk to us as businesses may postpone spending in response to tighter credit, higher unemployment, financial market volatility, government austerity programs, negative financial news, geopolitical instability, declines in income or asset values, or other factors.
Negative trends or sentiments in worldwide and regional economic conditions could have a material adverse effect on demand for our products and services.
