The accompanying unaudited consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto for the year ended December 31, 2017, included in our annual report on Form 10-K, filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
Our operating results for the three and six months ended June 30, 2018 are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for the year ending December 31, 2018.
We adopted ASU 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers and all the related amendments ("new revenue standard") as of January 1, 2018.
The impact of this new guidance on our accounting policies and operating results is also described below.
Accounts receivable are recorded net of allowances for doubtful accounts.
Our allowance for doubtful accounts is based on historical experience.
We analyze historical bad debts, customer concentrations, customer creditworthiness and current economic trends when evaluating the adequacy of our allowance for doubtful accounts.
The current portion of unbilled receivables is included in accounts receivable, net on the consolidated balance sheet and is not material.
Under this method, we evaluated all contracts that were in effect at the beginning of 2018 as if those contracts had been accounted for under the new revenue standard.
Our historical net cash flows are not impacted by this accounting change.
We enter into contracts that can include various combinations of our products or services, which are generally capable of being distinct and accounted for as separate performance obligations.
Product revenues are primarily generated from the sale of off-the-shelf modular test and measurement hardware components and related drivers, and application software licenses.
Sales of most hardware components may also include optional extended hardware warranties, which typically provide additional service-type coverage for three years from the purchase date.
We do not customize software for customers and installation services are not required.
Additionally, whether a renewal option represents a distinct performance obligation could significantly impact the timing of revenue recognized.
In instances where the timing of revenue recognition differs from the timing of invoicing, we have determined our contracts generally do not include a significant financing component.

We are not currently a party to any material litigation.
However, in the ordinary course of our business, we are involved in a limited number of legal actions, both as plaintiff and defendant, and could incur uninsured liability in any one or more of them.
In addition to the other information set forth in this Form 10-Q, you should carefully consider the risk factors discussed below.
The risks described below are not the only risks that we face.
Uncertainty about global and regional economic conditions poses a risk to us as businesses may postpone spending in response to tighter credit, higher unemployment, financial market volatility, government austerity programs, negative financial news, geopolitical instability, declines in income or asset values, or other factors.
In March 2018, the U.S. imposed steel, aluminum, and other tariffs on imports from various countries.
These tariffs have increased international trade tensions and led to tariffs on U.S. exports to various countries.
