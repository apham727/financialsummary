Consequently, we have not necessarily included all information and footnotes required for audited financial statements.
See “New Accounting Pronouncements” below and Note 8.
The condensed consolidated financial statements include the accounts of FICO and its subsidiaries.
Actual results may differ from our estimates.
See Note 8 for further discussion on revenues.
This adoption primarily affected timing of revenue recognition of license revenue on term licenses and transactional revenue on guaranteed minimum fees related to our on-premises software products.
Following the adoption of ASU 2014-09, the revenue recognition for our other sales arrangements remained materially consistent with our historical practice.
The accounting guidance establishes a three-level hierarchy for disclosure that is based on the extent and level of judgment used to estimate the fair value of assets and liabilities.
The forward contracts are not designated as hedges and are marked to market through other income (expense), net.
We have a $400 million unsecured revolving line of credit with a syndicate of banks that expires on May 8, 2023 with an option to increase it by another $100 million.
Proceeds from the credit facility can be used for working capital and general corporate purposes and may also be used for the refinancing of existing debt, acquisitions and the repurchase of our common stock.
The credit agreement also contains other covenants typical of unsecured facilities.
The 2010 Senior Notes require interest payments semi-annually and contain certain restrictive covenants, including the maintenance of a maximum consolidated net debt to consolidated EBITDA ratio of 3.00 and a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio of 2.50.

Forward-looking statements are qualified by some or all of these risk factors.
In addition, we derive a significant share of revenues from transactional or unit-based software license fees, transactional fees derived under credit scoring, data processing, data management and SaaS subscription services arrangements, and annual software maintenance fees.
We continue to drive growth in our Scores segment.
We continue to enhance stockholder value by returning cash to stockholders through our stock repurchase program.
As of March 31, 2019, we had $79.5 million remaining under our current stock repurchase program.
Management uses bookings as an indicator of our business performance.
We consider contract terms, knowledge of the marketplace and experience with our customers, among other factors, when determining the estimated value of contract bookings.
While we disclose estimated revenue expected to be recognized in the future related to unsatisfied performance obligations in Note 8 to the accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements, we believe bookings amount is still a meaningful measure of our business as it includes estimated revenues omitted from Note 8, such as sales- or usage-based royalties derived from our software licenses, among others.

Our DM strategy is also increasingly focused on the delivery of our products through cloud-based deployments.
The market may be unreceptive to our general DM business approach, including being unreceptive to purchasing multiple products from us, unreceptive to our customized solutions, or unreceptive to our cloud-based offerings.
We derive a substantial portion of our revenues from a small number of products and services, and if the market does not continue to accept these products and services, our revenues will decline.
Our growth and the success of our DM strategy depend upon our ability to develop and sell new products or suites of products, including the development and sale of our cloud-based product offerings.
We rely on relatively few customers, as well as our contracts with the three major credit reporting agencies, for a significant portion of our revenues and profits.
Many of our customers are significantly larger than we are and may have greater bargaining power.
Most of our customers are relatively large enterprises, such as banks, payment card processors, insurance companies, healthcare firms, telecommunications providers, retailers and public agencies.
As a result, many of our customers and potential customers are significantly larger than we are and may have sufficient bargaining power to demand reduced prices and favorable nonstandard terms.
