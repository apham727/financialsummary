For additional information, refer to Part 1, Item 1, "Business", in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2017.
The Consolidated Balance Sheets as of September 30, 2017 were derived from audited financial statements.
The adjustments, relating primarily to accumulated earnings taxes of a foreign operation, increased the income tax expense for the first quarter of fiscal 2018 by $2,071.
During the first quarter of fiscal 2018, the Company entered into a managed investment arrangement with a third party to invest in fixed income securities.
We have presented these securities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets as of December 31, 2017 as a current asset due to management's intent to use these funds for current business requirements.
Fair value is defined as the price that would be received from the sale of an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date.
Level 1 inputs consist of valuations based on quoted market prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
Level 2 inputs consist of valuations based on quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities, quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in an inactive market, or other observable inputs.
Level 3 inputs consist of valuations based on unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity.
See Note 8 for a detailed discussion of our long-term debt.
In instances where the inputs used to measure the fair value of an asset fall into more than one level of the hierarchy, we have classified them based on the lowest-level input that is significant to the determination of the fair value.
We are invested exclusively in AAA-rated, prime institutional money market funds, comprised of high quality, fixed income securities.
Our other long-term investments represent the fair value of investments under the Cabot Microelectronics Supplemental Employee Retirement Plan (SERP), which is a nonqualified supplemental savings plan.
The fair value of the investments is determined through quoted market prices within actively traded markets.
The increase in goodwill was due to $808 in foreign exchange fluctuations of the New Taiwan dollar.
In the first quarter of fiscal 2018, we adopted ASU No.
2017-04 "Simplifying the Test for Goodwill Impairment."

Forward-looking statements reflect our current expectations and are inherently uncertain.
We assume no obligation to update this forward-looking information.
In our first quarter of fiscal 2018, we experienced continued solid demand for our products, particularly for memory and logic applications, as well as continued strength in China.
Some semiconductor industry analysts continue to expect solid industry demand conditions throughout our fiscal year, especially for 3D memory technology.
We achieved record quarterly revenue in our tungsten slurry and polishing pads product areas.
Revenue from our tungsten, pads and dielectrics products increased 13.7%, 16.5% and 8.4%, respectively, from the same quarter last year.

However, we may update our risk factors, including adding or deleting them, in our SEC filings from time to time for clarification purposes or to include additional information, at management's discretion, even when there have been no material changes.
Furthermore, competitive dynamics within the semiconductor industry may impact our business.
For instance, we could experience negative impacts on cash flows due to the inability of our customers to pay their obligations to us, or our production process could be harmed if our suppliers cannot fulfill their obligations to us.
Our business would suffer if these products became obsolete or if consumption of these products decreased.
