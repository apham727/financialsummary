The financial statements contained in this Form 10-Q are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for the year ending December 31, 2019 or for any other future periods.
Except for the changes related to leases discussed in Note 6, there have been no other changes to the Company’s significant accounting policies during the three months ended March 31, 2019 as compared to the significant accounting policies described in the Company’s audited consolidated financial statements included in the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018.
The adoption did not have a material impact on the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations or the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.
See Note 6 for further discussion of the impact of the adoption on the Company’s financial statements.
The guidance removes step two of the goodwill impairment test, which requires a hypothetical purchase price allocation.
A goodwill impairment will now be the amount by which a reporting unit’s carrying value exceeds its fair value, not to exceed the carrying amount of goodwill.
Entities will continue to have the option to perform a qualitative assessment to determine if a quantitative impairment test is necessary.
In addition, for available-for-sale debt securities, entities will be required to recognize an allowance for credit losses rather than reductions in the amortized cost of the securities.
The Company is evaluating the impact of the adoption on its consolidated financial position, results of operations, cash flows and disclosures.
The Company sells its products primarily through third-party distributors, value-added resellers, original equipment manufacturers, original design manufacturers and electronic manufacturing service providers.
The Company considers purchase orders to be the contracts with customers.
The unit price as stated on the purchase orders is considered the observable, stand-alone selling price for the arrangements.
The Company excludes taxes assessed by government authorities, such as sales taxes, from revenue.
Under certain consignment agreements, revenue is not recognized when the products are shipped and delivered to be held at customers’ designated locations because the Company continues to control the products and retain ownership, and the customers do not have an unconditional obligation to pay.
The Company recognizes revenue when the customers consume the products from the consigned inventory locations or, in some cases, after a 60-day period from the delivery date has passed, at which time control transfers to the customers and the Company invoices them for payment.

We defend ourselves vigorously against any such claims.
•   changes in the estimation of the future size and growth rate of our markets.
In recent years, global credit and financial markets experienced disruptions, and may experience disruptions in the future, including diminished liquidity and credit availability, declines in consumer confidence, declines in economic growth, increases in unemployment rates, and uncertainty about economic stability.
Rising concern of international tariffs, including tariffs applied to goods traded between the United States and China, could materially and adversely affect our business and results of operations.
We may not be profitable on a quarterly or annual basis.
We may not experience growth rates comparable to past years.
Industry consolidation may lead to increased competition and may harm our operating results.
As we develop new product lines, we must adapt to market conditions that are unfamiliar to us, such as competitors and distribution channels that are different from those we have known in the past.
Some of our new product lines require us to re-equip our labs to test parameters we have not tested in the past.
If we are unable to adapt rapidly to these new and additional conditions, we may not be able to successfully penetrate new markets.
