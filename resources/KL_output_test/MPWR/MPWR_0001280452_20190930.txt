We defend ourselves vigorously against any such claims.
The future trading price of our common stock could be subject to wide fluctuations in response to a variety of factors.
In addition, the stock market often experiences substantial volatility that may be unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies.
We cannot predict the timing, strength or duration of any economic disruption or subsequent economic recovery worldwide, in the United States, in our industry, or in the different markets that we serve.
We are subject to export restrictions and laws affecting trade and investments that could materially and adversely affect our business and results of operations.
As a global company headquartered in the U.S., we are subject to U.S. laws and regulations that could limit and restrict the export of some of our products and services and may restrict our transactions with certain customers, business partners and other persons, including, in certain cases, dealings with or between our employees and subsidiaries.
We maintain an export compliance program but there are risks that the compliance controls could be circumvented, exposing us to legal liabilities.
Moreover, U.S. government’s actions targeting exports of certain technologies to China are becoming more pervasive.
For example, in May 2019, President Trump issued an executive order that invoked national emergency economic powers to implement a framework to regulate the acquisition or transfer of information communications technology in transactions that imposed undue national security risks.
These actions could lead to additional restrictions on the export of products that include or enable certain technologies, including products we provide to China-based customers.
