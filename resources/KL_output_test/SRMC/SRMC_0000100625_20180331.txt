In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, issued as a new Topic, ASC Topic 606 (ASU 2014-09).
The premise of the standard is that a Company should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services.
ASU 2014-09 can be adopted by the Company either retrospectively under the full retrospective approach or as a cumulative-effect adjustment as of the date of adoption under the modified retrospective approach.
However, the Company has changed its implementation to the modified retrospective approach.
Adoption of the standard did not have a material impact on our financial statements.
See Critical Accounting Policies for disclosures.
Management has not yet determined the effect of this ASU on the Company’s financial statements.
