In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued ASU 2014-09, “Revenue from Contracts with Customers” (Topic 606).
ASC 606 requires the recognition of revenue when promised goods or services are transferred to customers in an amount that reflects the considerations to which the entity expects to be entitled to in exchange for those goods or services.
The majority of the impact has been on sales returns and the impact has been deemed immaterial.
The creditworthiness of customers is assessed prior to the Company accepting a customer’s first order.
Revenue recognition occurs only when the service activity is completed.
Such services are provided to current and prior customers, and, as noted above, creditworthiness has generally already been assessed.
In cases where the probability of receiving payment is low, a credit card number is collected for immediate processing.For the three-month period ended September 30, 2018, Sierra Monitor Corporation (“we” or the “Company”) reported net sales of $5,994,234 compared to $5,177,199 for the three-month period ended September 30, 2017.
