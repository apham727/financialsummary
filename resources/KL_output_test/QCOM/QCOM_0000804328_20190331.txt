Financial Statement Preparation.
In the opinion of management, the interim financial information includes all normal recurring adjustments necessary for a fair statement of the results for the interim periods.
Operating results for interim periods are not necessarily indicative of operating results for an entire fiscal year.
Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current year presentation.
As previously disclosed, in connection with the preparation of our condensed consolidated financial statements for the three months ended December 30, 2018, we identified an immaterial error related to the recognition of certain royalty revenues of our QTL (Qualcomm Technology Licensing) segment in the quarterly and annual periods in fiscal 2018 and third and fourth quarters and annual period in fiscal 2017.
A summary of revisions to certain previously reported financial information presented herein for comparative purposes is included in Note 11.
At March 31, 2019, total unrecognized compensation expense related to nonvested restricted stock units granted prior to that date was $1.4 billion, which is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 2.2 years.
Adoption of this new accounting guidance most significantly impacts the timing of sales-based royalty revenues, which are the vast majority of our QTL segment’s revenues.Additionally, statements concerning future matters that are not historical are forward-looking statements, such as statements regarding our expectations concerning: industry, market, business, commercial, competitive or consumer trends; our businesses, growth potential or strategies, or factors that may impact them; attacks on our licensing business, including by licensees, customers, governments, governmental agencies or regulators, standards bodies or others; other legal or regulatory matters; competition; product or technology trends; new or expanded product areas, adjacent industry segments or applications; costs or expenditures including research and development, selling, general and administrative, restructuring or restructuring-related charges, working capital or information technology systems; our financing, stock repurchase or dividend programs; strategic investments or acquisitions; adoption and application of future accounting guidance; tax law changes; our tax structure or strategies; or the potential business or financial statement impacts of any of the above.
Although forward-looking statements in this Quarterly Report reflect our good faith judgment, such statements can only be based on facts and factors currently known by us.
in subsequent quarters to reflect changes in estimates as new information becomes available, primarily when actual amounts are reported by licensees.
Prior period results have not been restated for the adoption of the new accounting guidance and continue to be reported in accordance with the accounting guidance in effect for those periods.
•QTL results were negatively impacted by our prior dispute with Apple and its contract manufacturers.
Revenues in the second quarter of fiscal 2019 did not include royalties due on sales of Apple or other products by Apple’s contract manufacturers.
QTL revenues in the second quarter of fiscal 2019 included $150 million of royalties due under an interim agreement with Huawei.
This represents a minimum, non-refundable amount for royalties due for the second quarter of fiscal 2019 by Huawei while negotiations continue.
This payment does not reflect the full amount of royalties due under the underlying license agreement.
•In the second quarter of fiscal 2018, we announced a Cost Plan designed to align our cost structure to our long-term margin targets, under which we initiated a series of targeted actions across our businesses with the objective to reduce annual costs by $1 billion, excluding incremental costs resulting from any future acquisition of a business.
Actions taken under this plan have been completed and have resulted in us achieving substantially all of this target in fiscal 2019 based on our run rate exiting the second quarter of fiscal 2019, excluding litigation costs that are in excess of the baseline spend.
