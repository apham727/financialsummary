In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Accounting Standards Update ("ASU") 2014-09, "Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606)".
The guidance in this ASU affects any entity that either enters into contracts with customers to transfer goods or services or enters into contracts for the transfer of nonfinancial assets unless those contracts are within the scope of other standards (for example, insurance contracts or lease contracts).
This guidance requires a company to recognize revenue to depict the transfer of goods or services to a customer at an amount that reflects the consideration it expects to receive in exchange for those goods or services.
Beginning in January 2018, CTS adopted the provisions of Topic 606 under the modified retrospective method, which requires a cumulative effect adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings on the date of adoption.
This approach was applied to contracts not completed as of December 31, 2017.
Our contracts normally contain a single performance obligation that is fulfilled on the date of delivery based on shipping terms stipulated in the contract.
We usually expect payment within 30 to 90 days from the shipping date, depending on our terms with the customer.
Contract assets will be reviewed for impairment when events or circumstances indicate that they may not be recoverable.
During the three months period ended March 31, 2018, we recognized revenues of $131 that were included in contract liabilities at the beginning of the period.
Additional organizational changes will also occur in various other locations.
During the third quarter of 2017, we revised the June 2016 Plan.
The amendment does not impact any additional employees.
These restructuring actions, which were completed during 2015, impacted approximately 120 positions.

The difference to be paid or received under the terms of the swap agreements will be recognized as an adjustment to interest expense when settled.
If we subsequently change our assertion during the measurement period, we will account for the change in assertion as a change in estimate related to the enactment of the Act.
