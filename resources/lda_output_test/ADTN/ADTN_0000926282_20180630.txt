In February 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842). ASU 2016-02 requires an entity to recognize lease assets and lease liabilities on the balance sheet and to disclose key information about the entity's leasing arrangements. Subsequently, in July 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-10, Codification Improvements to Topic 842, Leases, which clarified certain aspects of ASU 2016-02. ASU 2016-02 and ASU 2018-10 are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, and interim periods within those fiscal years. A modified retrospective approach is required. We anticipate the adoption of these ASUs will have a material increase in the assets and liabilities of our consolidated balance sheets; however, we do not believe adoption will have a material effect on our results of operations. We believe the most significant effect relates to our accounting for operating leases for office space and equipment. 
These ASUs primarily affected our network implementation service revenue performance obligations and contract costs. We are using the “output method” to measure network implementation services progress, which 1) accelerates revenue recognition for certain performance obligations related to service revenue arrangements that were previously deferred until customer acceptance and 2) requires capitalization and amortization of the incremental costs of obtaining a contract as described below.  
We recorded a bargain purchase gain of $11.3 million during the first quarter of 2018, net of income taxes, which is subject to customary working capital adjustments between the parties. The bargain purchase gain of $11.3 million represents the difference between the fair value of the net assets acquired over the cash paid. SEI, an OEM supplier based in Japan, is the global market leader in EPON. SEI’s Broadband Networks Division, through its SEL subsidiary, operated a North American EPON business that included sales, marketing, support, and region-specific engineering development. The North American EPON market is primarily driven by the Tier 1 cable MSO operators and has developed more slowly than anticipated. Through the transaction, SEI divested its North American EPON assets and established a relationship with ADTRAN. The transfer of these assets to ADTRAN, which included key customer relationships and a required assumption by ADTRAN of relatively low incremental expenses, along with the value of the technology license and OEM supply agreement, resulted in the bargain purchase gain. We have assessed the recognition and measurement of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on historical and forecasted data for future periods and we have concluded that our valuation procedures and resulting measures were appropriate. 
The following unaudited supplemental pro forma information presents the financial results as if the acquisition had occurred on January 1, 2017. This unaudited supplemental pro forma information does not purport to be indicative of what would have occurred had the acquisition been completed on January 1, 2017, nor is it indicative of any future results. Aside from revising the 2017 and 2018 net income for the effect of the bargain purchase gain, there were no material, non-recurring adjustments to this unaudited pro forma information. 
Revenue is measured based on the consideration we expect to receive in exchange for transferring goods or providing services to a customer and as performance obligations under the terms of the contract are satisfied. Generally, this occurs with the transfer of control of a product or service to the customer. For transactions where there are multiple performance obligations, we account for individual products and services separately if they are distinct (if a product or service is separately identifiable from other items and if a customer can benefit from it on its own or with other resources that are readily available to the customer). The consideration, including any discounts, is allocated between separate products and services based on their stand-alone selling prices. The stand-alone selling prices are determined based on the prices at which we sell the separate products and services and are allocated based on each item’s relative value to the total value of the products and services in the arrangement. For items that are not sold separately, we estimate stand-alone selling prices primarily using the “expected cost plus a margin” approach. Payment terms are typically 30 days. Shipping fees are recorded as revenue and the related cost is included in cost of sales. Sales, value-added, and other taxes collected concurrently with revenue-producing activities are excluded from revenue. Costs of obtaining a contract are capitalized and amortized over the period that the related revenue is recognized if greater than one year. We have elected to apply the practical expedient related to the incremental costs of obtaining contracts and recognize those costs as an expense when incurred if the amortization period of the assets is one year or less. These costs are included in selling, general and administrative expenses. Capitalized costs with an amortization period greater than one year were immaterial. 
The majority of the revenue from this segment is from hardware sales and is recognized when control is transferred to our customers, which is generally when we ship the products. Shipping terms are generally FOB shipping point. Revenue is recorded net of estimated discounts and rebates using the most likely amount. Customers are typically invoiced when control is transferred and revenue is recognized. Our products generally include assurance-based warranties of 90 days to five years for product defects, which are accrued at the time revenue is recognized. 
Our maintenance service periods range from one month to five years. Customers are typically invoiced and pay for maintenance services at the beginning of the maintenance period. Payments received are recorded in current or non-current unearned revenue depending on the length of the service period. We recognize revenue for maintenance services on a straight-line basis over the maintenance period in services revenue as our customers benefit evenly throughout the contract term. 
We recognize revenue for network implementation, which primarily consists of engineering, execution and enablement services, at a point in time when each performance obligation is complete. If we have recognized revenue, but have not billed the customer, the right to consideration is recognized as a contract asset that is included in other receivables in the Consolidated Balance Sheet. The contract asset is transferred to accounts receivable when the completed performance obligation is invoiced to the customer. 
Our effective tax rate decreased from an expense of 27.3% in the six months ended June 30, 2017, to a benefit of 20.1%, excluding the tax effect of the bargain purchase gain, in the six months ended June 30, 2018. The decrease in the effective tax rate between the two periods is primarily attributable to the change in income and the effect of the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, which was signed into law on December 22, 2017.  
The fair value of our stock options is estimated using the Black-Scholes model. The determination of the fair value of stock options on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes model is affected by our stock price, as well as assumptions regarding a number of complex and subjective variables that may have a significant impact on the fair value estimate. 
The fair value of our PSUs with market conditions is calculated using a Monte Carlo Simulation valuation method. The fair value of RSUs and restricted stock is equal to the closing price of our stock on the date of grant. During the first quarter of 2017, the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors approved a PSU grant of 0.5 million shares that contain performance conditions. The fair value of these performance-based PSU awards was equal to the closing price of our stock on the date of grant.  
Prior to January 1, 2018, our marketable equity securities were classified as available-for-sale. Realized gains and losses on marketable equity securities were included in net realized investment gain (loss). Unrealized gains and losses were recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income, net of deferred taxes, on the balance sheet. 
The fair value of our Level 2 securities is calculated using a weighted average market price for each security. Market prices are obtained from a variety of industry standard data providers, security master files from large financial institutions, and other third-party sources. These multiple market prices are used as inputs into a distribution-curve-based algorithm to determine the daily market value of each security. 
Our cash flow hedging activities utilize foreign exchange forward contracts to reduce the risk that movements in exchange rates will adversely affect the net cash flows resulting from the planned purchase of products from foreign suppliers. Purchases of U.S. denominated inventory by our European subsidiary represent our primary exposure. Changes in the fair value of derivatives designated as cash flow hedges are not recognized in current operating results, but are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income. Amounts related to cash flow hedges are reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive income when the underlying hedged item impacts earnings. This reclassification is recorded in cost of sales, the same line item of the Consolidated Statements of Income at which the effects of the hedged item are recorded. 
We do not hold or issue derivative instruments for trading or other speculative purposes. Our derivative instruments are recorded in the Consolidated Balance Sheets at their fair values. Our derivative instruments are not subject to master netting arrangements and are not offset in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. 
We establish reserves for estimated excess, obsolete, or unmarketable inventory equal to the difference between the cost of the inventory and the estimated fair value of the inventory based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions. At June 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017, raw materials reserves totaled $17.5 million and $15.0 million, respectively, and finished goods inventory reserves totaled $9.7 million and $8.3 million, respectively.

We recognized a positive revenue impact in the first half of 2017 due to our being awarded a network expansion program by a large European Tier-1 customer. During the first and second quarters of 2018, this European Tier 1 customer undertook an additional network expansion project. We anticipate that as our Latin American customers resume their network upgrade projects, we may experience further enhancement to our revenues. We have recently announced receipt of a new nation-wide award in the APAC region, as well as additional awards based on new ADTRAN technologies in the EMEA region that we believe will likely result in a positive impact to our revenues. However, a resolution of the regulatory changes affecting a major customer in Mexico has been slower than anticipated, and business with one of our customers in that region has not yet returned to normal levels. We are continuing to pursue opportunities with new customers in this region. 
As a percentage of sales, cost of sales increased from 54.2% in the three months ended June 30, 2017 to 61.0% in the three months ended June 30, 2018, and increased from 55.4% in the six months ended June 30, 2017 to 63.9% in the six months ended June 30, 2018. The increase in cost of sales as a percentage of sales for the three months ended June 30, 2018 is primarily attributable to a regional revenue shift, customer and product mix, services and support mix and an increase in warranty expense. The increase in cost of sales as a percentage of sales for the six months ended June 30, 2018 is primarily attributable to a regional revenue shift, customer and product mix, services and support mix, an increase in labor expense due to a restructuring program and an increase in warranty expense. 
Network Solutions cost of sales, as a percent of that segment’s sales, increased from 51.2% in the three months ended June 30, 2017 to 60.5% in the three months ended June 30, 2018, and increased from 52.3% in the six months ended June 30, 2017 to 62.7% in the six months ended June 30, 2018. The increase in cost of sales as a percentage of sales for the three months ended June 30, 2018 is primarily attributable to a regional revenue shift, customer and product mix and an increase in warranty expense. The increase in cost of sales as a percentage of sales for the six months ended June 30, 2018 is primarily attributable to a regional revenue shift, customer and product mix, an increase in labor expense due to a restructuring program, an increase in warranty expense due to a settlement in first quarter of 2017 with a third party supplier for a defective component and purchase discounts received from a contract manufacturer in the first quarter of 2017. 
Selling, general and administrative expenses decreased 7.6% from $34.7 million in the three months ended June 30, 2017 to $32.1 million in the three months ended June 30, 2018, and decreased 5.6% from $69.5 million in the six months ended June 30, 2017 to $65.6 million in the six months ended June 30, 2018. The decrease in selling, general and administrative expenses for the three months ended June 30, 2018 is primarily attributable to decreases in performance-based compensation expense, travel expense, deferred compensation expense, and independent contractor expense, partially offset by an increase in labor expense due to a restructuring program. The decrease in selling, general and administrative expenses for the six months ended June 30, 2018 is primarily attributable to a decrease in deferred compensation expense, performance-based compensation expense, travel expense, and independent contractor expense, partially offset by an increase in labor expense due to a restructuring program. 
Research and development expenses decreased 8.4% from $33.6 million in the three months ended June 30, 2017 to $30.7 million in the three months ended June 30, 2018, and decreased 3.0% from $65.5 million in the six months ended June 30, 2017 to $63.6 million in the six months ended June 30, 2018. The decrease in research and development expenses for the three months ended June 30, 2018 is primarily attributable to decreases in engineering materials, independent contractor expense, amortization of intangibles acquired in the third quarter of 2016 that were fully amortized in 2017, and performance-based compensation expense. The decrease in research and development expenses for the six months ended June 30, 2018 is primarily attributable to decreases in engineering materials and amortization of intangibles acquired in the third quarter of 2016 that were fully amortized in 2017, partially offset by an increase in labor expense due to a restructuring program. 
Interest and dividend income decreased 6.1% from $1.0 million in the three months ended June 30, 2017 to $0.9 million in the three months ended June 30, 2018, and decreased 6.6% from $1.9 million in the six months ended June 30, 2017 to $1.8 million in the six months ended June 30, 2018. The decrease in interest and dividend income for the three and six months ended June 30, 2018 is primarily attributable to a decrease in investment balances and a decrease in the rate of return on those investments. 
Net realized investment gains decreased 28.8% from $1.4 million in the three months ended June 30, 2017 to $1.0 million in the three months ended June 30, 2018, and decreased 52.0% from $1.9 million in the six months ended June 30, 2017 to $0.9 million in the six months ended June 30, 2018. The decrease in net realized investment gains for the three and six months ended June 30, 2018 is primarily attributable to changes in fair value on equity securities recognized during the period under ASC 2016-01. Prior to January 1, 2018, changes in fair value were recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income, net of deferred taxes, on the balance sheet. See Note 1, Note 7 and “Investing Activities” in “Liquidity and Capital Resources” below for additional information. 
Other expense, net, comprised primarily of miscellaneous income, gains and losses on foreign currency transactions, gains and losses on foreign exchange forward contracts, investment account management fees, and scrap raw material sales, decreased 69.8% from $0.7 million of expense in the three months ended June 30, 2017 to $0.2 million of expense in the three months ended June 30, 2018, and decreased 53.2% from $0.6 million of expense in the six months ended June 30, 2017 to $0.3 million of expense in the six months ended June 30, 2018. The change in other expense, net for the three and six months ended June 30, 2018 is primarily attributable to higher losses on foreign exchange contracts in 2017. 
We intend to finance our operations with cash flow from operations. We have used, and expect to continue to use, the cash generated from operations for working capital, purchases of treasury stock, shareholder dividends, and other general corporate purposes, including (i) product development activities to enhance our existing products and develop new products and (ii) expansion of sales and marketing activities. We believe our cash and cash equivalents, investments and cash generated from operations to be adequate to meet our operating and capital needs for at least the next 12 months. 
At June 30, 2018, cash on hand was $100.3 million and short-term investments were $6.1 million, which resulted in available short-term liquidity of $106.4 million, of which $83.0 million was held by our foreign subsidiaries. At December 31, 2017, cash on hand was $86.4 million and short-term investments were $16.1 million, which resulted in available short-term liquidity of $102.6 million, of which $56.8 million was held by our foreign subsidiaries. We intend to permanently reinvest the funds held by our foreign subsidiaries outside the U.S. and our current business plans do not indicate a need to repatriate these funds to finance domestic operations. The increase in short-term liquidity from December 31, 2017 to June 30, 2018 is primarily attributable to shifts among available investment option tenures to provide funds for our short-term cash needs. 
Accounts receivable decreased 47.2% from $144.2 million at December 31, 2017 to $76.1 million at June 30, 2018. We had no allowance for doubtful accounts at December 31, 2017 or June 30, 2018. Quarterly accounts receivable days sales outstanding (DSO) decreased from 105 days as of December 31, 2017 to 54 days as of June 30, 2018. The decrease in net accounts receivable is due to the collection of customer-specific payment terms that became due in the first quarter of 2018 and the timing of sales and collections during the quarter. Additionally, certain international customers may have longer payment terms than U.S. customers.

As of June 30, 2018, approximately $67.7 million of our cash and investments may be directly affected by changes in interest rates. We have performed a hypothetical sensitivity analysis assuming market interest rates increase or decrease by 50 basis points (bps) for an entire year, while all other variables remain constant. At June 30, 2018, we held $23.0 million of cash and variable-rate investments where a change in interest rates would impact our interest income. A hypothetical 50 bps decline in interest rates as of June 30, 2018 would reduce annualized interest income on our cash and investments by approximately $0.1 million. In addition, we held $44.7 million of fixed-rate bonds whose fair values may be directly affected by a change in interest rates. A hypothetical 50 bps increase in interest rates as of June 30, 2018 would reduce the fair value of our fixed-rate bonds by approximately $0.3 million.

On July 14, 2015, our Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of an additional 5.0 million shares of our common stock (bringing the total shares authorized for repurchase to 50.0 million). This authorization will be implemented through open market or private purchases from time to time as conditions warrant.
