Accordingly, certain information and notes required by generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America (“GAAP”) for complete financial statements are not included herein.
Our more significant estimates include the excess, obsolete and slow moving inventory reserves, warranty reserves, customer rebates, determination of the deferred and accrued revenue components of multiple performance obligations sales agreements, estimated costs to complete obligations associated with deferred and accrued revenue, estimated income tax provision and income tax contingencies, the fair value of stock-based compensation, impairment of goodwill, valuation and estimated lives of intangible assets, estimated pension liability, fair value of investments and the evaluation of other-than-temporary declines in the value of investments.
During the three months ended June 30, 2019, the Company determined that there was an immaterial misstatement of its excess and obsolete inventory reserves in its previously issued annual and interim financial statements.
The Company corrected this misstatement by recognizing a $0.8 million out-of-period adjustment during the three months ended June 30, 2019, which increased its excess and obsolete inventory reserve and cost of goods sold for the period.
For the six months ended June 30, 2019, the out-of-period adjustment was a cumulative $0.2 million reduction in its excess and obsolete inventory reserve and cost of goods sold.
In July 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-10, Codification Improvements to Topic 842, Leases, which clarified certain aspects of ASU 2016-02, as well as ASU 2018-11, Leases (Topic 842), Targeted Improvements, which provided for an optional transition method allowing for the application of the legacy lease guidance, Leases (Topic 840), including its disclosure requirements, for the comparative periods presented in the year of adoption, with the cumulative effect of initially applying the new lease standard recognized as an adjustment to retained earnings as of the date of adoption.
In March 2019, the FASB issued ASU 2019-01, Leases (Topic 842) Codification Improvements, which removed the requirement for an entity to disclose in the interim periods after adoption, the effect of the change on income from continuing operations, net income, any other affected financial statement line item, and any affected per share amount.
This standard and related updates were effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, and interim periods within those fiscal years.
In addition, the Company elected the package of practical expedients which allows for companies to not reassess whether any expired or existing contracts are or contain leases, not reassess historical lease classifications for expired or existing contracts and not reassess initial direct costs for existing leases.
Additionally, the Company elected the practical expedients which allow the use of hindsight when determining the lease term, the short-term lease recognition exemption and the option to not separate lease and non-lease components.The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the related notes that appear in Part I, Item 1 of this document.
See Note 14 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Part I, Item 1 of this report for further information regarding these segments and revenue categories.
In the second quarter of 2019, we had three 10% of revenue customers geographically diversified in Latin America (“LATAM”), Europe, and the U.S. For the third and fourth quarter of 2019, our current expectations include the effect of a temporary slowdown in capital spending in one of these regions for access at a Tier-1 European carrier customer for the remainder of 2019, however the full effect of this slowdown has not yet been determined.
During the three months ended June 30, 2019, the Company changed the manner in which it estimates its excess and obsolete inventory reserves.
Under the new policy, we establish reserves for estimated excess and obsolete inventory equal to the difference between the cost of the inventory and the estimated net realizable value of the inventory based on historical usage, known trends, inventory age, and market conditions.
As a percentage of sales, cost of sales decreased from 61.0% for the three months ended June 30, 2018 to 58.4% for the three months ended June 30, 2019 and decreased from 63.9% for the six months ended June 30, 2018 to 58.2% for the six months ended June 30, 2019.Although these depository investments may exceed government insured depository limits, we have evaluated the credit-worthiness of these financial institutions, and determined the risk of material financial loss due to exposure of such credit risk to be minimal.We must perform system and process evaluation and testing of our internal control over financial reporting to allow management and our independent auditors to report on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting, as required by Section 404.
