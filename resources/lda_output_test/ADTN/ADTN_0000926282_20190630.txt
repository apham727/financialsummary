Accordingly, certain information and notes required by generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America (“GAAP”) for complete financial statements are not included herein.
The December 31, 2018 Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet is derived from audited financial statements, but does not include all disclosures required by GAAP.
Our more significant estimates include the excess, obsolete and slow moving inventory reserves, warranty reserves, customer rebates, determination of the deferred and accrued revenue components of multiple performance obligations sales agreements, estimated costs to complete obligations associated with deferred and accrued revenue, estimated income tax provision and income tax contingencies, the fair value of stock-based compensation, impairment of goodwill, valuation and estimated lives of intangible assets, estimated pension liability, fair value of investments and the evaluation of other-than-temporary declines in the value of investments.
During the three months ended June 30, 2019, the Company determined that there was an immaterial misstatement of its excess and obsolete inventory reserves in its previously issued annual and interim financial statements.
The Company corrected this misstatement by recognizing a $0.8 million out-of-period adjustment during the three months ended June 30, 2019, which increased its excess and obsolete inventory reserve and cost of goods sold for the period.
ASU 2016-02 requires an entity to recognize right-of-use assets and lease liabilities on the balance sheet and to disclose key information about the entity’s leasing arrangements.
In July 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-10, Codification Improvements to Topic 842, Leases, which clarified certain aspects of ASU 2016-02, as well as ASU 2018-11, Leases (Topic 842), Targeted Improvements, which provided for an optional transition method allowing for the application of the legacy lease guidance, Leases (Topic 840), including its disclosure requirements, for the comparative periods presented in the year of adoption, with the cumulative effect of initially applying the new lease standard recognized as an adjustment to retained earnings as of the date of adoption.
In March 2019, the FASB issued ASU 2019-01, Leases (Topic 842) Codification Improvements, which removed the requirement for an entity to disclose in the interim periods after adoption, the effect of the change on income from continuing operations, net income, any other affected financial statement line item, and any affected per share amount.
This standard and related updates were effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, and interim periods within those fiscal years.
In addition, the Company elected the package of practical expedients which allows for companies to not reassess whether any expired or existing contracts are or contain leases, not reassess historical lease classifications for expired or existing contracts and not reassess initial direct costs for existing leases.
Additionally, the Company elected the practical expedients which allow the use of hindsight when determining the lease term, the short-term lease recognition exemption and the option to not separate lease and non-lease components.
As a lessor, the adoption of this standard did not have a material impact on the Company’s Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet, Condensed Consolidated Statement of Income or Condensed Statement of Cash Flow.
Contingent liabilities with a fair value totaling $1.2 million were recognized at the acquisition date, the payments of which were dependent upon SmartRG achieving future revenue, EBIT or customer purchase order milestones during the first half of 2019.
An escrow in the amount of $2.8 million was set up at the acquisition date to fund post-closing working capital settlements and to satisfy indemnity obligations to the Company arising from any inaccuracy or breach of representations, warranties, covenants, agreements or obligations of the sellers.
We recorded goodwill of $3.5 million as a result of this acquisition, which represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of net assets acquired.

In addition, the following discussion should be read in conjunction with our audited consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2018, Part II, Item 7, Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, Part I, Item 1, Business, and Item 1A, Risk Factors, included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018 filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) on February 28, 2019 (the “2018 Form 10-K”).
In the second quarter of 2019, we had three 10% of revenue customers geographically diversified in Latin America (“LATAM”), Europe, and the U.S. For the third and fourth quarter of 2019, our current expectations include the effect of a temporary slowdown in capital spending in one of these regions for access at a Tier-1 European carrier customer for the remainder of 2019, however the full effect of this slowdown has not yet been determined.
During the three months ended June 30, 2019, the Company changed the manner in which it estimates its excess and obsolete inventory reserves.
Under the new policy, we establish reserves for estimated excess and obsolete inventory equal to the difference between the cost of the inventory and the estimated net realizable value of the inventory based on historical usage, known trends, inventory age, and market conditions.

Although these depository investments may exceed government insured depository limits, we have evaluated the credit-worthiness of these financial institutions, and determined the risk of material financial loss due to exposure of such credit risk to be minimal.
As of June 30, 2019, $106.2 million of our cash and cash equivalents, primarily certain domestic money market funds and foreign depository accounts, were in excess of government provided insured depository limits.

We must perform system and process evaluation and testing of our internal control over financial reporting to allow management and our independent auditors to report on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting, as required by Section 404.
Specifically, management has determined that controls were not effectively designed, documented, and maintained to verify that the existence of all inventories subject to our cycle count program were included and counted at the frequency required under the Company’s internal policies, and that the key reports and related data used to monitor the results of this program were not validated to ensure completeness and accuracy.
