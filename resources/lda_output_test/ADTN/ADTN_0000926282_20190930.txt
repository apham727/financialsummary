In the opinion of management, all adjustments necessary to fairly state these interim statements have been recorded and are of a normal and recurring nature. The results of operations for an interim period are not necessarily indicative of the results for the full year. The interim financial statements should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in ADTRAN’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018, filed with the SEC on February 28, 2019 (as amended on September 20, 2019, the “2018 Form 10-K”). 
During the three months ended June 30, 2019, the Company revised the methodology used in estimating its excess and obsolete inventory reserves. Under the revised methodology, we establish reserves for estimated excess and obsolete inventory equal to the difference between the cost of the inventory and the estimated net realizable value of the inventory based on historical usage, known trends, inventory age, and market conditions. When we dispose of excess and obsolete inventories, the related disposals are charged against the inventory reserves. See Note 8 for additional information. 
The Company adopted the new standard on January 1, 2019, the effective date of our initial application, using the optional transition method. At that time, the Company elected to carry forward the legacy ASC 840 disclosures for comparative periods and, therefore, did not adjust the comparative period financial information prior to January 1, 2019. In addition, the Company elected the package of practical expedients which allows for companies to not reassess whether any expired or existing contracts are or contain leases, not reassess historical lease classifications for expired or existing contracts and not reassess initial direct costs for existing leases. Additionally, the Company elected the practical expedients which allow the use of hindsight when determining the lease term, the short-term lease recognition exemption and the option to not separate lease and non-lease components. The adoption of this standard resulted in the recognition of a right-of-use asset and corresponding right-of-use liability on our Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet of $10.3 million as of January 1, 2019, primarily related to our operating leases for office space, automobiles and other equipment.  
Contingent liabilities with a fair value totaling $1.2 million were recognized at the acquisition date, the payments of which were dependent upon SmartRG achieving future revenue, EBIT or customer purchase order milestones during the first half of 2019. The required milestones were not achieved and, therefore, we recognized a gain of $1.2 million upon the reversal of these liabilities during the second quarter of 2019.  
An escrow in the amount of $2.8 million was set up at the acquisition date to fund post-closing working capital settlements and to satisfy indemnity obligations to the Company arising from any inaccuracy or breach of representations, warranties, covenants, agreements or obligations of the sellers. The escrow is subject to arbitration with final settlement expected during the fourth quarter of 2020. The minimum and maximum potential release of funds to the sellers ranges from zero to $2.8 million.  
We recorded goodwill of $3.5 million as a result of this acquisition, which represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of net assets acquired. We assessed the recognition and measurement of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on historical and forecasted data for future periods and concluded that our valuation procedures and resulting measures were appropriate. 
For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2019, we incurred acquisition and integration related expenses and amortization of acquired intangibles of $0.5 million and $1.7 million, respectively, related to the SmartRG acquisition. No acquisition-related expenses were incurred during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2018 related to the SmartRG acquisition. 
The following unaudited supplemental pro forma information presents the financial results of the Company for the nine months ended September 30, 2018 as if the acquisition of the Sumitomo EPON business had occurred on January 1, 2018. This unaudited supplemental pro forma information does not purport to be indicative of what would have occurred had the acquisition been completed on January 1, 2018, nor is it indicative of any future results. There were no material, non-recurring adjustments to this unaudited pro forma information. 
Revenue is measured based on the consideration we expect to receive in exchange for transferring goods or providing services to a customer and as performance obligations under the terms of the contract are satisfied. For transactions where there are multiple performance obligations, we account for individual products and services separately if they are distinct (if a product or service is separately identifiable from other items and if a customer can benefit from it on its own or with other resources that are readily available to the customer). As of September 30, 2019, we did not have any significant performance obligations related to customer contracts that had an original expected duration of one year or more, other than maintenance services, which are satisfied over time.  
Our effective tax rate increased from a benefit of 34.9%, excluding the tax effect of the bargain purchase gain, in the nine months ended September 30, 2018, to an expense of 197.1% in the nine months ended September 30, 2019. The increase in the effective tax rate between the two periods was primarily driven by the establishment of a valuation allowance against our domestic deferred tax assets in the amount of $37.1 million during the three months ended September 30, 2019, offset by a 9.38% rate reduction related to a transfer pricing study completed during the second quarter of 2019 that resulted in the assignment of operating expenditures to specific company locations, and the effective income tax rates among the respective jurisdictions. 
As of September 30, 2019, the Company had deferred tax assets totaling $49.4 million. As of September 30, 2019, a valuation allowance totaling $42.9 million has been established against our deferred tax assets. Of this amount, $37.1 million was established during the third quarter of 2019 relating to our domestic deferred tax assets. The remaining $5.8 million that was established in prior periods relates to state research and development credit carryforwards, and foreign net operating loss and research and development credit carryforwards, where we lack sufficient activity to realize those deferred tax assets. The remaining $6.5 million in deferred tax assets not offset by a valuation allowance are located in various foreign jurisdictions where the Company believes it is more likely than not we will realize these deferred tax assets.  
The aggregate intrinsic value of stock options represents the total pre-tax intrinsic value (the difference between ADTRAN’s closing stock price on the last trading day of the quarter and the exercise price, multiplied by the number of in-the-money options) that would have been received by the option holders had all option holders exercised their options on September 30, 2019. The amount of aggregate intrinsic value will change based on the fair market value of ADTRAN’s stock and was zero as of September 30, 2019. The total pre-tax intrinsic value of options exercised during the nine months ended September 30, 2019 was $0.1 million.  
At September 30, 2019, total unrecognized compensation expense related to the non-vested portion of market-based PSUs, RSUs and restricted stock was approximately $11.6 million, which is expected to be recognized over an average remaining recognition period of 2.4 years. In addition, there was $8.2 million of unrecognized compensation expense related to unvested 2017 performance-based PSUs, which will be recognized over the remaining requisite service period of 0.3 years if achievement of the performance obligation becomes probable. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2019 and 2018, no compensation expense was recognized related to these 2017 performance-based PSUs. Unrecognized compensation expense will be adjusted for actual forfeitures.  
ASU 2016-01 also provides a measurement alternative for equity investments that do not have a readily determinable fair value in which investments can be recorded at cost less impairment, if any, adjusted for observable price changes for an identical or similar investment. We elected to record our equity investment that does not have a readily determinable fair value using the measurement alternative method. As of December 31, 2018, the Company had a note receivable of approximately $4.3 million, which was included in other receivables on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet. During the three months ended March 31, 2019, this amount was repaid and reissued in the form of debt and equity. Approximately $3.4 million was issued as an equity investment, which represented a non-cash investing activity. The carrying value of this investment under the measurement alternative was $3.4 million as of September 30, 2019. The remaining amount, approximately $0.9 million, was converted into a new note receivable, which is included in other receivables on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet and represents a non-cash operating activity. 
The fair value of our Level 2 securities is calculated using a weighted average market price for each security. Market prices are obtained from a variety of industry standard data providers, large financial institutions, and other third-party sources. These multiple market prices are used as inputs into a distribution-curve-based algorithm to determine the daily market value of each security.  
Inventory reserves are established for estimated excess and obsolete inventory equal to the difference between the cost of the inventory and the estimated net realizable value of the inventory based on historical usage, known trends, inventory age, and market conditions. At September 30, 2019 and December 31, 2018, our inventory reserve was $32.0 million and $30.0 million, respectively.

During the three months ended June 30, 2019, the Company changed the manner in which it estimates its excess and obsolete inventory reserves. Under the new policy, we establish reserves for estimated excess and obsolete inventory equal to the difference between the cost of the inventory and the estimated net realizable value of the inventory based on historical usage, known trends, inventory age, and market conditions. When we dispose of excess and obsolete inventories, the related disposals are charged against the inventory reserves. See Note 8 of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part I, Item 1 of this report for additional information. 
Network Solutions segment cost of sales, as a percentage of that segment’s sales, increased from 57.8% for the three months ended September 30, 2018 to 60.0% for the three months ended September 30, 2019 and decreased from 61.0% for the nine months ended September 30, 2018 to 57.8% for the nine months ended September 30, 2019. The increase in cost of sales as a percentage of sales for the three months ended September 30, 2019 was primarily attributable to a decrease in volume, a regional revenue shift and changes in customer and product mix. The decrease in cost of sales as a percentage of sales for the nine months ended September 30, 2019 was primarily attributable to an increase in volume, a regional revenue shift, changes in customer and product mix and a decrease in labor expense due to a restructuring program initiated in the first quarter of 2018. 
Selling, general and administrative expenses increased 0.5% from $30.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2018 to $30.9 million for the three months ended September 30, 2019, and increased 3.4% from $96.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2018 to $99.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2019. The increase in selling, general and administrative expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2019 was primarily attributable to incremental expenses as a result of the SmartRG acquisition, IP litigation costs and professional and contract services offset by decreases in personnel-related expenses. The increase in selling, general and administrative expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2019 was primarily attributable to incremental expenses as a result of the SmartRG acquisition, IP litigation costs and deferred compensation offset by a decrease in personnel-related expenses. 
As a percentage of sales, selling, general and administrative expenses increased from 21.9% for the three months ended September 30, 2018 to 27.1% for the three months ended September 30, 2019, and decreased from 24.8% for the nine months ended September 30, 2018 to 24.1% for the nine months ended September 30, 2019. Selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales may fluctuate whenever there is a significant fluctuation in revenue for the periods being compared. 
Research and development expenses increased 6.6% from $29.9 million for the three months ended September 30, 2018 to $31.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2019 and increased 2.2% from $93.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2018 to $95.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2019. The increase in research and development expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2019 was primarily attributable to increases in incremental expenses as a result of the SmartRG acquisition, personnel-related expenses and restructuring expenses. The increase in research and development expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2019 was primarily attributable to increases in incremental expenses as a result of the SmartRG acquisition, contract services and lease expense, offset by a decrease in personnel-related expenses. 
As a percentage of sales, research and development expenses increased from 21.3% for the three months ended September 30, 2018 to 27.9% for the three months ended September 30, 2019, and decreased from 24.0% for the nine months ended September 30, 2018 to 23.1% for the nine months ended September 30, 2019. Research and development expenses as a percentage of sales will fluctuate whenever there are incremental product development activities or significant fluctuations in revenue for the periods being compared. 
Net investment gain decreased from a gain of $4.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2018 to a loss of $0.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2019, and increased from a gain of $5.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2018 to a gain of $8.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2019. The fluctuation in our net investment gain was primarily attributable to changes in fair value of equity securities recognized during the period. See Note 7 of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements, included in Part I, Item 1 of this report, and “Investing Activities” in “Liquidity and Capital Resources” below for additional information. 
Our effective tax rate increased from a benefit of 135.7% for the three months ended September 30, 2018 to an expense of 150.6% for the three months ended September 30, 2019, and increased from a benefit of 34.9%, excluding the tax effect of the bargain purchase gain, for the nine months ended September 30, 2018 to an expense of 197.1% for the nine months ended September 30, 2019. The increase in the effective tax rate between the two periods was primarily driven by the establishment of a valuation allowance against our domestic deferred tax assets in the amount of $37.1 million during the three months ending September 30, 2019, offset by a 9.38% rate reduction related to a transfer pricing study completed during the second quarter of 2019 that resulted in the assignment of operating expenditures to specific company locations, and the effective income tax rates among the respective jurisdictions. See Note 4 of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part I, Item 1 of this report for additional information. 
We intend to finance our future operations with cash flow from operations. We have used, and expect to continue to use, cash generated from operations for working capital, purchases of treasury stock, shareholder dividends, future business acquisitions and other general corporate purposes, including (i) product development activities to enhance our existing products and develop new products and (ii) expansion of sales and marketing activities. We believe our cash and cash equivalents, investments and cash generated from operations to be adequate to meet our operating and capital needs for at least the next 12 months.

We maintain depository investments with certain financial institutions. Although these depository investments may exceed government insured depository limits, we have evaluated the credit-worthiness of these financial institutions, and determined the risk of material financial loss due to exposure of such credit risk to be minimal. As of September 30, 2019, $93.7 million of our cash and cash equivalents, primarily certain domestic money market funds and foreign depository accounts, were in excess of government provided insured depository limits.

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures. We maintain disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to provide reasonable assurance that the information required to be disclosed by us in reports that we file or submit under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”), is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the rules and forms promulgated by the SEC, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Because of the inherent limitations to the effectiveness of any system of disclosure controls and procedures, no evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures can provide absolute assurance that all control issues, if any, with a company have been prevented or detected on a timely basis. Even disclosure controls and procedures determined to be effective can only provide reasonable assurance that their objectives are achieved.

Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (“Section 404”) requires us to include in our annual reports on Form 10-K an assessment by the Company’s management of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. We must perform system and process evaluation and testing of our internal control over financial reporting to allow management and our independent auditors to report on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting, as required by Section 404. Our compliance with Section 404 may require that we incur substantial accounting expense and expend significant management efforts. In addition, if management or our independent auditors are unable to conclude that our internal control over financial reporting is effective, we could lose investor confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial statements, which could have an adverse effect on our stock price. 
Management has been working to further strengthen the Company’s internal controls relating to inventory. Specifically, the Company has begun redesigning and enhancing additional controls and procedures to ensure the completeness of our cycle count program and the completeness and accuracy of key reports and related data used to monitor the results of this cycle count program. Additionally, the Company has begun redesigning and implementing enhanced controls and procedures related to the review of significant inputs and assumptions used to determine our excess and obsolete inventory reserve, and to ensure the completeness and accuracy of key reports and related data used in the calculation of the excess and obsolete inventory reserve. The implementation of these measures is ongoing, and, while we believe that they will ultimately be effective in remediating the material weaknesses described above, our initiatives may not prove successful, and management may not be able to conclude that our internal control over financial reporting is effective. Furthermore, even if management were to reach such a conclusion, if our independent auditors are not satisfied with the adequacy of our internal control over financial reporting, or if the independent auditors interpret the requirements, rules or regulations differently than we do, then they in the future may decline to issue a report on our internal control over financial reporting or may issue a report that is qualified. Any of these events could result in a loss of investor confidence in the reliability of our financial statements, which in turn could negatively affect the price of our common stock.
