Accordingly, certain information and notes required by generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America (“GAAP”) for complete financial statements are not included herein.
The December 31, 2018 Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet is derived from audited financial statements, but does not include all disclosures required by GAAP.
The interim financial statements should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in ADTRAN’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018, filed with the SEC on February 28, 2019 (as amended on September 20, 2019, the “2018 Form 10-K”).
During the three months ended June 30, 2019, the Company revised the methodology used in estimating its excess and obsolete inventory reserves.
During the three months ended June 30, 2019, the Company determined that there was an immaterial misstatement of its excess and obsolete inventory reserves in its previously issued annual and interim financial statements.
The Company corrected this misstatement by recognizing a $0.8 million out-of-period adjustment during the three months ended June 30, 2019, which increased its excess and obsolete inventory reserves and cost of goods sold for the period.
For the six months ended June 30, 2019, the out-of-period adjustment was a cumulative $0.2 million reduction in the Company’s excess and obsolete inventory reserves and cost of goods sold.
In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842), which requires an entity to recognize right-of-use assets and lease liabilities on the balance sheet and to disclose key information about the entity’s leasing arrangements.
In March 2019, the FASB issued ASU 2019-01, Leases (Topic 842) Codification Improvements, which removed the requirement for an entity to disclose in the interim periods after adoption, the effect of the change on income from continuing operations, net income, any other affected financial statement line item, and any affected per share amount.
For lessors, the new leasing standard requires leases to be classified as sales-type, direct financing or operating leases.
This standard and related updates were effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, and interim periods within those fiscal years.
At that time, the Company elected to carry forward the legacy ASC 840 disclosures for comparative periods and, therefore, did not adjust the comparative period financial information prior to January 1, 2019.
In addition, the Company elected the package of practical expedients which allows for companies to not reassess whether any expired or existing contracts are or contain leases, not reassess historical lease classifications for expired or existing contracts and not reassess initial direct costs for existing leases.
Additionally, the Company elected the practical expedients which allow the use of hindsight when determining the lease term, the short-term lease recognition exemption and the option to not separate lease and non-lease components.
As a lessee, the adoption of this standard did not have a material impact on our Condensed Consolidated Statement of Income or Statement of Cash Flows.
As a lessor, the adoption of this standard did not have a material impact on the Company’s Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet, Condensed Consolidated Statement of Income or Condensed Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows.

See Note 14 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part I, Item 1 of this report for further information regarding the Company’s segments and revenue categories.
Our third quarter 2019 revenue was negatively impacted by a pause in shipments to a Tier 1 customer in Latin America (“LATAM”) and the continued slowdown in spending at another international Tier 1 customer.
For the fourth quarter of 2019, our current expectations include a continued impact from a decline in sales related to these two customers.
Under the new policy, we establish reserves for estimated excess and obsolete inventory equal to the difference between the cost of the inventory and the estimated net realizable value of the inventory based on historical usage, known trends, inventory age, and market conditions.
The following table presents selected financial information derived from our Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income expressed as a percentage of sales for the periods indicated.
As a percentage of sales, cost of sales increased from 58.4% for the three months ended September 30, 2018 to 59.4% for the three months ended September 30, 2019 and decreased from 61.9% for the nine months ended September 30, 2018 to 58.5% for the nine months ended September 30, 2019.
Network Solutions segment cost of sales, as a percentage of that segment’s sales, increased from 57.8% for the three months ended September 30, 2018 to 60.0% for the three months ended September 30, 2019 and decreased from 61.0% for the nine months ended September 30, 2018 to 57.8% for the nine months ended September 30, 2019.
Selling, general and administrative expenses increased 0.5% from $30.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2018 to $30.9 million for the three months ended September 30, 2019, and increased 3.4% from $96.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2018 to $99.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2019.

Although these depository investments may exceed government insured depository limits, we have evaluated the credit-worthiness of these financial institutions, and determined the risk of material financial loss due to exposure of such credit risk to be minimal.
As of September 30, 2019, $93.7 million of our cash and cash equivalents, primarily certain domestic money market funds and foreign depository accounts, were in excess of government provided insured depository limits.
