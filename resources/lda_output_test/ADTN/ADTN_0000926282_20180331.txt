In the opinion of management, all adjustments necessary to fairly state these interim statements have been recorded and are of a normal and recurring nature. The results of operations for an interim period are not necessarily indicative of the results for the full year. The interim statements should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and notes thereto included in ADTRAN’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2017, filed on February 23, 2018 with the SEC. 
In February 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842) (ASU 2016-02). ASU 2016-02 requires an entity to recognize lease assets and lease liabilities on the balance sheet and to disclose key information about the entity's leasing arrangements. ASU 2016-02 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, and interim periods within those fiscal years. A modified retrospective approach is required. We anticipate the adoption of ASU 2016-02 will have a material impact on our financial position; however, we do not believe adoption will have a material impact on our results of operations. We believe the most significant impact relates to our accounting for operating leases for office space and equipment. 
The two primary areas of impact of these ASUs were network implementation service revenue performance obligations and contract costs. The output method will be used to measure network implementation services progress. The primary impact will be accelerated revenue recognition for certain performance obligations related to service revenue arrangements that were previously deferred until customer acceptance and capitalization and amortization of incremental costs of obtaining a contract as described below.  
We recorded a bargain purchase gain of $11.3 million during the first quarter of 2018, net of income taxes, which is subject to customary working capital adjustments between the parties. The bargain purchase gain of $11.3 million represents the difference between the fair value of the net assets acquired over the cash paid. SEI, an OEM supplier based in Japan, is a market leader in EPON. SEI’s Broadband Networks Division through its SEL subsidiary operated a North American EPON business including sales, marketing, support, and region-specific engineering development. The North American EPON market is primarily driven by the Tier 1 cable MSO operators and has developed slower than anticipated. Through the transaction, SEI divested its North American EPON assets and established a relationship with ADTRAN. The transfer of these assets to ADTRAN, which included key customer relationships and required assumption by ADTRAN of relatively low incremental expenses, along with the value of the technology license and OEM supply agreement, resulted in the bargain purchase gain. We have assessed the recognition and measurement of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on historical and forecasted data for future periods and have concluded that our valuation procedures and resulting measures were appropriate. 
The following unaudited supplemental pro forma information presents the financial results as if the acquisition had occurred on January 1, 2017. This unaudited supplemental pro forma information does not purport to be indicative of what would have occurred had the acquisition been completed on January 1, 2017, nor is it indicative of any future results. Aside from revising the 2017 and 2018 net income for the effect of the bargain purchase gain, there were no material, non-recurring adjustments to this unaudited pro forma information. 
The majority of the revenue from this segment is from hardware sales and is recognized when control is transferred to our customers, which is generally when we ship the products. Shipping terms are generally FOB shipping point. Revenue is recorded net of discounts and rebates using the most likely amount. Customers are typically invoiced when control is transferred and revenue is recognized. Our products generally include assurance-based warranties of 90 days to five years for product defects, which are accrued at the time revenue is recognized. 
In certain transactions, we are also the lessor in sales-type lease arrangements for network equipment, which have terms of 18 months to five years. These arrangements typically include network equipment, network implementation services and maintenance services. Product revenue for these leases is generally recorded when we transfer control of the product to our customers. Revenue for network implementation and maintenance services is recognized as described below. Customers are typically invoiced and pay in equal installments over the lease term.  
Our maintenance service periods range from one month to five years. Customers are typically invoiced and pay for maintenance services at the beginning of the maintenance period, which is recorded in current or non-current unearned revenue depending on the length of the service period. Maintenance services are provided on an as-needed basis and our customers benefit evenly throughout the contract term. Accordingly, we recognize revenue for maintenance services on a straight-line basis over the maintenance period in services revenue.  
We recognize revenue for network implementation, which primarily consists of engineering, execution and enablement services, when performance obligations are complete at a point in time. If we have recognized revenue, but not billed the customer, the right to consideration is recognized as a contract asset, which is included in other receivables in the Consolidated Balance Sheet. The contract asset is transferred to accounts receivable when the right to consideration to payment becomes unconditional. 
The fair value of our stock options is estimated using the Black-Scholes model. The determination of the fair value of stock options on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes model is affected by our stock price, as well as assumptions regarding a number of complex and subjective variables that may have a significant impact on the fair value estimate. 
The fair value of our PSUs with market conditions is calculated using a Monte Carlo Simulation valuation method. The fair value of RSUs and restricted stock is equal to the closing price of our stock on the date of grant. During the first quarter of 2017, the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors approved a PSU grant of 0.5 million shares that contain performance conditions. The fair value of these performance-based PSU awards was equal to the closing price of our stock on the date of grant.  
As of March 31, 2018, there was $12.9 million of unrecognized compensation expense related to unvested market-based PSUs, RSUs and restricted stock, which is expected to be recognized over an average remaining recognition period of 2.9 years. In addition, there was $10.7 million of unrecognized compensation expense related to unvested performance-based PSUs, which will be recognized over the requisite service period of three years as achievement of the performance objective becomes probable. For the three months ended March 31, 2018, no compensation expense was recognized related to these performance-based PSU awards. 
The fair value of our Level 2 securities is calculated using a weighted average market price for each security. Market prices are obtained from a variety of industry standard data providers, security master files from large financial institutions, and other third-party sources. These multiple market prices are used as inputs into a distribution-curve-based algorithm to determine the daily market value of each security. 
Our cash flow hedging activities utilize foreign exchange forward contracts to reduce the risk that movements in exchange rates will adversely affect the net cash flows resulting from the planned purchase of products from foreign suppliers. Purchases of U.S. denominated inventory by our European subsidiary represent our primary exposure. Changes in the fair value of derivatives designated as cash flow hedges are not recognized in current operating results, but are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income. Amounts related to cash flow hedges are reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive income when the underlying hedged item impacts earnings. This reclassification is recorded in the same line item of the consolidated statements of income at which the effects of the hedged item are recorded, which is cost of sales. 
We do not hold or issue derivative instruments for trading or other speculative purposes. Our derivative instruments are recorded in the Consolidated Balance Sheets at their fair values. Our derivative instruments are not subject to master netting arrangements and are not offset in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.

Sales were $120.8 million for the three months ended March 31, 2018, compared to $170.3 million for the three months ended March 31, 2017. Our gross margin decreased to 32.9% in the three months ended March 31, 2018 from 43.3% in the three months ended March 31, 2017. Our operating income margin decreased to (22.1)% for the three months ended March 31, 2018, from 4.1% for the three months ended March 31, 2017. Net income (loss) was $(10.8) million for the three months ended March 31, 2018, compared to $6.7 million for the three months ended March 31, 2017. Our effective tax rate, excluding the effect of the bargain purchase gain in 2018, decreased to 15.1% for the three months ended March 31, 2018, from 20.3% for the three months ended March 31, 2017. Earnings (loss) per share, assuming dilution, were $(0.22) for the three months ended March 31, 2018, compared to $0.14 for the three months ended March 31, 2017. 
We recognized a positive impact to our revenues in the first half of 2017 due to our being awarded a network expansion program by a large European tier-1 customer. During the first quarter of 2018, this European Tier 1 customer undertook an additional network expansion project. We anticipate that as our Latin American customers resume their network upgrade projects, we may experience further enhancement to our revenues. We have recently announced receipt of a new nationwide award in the APAC region, as well as additional awards based on new ADTRAN technologies in the EMEA region that we believe will likely result in a positive impact to our revenues. However, a resolution of the regulatory changes affecting a major customer in Mexico has been slower than anticipated, and business with our customer in that region has not yet returned to a more normal level. We are continuing to pursue opportunities with new customers in this region. 
As a percentage of sales, cost of sales increased from 56.7% in the three months ended March 31, 2017 to 67.1% in the three months ended March 31, 2018. The increase in cost of sales as a percentage of sales for the three months ended March 31, 2018 is primarily attributable to a regional revenue shift, customer and product mix, services and support mix, an increase in labor expense due to a restructuring program, an increase in warranty expense due to a settlement in Q1 2017 with a third party supplier for a defective component and purchase discounts received from a contract manufacturer in Q1 2017. 
Network Solutions cost of sales, as a percent of that segment’s sales, increased from 53.4% in the three months ended March 31, 2017 to 65.2% in the three months ended March 31, 2018. The increase in cost of sales as a percentage of sales for the three months ended March 31, 2018 is primarily attributable to a regional revenue shift, customer and product mix, an increase in labor expense due to a restructuring program, an increase in warranty expense due to a settlement in Q1 2017 with a third party supplier for a defective component and purchase discounts received from a contract manufacturer in Q1 2017. 
Selling, general and administrative expenses decreased 3.6% from $34.8 million in the three months ended March 31, 2017 to $33.5 million in the three months ended March 31, 2018. The decrease in selling, general and administrative expenses for the three months ended March 31, 2018 is primarily attributable to decreases in deferred compensation expense, travel expense, performance-based compensation expense, independent contractor expense, and legal expense, partially offset by an increase in labor expense due to a restructuring program.  
Interest and dividend income decreased 7.2% from $933 thousand in the three months ended March 31, 2017 to $866 thousand in the three months ended March 31, 2018. The decrease in interest and dividend income for the three months ended March 31, 2018 is primarily attributable to a decrease in investment balances and a decrease in the rate of return on those investments. 
Gain on bargain purchase of a business is related to our acquisition of Sumitomo Electric Lightwave Corp.’s North American EPON business and entry into a technology license and supply agreement with Sumitomo Electric Industries, Ltd. on March 19, 2018. See Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. 
We intend to finance our operations with cash flow from operations. We have used, and expect to continue to use, the cash generated from operations for working capital, purchases of treasury stock, shareholder dividends, and other general corporate purposes, including (i) product development activities to enhance our existing products and develop new products and (ii) expansion of sales and marketing activities. We believe our cash and cash equivalents, investments and cash generated from operations to be adequate to meet our operating and capital needs for at least the next 12 months. 
Accounts receivable decreased 43.9% from $144.2 million at December 31, 2017 to $80.9 million at March 31, 2018. We had no allowance for doubtful accounts at December 31, 2017 or March 31, 2018. Quarterly accounts receivable days sales outstanding (DSO) decreased from 105 days as of December 31, 2017 to 60 days as of March 31, 2018 The decrease in net accounts receivable is due to the collection of customer specific payment terms that became due in the first quarter of 2018 and the timing of sales and collections during the quarter. Additionally, certain international customers can have longer payment terms than U.S. customers.  
Other receivables increased 32.2% from $26.6 million at December 31, 2017 to $35.1 million at March 31, 2018. The increase in other receivables is primarily attributable to an increase in tax receivable and the timing of filing returns and collections of VAT receivables in our international subsidiaries, partially offset by the timing of shipments and collections for materials supplied to our contract manufacturers during the quarter. 
Prepaid expense and other current assets decreased 43.9% from $17.3 million at December 31, 2017 to $9.7 million at March 31, 2018. The decrease in prepaid expenses and other current assets is primarily attributable to the recognition of deferred costs related to network installation services that were completed during the quarter.

As of March 31, 2018, approximately $110.3 million of our cash and investments may be directly affected by changes in interest rates. We have performed a hypothetical sensitivity analysis assuming market interest rates increase or decrease by 50 basis points (bps) for an entire year, while all other variables remain constant. At March 31, 2018, we held $51.0 million of cash and variable-rate investments where a change in interest rates would impact our interest income. A hypothetical 50 bps decline in interest rates as of March 31, 2018 would reduce annualized interest income on our cash and investments by approximately $0.3 million. In addition, we held $59.2 million of fixed-rate bonds whose fair values may be directly affected by a change in interest rates. A hypothetical 50 bps increase in interest rates as of March 31, 2018 would reduce the fair value of our fixed-rate bonds by approximately $0.4 million.
