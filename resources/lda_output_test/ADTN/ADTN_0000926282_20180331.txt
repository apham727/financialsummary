The accompanying unaudited consolidated financial statements of ADTRAN®, Inc. and its subsidiaries (ADTRAN) have been prepared pursuant to the rules and regulations for reporting on Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q.
In the opinion of management, all adjustments necessary to fairly state these interim statements have been recorded and are of a normal and recurring nature.

ASU 2016-02 requires an entity to recognize lease assets and lease liabilities on the balance sheet and to disclose key information about the entity's leasing arrangements.
We believe the most significant impact relates to our accounting for operating leases for office space and equipment.
The two primary areas of impact of these ASUs were network implementation service revenue performance obligations and contract costs.
The primary impact will be accelerated revenue recognition for certain performance obligations related to service revenue arrangements that were previously deferred until customer acceptance and capitalization and amortization of incremental costs of obtaining a contract as described below.

We recorded a bargain purchase gain of $11.3 million during the first quarter of 2018, net of income taxes, which is subject to customary working capital adjustments between the parties.
SEI’s Broadband Networks Division through its SEL subsidiary operated a North American EPON business including sales, marketing, support, and region-specific engineering development.
The North American EPON market is primarily driven by the Tier 1 cable MSO operators and has developed slower than anticipated.
The transfer of these assets to ADTRAN, which included key customer relationships and required assumption by ADTRAN of relatively low incremental expenses, along with the value of the technology license and OEM supply agreement, resulted in the bargain purchase gain.
This unaudited supplemental pro forma information does not purport to be indicative of what would have occurred had the acquisition been completed on January 1, 2017, nor is it indicative of any future results.
Aside from revising the 2017 and 2018 net income for the effect of the bargain purchase gain, there were no material, non-recurring adjustments to this unaudited pro forma information.
Revenue is measured based on the consideration we expect to receive in exchange for transferring goods or providing services to a customer and as performance obligations under the terms of the contract are satisfied.

We have recently announced receipt of a new nationwide award in the APAC region, as well as additional awards based on new ADTRAN technologies in the EMEA region that we believe will likely result in a positive impact to our revenues.
