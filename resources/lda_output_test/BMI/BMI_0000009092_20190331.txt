The Company disclosed in its financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2018 that it estimated it would pay $0.4 million in other postretirement benefits in 2019 based on actuarial estimates. As of March 31, 2019, $52,000 of such benefits have been paid. The Company continues to believe that its estimated payments for the full year are reasonable. However, such estimates contain inherent uncertainties because cash payments can vary significantly depending on the timing of postretirement medical claims and the collection of the retirees’ portion of certain costs. The amount of benefits paid in calendar year 2019 will not impact the expense for postretirement benefits for 2019. 
On April 2, 2018, the Company acquired 100% of the outstanding stock of Innovative Metering Solutions, Inc. ("IMS") of Odessa, Florida, which was one of the Company's distributors serving Florida. Acquisitions are accounted for under the purchase method, and accordingly, the results of operations were included in the Company's financial statements from the date of acquisition. The IMS acquisition did not have a material impact on the Company's consolidated financial statements or the notes thereto. 
The total purchase consideration was approximately $12.0 million, which included $7.7 million in cash, a $0.3 million working capital adjustment, a balance sheet holdback of $0.7 million and settlement of $3.3 million of pre-existing Company receivables. The working capital adjustment was settled in the second quarter of 2018 and the balance sheet holdback is recorded in payables on the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheet as it is anticipated to be paid in the next twelve months. The Company's allocation of the purchase price at March 31, 2019 included $3.8 million of receivables, $0.8 million of inventories, $0.1 million of machinery and equipment, $3.6 million of intangibles and $3.7 million of goodwill. The intangible assets acquired are customer relationships with an estimated average useful life of 10 years. The allocation of the purchase price to the assets acquired was based upon the estimated fair values at the date of acquisition. As of March 31, 2019, the Company had completed its analysis for estimating the fair value of the assets acquired with no additional adjustments.  
The Company applies the accounting standards for fair value measurements and disclosures for its financial assets and financial liabilities. The carrying amounts of cash, receivables and payables in the financial statements approximate their fair values due to the short-term nature of these financial instruments. Short-term debt is comprised of notes payable drawn against the Company's lines of credit and commercial paper. Because of its short-term nature, the carrying amount of the short-term debt also approximates fair value. Included in other assets are insurance policies on various individuals who were previously employed by the Company. The carrying amounts of these insurance policies approximate their fair value. 
In August 2018, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) No. 2018-14 “Compensation - Retirement Benefits - Defined Benefit Plans - General (Subtopic 715-20),” which modifies the annual disclosure requirements for defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plans. This ASU as modified added and deleted specific disclosures in an effort to improve the usefulness for financial statement users while also reducing unnecessary costs for companies. The ASU is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2020 with early adoption being permitted in any interim reporting period within the annual reporting period. The Company is currently assessing the impact of adopting ASU No. 2018-14. 
In January 2017, the FASB issued ASU No. 2017-04 “Intangibles - Goodwill and Other (Topic 350).” The update requires a single-step quantitative test to measure potential impairment based on the excess of a reporting unit's carrying amount over its fair value. A qualitative assessment can still be completed first for an entity to determine if a quantitative impairment test is necessary. The ASU is effective on a prospective basis for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2019 and interim periods thereafter. Early adoption is permitted for interim or annual goodwill impairment tests performed on testing dates after January 1, 2017. The Company adopted ASU No. 2017-04 on January 1, 2019. The adoption of this standard did not have any impact on the Company’s financial statements.  
In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-13 “Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326),” which amends the accounting for credit losses on purchased financial assets and available-for-sale debt securities with credit deterioration. This ASU requires the measurement of all expected credit losses for financial assets, including accounts receivables, held at the reporting date based upon current conditions, historical experience and reasonable forecasts. This ASU is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2019, and early adoption is allowed in any interim reporting period within the annual reporting period. The Company is currently assessing the impact of adopting ASU No. 2016-13. 
In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02 “Leases (Topic 842),” which requires lessees to record most leases on their balance sheets. Lessees initially recognize a lease liability (measured at the present value of the lease payments over the lease term) and a right-of-use asset (measured at the lease liability amount, adjusted for lease prepayments, lease incentives received and the lessee's initial direct costs). Lessees can make an accounting policy election not to recognize ROU assets and lease liabilities for leases with a lease term of 12 months or less as long as the leases do not include options to purchase the underlying assets that the lessee is reasonably certain to exercise. The standard includes the use of a modified retrospective approach for leases that exist or are entered into after the beginning of the earliest comparative period in the financial statements. Full retrospective application is prohibited. In July 2018, the FASB issued ASU No. 2018-11 “Targeted Improvements (Topic 842).” This ASU provides for an optional method of transition which allows companies to adopt the new leasing standard with a cumulative effect adjustment to reinvested earnings. The Company adopted the new leasing standard with the optional transition methodology as of January 1, 2019. For a complete discussion of the adoption of ASU No. 2016-02 and ASU No. 2018-11, see Note 12 “Leases.” 
As of March 31, 2019, the Company had certain contracts where there were unsatisfied performance obligations. For contracts recorded as contract liabilities, $16.7 million was the aggregate amount of the transaction price allocated to performance obligations that were unsatisfied or partially unsatisfied as of the end of the reporting period. The Company estimates that revenue recognized from satisfying those performance obligations will be approximately $3.3 million in 2019, $1.5 million in each year from 2020 through 2024 and $5.9 million thereafter.  
A performance obligation is a promise in a contract to transfer a distinct good or service to the customer, and is the unit of measurement in Topic 606. At contract inception, the Company assesses the products and services promised in its contracts with customers. The Company then identifies performance obligations to transfer distinct products or services to the customer. In order to identify performance obligations, the Company considers all of the products or services promised in the contract regardless of whether they are explicitly stated or are implied by customary business practices. 
On January 1, 2019, the Company adopted ASU No. 2016-02 and ASU No. 2018-11 using the optional transition method. Under this transition method, comparative periods will continue to be reported in accordance with prior lease guidance under ASC 840 Leases. The Company has elected certain practical expedients permitted under the transition guidance, which, among other things, allows the Company to carry forward historical lease classifications.

Municipal water, the largest sales category, is comprised of either mechanical or static (ultrasonic) water meters along with the related radio and software technologies and services used by municipal water utilities as the basis for generating their water and wastewater revenues. The largest geographic market for the Company’s municipal water products is North America, primarily the United States, because most of the Company's meters are designed and manufactured to conform to standards promulgated by the American Water Works Association. The majority of water meters sold by the Company continue to be mechanical in nature; however, ultrasonic meters are gaining in penetration due to a variety of factors, including their ability to maintain near absolute measurement accuracy over their useful life. Providing ultrasonic water meter technology, combined with advanced radio technology, provides the Company with the opportunity to sell into other geographical markets, for example the Middle East and Europe.  
Critical to the water metering ecosystem is information and analytics. The Company’s BEACON Advanced Metering Analytics (AMA) software suite improves the utilities’ visibility of their water and water usage. BEACON AMA is a secure, cloud-hosted software suite that includes a customizable dashboard, and has the ability to establish alerts for specific conditions. It also allows for consumer engagement tools that permit end water users (such as homeowners) to view and manage their water usage activity. Benefits to the utility include improved customer service, increased visibility through faster leak detection, the ability to promote and quantify the effects of its water conservation efforts, and easier compliance reporting. 
Water meter replacement and the adoption and deployment of new technology comprise the majority of water meter product sales, including radio products. To a much lesser extent, housing starts also contribute to the new product sales base. Over the last decade, there has been a growing trend in the conversion from manually read water meters to meters with radio technology. This conversion rate is accelerating, with the Company estimating that approximately 60% of water meters installed in the United States have been converted to a radio solution technology. 
The Company’s net sales and corresponding net earnings depend on unit volume and product mix, with the Company generally earning higher average selling prices and margins on meters equipped with radio technology, and higher margins on ultrasonic compared to mechanical meters. The Company’s proprietary radio products (i.e. ORION) generally result in higher margins than the remarketed, non-proprietary technology products. The Company also sells registers and endpoints separately to customers who wish to upgrade their existing meters in the field.  
The industries served by the Company’s flow instrumentation products face accelerating demands to contain costs, reduce product variability, and meet ever-changing safety, regulatory and sustainability requirements. To address these challenges, customers must reap more value from every component in their systems. This system-wide scrutiny has heightened the focus on flow instrumentation in industrial process, manufacturing, commercial fluid, building automation and precision engineering applications where flow measurement and control are critical. 
A leader in both mechanical and static (ultrasonic) flow metering technologies for industrial markets, the Company offers one of the broadest flow measurement, control and communication portfolios in the market. This portfolio carries respected brand names including Recordall®, Hedland®, Dynasonics®, Blancett®, and Research Control®, and includes eight of the ten major flow meter technologies. Customers rely on the Company for application-specific solutions that deliver accurate, timely and dependable flow data and control essential for product quality, cost control, safer operations, regulatory compliance and more sustainable operations. 
Increasingly, customers in the water utility market are interested in more frequent and diverse data collection. Specifically, AMI technology enables water utilities to capture readings from each meter at more frequent and variable intervals. There are approximately 52,000 water utilities in the United States and the Company estimates that approximately 60% of them have converted to a radio solution. The Company believes it is well positioned to meet this continuing conversion trend with its comprehensive radio and software solutions. 
The total purchase consideration was approximately $12.0 million, which included $7.7 million in cash, a $0.3 million working capital adjustment, a balance sheet holdback of $0.7 million and settlement of $3.3 million of pre-existing Company receivables. The working capital adjustment was settled in the second quarter of 2018 and the balance sheet holdback is recorded in payables on the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheet as it is anticipated to be paid in the next twelve months. The Company's allocation of the purchase price at June 30, 2018 included $3.8 million of receivables, $0.8 million of inventories, $0.1 million of machinery and equipment, $3.6 million of intangibles and $3.7 million of goodwill. The intangible assets acquired are customer relationships with an estimated average useful life of 10 years. As of March 31, 2019, the Company had completed its analysis for estimating the fair value of the assets acquired with no additional adjustments. This acquisition is further described in Note 5 "Acquisition" in the Unaudited Notes to Consolidated Condensed Financial Statements. 
The Company’s financial condition remains strong. In June 2018, the Company amended its May 2012 credit agreement with its primary lender and extended its term until September 2021. The credit agreement includes a $125.0 million line of credit that supports commercial paper (up to $70.0 million) and includes $5.0 million of a Euro line of credit. While the facility is unsecured, there are a number of financial covenants with which the Company must comply, and the Company was in compliance as of March 31, 2019. The Company believes that its operating cash flows, available borrowing capacity, and its ability to raise capital provide adequate resources to fund ongoing operating requirements, future capital expenditures and the development of new products. The Company continues to take advantage of its local commercial paper market and carefully monitors the current borrowing market. The Company had $121.8 million of unused credit lines available at March 31, 2019.
