The unaudited financial statements of Encore Wire Corporation (the “Company”) have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”) for interim information and the instructions to Form 10-Q and Rule 10-01 of Regulation S-X.
Amounts billed and due from our customers are classified as accounts receivables on the balance sheet and require payment on a short-term basis through standard payment terms.
We review and update these estimates regularly and the impact of any adjustments are recognized in the period the adjustments are identified.
The adjustments resulting from updated estimates of trade payment discounts and customer rebates were not material.
The Financial Accounting Standards Board (the “FASB”) Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) is the sole source of authoritative U.S. GAAP other than Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") issued rules and regulations that apply only to SEC registrants.
2016-02, “Leases (Topic 842),” on January 1, 2019, the Company recorded $0.7 million of right of use assets which are included in other non-current assets, $0.2 million of current lease liabilities which are included in accounts payable and $0.5 million of long-term lease liabilities included in other non-current liabilities.
During the first three quarters of every year, LIFO calculations are based on the inventory levels and costs at that time.
In the second quarter of 2019, LIFO adjustments were recorded, decreasing cost of sales by $3.3 million, versus LIFO adjustments increasing cost of sales by $1.7 million in the second quarter of 2018.
Income taxes were accrued at an effective rate of 23.2% in the second quarter of 2019 versus 22.7% in the second quarter of 2018, consistent with the Company’s estimated liabilities.

The Company is a significant supplier of building wire for interior electrical wiring in commercial and industrial buildings, homes, apartments, and manufactured housing.
Price competition for electrical wire and cable is intense, and the Company sells its products in accordance with prevailing market prices.
Additionally, the SEC allows shares of certain physically backed copper exchange-traded funds (“ETFs”) to be listed and publicly traded.
The acquisition of copper cathode by copper ETFs may materially decrease or interrupt the availability of copper for immediate delivery in the United States, which could materially increase the Company’s cost of copper.
In addition to rising copper prices and potential supply shortages, we believe that ETFs and similar copper-backed derivative products could lead to increased price volatility for copper.
The tables below highlight the range of closing prices of copper on a per pound basis on the Comex exchange for the periods shown.
The following discussion and analysis relate to factors that have affected the operating results of the Company for the quarters and six months ended June 30, 2019 and 2018.
Reference should also be made to the audited financial statements and notes thereto included in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018.
The virtually identical net sales dollars are primarily the result of a 5.6% increase in copper wire unit volume shipped, offset by a 6.1% decrease in the average selling price of copper wire.
The 5.6% increase in unit volume shipped was primarily due to strong construction industry demand despite rough spring weather in certain areas that slowed construction and impacted volumes in the second quarter of 2019.
The average cost per pound of raw copper purchased decreased 8.7% in the second quarter of 2019 compared to the second quarter of 2018 and was the principal driver of the decreased average sales price of copper wire.
The small increase in gross profit margin percentage was primarily the result of two factors that served to mostly offset each other.
Unit volumes increased 5.6%, while the spread between the average price paid for a pound of raw copper and the average sales price for a pound of copper contained in finished wire decreased 0.4% in the second quarter of 2019 versus the second quarter of 2018.
The percentage change on sales is on a higher nominal dollar amount than on purchases and, therefore, spreads change on a nominal dollar basis.
On May 30, 2019, the U.S. Commerce Department imposed a preliminary antidumping ruling on imports of aluminum wire from China at rates ranging from 58.36 to 63.32 percent.
Total raw materials cost, including the LIFO adjustment, decreased to 74.6% of net sales in the second quarter of 2019, from 76.4% of net sales in the second quarter of 2018.
Net sales for the first six months of 2019 were $651.6 million compared to net sales of $628.2 million for the first six months of 2018.
