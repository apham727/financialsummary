The accompanying interim condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared in conformity with United States (U.S.) generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) for interim financial information and the instructions to Form 10-Q and Article 10 of Regulation S-X, and should be read in conjunction with the Xilinx, Inc. (Xilinx or the Company) consolidated financial statements filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended April 1, 2017. The interim financial statements are unaudited, but reflect all adjustments which are, in the opinion of management, of a normal, recurring nature necessary to provide a fair statement of results for the interim periods presented. The results of operations for the interim periods shown in this report are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for the fiscal year ending March 31, 2018 or any future period.
In February 2016, the FASB issued the authoritative guidance on leases. The new authoritative guidance requires the recognition of assets and liabilities arising from lease transactions on the balance sheet and will also require significant additional disclosures about the amount, timing and uncertainty of cash flows from leases. Accordingly, a lessee will recognize a lease asset for its right to use the underlying asset and a lease liability for the corresponding lease obligation. The new authoritative guidance is effective for public business entities for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, and interim periods within those fiscal years, which for Xilinx would be the first quarter of fiscal year 2020. Early adoption is permitted. The new authoritative guidance must be adopted using a modified retrospective transition, and provides for certain practical expedients. In addition, the transition will 
In August 2017, the FASB issued authoritative guidance that amended the accounting for hedging activities. The guidance permits more hedging strategies to be eligible for hedge accounting and simplifies the application of hedge accounting guidance in areas where practice issues exist. The new authoritative guidance will be effective for public business entities for annual periods, and interim periods within those annual periods, beginning after December 15, 2018, which for Xilinx would be the first quarter of fiscal year 2020. Early adoption is permitted, including adoption in any interim periods after issuance of the authoritative guidance. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of this new authoritative guidance on its consolidated financial statements. 
Avnet, Inc. (Avnet), one of the Company’s distributors, distributes the Company’s products worldwide. As of December 30, 2017 and April 1, 2017, Avnet accounted for 64% and 59% of the Company’s total net accounts receivable, respectively. For the third quarter and first nine months of fiscal year 2018, resale of product through Avnet accounted for 42% and 45% of the Company’s worldwide net revenues, respectively. For the third quarter and the first nine months of fiscal year 2017, resale of product through Avnet accounted for 42% and 43% of the Company’s worldwide net revenues, respectively.
Xilinx is subject to concentrations of credit risk primarily in its trade accounts receivable and investments in debt securities to the extent of the amounts recorded on the consolidated balance sheet. The Company attempts to mitigate the concentration of credit risk in its trade receivables through its credit evaluation process, collection terms, distributor sales to diverse end customers and through geographical dispersion of sales. Xilinx generally does not require collateral for receivables from its end customers or from distributors.
participants at the measurement date. When determining the fair value measurements for assets and liabilities required or permitted to be recorded at fair value, the Company considers the principal or most advantageous market in which Xilinx would transact and also considers assumptions that market participants would use when pricing the asset or liability, such as inherent risk, transfer restrictions and risk of nonperformance.
Level 2 — Observable inputs other than quoted prices included in Level 1, such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets; quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active; or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the asset or liability.
The Company’s Level 2 assets consist of financial institution securities, non-financial institution securities, U.S. agency securities, foreign government and agency securities, mortgage-backed securities, debt mutual funds, bank loans, asset-backed securities and commercial mortgage-backed securities. The Company’s Level 2 assets and liabilities also include foreign currency forward contracts and interest rate swap contracts.
Level 3 — Unobservable inputs to the valuation methodology that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the measurement of the fair value of the assets or liabilities. Level 3 assets and liabilities include those whose fair value measurements are determined using pricing models, discounted cash flow methodologies or similar valuation techniques, as well as significant management judgment or estimation.
The Company's $500.0 million principal amount of 2.125% notes due March 15, 2019 (2019 Notes), $500.0 million principal amount of 3.000% notes due March 15, 2021 (2021 Notes) and $750.0 million principal amount of 2.950% senior notes due June 1, 
2024 (2024 Notes) are measured at fair value on a quarterly basis for disclosure purposes. The fair values of the 2019 Notes, 2021 Notes and 2024 Notes as of December 30, 2017 were approximately $499.2 million, $504.7 million and $746.4 million, respectively, based on the last trading price for the period (classified as Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy due to relatively low trading volume). 
The Company reviewed the investment portfolio and determined that the gross unrealized losses on these investments as of December 30, 2017 and April 1, 2017 were temporary in nature as evidenced by the fluctuations in the gross unrealized losses within the investment categories. These investments are highly rated by the credit rating agencies, there have been no defaults on any of these securities and we have received interest payments as they become due. Therefore, the Company believes that it will be able to collect both principal and interest amount due to the Company. Additionally, in the past several years a portion of the Company's investment in the mortgage-backed securities were redeemed or prepaid by the debtors at par. Furthermore, the aggregate of individual unrealized losses that had been outstanding for twelve months or more were not significant as of December 30, 2017 and April 1, 2017, the majority of which were related to debt mutual funds due to foreign currency and interest rate fluctuations. The Company neither intends to sell these investments nor concludes that it is more-likely-than-not that it will have to sell them until recovery of their carrying values. 
The amortized cost and estimated fair value of marketable debt securities (financial institution securities, non-financial institution securities, U.S. and foreign government and agency securities, asset-backed securities, bank loans, mortgage-backed securities and commercial mortgage-backed securities), by contractual maturity, are shown in the table below. Actual maturities may differ from contractual maturities because issuers may have the right to call or prepay obligations without call or prepayment penalties.
As of December 30, 2017, $1.98 billion of marketable debt securities with contractual maturities of greater than one year were classified as short-term investments. Additionally, the above table did not include investments in money market funds, mutual funds and equity securities because these securities do not have specific contractual maturities.
The Company entered into interest rate swap contracts with certain independent financial institutions to manage interest rate risks related to fixed interest rate expenses from its 2024 Notes and floating interest rate income from its investments in marketable debt securities. See “Note 10. Debt and Credit Facility” for more discussion related to interest rate swap contracts. The interest rate swap contracts were designated and qualified as fair value hedges of the 2024 Notes, and were separately accounted for as a derivative. The interest rate swap contracts and the 2024 Notes were initially measured at fair value. Any subsequent changes in fair values of the interest rate swap contracts and the 2024 Notes will be recorded in the Company’s consolidated balance sheets. During the nine months ended December 30, 2017, the net change in fair values of the interest rate swap contracts and the underlying 2024 Notes was $11.8 million, which was recorded as a derivative liability for the interest rate swap contacts (as a component of other long-term liabilities on the condensed consolidated balance sheets) and also a reduction from the carrying amount of 2024 Notes. There was no ineffectiveness during all periods presented. Other than this arrangement, there have been no material changes to the Company's derivative financial instruments since April 1, 2017.
The Company’s equity incentive plans are broad-based, long-term retention programs that cover employees, consultants and non-employee directors of the Company. These plans are intended to attract and retain talented employees, consultants and non-employee directors and to provide such persons with a proprietary interest in the Company.
The types of awards allowed under the 2007 Equity Incentive Plan (2007 Equity Plan) include incentive stock options, non-qualified stock options, restricted stock units (RSUs), restricted stock and stock appreciation rights. To date, the Company has issued a mix of non-qualified stock options and RSUs under the 2007 Equity Plan; however, there was no issuance of stock options during the first nine months of fiscal year 2018 and the entire fiscal year 2017. The Company's stock-based compensation expenses related to options during the first nine months of fiscal year 2018 and the number of options outstanding as of December 30, 2017

These product categories are modified on a periodic basis to better reflect the maturity of the products and advances in technology. The most recent modification was made on April 3, 2016, which was the beginning of our fiscal year 2017, whereby we reclassified our product categories to be consistent with how these categories are analyzed and reviewed internally. Specifically, we grouped the products manufactured at the 28nm, 20nm and 16nm nodes into a category named Advanced Products while all other products are included in a category named Core Products. 
Net revenues of $631.2 million in the third quarter of fiscal year 2018 represented an 8% increase from the comparable prior year period of $585.7 million. Net revenues from Advanced Products increased 30% in the third quarter of fiscal year 2018 versus the comparable prior year period, but the declines from our Core Products partially offset the increase. No end customer accounted for more than 10% of our net revenues for the third quarter and the first nine months of fiscal years 2018 and 2017.
For the first nine months of fiscal year 2018, approximately 52% of our net revenues were from products sold to distributors for subsequent resale to original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) or their subcontract manufacturers. As of December 30, 2017, we had $48.0 million of deferred revenue and $15.0 million of deferred cost of revenues recognized as a net $33.0 million of deferred income on shipments to distributors. As of April 1, 2017, we had $74.2 million of deferred revenue and $19.6 million of deferred cost of revenues recognized as a net $54.6 million of deferred income on shipments to distributors. The deferred income on shipments to distributors that will ultimately be recognized in our condensed consolidated statements of income will be different than the amount shown on the condensed consolidated balance sheets due to actual price adjustments issued to the distributors when the product is sold to their end customers.
Net revenues from Core Products decreased in both the third quarter and the first nine months of fiscal year 2018 from the comparable prior year periods. For both the third quarter and the first nine months of fiscal year 2018, the decreases were largely due to decline in sales of our Virtex-5 and, to a lesser extent, our Spartan-3 and Virtex-6 product families.

Most of our wafers are manufactured in Taiwan by TSMC and UMC. In addition, we also have wafers manufactured in South Korea by Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd. Terms with respect to the volume and timing of wafer production and the pricing of wafers produced by the semiconductor foundries are determined by periodic negotiations between us and these wafer foundries, which usually result in short-term agreements that do not provide for long-term supply or allocation commitments. We are dependent on these foundries to supply the substantial majority of our wafers. We rely on TSMC, UMC and our other foundries to produce wafers with competitive performance attributes. Therefore, the foundries, particularly TSMC who manufactures our newest products, must be able to transition to advanced manufacturing process technologies and increased wafer sizes, produce wafers at acceptable yields and deliver them in a timely manner. Furthermore, we cannot guarantee that the foundries that supply our wafers will offer us competitive pricing terms or other commercial terms important to our business. 
We cannot guarantee that our foundries will not experience manufacturing problems, including delays in the realization of advanced manufacturing process technologies or difficulties due to limitations of new and existing process technologies. Furthermore, we cannot guarantee the foundries will be able to manufacture sufficient quantities of our products or that they will continue to manufacture a product for the full life of the product. In addition, weak economic conditions may adversely impact the financial health and viability of the foundries and result in their insolvency or their inability to meet their commitments to us. For example, we may experience supply shortages due to the difficulties foundries may encounter if they must rapidly increase their production capacities from low utilization levels to high utilization levels because of an unexpected increase in demand. We may also experience supply shortages due to very strong demand for our products and a surge in demand for semiconductors in general, which may lead to tightening of foundry capacity across the industry. The insolvency of a foundry or any significant manufacturing problem or insufficient foundry capacity would disrupt our operations and negatively impact our financial condition and results of operations.
The independent foundries, upon which we rely to manufacture our products, as well as our California and Singapore facilities, are located in regions that are subject to earthquakes and other natural disasters. UMC's and TSMC's foundries in Taiwan and our assembly and test partners in other regions as well as many of our operations in California are centered in areas that have been seismically active in the recent past and some areas have been affected by other natural disasters such as typhoons. Any catastrophic event in these locations will disrupt our operations, including our manufacturing activities, and our insurance may not cover losses resulting from such disruptions of our operations. This type of disruption could result in our inability to manufacture or ship products, thereby materially adversely affecting our financial condition and results of operations. For example, as a result of the March 2011 earthquake in Japan, production at the Seiko foundry at Sakata was halted temporarily, impacting production of some of our older devices. In addition, suppliers of wafers and substrates were forced to halt production temporarily. Disruption of operations at these foundries for any reason, including other natural disasters such as typhoons, tsunamis, volcano eruptions, fires or floods, as well as disruptions in access to adequate supplies of electricity, natural gas or water could cause delays in shipments of our products, and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. Furthermore, natural disasters can also indirectly impact us. For example, our customers' supply of other complimentary products may be disrupted by a natural disaster and may cause them to delay orders of our products. More vertically-integrated competitors may be less exposed to some or all of these and other risks.
As a result of the 2008 global financial crisis, global consumer confidence eroded amidst concerns over declining asset values, inflation, volatility in energy costs, geopolitical issues, the availability and cost of credit, rising unemployment, and the stability and solvency of financial institutions, financial markets, businesses and sovereign nations, among other concerns. These concerns slowed global economic growth and resulted in recessions in numerous countries, including many of those in North America, Europe and Asia. The financial condition of certain sovereign nations, particularly in Europe, is of continuing concern as the sovereign debt crisis remains unresolved. These weak economic conditions resulted in reduced customer demand and had a negative impact on our results of operations in some parts of fiscal year 2012 and fiscal year 2013. If weak economic conditions return, there may be a number of negative effects on our business, including customers or potential customers reducing or delaying orders, the insolvency of key suppliers, potentially causing production delays, the inability of customers to obtain credit, and the insolvency of one or more customers. Any of these effects could impact our ability to effectively manage inventory levels and collect receivables and ultimately decrease our net revenues and profitability. 
In addition to the challenging market conditions we may face, we have limited visibility into the demand for our products, particularly new products, because demand for our products depends upon our products being designed into our end customers' products and those products achieving market acceptance. Due to the complexity of our customers' designs, the design to volume production process for our customers requires a substantial amount of time, frequently longer than a year. In addition to this, other factors may affect our end customers' demand for our products, including, but not limited to, end customer program delays and the ability of end customers to secure other complementary products. We also are dependent upon "turns," orders received and turned for shipment in the same quarter. These factors make it difficult for us to forecast future sales and project quarterly revenues. The difficulty in forecasting future sales impairs our ability to project our inventory requirements, which could result, and in the past has resulted, in inventory write-downs or failure to meet customer product demands in a timely manner. In addition, difficulty in forecasting revenues compromises our ability to provide forward-looking revenue and earnings guidance.
Our strategy for expansion in the logic market includes continued introduction of new product architectures that address high-volume, low-cost and low-power applications as well as high-performance, high-density applications. However, we may not be successful in executing this strategy. In addition, we anticipate continued pressure from our customers to reduce prices, which may outpace our ability to lower the cost for established products. 
Several companies have introduced products that compete with ours or have announced their intention to sell PLD products. To the extent that our efforts to compete are not successful, our financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected. 
The benefits of programmable logic have attracted a number of competitors to this segment. We recognize that different applications require different programmable technologies, and we are developing architectures, processes and products to meet these varying customer needs. Recognizing the increasing importance of standard software solutions, we have developed common software
