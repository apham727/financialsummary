Our critical accounting policies, including the assumptions and judgments underlying them, are discussed in our 2017 Form 10-K in Note 1 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies included in our Consolidated Financial Statements. In May 2014, the FASB issued ASC Update No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606), which has been subsequently updated. The purpose of Update No. 2014-09 is to provide enhancements to the quality and consistency of how revenue is reported while also improving comparability in the financial statements of companies using U.S. GAAP and International Financial Reporting Standards. The core principle requires entities to recognize revenue in a manner that depicts the transfer of goods or services to customers in amounts that reflect the consideration an entity expects to be entitled to in exchange for those goods or services. The Company adopted ASU 2014-09 and its related amendments effective January 1, 2018 using the modified retrospective method. Please see Note 2 for the required disclosures related to the impact of adopting this standard and a discussion of the Company’s updated policies related to revenue recognition and accounting for costs to obtain and fulfill a customer contract. There were no other significant changes to our critical accounting policies during the nine months ended September 30, 2018. 
Recently issued accounting standards and their estimated effect on the Company’s condensed consolidated financial statements are also described in Note 15, Recent Accounting Pronouncements, to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements.

Long-lived Asset Impairment Testing. Based on management’s testing and evaluation, we determined that we did not design and maintain effective internal control over the step one goodwill impairment testing that we performed in accordance with ASC 350, Intangibles – Goodwill and Other and ASC 360, Property, Plant, and Equipment, as of April 30, 2017 and December 31, 2017, respectively. Specifically, the Company’s review control did not operate at a sufficient level of precision to identify the improper assumptions used in our impairment analyses. We concluded that this lack of review in sufficient detail of the analyses was a material weakness in our internal controls. We wrote off the JDL reporting unit goodwill in the second quarter of 2017 and have no remaining recorded goodwill. If we record goodwill in the future, however, we will need to implement and maintain internal controls to ensure we complete our goodwill impairment analysis in a timely manner and with adequate detail. 
To address the above, we are in the process of designing new review controls to value our business units to ensure that goodwill and long-lived asset impairment analyses are completed in a timely manner and in enough detail to operate at a sufficient level of precision to identify improper assumptions.
