Media converter sales increased 2% or $357,000 due to a large EMEA project in the first quarter.

Our critical accounting policies, including the assumptions and judgments underlying them, are discussed in our 2018 Form 10-K in Note 1 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies included in our Consolidated Financial Statements. In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02, “Leases” (Topic 842), which amends existing guidance and requires an entity to recognize both assets and liabilities arising from financing and operating leases, along with additional qualitative and quantitative disclosures. The new standard is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within that reporting period, and early adoption is permitted. The Company adopted the accounting standard effective January 1, 2019. Please see Note 3 for the required disclosures related to the impact of adopting this standard. There were no other significant changes to our critical accounting policies during the nine months ended September 30, 2019.
