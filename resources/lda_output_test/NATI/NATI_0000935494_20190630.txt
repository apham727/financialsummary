The accompanying unaudited consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto for the year ended December 31, 2018, included in our annual report on Form 10-K, filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
In our opinion, the accompanying consolidated financial statements reflect all adjustments (consisting only of normal recurring items) considered necessary to present fairly our financial position at June 30, 2019 and December 31, 2018, the results of our operations and comprehensive income for three and six months ended June 30, 2019 and 2018, the cash flows for the six months ended June 30, 2019 and 2018 and the statement of stockholder's equity for the three and six months ended June 30, 2019.
These financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States.
Consequently, financial information will not be updated and the disclosures required under the new standard will not be provided for earlier periods.
Additionally, we also reclassified approximately $19 million from "Property, plant and equipment, net" to "Operating lease right-of-use assets" related to prepaid leasehold land.
This means, for those leases that qualify, we will not recognize ROU assets or lease liabilities, and this includes not recognizing ROU assets or lease liabilities for existing short-term leases of those assets in transition.
2016-13, Financial Instruments—Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments.
The ASU will replace the incurred loss impairment methodology under current GAAP with a methodology that reflects expected credit losses and requires consideration of a broader range of reasonable and supportable information to inform credit loss estimates.
Entities are also required to record allowances for available-for-sale debt securities rather than reduce the carrying amount.
Additionally, in the first quarter of 2019, we granted performance-based restricted stock units to certain executives under our 2015 Equity Incentive Plan ("PRSUs").
Stock-based compensation costs are based on the fair value on the date of grant for all restricted stock units ("RSUs") and on the date of enrollment for the employee stock purchase plan.
PRSUs are RSU awards that vest based on a market condition, currently our stockholder return relative to the total stockholder return of the companies included in the Russell 2000 Index at the end of a three-year performance period.
Up to 200% of the full target number of shares subject to each PRSU award are eligible to be earned after the completion of the three-year performance period based on our total stockholder return relative to the total stockholder return of the Russell 2000 Index at the end of the performance period.
Operating leases are included in operating lease right-of-use ("ROU") assets and operating lease liabilities (current and non-current) on our consolidated balance sheet.
Finance leases are included in property and equipment, other current liabilities, and other long-term liabilities in our consolidated balance sheet.
The operating lease ROU assets also includes any lease payments made and excludes lease incentives and initial direct costs incurred.

However, in the ordinary course of our business, we have in the past, are currently and will likely become involved in various legal proceedings, claims, and regulatory, tax or government inquiries and investigations, and could incur uninsured liability in any one or more of them.
Uncertainty about global and regional economic conditions poses a risk to us as businesses may decrease or postpone spending in response to events such as the impending Brexit, continued trade tensions and restrictions between the U.S. and other parts of the world, financial market volatility, tariffs or other trade restrictions, government austerity programs, government regulatory actions, negative financial news, geopolitical instability, declines in income or asset values, or other factors.
Moreover, there can be no assurance that our international sales will continue at existing levels or grow in accordance with our efforts to increase foreign market penetration.
In many foreign countries, particularly in those with developing economies, it is common to engage in business practices that are prohibited by U.S. regulations applicable to us such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act.
Although we have policies and procedures designed to ensure compliance with these laws, there can be no assurance that all of our employees, contractors and agents, including those based in or from countries where practices which violate such U.S. laws may be customary, will not take actions in violation of our policies.
Any violation of foreign or U.S. laws by our employees, contractors or agents, even if such violation is prohibited by our policies, could have a material adverse effect on our business.
As a result, even if we are currently in compliance with applicable regulations, there can be no assurance that we will not have to incur additional costs or take additional compliance actions in the future.
