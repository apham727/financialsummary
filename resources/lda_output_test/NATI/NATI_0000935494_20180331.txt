The accompanying unaudited consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto for the year ended December 31, 2017, included in our annual report on Form 10-K, filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
Our operating results for the three months ended March 31, 2018 are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for the year ending December 31, 2018.
We adopted ASU 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers and all the related amendments ("new revenue standard") as of January 1, 2018.
We analyze historical bad debts, customer concentrations, customer creditworthiness and current economic trends when evaluating the adequacy of our allowance for doubtful accounts.
Unbilled receivables represent amounts for which revenue has been recognized but which have not yet been invoiced to the customer.
Shipping and handling costs associated with outbound freight after control over a product has transferred to a customer are accounted for as a fulfillment cost and are in included in cost of sales.
Under this method, we evaluated all contracts that were in effect at the beginning of 2018 as if those contracts had been accounted for under the new revenue standard.
We did not evaluate individual modifications for those periods prior to the adoption date, but the aggregate effect of all modifications as of the adoption date and such effects are provided below.
A cumulative catch-up adjustment was recorded to beginning retained earnings to reflect the impact of all existing arrangements under the new revenue standard.
We do not expect the impact of the adoption of the new standard to be material to our annual net income on an ongoing basis.
Historically, we have had to defer revenue for certain types of licenses arrangements and recognize revenue ratably over the license term.
Under the new revenue standard, we are no longer required to establish vendor-specific objective evidence ("VSOE") to recognize software license revenue separately from the other elements, and we are able to recognize all software license revenue once the customer obtains control of the license, which will generally occur at the start of each license term.
The update states that a lessee would recognize a lease liability for the obligation to make lease payments and a right-to-use asset for the right to use the underlying asset for the lease term.
We are currently evaluating the effect that the updated standard will have on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.
We enter into contracts that can include various combinations of our products or services, which are generally capable of being distinct and accounted for as separate performance obligations.
Revenue is recognized net of allowances for returns and any taxes collected from customers, which are subsequently remitted to governmental authorities.

However, in the ordinary course of our business, we are involved in a limited number of legal actions, both as plaintiff and defendant, and could incur uninsured liability in any one or more of them.
Uncertainty about global and regional economic conditions poses a risk to us as businesses may postpone spending in response to tighter credit, higher unemployment, financial market volatility, government austerity programs, negative financial news, geopolitical instability, declines in income or asset values, or other factors.
Negative trends or sentiments in worldwide and regional economic conditions could have a material adverse effect on demand for our products and services.
These investments involve a number of risks as the commercial success of such efforts depend on many factors, including our ability to anticipate and respond to innovation, achieve the desired technological fit, and be effective with our marketing and distribution efforts.
Our success is dependent on our ability to successfully develop and introduce new and enhanced products on a timely basis to replace declining revenues from older products, and on increasing penetration in domestic and international markets.
As has occurred in the past and as may be expected to occur in the future, we have experienced significant delays between the announcement and the commercial availability of new products.
There can be no assurance that we will be able to introduce new products in accordance with announced release dates, that our new products will achieve market acceptance or that any such acceptance will be sustained for any significant period.
