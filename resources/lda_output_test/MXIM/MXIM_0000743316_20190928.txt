Effective June 30, 2019, the first day of adoption, the Company recognized $61.0 million of operating lease right-of-use assets and $65.2 million of operating lease liabilities on its Consolidated Balance Sheet. The adoption of the standard had an immaterial impact on retained earnings. 
The Company determines if an arrangement is, or contains, a lease at inception. Lease right-of-use (ROU) assets are recorded as other assets, short-term lease obligations are recorded as accrued expenses and long-term lease obligations are recorded as other liabilities on the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheet. The Company’s classes of assets include real estate leases, equipment leases, and vehicle leases.
Lease ROU assets and lease liabilities are recognized based on the present value of future minimum lease payments over the lease term at commencement date. When discount rates implicit in leases cannot be readily determined, the Company uses its incremental borrowing rate based on information available at commencement date in determining the present value of future payments.
Lease terms may include options to extend or terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain that the Company will exercise such option. Lease expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term. The Company elected to combine lease and non-lease components for all asset classes. In addition, the Company does not apply the recognition requirements to leases with lease terms of 12 months or less. 
Level 2 - Observable inputs other than quoted prices included in Level 1, such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active, or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the asset or liability. 
As of September 28, 2019 and June 29, 2019, the fair market value of private company investments amounted to $20.2 million and $20.7 million, respectively.

The Company invests in various financial instruments including U.S. Treasury securities, corporate debt securities, commercial paper, and certificates of deposit which include instruments issued or managed by industrial, financial, and utility institutions and U.S. Treasury securities which include U.S. government Treasury bills and Treasury notes.
The Company incurs expenditures denominated in non-U.S. currencies, primarily the Philippine Peso and the Thai Baht associated with the Company's manufacturing activities in the Philippines and Thailand, respectively, and the European Euro, Indian Rupee, Japanese Yen, Taiwan New Dollar, South Korean Won, Chinese Yuan and Canadian Dollar, for sales offices and research and development activities undertaken outside of the U.S.
The Company has established a program that primarily utilizes foreign currency forward contracts to offset the risks associated with the effects of certain foreign currency exposures. The Company does not use these foreign currency forward contracts for trading purposes.
The Company designates certain forward contracts as hedging instruments pursuant to Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) 815, Derivatives and Hedging (“ASC 815”). As of September 28, 2019 and June 29, 2019, the notional amounts of the forward contracts the Company held to purchase international currencies were $43.0 million and $48.5 million, respectively.

On November 21, 2013, the Company completed a public offering of $500 million aggregate principal amount of the Company’s 2.5% coupon senior unsecured and unsubordinated notes due in November 2018 (“2018 Notes”), with an effective interest rate of 2.6%. Interest on the 2018 Notes is payable semi-annually in arrears on May 15 and November 15 of each year, commencing on May 15, 2014. The net proceeds of this offering were approximately $494.5 million, after issuing at a discount and deducting paid expenses. In November of 2018, the Company repaid the entire $500 million in principal and any outstanding interest, related to these outstanding notes.
At September 28, 2019, the Company had one stock incentive plan, the Company's 1996 Stock Incentive Plan (the “1996 Plan”) and one employee stock purchase plan, the 2008 Employee Stock Purchase Plan (the “2008 ESPP”). The 1996 Plan was adopted by the Board of Directors to provide the grant of incentive stock options, non-statutory stock options, restricted stock units (“RSUs”), and market stock units (“MSUs”) to employees, directors, and consultants. 
Pursuant to the 1996 Plan, the exercise price for incentive stock options and non-statutory stock options is determined to be the fair market value of the underlying shares on the date of grant. Options typically vest ratably over a four-year period measured from the date of grant. Options generally expire no later than seven years after the date of grant, subject to earlier termination upon an optionee's cessation of employment or service.
RSUs granted to employees typically vest ratably over a four-year period and are converted into shares of the Company's common stock upon vesting, subject to the employee's continued service to the Company over that period. RSUs granted after August 2017 will continue to vest post-employment at the Company for certain individuals satisfying specific eligibility requirements.
The fair value of RSUs and other awards under the Company’s 1996 Plan is estimated using the value of the Company’s common stock on the date of grant, reduced by the present value of dividends expected to be paid on the Company’s common stock prior to vesting. The Company also estimates forfeitures at the time of grant and makes revisions to forfeitures on a quarterly basis.
The Company withheld shares totaling $9.9 million in value as a result of employee withholding taxes based on the value of RSUs on their vesting date for the three months ended September 28, 2019. Total payments for employees’ tax obligations to taxing authorities are reflected as financing activities within the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.

All electronic signals generally fall into one of two categories, linear or digital. Linear (or analog) signals represent real world phenomena, such as temperature, pressure, sound or speed, and are continuously variable over a wide range of values. Digital signals represent the “ones” and “zeros” of binary arithmetic and are either on or off.
Our strategy has been to target both the linear and mixed-signal markets, often collectively referred to as the analog market. However, some of our products are exclusively or principally digital. While our focus continues to be on the linear and mixed-signal market, our capabilities in the digital domain enable development of new mixed-signal and other products with highly sophisticated digital characteristics.
Net revenues were $533.0 million and $638.5 million for the three months ended September 28, 2019 and September 29, 2018, respectively. Revenue from industrial products was down by 21% due to lower shipments in control and automation and automatic test equipment products. Revenue from communication and data center products was down by 25% due to lower shipments in network and data communications, data center and other communications products. These results include net revenues for the three months ended September 29, 2018 that align with our revised end-market categories. 
During the three months ended September 28, 2019 and September 29, 2018, approximately 90% and 89% of net revenues, respectively, were derived from customers outside of the United States. While less than 1.0% of our sales are denominated in currencies other than U.S. dollars, we enter into foreign currency forward contracts to mitigate our risks on firm commitments and net monetary assets denominated in foreign currencies. The impact of changes in foreign exchange rates on our revenue and results of operations for the three months ended September 28, 2019 and September 29, 2018 was immaterial.
Research and development expenses were $109.0 million and $112.7 million for the three months ended September 28, 2019 and September 29, 2018, respectively, which represented 20.4% and 17.7% of net revenues for each respective period. The $3.7 million decrease was due to lower salaries and related personnel costs. 
Selling, general and administrative expenses were $76.1 million and $81.5 million for the three months ended September 28, 2019 and September 29, 2018, respectively, which represented 14.3% and 12.8% of net revenues for each respective period. The $5.4 million decrease was due to lower salaries and related personnel costs, and lower depreciation expense.
Cash provided by investing activities decreased by $74.6 million for the three months ended September 28, 2019 compared with the three months ended September 29, 2018. The decrease was due to lower proceeds from maturity of available-for-sale securities and lower purchases of available-for-sale securities. 
We anticipate that the available funds and cash generated from operations will be sufficient to meet cash and working capital requirements, including the anticipated level of capital expenditures, common stock repurchases, debt repayments and dividend payments for at least the next twelve months.
