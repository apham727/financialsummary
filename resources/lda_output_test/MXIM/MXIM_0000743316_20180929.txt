On July 1, 2018, the Company adopted Topic 606 and related amendments (ASU 2015-14, Deferral of the Effective Date; ASU 2016-08, Principal versus Agent Considerations; ASU 2016-10, Identifying Performance Obligations and Licensing, ASU 2016-12, Narrow-Scope Improvements and Practical Expedients and ASU 2016-20, Technical Corrections and Improvements to Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers) using the modified retrospective method applied to all contracts that are not completed at the date of initial application (i.e., July 1, 2018). Results for reporting periods beginning after July 1, 2018 are presented under Topic 606, while prior period amounts are not adjusted and continue to be reported in accordance with historic accounting standards under Topic 605. 
•The Company does not disclose the value of unsatisfied performance obligations for (i) contracts with an original expected length of one year or less and (ii) contracts for which the Company recognizes revenue at the amount to which we have the right to invoice for services performed.
The Company recognizes revenue for sales to direct customers and sales to distributors when a customer obtains control of promised goods or services in an amount that reflects the consideration which the Company expects to receive in exchange for those goods or services. The transaction price is calculated as selling price net of variable considerations, such as distributor price adjustments. In determining the transaction price, the Company evaluates whether the price is subject to refund or adjustment to determine the net consideration that is expected to be entitled. The transaction price does not include amounts collected on behalf of another party, such as sales taxes or value added tax. The Company elected the practical expedient to not disclose the value of unsatisfied performance obligations for (i) contracts with an original expected length of one year or less and (ii) contracts for which we recognize revenue at the amount to which we have the right to invoice for services performed. The Company estimates returns for sales to direct customers and distributors based on historical return rates applied against current period gross revenue. Specific customer returns and allowances are considered within this estimate. 
Accounts receivable from direct customers and distributors are recognized and inventory is relieved upon shipment as title to inventories generally transfers upon shipment, at which point the Company has a legally enforceable right to collection under normal terms. Accounts receivable related to consigned inventory is recognized when the customer takes title to such inventory from its consigned location, at which point inventory is relieved, title transfers, and the Company has a legally enforceable right to collection under the terms of the agreement with the related customers. Customers are generally required to pay for products and services within the Company’s standard terms, which is net 30 days from the date of invoice. The Company does not have any significant financing components greater than one year. 
In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842), which supersedes the lease accounting requirements in Topic 840. ASU 2016-02 requires a dual approach for lessee accounting under which a lessee would account for leases as finance leases or operating leases. Both finance leases and operating leases will result in the lessee recognizing a right-of use asset and a 
Level 2 - Observable inputs other than quoted prices included in Level 1, such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active, or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the asset or liability. 
The Company’s Level 2 assets and liabilities consist of U.S. Treasury securities, agency securities, corporate debt securities, certificates of deposit, commercial paper and foreign currency forward contracts that are valued using quoted market prices or are determined using a yield curve model based on current market rates.
The Company invests in various financial instruments including U.S. Treasury securities, corporate debt securities, commercial paper, and certificates of deposit which include instruments issued or managed by industrial, financial, and utility institutions and U.S. Treasury securities which include U.S. government Treasury bills and Treasury notes.
The Company incurs expenditures denominated in non-U.S. currencies, primarily the Philippine Peso and the Thai Baht associated with the Company's manufacturing activities in the Philippines and Thailand, respectively, and the European Euro, Indian Rupee, Japanese Yen, Taiwan New Dollar, South Korean Won, Chinese Yuan and Canadian Dollar, expenditures for sales offices and research and development activities undertaken outside of the U.S.
The Company designates certain forward contracts as hedging instruments pursuant to Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) 815, Derivatives and Hedging (“ASC 815”). As of September 29, 2018 and June 30, 2018, the notional amounts of the forward contracts the Company held to purchase international currencies were $41.8 million and $49.7 million, respectively, and the notional amounts of forward contracts the Company held to sell international currencies were $0.7 million and $1.2 million, respectively. 
As of September 29, 2018 and June 30, 2018, the notional amounts of the forward contracts the Company held to purchase international currencies were $21.8 million and $21.1 million, respectively, and the notional amounts of forward contracts the Company held to sell international currencies were $25.8 million and $21.3 million, respectively. The fair values of our outstanding foreign currency forward contracts and gain (loss) included in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income were not material for the three months ended September 29, 2018 and June 30, 2018. 
The debt indentures that govern the 2027 Notes, the 2023 Notes and the 2018 Notes, respectively, include covenants that limit the Company's ability to grant liens on its facilities and to enter into sale and leaseback transactions, which could limit the Company's ability to secure additional debt funding in the future. In circumstances involving a change of control of the Company followed by a downgrade of the rating of the 2027 Notes, the 2023 Notes or the 2018 Notes, the Company would be required to make an offer to repurchase the affected notes at a purchase price equal to 101% of the aggregate principal amount of such notes, plus accrued and unpaid interest. 
The Company has access to a $350 million senior unsecured revolving credit facility with certain institutional lenders that expires on June 27, 2019. The facility fee is at a rate per annum that varies based on the Company’s index debt rating and any advances under the credit agreement will accrue interest at a base rate plus a margin based on the Company’s index debt rating. The credit agreement requires the Company to comply with certain covenants, including a requirement that the Company maintain a ratio of debt to EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization) of not more than 3 to 1 and a minimum interest coverage ratio (EBITDA divided by interest expense) greater than 3.5 to 1. As of September 29, 2018, the Company had not borrowed any amounts from this credit facility and was in compliance with all debt covenants.
Pursuant to the 1996 Plan, the exercise price for incentive stock options and non-statutory stock options is determined to be the fair market value of the underlying shares on the date of grant. Options typically vest ratably over a four-year period measured from the date of grant. Options generally expire no later than seven years after the date of grant, subject to earlier termination upon an optionee's cessation of employment or service. 
RSUs granted to employees typically vest ratably over a four-year period and are converted into shares of the Company's common stock upon vesting, subject to the employee's continued service to the Company over that period. RSUs granted after August 2017 will continue to vest post-employment at the Company for certain individuals satisfying specific eligibility requirements. 
The fair value of RSUs and other awards under the Company’s 1996 Plan is estimated using the value of the Company’s common stock on the date of grant, reduced by the present value of dividends expected to be paid on the Company’s common stock prior to vesting. The Company also estimates forfeitures at the time of grant and makes revisions to forfeitures on a quarterly basis. 
The Company withheld shares totaling $7.5 million in value as a result of employee withholding taxes based on the value of the RSUs on their vesting date for the three months ended September 29, 2018. The total payments for the employees’ tax obligations to the taxing authorities are reflected as financing activities within the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.

Net revenues were $638.5 million and $575.7 million for the three months ended September 29, 2018 and September 23, 2017, respectively. Revenue from consumer products was up 13%, primarily driven by higher sales of wearables, smartphones and other consumer products. Revenue from automotive products was up 15%, primarily driven by growth in battery management systems for electric vehicles and auto safety and security products. Revenue from industrial products was also up 12%, primarily driven by higher sales of control and automation products. 
During the three months ended September 29, 2018 and September 23, 2017, approximately 89% and 89% of net revenues, respectively, were derived from customers outside of the United States. While less than 1.0% of our sales are denominated in currencies other than U.S. dollars, we enter into foreign currency forward contracts to mitigate our risks on firm commitments and net monetary assets denominated in foreign currencies. The impact of changes in foreign exchange rates on our revenue and results of operations for the three months ended September 29, 2018 and September 23, 2017 was immaterial.
Research and development expenses were $112.7 million and $108.6 million for the three months ended September 29, 2018 and September 23, 2017, respectively, which represented 17.7% and 18.9% of net revenues for each respective period. The $4.1 million increase was primarily attributable to an increase in salaries and related expenses.
The Act contains Global Intangible Low-Taxed Income (“GILTI”) provisions, which first impact the Company in fiscal year 2019. The GILTI provisions effectively subject income earned by the Company’s foreign subsidiaries to current U.S. tax at a rate of 10.5%, less foreign tax credits. Under U.S. GAAP the Company can make an accounting policy election to either recognize deferred taxes for temporary differences expected to impact GILTI in future years or provide for tax expense related to GILTI in the year the tax is incurred as a period expense. The Company has elected to treat tax generated by the GILTI provisions as a period expense. 
The Company’s federal statutory tax rate for the first quarter of fiscal year 2019 is 21%. The Company’s effective tax rate for the three months ended September 29, 2018 of 15.5% was lower than the statutory rate primarily due to earnings of foreign subsidiaries, generated primarily by the Company's international operations managed in Ireland, that were taxed at lower rates, partially offset by tax expense related to GILTI.
The Company’s federal statutory tax rate for the first quarter of fiscal year 2018 was 35%. The Act did not impact the federal statutory tax rate and income tax provision for the first quarter of fiscal year 2018 because it was enacted after the end of that quarter. The Company’s effective tax rate for the three months ended September 23, 2017 of 14.6% was lower than the statutory rate primarily due to earnings of foreign subsidiaries, generated primarily by the Company's international operations managed in Ireland, that were taxed at lower rates, and a $2.0 million discrete benefit for excess tax benefits generated by the settlement of share-based awards, partially offset by share-based compensation for which no tax benefit is expected and $3.9 million of discrete interest accruals for unrecognized tax benefits.
