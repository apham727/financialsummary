The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements of Maxim Integrated Products, Inc. and all of its majority-owned subsidiaries (collectively, the “Company” or “Maxim Integrated”) included herein have been prepared by the Company pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”).
In the opinion of management, all adjustments of a normal recurring nature which were considered necessary for fair presentation have been included.
Under the new standard, revenue is recognized when a customer obtains control of promised goods or services in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services.
On July 1, 2018, the Company adopted Topic 606 and related amendments (ASU 2015-14, Deferral of the Effective Date; ASU 2016-08, Principal versus Agent Considerations; ASU 2016-10, Identifying Performance Obligations and Licensing, ASU 2016-12, Narrow-Scope Improvements and Practical Expedients and ASU 2016-20, Technical Corrections and Improvements to Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers) using the modified retrospective method applied to all contracts that are not completed at the date of initial application (i.e., July 1, 2018).
Results for reporting periods beginning after July 1, 2018 are presented under Topic 606, while prior period amounts are not adjusted and continue to be reported in accordance with historic accounting standards under Topic 605.
The adoption of Topic 606 has no impact on the total cash flows from operating, investing, or financing activities on the Condensed Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows.
•The Company does not disclose the value of unsatisfied performance obligations for (i) contracts with an original expected length of one year or less and (ii) contracts for which the Company recognizes revenue at the amount to which we have the right to invoice for services performed.
•The Company has elected to account for shipping and handling costs as fulfillment costs after the customer obtains control of the goods.
•The Company has elected to exclude sales, use, value added, and some excise taxes, if applicable, from the measurement of the transaction price.
The transaction price is calculated as selling price net of variable considerations, such as distributor price adjustments.
