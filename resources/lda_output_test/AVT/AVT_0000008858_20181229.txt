 In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (the “FASB”) issued Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606) (“ASU 2014-09”, and collectively with its related subsequent amendments, “Topic 606”). Topic 606 supersedes previous revenue recognition guidance and requires the Company to recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the Company expects to be entitled in exchange for such goods or services. The Company adopted Topic 606 on July 1, 2018 using the modified retrospective transition method applied to those contracts which were not completed as of July 1, 2018. Under this transition method, the Company’s results in the consolidated statements of operations for the second quarter and six months ended December 29, 2018 are presented under Topic 606, while the comparative results for the second quarter and six months ended December 30, 2017 were not retrospectively adjusted, as such results were recognized in accordance with the revenue recognition policy discussed under Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in Note 1 of the Company’s Fiscal 2018 Annual Report on Form 10-K.  
 In March 2017, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2017-07, Compensation - Retirement Benefits (Topic 715)- Improving the Presentation of Net Periodic Cost and Net Periodic Postretirement Benefit Cost ("ASU No. 2017-07"). ASU No. 2017-07 requires that the service cost component of net periodic pension costs be included in the same line item as other compensation costs arising from services rendered by employees during the period, with the other components of the net periodic pension costs reported separately from the service cost component and below operating 
income. The Company adopted this standard effective the first quarter of fiscal year 2019, which required changes to the classification of net periodic pension costs in the consolidated statements of operations for all periods presented. The service cost component of the net periodic pension cost is now included in “Selling, general and administrative expenses” with all other components of net periodic pension costs within “Other income, net” in the consolidated statements of operations. The adoption of ASU No. 2017-07 did not have any impact on the Company’s reported amount of income from continuing operations before taxes.  
 In August 2017, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update 2017-12, Derivatives and Hedging (Topic 815) - Targeted Improvements to Accounting for Hedging Activities (“ASU 2017-12”), which improves the financial reporting of hedging relationships to better portray the economic results of an entity’s risk management activities in its financial statements and makes certain targeted improvements to simplify the qualification and application of hedge accounting compared to current GAAP. This update is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, with early adoption permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of the adoption of ASU 2017-12 on its consolidated financial statements.  
 Prior to the adoption of Topic 606, the Company’s revenue recognition policy was in accordance with ASC Topic 605, Revenue Recognition. Effective July 1, 2018, the Company adopted Topic 606 using the modified retrospective transition method, resulting in accounting policy changes surrounding revenue recognition which replace revenue recognition policies discussed in the Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in Note 1 of the Company’s Fiscal 2018 Annual Report on Form 10-K. The adoption of Topic 606 did not have a material impact on the Company’s consolidated financial statements.  
 Revenue is recognized at the point at which control of the underlying products are transferred to the customer, which includes determining whether products are distinct and separate performance obligations. For electronic component and related product sales, this generally occurs upon shipment of the products, however, this may occur at a later date depending on the agreed upon sales terms, such as delivery at the customer's designated location, or when products that are consigned at customer locations are consumed. In limited instances, where products are not in stock and delivery times are critical, product is purchased from the supplier and drop-shipped to the customer. The Company typically takes control of the products when shipped by the manufacturer and then recognizes revenue when control of the product transfers to the customer. The Company does not have material product warranty obligations as the assurance type product warranties provided by the component manufacturers are passed through to the Company’s customers.  
 For contracts related to the specialized manufacture of products for customers with no alternative use and for which the Company has an enforceable right to payment, including a reasonable profit margin, the Company recognizes revenue over time as control of the products transfer through the manufacturing process. The contract assets associated with such specialized manufacturing products are not material as these contracts represent less than 2% of the Company’s total sales.  
 Revenue is measured as the amount of consideration the Company expects to receive in exchange for transferring products. The Company estimates different forms of variable consideration at the time of sale based on historical experience, current conditions and contractual obligations. Revenue is recorded net of customer discounts and rebates. When the Company offers the right or has a history of accepting returns of product, historical experience is utilized to establish a liability for the estimate of expected returns and an asset for the right to recover the product expected to be returned. These adjustments are made in the same period as the underlying sales transactions.   
 Sales and other tax amounts collected from customers for remittance to governmental authorities are excluded from revenue. The Company has elected to treat shipping and handling of product as a fulfillment activity. The practical expedient not to disclose information about remaining performance obligations has also been elected as these contacts have an original duration of one year or less. The Company does not have any payment terms that exceed one year from the point it has satisfied the related performance obligations.   
 In December 2018, the Company acquired Softweb Solutions (“Softweb”) a privately held software and artificial intelligence company that delivers software solutions for Internet of Things (IoT) applications and systems designed to increase efficiency, speed time to market, and help businesses transform. The impact of this acquisition was not material to the Company’s consolidated balance sheets or statements of operations and as a result, the Company has not disclosed the preliminary allocation of purchase price or the pro-forma impact of the acquisition.  
 In February 2017, the Company completed the sale of its Technology Solutions business (“TS business”) to Tech Data Corporation (the “Buyer”). The TS business and the financial impacts of the divestiture are classified as discontinued operations in all periods presented. In August 2018, the Company executed a settlement agreement with the Buyer resulting in a final adjustment of $120.0 million and a final geographic allocation of the TS business sales price for tax reporting purposes. This incremental consideration received from the sale of the TS business as well as cash settlements from the resolution of indemnification claims and other cash reimbursements have been classified as cash flow from discontinued operations investing activities. Income tax payments related to the gain on sale of the TS business have been classified as cash flow from discontinued operations operating activities.  
 In connection with the sale of the TS business, the Company entered into a Transition Services Agreement (“TSA”), pursuant to which the Buyer will pay the Company to provide certain information technology, distribution, facilities, finance and human resources related services for various periods of time depending upon the services not to exceed approximately two years from the closing date. Expenses incurred by the Company to provide such services under the TSA are classified within selling, general and administrative expenses and amounts billed to the Buyer to provide such services are classified as a reduction of such expenses. As of December 29, 2018, the Buyer has formally terminated all TSA services.   
 The Company evaluates each quarter if facts and circumstances indicate that it is more likely than not that the fair value of reporting units is less than its carrying value, which would require the Company to perform an interim goodwill impairment test. Indicators the Company evaluates to determine whether an interim goodwill impairment test is necessary include, but are not limited to (i) a sustained decrease in share price or market capitalization as of any fiscal quarter end, (ii) changes in the macroeconomic or industry environments, (iii) the results of and the amount of time passed since the last goodwill impairment test and (iv) the long-term expected financial performance of its reporting units. During the second quarter of fiscal 2019, the Company concluded that an interim goodwill impairment test was not required.  
 The Company has an accounts receivable securitization program (the “Securitization Program”) in the United States with a group of financial institutions to allow the Company to transfer, on an ongoing revolving basis, an undivided interest in a designated pool of trade accounts receivable, to provide security or collateral for borrowings up to a maximum of $500 million. The Securitization Program does not qualify for off balance sheet accounting treatment and any borrowings under the Securitization Program are recorded as debt in the consolidated balance sheets. Under the Securitization Program, the Company legally sells and isolates certain U.S. trade accounts receivable, into a wholly owned and consolidated bankruptcy remote special purpose entity. Such receivables, which are recorded within “Receivables” in the consolidated balance sheets, totaled $814.6 million and $790.5 million at December 29, 2018, and June 30, 2018, respectively. The Securitization Program contains certain covenants relating to the quality of the receivables sold. The Securitization Program also requires the Company to maintain certain minimum interest coverage and leverage ratios, which the Company was in compliance with as of December 29, 2018, and June 30, 2018. The Securitization Program expires in August 2020 and as a result the Company has classified outstanding balances as long-term debt as of December 29, 2018. Interest on borrowings is calculated using a one-month LIBOR rate plus a spread of 0.75%. The facility fee on the unused balance of the facility is up to 0.35%.  
 The Company has a five-year $1.25 billion senior unsecured revolving credit facility (the “Credit Facility”) with a syndicate of banks, consisting of revolving credit facilities and the issuance of up to $200.0 million of letters of credit and up to $300.0 million of loans in certain approved currencies, which expires in June 2023. Subject to certain conditions, the Credit Facility may be increased up to $1.50 billion. Under the Credit Facility, the Company may select from various interest rate options, currencies and maturities. The Credit Facility contains certain covenants including various limitations on debt incurrence, share repurchases, dividends, investments and capital expenditures. The Credit Facility also includes financial covenants requiring the Company to maintain minimum interest coverage and leverage ratios, which the Company was in compliance with as of December 29, 2018, and June 30, 2018. As of December 29, 2018, and June 30, 2018, there were $3.0 million and $2.0 million, respectively, in letters of credit issued under the Credit Facility.

 Management believes that providing this additional information is useful to readers to better assess and understand operating performance, especially when comparing results with prior periods or forecasting performance for future periods, primarily because management typically monitors the business both including and excluding these adjustments to GAAP results. Management also uses these non-GAAP measures to establish operational goals and, in many cases, for measuring performance for compensation purposes. However, any analysis of results on a non-GAAP basis should be used as a complement to, and in conjunction with, results presented in accordance with GAAP.

 Sales for the second quarter of fiscal 2019 were $5.05 billion, an increase of 11.7%, or $527.3 million, from the prior year second quarter sales of $4.52 billion. Sales in constant currency increased 13.1% over the prior year second quarter with all regions of both the EC and PF operating groups contributing to this growth.  
 EC sales of $4.68 billion in the second quarter of fiscal 2019 increased $517.2 million or 12.4% from the prior year second quarter sales of $4.16 billion. This increase was primarily driven by increased sales across all EC regions including double digit growth in both the EMEA and Asia regions. PF sales for the second quarter of fiscal 2019 were $368.3 million, an increase of $10.1 million or 2.8% from the prior year second quarter sales of $358.1 million driven by growth in all three regions.   
 Gross profit for the second quarter of fiscal 2019 was $630.0 million, an increase of $27.6 million, or 4.6%, from the second quarter of fiscal 2018 gross profit of $602.5 million primarily driven by the increase in sales. Gross profit margin decreased 84 basis points to 12.5% from the second quarter of fiscal 2018 gross profit margin of 13.3%.  
 Gross profit and gross margins were $1.27 billion and 12.5%, respectively, for the first six months of fiscal 2019 as compared with $1.22 billion and 13.2%, respectively, for the first six months of fiscal 2018 primarily due to an increased mix of sales coming from the lower-margin Asia region and from the impact of supplier program changes.   
 Operating income for the second quarter of fiscal 2019 was $96.1 million, an increase of $14.4 million, or 17.7%, from the second quarter of fiscal 2018 of $81.6 million. The year over year increase in operating income was primarily driven by the increase in sales and the reduction in selling, general and administrative expenses as compared to the prior year second quarter, partially offset by the decline in gross profit margin. Adjusted operating income for the second quarter of fiscal 2019 was $178.8 million, an increase of $38.6 million, or 27.5%, from the second quarter of fiscal 2018. The year over year increase in adjusted operating income was primarily driven by the increase in sales and the reduction in selling, general and administrative expenses as compared to the prior year second quarter, partially offset by the decline in gross profit margin.  
 EC operating income margin increased 27 basis points year over year to 3.4% and PF operating income margin increased 142 basis points year over year to 10.8%. The improvement in operating income margin at both operating groups was primarily due to the organic sales growth and from operating cost reductions related to restructuring and integration activities.   
 Interest and other financing expenses in the second quarter of fiscal 2019 was $33.7 million, an increase of $10.9 million or 47.7%, as compared with interest and other financing expenses of $22.8 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2018. Interest and other financing expenses in the first six months of fiscal 2019 was $63.8 million, an increase of $19.0 million or 42.3%, as compared with interest and other financing expenses of $44.8 million in the first six months of fiscal 2018.The increase in interest and other financing expenses in the second quarter and first six months of fiscal 2019 compared to the second quarter and first six months of fiscal 2018 was primarily related to increased expenses in Asia to finance working capital needs and from lower interest income from investments in cash equivalents between the fiscal years.

In the second quarter and first six months of fiscal 2019, the Company had income related to the Company’s pension plans, partially offset by foreign currency losses primarily due to the strengthening of the U.S. Dollar compared to certain currencies.  
 Loss from discontinued operations was $10.1 million and $9.9 million in the second quarter and the first six months of fiscal 2018, respectively, primarily as a result of settlement losses associated with the Company’s pension plan due to former TS business employees requesting and receiving distributions from the Company’s pension plan during fiscal 2018.

 As a result primarily of certain former manufacturing operations, the Company has incurred and may have future liability under various federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations, including those governing pollution and exposure to, and the handling, storage and disposal of, hazardous substances. For example, under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act of 1980, as amended, and similar state laws, the Company is and may be liable for the costs of cleaning up environmental contamination on or from certain of its current or former properties, and at off-site locations where the Company disposed of wastes in the past. Such laws may impose joint and several liability. Typically, however, the costs for clean up at such sites are allocated among potentially responsible parties based upon each party’s relative contribution to the contamination, and other factors.  
 Pursuant to SEC regulations, including but not limited to Item 103 of Regulation S-K, the Company regularly assesses the status of and developments in pending environmental and other compliance related legal proceedings to determine whether any such proceedings should be identified specifically in this discussion of legal proceedings, and has concluded that no particular pending legal proceeding requires public disclosure. Based on the information known to date, management believes that the Company has appropriately accrued in its consolidated financial statements for its share of the estimable costs of environmental and other compliance related matters.
