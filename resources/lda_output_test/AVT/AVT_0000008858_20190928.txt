The adoption of ASC 842 did not have a material impact on the Company’s consolidated statements of operations or retained earnings. The Company elected the package of practical expedients permitted under the transition guidance that allowed, among other things, the historical lease classification to be carried forward without reassessment and the hindsight practical expedient. The Company elected to not separate lease and non-lease components for its real estate leases. Refer to Note 5 for additional disclosures related to leases.
In August 2017, the FASB issued ASU 2017-12, Derivatives and Hedging (Topic 815) - Targeted Improvements to Accounting for Hedging Activities” and its related amendments (collectively “ASC 815”), which improves the financial reporting of hedging relationships to better portray the economic results of an entity’s risk management activities in its financial statements and makes certain targeted improvements to simplify the qualification and application of hedge accounting compared to current GAAP. This update is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, with early adoption permitted. The adoption of ASC 815 in the first quarter of fiscal 2020 did not have any impact on the Company’s consolidated financial statements.
In February 2017, the Company completed the sale of its Technology Solutions business (“TS business”) to Tech Data Corporation (the “Buyer”). The TS business and the financial impacts of the divestiture are classified as discontinued operations in all periods presented. In August 2018, the Company executed a settlement agreement with the Buyer resulting in a final adjustment of $120.0 million and a final geographic allocation of the TS business sales price for tax reporting purposes. This incremental consideration received from the sale of the TS business as well as cash settlements from the resolution of indemnification claims and other cash reimbursements have been classified as cash flow from discontinued operations investing activities. Income tax payments related to the gain on sale of the TS business have been classified as cash flow from discontinued operations operating activities.
The following table presents the change in goodwill by reportable segment for the three months ended September 28, 2019. 
The Company evaluates each quarter if facts and circumstances indicate that it is more likely than not that the fair value of its reporting units is less than their carrying value, which would require the Company to perform an interim goodwill impairment test. Indicators the Company evaluates to determine whether an interim goodwill impairment test is necessary include, but are not limited to, (i) a sustained decrease in share price or market capitalization as of any fiscal quarter end, (ii) changes in the macroeconomic or industry environments, (iii) the results of and the amount of time passed since the last goodwill impairment test and (iv) the long-term expected financial performance of its reporting units. During the first quarter of fiscal 2020, the Company concluded that an interim goodwill impairment test was not required.
The following table presents the Company’s acquired intangible assets at September 28, 2019, and June 29, 2019, respectively. 
The Company has an accounts receivable securitization program (the “Securitization Program”) in the United States with a group of financial institutions to allow the Company to transfer, on an ongoing revolving basis, an undivided interest in a designated pool of trade accounts receivable, to provide security or collateral for borrowings up to a maximum of $500 million. The Securitization Program does not qualify for off balance sheet accounting treatment and any borrowings under the Securitization Program are recorded as debt in the consolidated balance sheets. Under the Securitization Program, the Company legally sells and isolates certain U.S. trade accounts receivable into a wholly owned and consolidated bankruptcy remote special purpose entity. Such receivables, which are recorded within “Receivables” in the consolidated balance sheets, totaled $839.6 million and $857.3 million at September 28, 2019, and June 29, 2019, respectively. The Securitization Program contains certain covenants relating to the quality of the receivables sold. The Securitization Program also requires the Company to maintain certain minimum interest coverage and leverage ratios, which the Company was in compliance with as of September 28, 2019, and June 29, 2019. The Securitization Program expires in August 2020 and as a result the Company has classified outstanding balances as short-term debt as of September 28, 2019. Interest on borrowings is calculated using a one-month LIBOR rate plus a spread of 0.75%. The facility fee on the unused balance of the facility is up to 0.35%.
The Company has a five-year $1.25 billion senior unsecured revolving credit facility (the “Credit Facility”) with a syndicate of banks, consisting of revolving credit facilities and the issuance of up to $200.0 million of letters of credit and up to $300.0 million of loans in certain approved currencies, which expires in June 2023. Subject to certain conditions, the Credit Facility may be increased up to $1.50 billion. Under the Credit Facility, the Company may select from various interest rate options, currencies and maturities. The Credit Facility contains certain covenants including various limitations on debt incurrence, share repurchases, dividends, investments and capital expenditures. The Credit Facility also includes financial covenants requiring the Company to maintain minimum interest coverage and leverage ratios, which the Company was in compliance with as of September 28, 2019 and June 29, 2019. As of September 28, 2019, and June 29, 2019, there were $4.2 million and $4.0 million, respectively, in letters of credit issued under the Credit Facility.
As of September 28, 2019, the carrying value and fair value of the Company’s total debt was $1.83 billion and $1.91 billion, respectively. At June 29, 2019, the carrying value and fair value of the Company’s total debt was $1.72 billion and $1.78 billion, respectively. Fair value for the public notes was estimated based upon quoted market prices and for other forms of debt fair value approximates carrying value due to the market based variable nature of the interest rates on those debt facilities.
Substantially all the Company’s leases are classified as operating leases and are predominately related to real property for distribution centers, office space and integration facilities with a remaining lease term of up to 19 years. The Company’s equipment leases are primarily for automobiles and equipment and are not material to the consolidated financial statements.
The Company determines if an arrangement contains a lease at inception based on whether it conveys the right to control the use of an identified asset in exchange for consideration. Lease right-of-use assets (“operating lease assets”) and associated liabilities (“operating lease liabilities”) are recognized at the commencement date of the lease based on the present value of lease payments over the lease term. Certain lease agreements may include one or more options to extend or terminate a lease. Lease terms are inclusive of these options if it is reasonably certain that the Company will exercise such options. 
The Company’s leases generally do not provide a readily determinable implicit borrowing rate, as such, the discount rate used to calculate present value is the Company’s incremental secured borrowing rate. The incremental secured borrowing rates used at the date of adoption for each lease varies in accordance with the remaining lease term and the currency of the lease payments. Lease cost is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term and is included as a component of “Selling, general, and administrative expenses” in the consolidated statements of operations. Lease payments are primarily fixed; however, certain lease agreements contain variable payments, which are expensed as incurred and not included in the measurement of operating lease assets and liabilities. 
Many of the Company’s subsidiaries purchase and sell products in currencies other than their functional currencies. This subjects the Company to the risks associated with fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. The Company reduces this risk by utilizing natural hedging (e.g., offsetting receivables and payables in the same foreign currency) as well as by creating offsetting positions through the use of derivative financial instruments, primarily forward foreign exchange contracts typically with maturities of less than 60 days (“economic hedges”), but no longer than one year. The Company continues to have exposure to foreign currency risks to the extent they are not economically hedged. The Company adjusts any economic hedges to fair value through the consolidated statements of operations primarily within “Other income (expense), net.” The fair value of forward foreign exchange contracts, which are based upon Level 2 criteria under the ASC 820 fair value hierarchy, are classified in the captions “Prepaid and other current assets” or “Accrued expenses and other,” as applicable, in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets as of September 28, 2019 and June 29, 2019. The Company’s master netting and other similar arrangements with various financial institutions related to derivative financial instruments allow for the right of offset. The Company’s policy is to present derivative financial instruments with the same counterparty as either a net asset or liability when the right of offset exists.
As of September 28, 2019, and June 29, 2019, the Company had aggregate estimated liabilities of $14.7 million classified within accrued expenses and other for such compliance-related matters that were reasonably estimable as of such dates.

●Sales adjusted for certain items that impact the year-over-year analysis, which includes the impact of certain acquisitions by adjusting Avnet’s prior periods to include the sales of acquired businesses, as if the acquisitions had occurred at the beginning of the earliest period presented. Sales taking into account these adjustments are referred to as “organic sales.”
Management believes that providing this additional information is useful to readers to better assess and understand operating performance, especially when comparing results with prior periods or forecasting performance for future periods, primarily because management typically monitors the business both including and excluding these adjustments to GAAP results. Management also uses these non-GAAP measures to establish operational goals and, in many cases, for measuring performance for compensation purposes. However, any analysis of results on a non-GAAP basis should be used as a complement to, and in conjunction with, results presented in accordance with GAAP.
Avnet, Inc. (the “Company” or “Avnet”), is a global technology solutions company with an extensive ecosystem delivering design, product, marketing and supply chain expertise for customers at every stage of the product lifecycle.

Sales in constant currency decreased 7.8% over the prior year first quarter with all three regions of both operating groups contributing to the decline. These decreases are primarily due to the current industry-wide economic downturn.
EC sales of $4.29 billion in the first quarter of fiscal 2020 decreased $416.6 million or 8.8% from the prior year first quarter sales of $4.71 billion. EC sales in constant currency declined 7.7% in constant currency year over year. Farnell sales for the first quarter of fiscal 2020 were $335.8 million, a decrease of $43.2 million or 11.4% from the prior year first quarter sales of $379.1 million.

Interest and other financing expenses in the first quarter of fiscal 2020 was $33.6 million, an increase of $3.5 million or 11.8%, as compared with interest and other financing expenses of $30.1 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2019. The increase in interest and other financing expenses in the first quarter of fiscal 2020 compared to the first quarter of fiscal 2019 was primarily related to increased expenses in foreign regions to finance working capital needs.
During the first quarter of fiscal 2020, the Company had $4.9 million of other income as compared with $1.9 million of other expense in the first quarter of fiscal 2019. The increase in other income was primarily due to favorable foreign currency gains in the first quarter of fiscal 2020 as compared to foreign currency losses in the first quarter of fiscal 2019.
For a detailed description of the Company’s long-term debt and lease commitments for the next five years and thereafter, see Long-Term Contractual Obligations appearing in Item 7 of the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 29, 2019. With the exception of the Company’s debt transactions discussed herein, there are no material changes to this information outside of normal borrowings and repayments of long-term debt and operating lease payments. The Company does not currently have any material non-cancellable commitments for capital expenditures or inventory purchases.
The Company has various lines of credit, financing arrangements and other forms of bank debt in the U.S. and various foreign locations to fund the short-term working capital, foreign exchange, overdraft and letter of credit needs of its wholly owned subsidiaries. Outstanding borrowings under such forms of debt at the end of first quarter of fiscal 2020 was $0.6 million.
As of the end of the first quarter of fiscal 2020, the Company had a combined total borrowing capacity of $1.75 billion under the Credit Facility and the Securitization Program. There were no borrowings outstanding and $4.2 million in letters of credit issued under the Credit Facility and $338.1 million in borrowings outstanding under the Securitization Program, resulting in approximately $1.41 billion of total availability as of September 28, 2019. Availability under the Securitization Program is subject to the Company having sufficient eligible trade accounts receivable to support desired borrowings. The Company expects to renew or replace the Securitization Program on similar terms, subject to market conditions, before its maturity in August 2020. The Company expects to redeem the $300.0 million of Notes due June 2020 either through the issuance of new notes or from available borrowing capacity under the Credit Facility. During the first quarter of fiscal 2020, the Company had an average daily balance outstanding of approximately $50.6 million under the Credit Facility and approximately $488.4 million under the Securitization Program. During the first quarter of fiscal 2019, the Company had an average daily balance outstanding of approximately $65.0 million under the Securitization Program.
During periods of weakening demand in the electronic components industry, the Company typically generates cash from operating activities. Conversely, the Company is more likely to use operating cash flows for working capital requirements during periods of higher growth. The Company generated $871.7 million in cash flows from operating activities over the trailing four fiscal quarters ended September 28, 2019 from continuing operations. 
Historically the Company has made, and expects to continue to make, strategic investments through acquisition activity to the extent the investments strengthen Avnet’s competitive position, further its business strategies and meet management’s return on financial thresholds. As the Company implements the operating cost savings restructuring plans, responds to current business environment challenges and pursues ways to become more efficient and cost effective, the Company expects to use cash for restructuring, integration and other expenses.

See Liquidity and Capital Resources — Financing Transactions appearing in Item 2 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for further discussion of the Company’s financing transactions and capital structure. As of September 28, 2019, 82% of the Company’s debt bears interest at a fixed rate and 18% of the Company’s debt bears interest at variable rates. Therefore, a hypothetical 1.0% (100 basis points) increase in interest rates would result in a $0.8 million decrease in income from continuing operations before income taxes in the Company’s consolidated statement of operations for the first quarter of fiscal 2020.
