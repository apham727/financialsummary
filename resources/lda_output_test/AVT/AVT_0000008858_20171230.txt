 In the opinion of management, the accompanying unaudited interim consolidated financial statements contain all adjustments necessary to present fairly Avnet, Inc.’s and its consolidated subsidiaries’ (collectively, the “Company” or “Avnet”) financial position, results of operations, comprehensive income (loss) and cash flows. All such adjustments are of a normal recurring nature.  
 In August 2017, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued Accounting Standards Update 2017-12, Derivatives and Hedging (Topic 815) - Targeted Improvements to Accounting for Hedging Activities (“ASU 2017-12”), which improves the financial reporting of hedging relationships to better portray the economic results of an entity’s risk management activities in its financial statements and makes certain targeted improvements to simplify the qualification and application of the hedge accounting compared to current GAAP. This update is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, with early adoption permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of the adoption of ASU 2017-12 on its consolidated financial statements.  
 In February 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842) (“ASU 2016-02”). The update requires a lessee to recognize assets and liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets for leases with lease terms greater than 12 months. ASU 2016-02 is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2018. Early adoption is permitted. The update will be effective for the Company in the first quarter of fiscal 2020, using a modified retrospective approach. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of the adoption of ASU 2016-02 on its consolidated financial statements.  
 In May 2014, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, as amended (“ASU 2014-09”), to supersede nearly all existing revenue recognition guidance under GAAP. The core principles of ASU 2014-09 are to recognize revenue when promised goods or services are transferred to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration that is expected to be received for those goods or services. Application of the guidance in ASU 2014-09 is expected to require more judgment and estimates within the revenue recognition process compared to existing GAAP. ASU 2014-09 is required to be adopted by the Company in the first quarter of fiscal 2019.   
 The Company expects to adopt the requirements of ASU 2014-09 using retrospective adoption to each prior reporting period presented. The company has established an implementation team inclusive of external advisors engaged to assist in evaluating potential differences compared to existing GAAP. The Company has identified its revenue streams and is currently assessing each stream for potential impacts from the adoption of ASU 2014-09. For the revenue streams assessed, the Company does not anticipate a material impact in the timing or amount of revenue recognized.   
 In August 2017, the Company acquired Dragon Innovation, Inc. (“Dragon”), a provider of manufacturing logistics services to entrepreneurs. The impact of this acquisition was not material to the Company’s consolidated balance sheets or statements of operations.  
 In February 2017, the Company completed the sale of its Technology Solutions (“TS”) business to Tech Data Corporation (the “Buyer”). Included in the gain on sale recorded upon completion of the sale were estimates for certain income taxes due on the gain and additional cash consideration expected from the Buyer related to a closing date net working capital sales price adjustment (the “closing date adjustment”). The Company is finalizing the closing date adjustment with the Buyer as provided for in the sales agreement and has included an estimate of this amount as the principal component of the $269.2 million of prepaid and other current assets as of December 30, 2017. The final closing date adjustment, as determined through the established process outlined in the sales agreement, may be materially different from the Company’s estimate. The impact of any probable changes in the closing date adjustment will be recorded as an adjustment to the gain on sale from discontinued operations in the period such change occurs. Additionally, the income taxes associated with the gain will be impacted by the final geographic allocation of the sales price, which must be agreed to with the Buyer after determination of the closing date adjustment as required in the sales agreement and may be materially different from the Company’s estimates. The impact of any changes in estimated income taxes on the gain will be recorded as an adjustment to the gain on sale from discontinued operations in the period such change in estimate occurs. The Company expects the closing date adjustment to be finalized by the end of fiscal 2018 and the income tax on the gain to be finalized during fiscal 2019.  
 The Company received 2.8 million shares of the Buyer’s common stock at closing (the “Shares”), which has been recorded within “Marketable securities” on the Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheets. Unrealized and realized gains or losses due to changes in fair value based upon Level 1 quoted active market prices of the Shares are recorded in “Other income (expense), net” on the Consolidated Statements of Operations. The sales agreement includes time based contractual restrictions related to the Company’s sale of the Shares and as such, the Company entered into economic hedges to reduce the Company’s exposure to price fluctuations of the Shares during the restricted period, which fixes the net amount that the Company will realize upon the sale of the Shares. The Company records changes in fair value related to the economic share price hedges within “Other income (expense), net”, offsetting the changes in fair value of the underlying Shares. During the six months ended December 30, 2017, the Company sold 1.4 million Shares, the net proceeds of which have been included in “Cash flows from investing activities – discontinued operations.”  
 In connection with the sale of the TS business, the Company entered into a Transition Services Agreement (“TSA”), pursuant to which the Buyer will pay the Company to provide certain information technology, distribution, facilities, finance and human resources related services for various periods of time depending upon the services not to exceed approximately two years from the closing date. Expenses incurred by the Company to provide such services under the TSA are classified within selling, general and administrative expenses and amounts billed to the Buyer to provide such services are classified as a reduction of such expenses. The Buyer has terminated substantially all TSA services outside of certain information technology services and all remaining TSA services are expected to be terminated by the end of fiscal 2018.  
 The Company’s reporting units passed goodwill impairment testing using a quantitative impairment model in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017, however, the Company’s Electronic Components (“EC”) Americas reporting units had an estimated fair value that was not substantially in excess of its carrying value. The Company also evaluates each quarter if facts and circumstances indicate that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value, which would require the Company to perform an interim goodwill impairment test. Indicators that the Company evaluates to determine whether an interim goodwill impairment test is necessary include, but are not limited to (i) a sustained decrease in share price or market capitalization, (ii) changes in the macroeconomic or industry environments, (iii) the results of and the amount of time passed since the last goodwill impairment test and (iv) the long-term expected financial performance of its reporting units.  
 Bank credit facilities and other consists primarily of various committed and uncommitted lines of credit and other forms of bank debt with financial institutions utilized primarily to support the working capital requirements of the Company including its foreign operations.  
 The Company has an accounts receivable securitization program (the “Program”) in the United States with a group of financial institutions to allow the Company to transfer, on an ongoing revolving basis, an undivided interest in a designated pool of trade accounts receivable, to provide security or collateral for borrowings up to a maximum of $400 million. The Program does not qualify for off balance sheet accounting treatment and any borrowings under the Program are recorded as debt in the consolidated balance sheets. Under the Program, the Company legally sells and isolates certain U.S. trade accounts receivable into a wholly owned and consolidated bankruptcy remote special purpose entity. Such receivables, which are recorded within “Receivables” in the consolidated balance sheets, totaled $730.8 million and $807.5 million at December 30, 2017, and July 1, 2017, respectively. The Program contains certain covenants relating to the quality of the receivables sold. The Program also requires the Company to maintain certain minimum interest coverage and leverage ratios, which the Company was in compliance with as of December 30, 2017, and July 1, 2017. The Program expires in August 2018 and as a result the Company has classified outstanding balances as short-term debt as of December 30, 2017. Interest on borrowings is calculated using a base rate or a commercial paper rate plus a spread of 0.40% with a facility fee of 0.40%.  
 As of December 30, 2017, the carrying value and fair value of the Company’s total debt was $1.73 billion and $1.80 billion, respectively. At July 1, 2017, the carrying value and fair value of the Company’s total debt was $1.78 billion and $1.85 billion, respectively. Fair value for the notes was estimated based upon quoted market prices and for other forms of debt fair value approximates carrying value due to the market based variable nature of the interest rates on those debt agreements.  
 Many of the Company’s subsidiaries purchase and sell products in currencies other than their functional currencies. This subjects the Company to the risks associated with fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. The Company reduces this risk by utilizing natural hedging (e.g., offsetting receivables and payables in the same foreign currency) as well as by creating offsetting positions through the use of derivative financial instruments, primarily forward foreign exchange contracts typically with maturities of less than 60 days (“economic hedges”), but no longer than one year. The Company continues to have exposure to foreign currency risks to the extent they are not economically hedged. The Company adjusts any economic hedges to fair value through the consolidated statements of operations primarily within “other income (expense), net.” The fair value of forward foreign exchange contracts, which are based upon Level 2 criteria under the ASC 820 fair value hierarchy, are classified in the captions “other current assets” or “accrued expenses and other,” as applicable, in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets as of December 30, 2017, and July 1, 2017. The Company’s master netting and other similar arrangements with various financial institutions related to derivative financial instruments allow for the right of offset. The Company’s policy is to present derivative financial instruments with the same counterparty as either a net asset or liability when the right of offset exists.  
 In addition to amounts included in the above table, there was approximately $12.8 million and $34.0 million as of December 30, 2017 and July 1, 2017, respectively, of accrued expenses related to derivative financial instruments used to economically hedge the fair value changes in marketable securities discussed further in Note 3.  
 The above table excludes approximately $27.0 million and $35.0 million for the second quarter and first six months of fiscal 2017, respectively, of derivative financial instrument losses in other income (expenses), net, associated with foreign currency derivative financial instruments purchased to economically hedge the British Pound purchase price of the PF acquisition.

 The Company recorded restructuring, integration and other expenses of $36.8 million during the second quarter of fiscal 2018. The Company recorded $12.9 million of restructuring costs in the second quarter of fiscal 2018 in order to realize approximately $2.0 million in expected annualized operating cost savings once such restructuring actions initiated before the end of the second quarter of fiscal 2018 are completed. During the second quarter of fiscal 2018, the Company incurred integration costs of $8.2 million, accelerated depreciation of $16.9 million, other costs of $0.2 million and a reversal of $1.4 million for changes in estimates for costs associated with prior year restructuring actions.

The year over year decrease in operating income was primarily driven by declines in the EC’s Americas and EMEA regions due primarily to supplier program changes, partially offset by an increase at PF. Adjusted operating income for the second quarter of fiscal 2018 was $145.7 million, a decrease of $18.8 million, or 11.4%, from the second quarter of fiscal 2017.  
  EC operating income margin decreased 104 basis points year over year to 3.1% due primarily to supplier program changes partially offset by cost reductions from restructuring actions. PF operating income margin increased 105 basis points year over year to 10.0% due primarily to sales growth and the realization of post-acquisition cost synergies.   
 Interest expense in the second quarter of fiscal 2018 was $25.6 million, a decrease of $1.1 million or 4.1%, as compared with interest expense of $26.7 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2017.

The decrease in interest expense in the second quarter and first six months of fiscal 2018 compared to the second quarter and first six months of fiscal 2017 was primarily related to the impact of the Company’s repayment of its outstanding term loans and borrowings on its revolving credit facilities, which were used to help fund the PF acquisition.

 As a result primarily of certain former manufacturing operations, Avnet has incurred and may have future liability under various federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations, including those governing pollution and exposure to, and the handling, storage and disposal of, hazardous substances. For example, under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act of 1980, as amended, and similar state laws, Avnet is and may be liable for the costs of cleaning up environmental contamination on or from certain of its current or former properties, and at off-site locations where the Company disposed of wastes in the past. Such laws may impose joint and several liability. Typically, however, the costs for clean up at such sites are allocated among potentially responsible parties based upon each party’s relative contribution to the contamination, and other factors.  
 Pursuant to SEC regulations, including but not limited to Item 103 of Regulation S-K, the Company regularly assesses the status of and developments in pending environmental and other compliance related legal proceedings to determine whether any such proceedings should be identified specifically in this discussion of legal proceedings, and has concluded that no particular pending legal proceeding requires public disclosure. Based on the information known to date, management believes that the Company has appropriately accrued in its consolidated financial statements for its share of the estimable costs of environmental and other compliance related matters.
