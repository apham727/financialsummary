 Certain reclassifications have been made in prior periods and the fiscal year to date current periods to conform to the current period presentation.
 In August 2017, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued Accounting Standards Update 2017-12, Derivatives and Hedging (Topic 815) - Targeted Improvements to Accounting for Hedging Activities (“ASU 2017-12”), which improves the financial reporting of hedging relationships to better portray the economic results of an entity’s risk management activities in its financial statements and makes certain targeted improvements to simplify the qualification and application of the hedge accounting compared to current GAAP.
 In March 2017, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update 2017-07, Compensation—Retirement Benefits (Topic 715) - Improving the Presentation of Net Periodic Pension Cost and Net Periodic Postretirement Benefit Cost (“ASU 2017-07”).
The new guidance requires the service cost component of net periodic benefit cost to be presented in the same income statement line item as other employee compensation costs arising from services rendered during the period, and allows only the service cost component to be eligible for capitalization in assets.
The update requires a lessee to recognize assets and liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets for leases with lease terms greater than 12 months.
2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, as amended (“ASU 2014-09”), to supersede nearly all existing revenue recognition guidance under GAAP.
The core principles of ASU 2014-09 are to recognize revenue when promised goods or services are transferred to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration that is expected to be received for those goods or services.
Application of the guidance in ASU 2014-09 is expected to require more judgment and estimates within the revenue recognition process compared to existing GAAP.
The company has established an implementation team inclusive of external advisors engaged to assist in evaluating potential differences compared to existing GAAP.
For the revenue streams assessed, the Company does not anticipate a material impact in the timing or amount of revenue recognized. Management believes that providing this additional information is useful to readers to better assess and understand operating performance, especially when comparing results with prior periods or forecasting performance for future periods, primarily because management typically monitors the business both including and excluding these adjustments to GAAP results.
