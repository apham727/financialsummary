 In March 2017, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update 2017-07, Compensation–Retirement Benefits (Topic 715) - Improving the Presentation of Net Periodic Pension Cost and Net Periodic Postretirement Benefit Cost (“ASU 2017-07”).
The new guidance requires the service cost component of net periodic benefit cost to be presented in the same income statement line item as other employee compensation costs arising from services rendered during the period, and allows only the service cost component to be eligible for capitalization in assets.
The update requires a lessee to recognize assets and liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets for leases with lease terms greater than 12 months.
The core principles of ASU 2014-09 are to recognize revenue when promised goods or services are transferred to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration that is expected to be received for those goods or services.
Application of the guidance in ASU 2014-09 is expected to require more judgment and estimates within the revenue recognition process compared to existing GAAP.
The company has established an implementation team inclusive of external advisors engaged to assist in evaluating potential differences compared to existing GAAP.
The Company does not currently expect significant changes in revenue recognition practices for continuing operations compared to existing GAAP.
The Company is finalizing the closing date adjustment with the Buyer as provided for in the sales agreement and has included an estimate of this amount as primary component of the $305.1 million of prepaid and other current assets as of March 31, 2018.
The final closing date adjustment, as determined through the established process outlined in the sales agreement, may be materially different from the Company’s estimate.
The impact of any changes in estimated income taxes on the gain will be recorded as an adjustment to the gain on sale from discontinued operations in the period such change in estimate occurs.
Unrealized and realized gains or losses due to changes in fair value based upon Level 1 quoted active market prices of the Shares are recorded in “Other income (expense), net” on the Consolidated Statements of Operations.
The sales agreement includes time based contractual restrictions related to the Company’s sale of the Shares and as such, the Company entered into economic hedges to reduce the Company’s exposure to price fluctuations of the Shares during the restricted period, which fixes the net amount that the Company will realize upon the sale of the Shares.
During the nine months ended March 31, 2018, the Company sold 1.9 million Shares, the net proceeds of which have been included in “Cash flows from investing activities – discontinued operations.”
 In connection with the sale of the TS business, the Company entered into a Transition Services Agreement (“TSA”), pursuant to which the Buyer will pay the Company to provide certain information technology, distribution, facilities, finance and human resources related services for various periods of time depending upon the services not to exceed approximately two years from the closing date.
Expenses incurred by the Company to provide such services under the TSA are classified within selling, general and administrative expenses and amounts billed to the Buyer to provide such services are classified as a reduction of such expenses.
