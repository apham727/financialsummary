 In August 2017, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update 2017-12, Derivatives and Hedging (Topic 815) - Targeted Improvements to Accounting for Hedging Activities (“ASU 2017-12”), which improves the financial reporting of hedging relationships to better portray the economic results of an entity’s risk management activities in its financial statements and makes certain targeted improvements to simplify the qualification and application of the hedge accounting compared to current GAAP. This update is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, with early adoption permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of the adoption of ASU 2017-12 on its consolidated financial 
 In March 2017, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update 2017-07, Compensation–Retirement Benefits (Topic 715) - Improving the Presentation of Net Periodic Pension Cost and Net Periodic Postretirement Benefit Cost (“ASU 2017-07”). The new guidance requires the service cost component of net periodic benefit cost to be presented in the same income statement line item as other employee compensation costs arising from services rendered during the period, and allows only the service cost component to be eligible for capitalization in assets. Other components of the net periodic benefit cost are to be presented separately from the line item that includes the service cost and outside of any subtotal of operating income, and the line item must be appropriately described. If a separate line item is not used, the line item used in the income statement to present the other components of net benefit cost must be disclosed. The guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, and interim periods within that annual period, with early adoption permitted. The amendment is to be applied retrospectively. The new guidance primarily impacts the income statement presentation of net periodic benefit cost and the Company does not believe adoption of this standard will have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements including income before income taxes, but the reported amount of operating income will decrease compared to historical measurements of operating income. Refer to Note 9, “Pension Plan,” for further information on the components of net periodic benefit cost.  
 In May 2014, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, as amended (“ASU 2014-09”), to supersede nearly all existing revenue recognition guidance under GAAP. The core principles of ASU 2014-09 are to recognize revenue when promised goods or services are transferred to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration that is expected to be received for those goods or services. Application of the guidance in ASU 2014-09 is expected to require more judgment and estimates within the revenue recognition process compared to existing GAAP. ASU 2014-09 is required to be adopted by the Company in the first quarter of fiscal 2019.   
 The Company expects to adopt the requirements of ASU 2014-09 using retrospective adoption to each prior reporting period presented. The company has established an implementation team inclusive of external advisors engaged to assist in evaluating potential differences compared to existing GAAP. The Company has identified its revenue streams and is currently assessing each stream for potential impacts from the adoption of ASU 2014-09. For the revenue streams assessed, the Company does not anticipate a material impact in the timing or amount of revenue recognized.   
 The income taxes associated with the gain will be impacted by the final geographic allocation of the sales price, which must be agreed to with the Buyer after determination of the closing date adjustment, as required in the sales agreement, and may be materially different from the Company’s estimates. The impact of any changes in estimated income taxes on the gain will be recorded as an adjustment to the gain on sale from discontinued operations in the period such change in estimate occurs. The Company currently expects the closing date adjustment to be finalized by the first half of fiscal 2019 and the income tax on the gain to be finalized by the end of fiscal 2019.  
 The Company received 2.8 million shares of the Buyer’s common stock at closing (the “Shares”), which has been recorded within “Marketable securities” on the Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheets. As of March 31, 2018, the Company had 0.9 million shares remaining, which had market value of $75.1 million. Unrealized and realized gains or losses due to changes in fair value based upon Level 1 quoted active market prices of the Shares are recorded in “Other income (expense), net” on the Consolidated Statements of Operations. The sales agreement includes time based contractual restrictions related to the Company’s sale of the Shares and as such, the Company entered into economic hedges to reduce the Company’s exposure to price fluctuations of the Shares during the restricted period, which fixes the net amount that the Company will realize upon the sale of the Shares. The Company records changes in fair value related to the economic share price hedges within “Other income (expense), net”, offsetting the changes in fair value of the underlying Shares. During the nine months ended March 31, 2018, the Company sold 1.9 million Shares, the net proceeds of which have been included in “Cash flows from investing activities – discontinued operations.”  
 In connection with the sale of the TS business, the Company entered into a Transition Services Agreement (“TSA”), pursuant to which the Buyer will pay the Company to provide certain information technology, distribution, facilities, finance and human resources related services for various periods of time depending upon the services not to exceed approximately two years from the closing date. Expenses incurred by the Company to provide such services under the TSA are classified within selling, general and administrative expenses and amounts billed to the Buyer to provide such services are classified as a reduction of such expenses. As of March 31, 2018, the Buyer has formally terminated substantially all TSA services outside of certain minor information technology services and all remaining TSA services are expected to be terminated by the first half of fiscal 2019.  
 Included within selling, general and administrative expenses of discontinued operations was $8.3 million and $34.9 million of estimated corporate expenses, excluding general overhead, specific to or benefiting the TS business for the third quarter and nine months ended April 1, 2017, respectively.   
 The loss from discontinued operations, net of tax, in the third quarter and first nine months of fiscal 2018 substantially all relates to settlement losses associated with the Company’s pension plan due to former TS business employees requesting and receiving distributions from the Company’s pension plan during fiscal 2018 and the closing date adjustments discussed above. Refer to Note 9, “Pension plan,” for further information on the pension settlement losses.  
 As of December 30, 2017, the $181.4 million of goodwill related to the Electronic Components Americas core reporting unit (the “Americas”) primarily represented goodwill allocated from the acquisitions of Bell Micro, G2 and Round 2, all of which occurred prior to fiscal 2011. The allocation of goodwill to the Americas represented the expected synergies the Americas would realize from these historical acquisitions. Once goodwill has been assigned to a reporting unit, for accounting purposes, the goodwill is no longer directly associated with the underlying acquisitions that the goodwill originated from, but rather the reporting unit to which it has been allocated. In accordance with ASC 350, the Company has been monitoring the Americas each quarter for the potential need to perform an interim goodwill impairment test.  
 In assessing the Americas goodwill for impairment in the third quarter of fiscal 2018, the Company was required to make significant judgments related to the fair value of the Americas. The Company used a combination of an income approach, specifically a discounted cash flow methodology, and a market approach to estimate the fair value of the Americas. The discounted cash flow methodology includes market participant assumptions for, among other factors, forecasted sales, gross profit margins, operating expenses, cash flows, perpetual growth rates and long-term discount rates, all of which required judgments and estimates by management which are inherently uncertain. The market approach methodology required significant assumptions related to comparable transactions, market multiples, capital structure and control premiums.   
 As a result of the impairment testing and related fair value estimate of the Americas in the third quarter of fiscal 2018, the Company impaired all of the goodwill in the Americas and recorded $181.4 million of goodwill impairment expense, which is classified within goodwill impairment expense in the Consolidated Statements of Operations.   
 Bank credit facilities and other consists primarily of various committed and uncommitted lines of credit and other forms of bank debt with financial institutions utilized primarily to support the working capital requirements of the Company including its foreign operations.  
 The Company has an accounts receivable securitization program (the “Program”) in the United States with a group of financial institutions to allow the Company to transfer, on an ongoing revolving basis, an undivided interest in a designated pool of trade accounts receivable, to provide security or collateral for borrowings up to a maximum of $400 million. The Program does not qualify for off balance sheet accounting treatment and any borrowings under the Program are recorded as debt in the consolidated balance sheets. Under the Program, the Company legally sells and isolates certain U.S. trade accounts receivable, into a wholly owned and consolidated bankruptcy remote special purpose entity. Such receivables, which are recorded within “Receivables” in the consolidated balance sheets, totaled $774.8 million and $807.5 million at March 31, 2018, and July 1, 2017, respectively. The Program contains certain covenants relating to the quality of the receivables sold. The Program also requires the Company to maintain certain minimum interest coverage and leverage ratios, which the Company was in compliance with as of March 31, 2018, and July 1, 2017. The Program expires in August 2018 and as a result the Company has classified outstanding balances as short-term debt as of August 2017. Interest on borrowings is calculated using a base rate or a commercial paper rate plus a spread of 0.40% with a facility fee of 0.40%.  
 As of March 31, 2018, the carrying value and fair value of the Company’s total debt was $1.59 billion and $1.63 billion, respectively. At July 1, 2017, the carrying value and fair value of the Company’s total debt was $1.78 billion and $1.85 billion, respectively. Fair value for the public notes was estimated based upon quoted market prices and for other forms of debt fair value approximates carrying value due to the market based variable nature of the interest rates on those debt facilities.  
 Many of the Company’s subsidiaries purchase and sell products in currencies other than their functional currencies. This subjects the Company to the risks associated with fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. The Company reduces this risk by utilizing natural hedging (e.g., offsetting receivables and payables in the same foreign currency) as well as by creating offsetting positions through the use of derivative financial instruments, primarily forward foreign exchange contracts typically with maturities of less than 60 days (“economic hedges”), but no longer than one year. The Company continues to have exposure to foreign currency risks to the extent they are not economically hedged. The Company adjusts any economic hedges to fair value through the consolidated statements of operations primarily within “other income (expense), net.” The fair value of forward foreign exchange contracts, which are based upon Level 2 criteria under the ASC 820 fair value hierarchy, are classified in the captions “other current assets” or “accrued expenses and other,” as applicable, in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets as of March 31, 2018, and July 1, 2017. The Company’s master netting and other similar arrangements with various financial institutions related to derivative financial instruments allow for the right of offset. The Company’s policy is to present derivative financial instruments with the same counterparty as either a net asset or liability when the right of offset exists.

 Sales for the third quarter of fiscal 2018 were $4.80 billion, an increase of 8.0% from sales for the third quarter of fiscal 2017 of $4.44 billion. The increase in sales was due to the increased sales in PF and the EMEA and Asia regions of EC, offset by sales declines in the EC Americas region. Sales in constant currency increased year over year by 2.4% with both EC and PF contributing to the increase.   
 Avnet operating loss margin was (1.1)% in the third quarter of fiscal 2018 as compared with 2.6% of operating income margin in the third quarter of fiscal 2017. Both periods included amortization and restructuring, integration and other expenses. The third quarter of fiscal 2018 also includes goodwill impairment expense. Excluding these expenses from both periods, adjusted operating income margin was 3.7% in the third quarter of fiscal 2018 as compared to 3.9% in the third quarter of fiscal 2017.   
 Sales for the third quarter of fiscal 2018 were $4.80 billion, an increase of 8.0%, or $353.2 million, from the prior year third quarter sales of $4.44 billion. Excluding the translation impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates, sales increased 2.4% over the prior year third quarter with both operating groups contributing to this increase.  
 As of December 30, 2017, the $181.4 million in goodwill related to the Electronic Components Americas core reporting unit (the “Americas”) primarily represented goodwill allocated from the acquisitions of Bell Micro, G2 and Round 2, all of which occurred prior to fiscal 2011. The allocation of goodwill to the Americas represented the expected synergies the Americas would realize from these historical acquisitions. Once goodwill has been assigned to a reporting unit, for accounting purposes, the goodwill is no longer directly associated with the underlying acquisitions that the goodwill originated from, but rather the reporting unit to which it has been allocated.   
 As a result of the interim impairment testing and related fair value estimate of the Americas as of the third quarter of fiscal 2018, the Company impaired all of the goodwill in the Americas and recorded $181.4 million of goodwill impairment expense in the third quarter of fiscal 2018. See Note 4 “Goodwill and long-lived assets” to the Company’s consolidated financial statements included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.  
 Operating income for the first nine months of fiscal 2018 was $102.6 million, or 0.7% of consolidated sales, as compared with operating income of $368.0 million, or 2.9% in the first nine months of 2017 primarily driven by declines in EC partially offset by the acquisition of PF.   
 During the third quarter of fiscal 2018, the Company had $8.4 million of other income, net, as compared with $19.4 million of other income, net, in the third quarter of fiscal 2017.

In the third quarter and first nine months of fiscal 2018, the Company had foreign currency gains primarily due to the weakening of the U.S. Dollar. In the third quarter of fiscal 2017, the Company had other income due to unrealized gains on marketable securities obtained through the sale of TS. In the first nine months of fiscal 2017, the Company incurred additional financing and economic foreign currency hedging costs associated with the PF acquisition, partially offset by unrealized gains on marketable securities.   
 See Note 8 “Income taxes” to the Company’s consolidated financial statements included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for further information including discussion of the provisional transition tax expense estimate recorded under the requirements of the Act in the third quarter of fiscal 2018.  
 Loss from discontinued operations was $(4.5) million and $(14.4) million in the third quarter and the first nine months of fiscal 2018, respectively, primarily as a result of settlement losses associated with the Company’s pension plan due to former TS business employees requesting and receiving distributions from the Company’s pension plan during fiscal 2018. Refer to Note 9, “Pension Plan,” for further information on the pension settlement losses.  
 During the first nine months of fiscal 2018, the Company used $112.2 million for capital expenditures primarily related to information system development costs, computer hardware and software purchases and facilities costs compared to $108.0 million for capital expenditures in the first nine months of fiscal 2017.

 The Company seeks to reduce earnings and cash flow volatility associated with changes in foreign currency exchange rates by entering into financial arrangements that are intended to provide an economic hedge against all or a portion of the risks associated with such volatility. The Company continues to have exposure to such risks to the extent they are not economically hedged.

 As a result primarily of certain former manufacturing operations, Avnet has incurred and may have future liability under various federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations, including those governing pollution and exposure to, and the handling, storage and disposal of, hazardous substances. For example, under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act of 1980, as amended, and similar state laws, Avnet is and may be liable for the costs of cleaning up environmental contamination on or from certain of its current or former properties, and at off-site locations where the Company disposed of wastes in the past. Such laws may impose joint and several liability. Typically, however, the costs for clean up at such sites are allocated among potentially responsible parties based upon each party’s relative contribution to the contamination, and other factors.  
 Pursuant to SEC regulations, including but not limited to Item 103 of Regulation S-K, the Company regularly assesses the status of and developments in pending environmental and other compliance related legal proceedings to determine whether any such proceedings should be identified specifically in this discussion of legal proceedings, and has concluded that no particular pending legal proceeding requires public disclosure. Based on the information known to date, management believes that the Company has appropriately accrued in its consolidated financial statements for its share of the estimable costs of environmental and other compliance related matters.
