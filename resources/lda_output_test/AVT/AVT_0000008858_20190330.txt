 In the opinion of management, the accompanying unaudited interim consolidated financial statements contain all adjustments necessary to present fairly Avnet, Inc.’s and its consolidated subsidiaries’ (collectively, the “Company” or “Avnet”) financial position, results of operations, comprehensive income and cash flows. All such adjustments are of a normal recurring nature.  
 In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (the “FASB”) issued Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606) (“ASU 2014-09”, and collectively with its related subsequent amendments, “Topic 606”). Topic 606 supersedes previous revenue recognition guidance and requires the Company to recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the Company expects to be entitled in exchange for such goods or services. The Company adopted Topic 606 on July 1, 2018 using the modified retrospective transition method applied to those contracts which were not completed as of July 1, 2018. Under this transition method, the Company’s results in the consolidated statements of operations for the third quarter and nine months ended March 30, 2019 are presented under Topic 606, while the comparative results for the third quarter and nine months ended March 31, 2018 were not retrospectively adjusted, as such results were recognized in accordance with the revenue recognition policy discussed under Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in Note 1 of the Company’s Fiscal 2018 Annual Report on Form 10-K.  
 The adoption of Topic 606 did not have a material impact on the Company’s consolidated financial statements as of the adoption date and as of and for the nine months ended March 30, 2019. Substantially all of the Company’s sales continue to be recognized when products are shipped from the Company’s facilities or delivered to customers, depending on the underlying contractual terms. For a nominal portion of the Company’s contracts where the accounting did change, the adoption of Topic 606 resulted in an increase to the opening balance of retained earnings of $2.0 million as of July 1, 2018. This impact was primarily due to the acceleration of recognition of net sales and associated gross profit related to certain uncompleted contracts for the manufacture of goods with no alternative use and for which the Company has an enforceable right to payment, including a reasonable profit margin, from the customer for performance completed to date. For these contracts, the Company recognizes revenue over time as control of the goods transfers through the manufacturing process, rather than when the goods are delivered, title has transferred, and the risks and rewards of ownership are passed to the customer, as under previous revenue recognition guidance.  
 In March 2017, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2017-07, Compensation - Retirement Benefits (Topic 715)- Improving the Presentation of Net Periodic Cost and Net Periodic Postretirement Benefit Cost ("ASU No. 2017-07"). ASU No. 2017-07 requires that the service cost component of net periodic pension costs be included in the same line item as other compensation costs arising from services rendered by employees during the period, with the other components of the net periodic pension costs reported separately from the service cost component and below operating 
 In August 2017, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update 2017-12, Derivatives and Hedging (Topic 815) - Targeted Improvements to Accounting for Hedging Activities (“ASU 2017-12”), which improves the financial reporting of hedging relationships to better portray the economic results of an entity’s risk management activities in its financial statements and makes certain targeted improvements to simplify the qualification and application of hedge accounting compared to current GAAP. This update is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, with early adoption permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of the adoption of ASU 2017-12 on its consolidated financial statements.  
 Prior to the adoption of Topic 606, the Company’s revenue recognition policy was in accordance with ASC Topic 605, Revenue Recognition. Effective July 1, 2018, the Company adopted Topic 606 using the modified retrospective transition method, resulting in accounting policy changes surrounding revenue recognition which replace revenue recognition policies discussed in the Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in Note 1 of the Company’s Fiscal 2018 Annual Report on Form 10-K. The adoption of Topic 606 did not have a material impact on the Company’s consolidated financial statements.  
 Revenue is recognized at the point at which control of the underlying products are transferred to the customer, which includes determining whether products are distinct and separate performance obligations. For electronic component and related product sales, this generally occurs upon shipment of the products, however, this may occur at a later date depending on the agreed upon sales terms, such as delivery at the customer's designated location, or when products that are consigned at customer locations are consumed. In limited instances, where products are not in stock and delivery times are critical, product is purchased from the supplier and drop-shipped to the customer. The Company typically takes control of the products when shipped by the manufacturer and then recognizes revenue when control of the product transfers to the customer. The Company does not have material product warranty obligations as the assurance type product warranties provided by the component manufacturers are passed through to the Company’s customers.  
 For contracts related to the specialized manufacture of products for customers with no alternative use and for which the Company has an enforceable right to payment, including a reasonable profit margin, the Company recognizes revenue over time as control of the products transfer through the manufacturing process. The contract assets associated with such specialized manufacturing products are not material as these contracts represent less than 2% of the Company’s total sales.  
 Revenue is measured as the amount of consideration the Company expects to receive in exchange for transferring products. The Company estimates different forms of variable consideration at the time of sale based on historical experience, current conditions and contractual obligations. Revenue is recorded net of customer discounts and rebates. When the Company offers the right or has a history of accepting returns of product, historical experience is utilized to establish a liability for the estimate of expected returns and an asset for the right to recover the product expected to be returned. These adjustments are made in the same period as the underlying sales transactions.   
 At the end of December 2018, the Company acquired Softweb Solutions (“Softweb”) a privately held software and artificial intelligence company that delivers software solutions for Internet of Things (IoT) applications and systems designed to increase efficiency, speed time to market, and help businesses transform. The impact of this acquisition was not material to the Company’s consolidated balance sheets or statements of operations and as a result, the Company has not disclosed the preliminary allocation of purchase price or the pro-forma impact of the acquisition.  
 In February 2017, the Company completed the sale of its Technology Solutions business (“TS business”) to Tech Data Corporation (the “Buyer”). The TS business and the financial impacts of the divestiture are classified as discontinued operations in all periods presented. In August 2018, the Company executed a settlement agreement with the Buyer resulting in a final adjustment of $120.0 million and a final geographic allocation of the TS business sales price for tax reporting purposes. This incremental consideration received from the sale of the TS business as well as cash settlements from the resolution of indemnification claims and other cash reimbursements have been classified as cash flow from discontinued operations investing activities. Income tax payments related to the gain on sale of the TS business have been classified as cash flow from discontinued operations operating activities.  
 The Company evaluates each quarter if facts and circumstances indicate that it is more likely than not that the fair value of its reporting units is less than their carrying value, which would require the Company to perform an interim goodwill impairment test. Indicators the Company evaluates to determine whether an interim goodwill impairment test is necessary include, but are not limited to, (i) a sustained decrease in share price or market capitalization as of any fiscal quarter end, (ii) changes in the macroeconomic or industry environments, (iii) the results of and the amount of time passed since the last goodwill impairment test and (iv) the long-term expected financial performance of its reporting units. During the third quarter of fiscal 2019, the Company concluded that an interim goodwill impairment test was not required.  
 Bank credit facilities and other consists primarily of various committed and uncommitted lines of credit and other forms of bank debt with financial institutions utilized primarily to support the working capital requirements of the Company including its foreign operations.  
 The Company has an accounts receivable securitization program (the “Securitization Program”) in the United States with a group of financial institutions to allow the Company to transfer, on an ongoing revolving basis, an undivided interest in a designated pool of trade accounts receivable, to provide security or collateral for borrowings up to a maximum of $500 million. The Securitization Program does not qualify for off balance sheet accounting treatment and any borrowings under the Securitization Program are recorded as debt in the consolidated balance sheets. Under the Securitization Program, the Company legally sells and isolates certain U.S. trade accounts receivable into a wholly owned and consolidated bankruptcy remote special purpose entity. Such receivables, which are recorded within “Receivables” in the consolidated balance sheets, totaled $820.9 million and $790.5 million at March 30, 2019, and June 30, 2018, respectively. The Securitization Program contains certain covenants relating to the quality of the receivables sold. The Securitization Program also requires the Company to maintain certain minimum interest coverage and leverage ratios, which the Company was in compliance with as of March 30, 2019, and June 30, 2018. The Securitization Program expires in August 2020 and as a result the Company has classified outstanding balances as long-term debt as of March 30, 2019. Interest on borrowings is calculated using a one-month LIBOR rate plus a spread of 0.75%. The facility fee on the unused balance of the facility is up to 0.35%.  
 The Company has a five-year $1.25 billion senior unsecured revolving credit facility (the “Credit Facility”) with a syndicate of banks, consisting of revolving credit facilities and the issuance of up to $200.0 million of letters of credit and up to $300.0 million of loans in certain approved currencies, which expires in June 2023. Subject to certain conditions, the Credit Facility may be increased up to $1.50 billion. Under the Credit Facility, the Company may select from various interest rate options, currencies and maturities. The Credit Facility contains certain covenants including various limitations on debt incurrence, share repurchases, dividends, investments and capital expenditures. The Credit Facility also includes financial covenants requiring the Company to maintain minimum interest coverage and leverage ratios, which the Company was in compliance with as of March 30, 2019 and June 30, 2018. As of March 30, 2019 and June 30, 2018, there were $3.0 million and $2.0 million, respectively, in letters of credit issued under the Credit Facility.

 Management believes that providing this additional information is useful to readers to better assess and understand operating performance, especially when comparing results with prior periods or forecasting performance for future periods, primarily because management typically monitors the business both including and excluding these adjustments to GAAP results. Management also uses these non-GAAP measures to establish operational goals and, in many cases, for measuring performance for compensation purposes. However, any analysis of results on a non-GAAP basis should be used as a complement to, and in conjunction with, results presented in accordance with GAAP.

Excluding these expenses from both periods, adjusted operating income margin was 3.8% in the third quarter of fiscal 2019 as compared to 3.6% in the third quarter of fiscal 2018. The increase in operating income margin is primarily due to the reduction in operating expenses from the Company’s restructuring and integration efforts, partially offset by a decline in sales and gross profit margin.

 Each fiscal year, during the fiscal fourth quarter, the Company is required to perform an annual goodwill impairment test. The annual goodwill impairment testing typically includes consideration of the Company’s annual long-term planning as well as current market conditions when determining whether there is a goodwill impairment for any of the Company’s reporting units. The results of a quantitative annual goodwill impairment test may result in the impairment of goodwill at one or more of the Company’s reporting units even if a qualitative assessment concludes that goodwill is not impaired.  
 The Company recorded restructuring, integration and other expenses of $2.9 million during the third quarter of fiscal 2019. The Company recorded $13.4 million of restructuring costs in the third quarter of fiscal 2019, which are expected to provide approximately $12.0 million in annual operating expense savings once such restructuring actions are completed.

 As a result primarily of certain former manufacturing operations, the Company has incurred and may have future liability under various federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations, including those governing pollution and exposure to, and the handling, storage and disposal of, hazardous substances. For example, under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act of 1980, as amended, and similar state laws, the Company is and may be liable for the costs of cleaning up environmental contamination on or from certain of its current or former properties, and at off-site locations where the Company disposed of wastes in the past. Such laws may impose joint and several liability. Typically, however, the costs for clean up at such sites are allocated among potentially responsible parties based upon each party’s relative contribution to the contamination, and other factors.  
 Pursuant to SEC regulations, including but not limited to Item 103 of Regulation S-K, the Company regularly assesses the status of and developments in pending environmental and other compliance related legal proceedings to determine whether any such proceedings should be identified specifically in this discussion of legal proceedings, and has concluded that no particular pending legal proceeding requires public disclosure. Based on the information known to date, management believes that the Company has appropriately accrued in its consolidated financial statements for its share of the estimable costs of environmental and other compliance related matters.
