 In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (the “FASB”) issued Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606) (“ASU 2014-09”, and collectively with its related subsequent amendments, “Topic 606”). Topic 606 supersedes previous revenue recognition guidance and requires the Company to recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the Company expects to be entitled in exchange for such goods or services. The Company adopted Topic 606 on July 1, 2018 using the modified retrospective transition method applied to those contracts which were not completed as of July 1, 2018. Under this transition method, the Company’s results in the consolidated statements of operations for the three months ended September 29, 2018 are presented under Topic 606, while the comparative results for the three months ended September 30, 2017 were not retrospectively adjusted, as such results were recognized in accordance with the revenue recognition policy discussed under Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in Note 1 of the Company’s Fiscal 2018 Annual Report on Form 10-K.  
 The adoption of Topic 606 did not have a material impact on the Company’s consolidated financial statements as of the adoption date and as of and for the three months ended September 29, 2018. Substantially all of the Company’s sales continue to be recognized when products are shipped from the Company’s facilities or delivered to customers, depending on the respective contractual terms. For a nominal portion of the Company’s contracts where the accounting did change, the adoption of Topic 606 resulted in an increase to the opening balance of retained earnings of $2.0 million as of July 1, 2018. This impact was primarily due to the acceleration of recognition of net sales and associated gross profit related to certain uncompleted contracts for the manufacture of goods with no alternative use and for which the Company has an enforceable right to payment, including a reasonable profit margin, from the customer for performance completed to date. For these contracts, the Company now recognizes revenue over time as control of the goods transfers through the manufacturing process, rather than when the goods are delivered, and title, risk and reward of ownership are passed to the customer, as under previous revenue recognition guidance.  
 In March 2017, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2017-07, Compensation - Retirement Benefits (Topic 715)- Improving the Presentation of Net Periodic Cost and Net Periodic Postretirement Benefit Cost ("ASU No. 2017-07"). ASU No. 2017-07 requires that the service cost component of net periodic pension costs be included in the same line item as other compensation costs arising from services rendered by employees during the period, with the other components of the net periodic pension costs reported separately from the service cost component and below operating 
 In February 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2016-02, Leases (“ASU 2016-02”) and issued subsequent amendments to the initial guidance in September 2017 within ASU 2017-13 (collectively, Topic 842). Topic 842 requires companies to generally recognize operating and financing lease liabilities on the balance sheet and corresponding right-of-use assets created by those leases with lease terms of more than 12 months. The Company intends to adopt Topic 842 when it becomes effective in the first quarter of fiscal 2020 using a modified retrospective approach. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of its pending adoption of Topic 842 on its consolidated financial statements and expects that most of its operating lease commitments related to the Company’s real estate portfolio will be subject to the new standard and recognized as operating lease liabilities and right-of-use assets upon adoption, which will materially increase total assets and total liabilities relative to such amounts prior to adoption.  
 Prior to the adoption of Topic 606, the Company’s revenue recognition policy was in accordance with ASC Topic 605, Revenue Recognition. Effective July 1, 2018, the Company adopted Topic 606 using the modified retrospective transition method, resulting in accounting policy changes surrounding revenue recognition which replace revenue recognition policies discussed in the Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in Note 1 of the Company’s Fiscal 2018 Annual Report on Form 10-K. The adoption of Topic 606 did not have a material impact on the Company’s consolidated financial statements.  
 Revenue is recognized at the point at which control of the underlying products are transferred to the customer, which includes determining whether products are distinct and separate performance obligations. For electronic component and related product sales, this generally occurs upon shipment of the products, however, this may occur at a later date depending on the agreed upon sales terms, such as delivery at the customer's designated location, or when products that are consigned at customer locations are consumed. In limited instances, where products are not in stock and delivery times are critical, product is purchased from the supplier and drop-shipped to the customer. The Company typically takes control of the products when shipped by the manufacturer and then recognizes revenue when control of the product transfers to the customer. The Company does not have material product warranty obligations as the assurance type product warranties provided by the component manufacturers are passed through to the Company’s customers.  
 For contracts related to the specialized manufacture of products for customers with no alternative use and for which the Company has an enforceable right to payment, including a reasonable profit margin, the Company recognizes revenue over time as control of the products transfer through the manufacturing process. The contract assets associated with such specialized manufacturing products are not material as these contracts represent less than 2% of the Company’s total sales.  
  Sales and other tax amounts collected from customers for remittance to governmental authorities are excluded from revenue. The Company has elected to treat shipping and handling of product as a fulfillment activity. The practical expedient not to disclose information about remaining performance obligations has also been elected as these contacts have an original duration of one year or less. The Company does not have any payment terms that exceed one year from the point it has satisfied the related performance obligations.   
 In February 2017, the Company completed the sale of its Technology Solutions business (“TS business”) to Tech Data Corporation (the “Buyer”). The TS business and the financial impacts of the divestiture are classified as discontinued operations in all periods presented. In August 2018, the Company executed a settlement agreement with the Buyer resulting in a final adjustment of $120.0 million and a final geographic allocation of the TS business sales price for tax reporting purposes. The incremental consideration received from the sale of the TS business has been classified as cash flow from discontinued operations investing activities.  
 In connection with the sale of the TS business, the Company entered into a Transition Services Agreement (“TSA”), pursuant to which the Buyer will pay the Company to provide certain information technology, distribution, facilities, finance and human resources related services for various periods of time depending upon the services not to exceed approximately two years from the closing date. Expenses incurred by the Company to provide such services under the TSA are classified within selling, general and administrative expenses and amounts billed to the Buyer to provide such services are classified as a reduction of such expenses. In fiscal 2018, the Buyer formally terminated substantially all TSA services outside of certain minor information technology services and all remaining TSA services are expected to be terminated during the first half of fiscal 2019.  
 The Company evaluates each quarter if facts and circumstances indicate that it is more likely than not that the fair value of reporting units is less than its carrying value, which would require the Company to perform an interim goodwill impairment test. Indicators the Company evaluates to determine whether an interim goodwill impairment test is necessary include, but are not limited to (i) a sustained decrease in share price or market capitalization as of any fiscal quarter end, (ii) changes in the macroeconomic or industry environments, (iii) the results of and the amount of time passed since the last goodwill impairment test and (iv) the long-term expected financial performance of its reporting units. During the first quarter of fiscal 2019, the Company concluded that an interim goodwill impairment test was not required.  
 In August 2018, the Company amended and extended its accounts receivable securitization program (the “Securitization Program”) in the United States with a group of financial institutions to allow the Company to transfer, on an ongoing revolving basis, an undivided interest in a designated pool of trade accounts receivable, to provide security or collateral for borrowings up to a maximum of $500 million. The Securitization Program does not qualify for off balance sheet accounting treatment and any borrowings under the Securitization Program are recorded as debt in the consolidated balance sheets. Under the Securitization Program, the Company legally sells and isolates certain U.S. trade accounts receivable, into a wholly owned and consolidated bankruptcy remote special purpose entity. Such receivables, which are recorded within “Receivables” in the consolidated balance sheets, totaled $767.7 million and $790.5 million at September 29, 2018, and June 30, 2018, respectively. The Securitization Program contains certain covenants relating to the quality of the receivables sold. The Securitization Program also requires the Company to maintain certain minimum interest coverage and leverage ratios, which the Company was in compliance with as of September 29, 2018, and June 30, 2018. The Securitization Program expires in August 2020 and as a result the Company has classified outstanding balances as long-term debt as of September 29, 2018. Interest on borrowings is calculated using a one-month LIBOR rate plus a spread of 0.75%. The facility fee on the unused balance of the facility is up to 0.35%.  
 The Company has a five-year $1.25 billion senior unsecured revolving credit facility (the “Credit Facility”) with a syndicate of banks, consisting of revolving credit facilities and the issuance of up to $200.0 million of letters of credit and up to $300.0 million of loans in certain approved currencies, which expires in June 2023. Subject to certain conditions, the Credit Facility may be increased up to $1.50 billion. Under the Credit Facility, the Company may select from various interest rate options, currencies and maturities. The Credit Facility contains certain covenants including various limitations on debt incurrence, share repurchases, dividends, investments and capital expenditures. The Credit Facility also includes financial covenants requiring the Company to maintain minimum interest coverage and leverage ratios, which the Company was in compliance with as of September 29, 2018, and June 30, 2018. As of September 29, 2018, and June 30, 2018, there were $3.0 million and $2.0 million, respectively, in letters of credit issued under the Credit Facility.  
 As of September 29, 2018, the carrying value and fair value of the Company’s total debt was $1.57 billion and $1.59 billion, respectively. At June 30, 2018, the carrying value and fair value of the Company’s total debt was $1.65 billion and $1.67 billion, respectively. Fair value for the public notes was estimated based upon quoted market prices and for other forms of debt fair value approximates carrying value due to the market based variable nature of the interest rates on those debt facilities.  
 Many of the Company’s subsidiaries purchase and sell products in currencies other than their functional currencies. This subjects the Company to the risks associated with fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. The Company reduces this risk by utilizing natural hedging (e.g., offsetting receivables and payables in the same foreign currency) as well as by creating offsetting positions through the use of derivative financial instruments, primarily forward foreign exchange contracts typically with maturities of less than 60 days (“economic hedges”), but no longer than one year. The Company continues to have exposure to foreign currency risks to the extent they are not economically hedged. The Company adjusts any economic hedges to fair value through the consolidated statements of operations primarily within “other income (expense), net.” The fair value of forward foreign exchange contracts, which are based upon Level 2 criteria under the ASC 820 fair value hierarchy, are classified in the captions “Prepaid and other current assets” or “Accrued expenses and other,” as applicable, in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets as of September 29, 2018, and June 30, 2018. The Company’s master netting and other similar arrangements with various financial institutions related to derivative financial instruments allow for the right of offset. The Company’s policy is to present derivative financial instruments with the same counterparty as either a net asset or liability when the right of offset exists.  
 As of September 29, 2018 and June 30, 2018, the Company had aggregate estimated liabilities of $14.7 million and $14.2 million, respectively, classified within accrued expenses and other for such compliance-related matters that were reasonably estimable as of such dates.

 EC sales of $4.71 billion in the first quarter of fiscal 2019 increased $403.6 million or 9.4% from the prior year first quarter sales of $4.31 billion. This increase was primarily driven by increased sales in the Asia and Americas regions. PF sales for the first quarter of fiscal 2019 were $379.1 million, an increase of $25.4 million or 7.2% from the prior year first quarter sales of $353.7 million driven by growth in all three regions.   
 Gross profit for the first quarter of fiscal 2019 was $636.8 million, an increase of $24.2 million, or 3.9%, from the first quarter of fiscal 2018 gross profit of $612.6 million primarily driven by the increase in sales. Gross profit margin decreased 63 basis points to 12.5% from the first quarter of fiscal 2018 gross profit margin of 13.1%, with both operating groups contributing to the decrease.  
 Operating income for the first quarter of fiscal 2019 was $146.8 million, an increase of $82.2 million, or 127.4%, from the first quarter of fiscal 2018 of $64.6 million. The year over year increase in operating income was primarily driven by the reduction in selling, general and administrative expenses and lower restructuring, integration and other expenses as compared to the prior year first quarter. Adjusted operating income for the first quarter of fiscal 2019 was $182.5 million, an increase of $46.0 million, or 33.7%, from the first quarter of fiscal 2018.  
 Interest and other financing expenses in the first quarter of fiscal 2019 was $30.1 million, an increase of $8.1 million or 36.7%, as compared with interest and other financing expenses of $22.0 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2018. The increase in interest and other financing expenses in the first quarter of fiscal 2019 compared to the first quarter of fiscal 2018 was primarily related to increased expenses in Asia to finance working capital needs and from lower interest income from investments in cash equivalents between the fiscal years.  
 During the first quarter of fiscal 2019, the Company had $1.9 million of other expense, net, as compared with $18.9 million of other income, net, in the first quarter of fiscal 2018. In the first quarter of fiscal 2019, the Company had foreign currency losses primarily due to the strengthening of the U.S. Dollar compared to certain currencies, partially offset by income related to the Company’s pension plans. In the first quarter of fiscal 2018, the Company had foreign currency gains primarily due to the strengthening of the Euro compared to the U.S. Dollar and British Pound and other income related to the Company’s pension plans.   
 The Company’s effective tax rate on its income before income taxes from continuing operations was 27.3% in the first quarter of fiscal 2019 as compared with 5.4% in the first quarter of fiscal 2018. During the first quarter of fiscal 2019, the Company’s effective tax rate was unfavorably impacted primarily by (i) an adjustment to the provisional transition tax expense estimate recorded under the requirements of the Act and (ii) increases in unrecognized tax benefits, partially offset by (iii) an adjustment to the provisional deferred tax impacts of the Act and (iv) the mix of income in lower tax jurisdictions. During the first quarter of fiscal 2018, the Company’s effective tax rate was favorably impacted primarily by (i) the mix of income in lower tax jurisdictions and (ii) the release of unrecognized tax benefit reserves primarily due to the negotiation of a favorable outcome in a foreign jurisdiction.  
 During the first quarter of fiscal 2019, the Company used $41.0 million for capital expenditures primarily related to warehouse and facilities, computer hardware and software purchases and information system development costs compared to $26.7 million for capital expenditures in the first quarter of fiscal 2018. During the first quarter of fiscal 2018, the Company used $14.7 million of cash for acquisitions, which is net of the cash acquired.   
 For a detailed description of the Company’s long-term debt and lease commitments for the next five years and thereafter, see Long-Term Contractual Obligations appearing in Item 7 of the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2018. With the exception of the Company’s debt transactions discussed herein, there are no material changes to this information outside of normal borrowings and repayments of long-term debt and operating lease payments. The Company does not currently have any material non-cancellable commitments for capital expenditures or inventory purchases.  
 As of the end of the first quarter of fiscal 2019, the Company had a combined total borrowing capacity of $1.75 billion under the Credit Facility and the Securitization Program. There were no borrowings outstanding and $3.0 million in letters of credit issued under the Credit Facility and $65.0 million in borrowings outstanding under the Securitization Program, resulting in approximately $1.68 billion of total availability as of September 29, 2018. Availability under the Securitization Program is subject to the Company having sufficient eligible trade accounts receivable to support desired borrowings. The Company currently expects to utilize availability under credit facilities to support working capital and other general corporate purposes to the extent such incremental borrowings do not impact the Company’s investment grade credit rating. During the first quarter of fiscal 2019, the Company had an average daily balance outstanding of approximately $65.0 million under the Securitization Program. During the first quarter of fiscal 2018, the Company had an average daily balance outstanding of approximately $10.3 million under the Credit Facility and approximately $166.0 million under the Securitization Program.

 As a result primarily of certain former manufacturing operations, Avnet has incurred and may have future liability under various federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations, including those governing pollution and exposure to, and the handling, storage and disposal of, hazardous substances. For example, under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act of 1980, as amended, and similar state laws, Avnet is and may be liable for the costs of cleaning up environmental contamination on or from certain of its current or former properties, and at off-site locations where the Company disposed of wastes in the past. Such laws may impose joint and several liability. Typically, however, the costs for clean up at such sites are allocated among potentially responsible parties based upon each party’s relative contribution to the contamination, and other factors.  
 Pursuant to SEC regulations, including but not limited to Item 103 of Regulation S-K, the Company regularly assesses the status of and developments in pending environmental and other compliance related legal proceedings to determine whether any such proceedings should be identified specifically in this discussion of legal proceedings, and has concluded that no particular pending legal proceeding requires public disclosure. Based on the information known to date, management believes that the Company has appropriately accrued in its consolidated financial statements for its share of the estimable costs of environmental and other compliance related matters.  
 The Company’s Board of Directors has approved the repurchase of up to $2.45 billion of the Company’s common stock under the Company’s share repurchase program including an increase in August 2018 of $500.0 million.
