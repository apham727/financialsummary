These condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared by QUALCOMM Incorporated (collectively with its subsidiaries, the Company or Qualcomm) in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (GAAP) for interim financial information and the instructions to Rule 10-01 of Regulation S-X.
These condensed consolidated financial statements are unaudited and should be read in conjunction with the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended September 24, 2017.
Operating results for interim periods are not necessarily indicative of operating results for an entire fiscal year.
At December 24, 2017, the Company had 28.8 million restricted stock units outstanding and 9.1 million stock options outstanding.
The Company currently expects the adoption of this new guidance to most significantly impact its licensing business.
Specifically, the Company expects a change in the timing of revenues recognized from sales-based royalties.
The Company currently recognizes sales-based royalties as revenues in the period in which such royalties are reported by licensees, which is after the conclusion of the quarter in which the licensees’ sales occur and when all other revenue recognition criteria are met.
The new guidance also modifies the impairment models for available-for-sale debt securities and for purchased financial assets with credit deterioration since their origination.
The Company is in the process of determining the effects the adoption will have on its consolidated financial statements as well as whether to adopt the new guidance early.This information should be read in conjunction with the condensed consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto included in “Part I, Item 1” of this Quarterly Report and with “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” for the year ended September 24, 2017 contained in our 2017 Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Although forward-looking statements in this Quarterly Report reflect our good faith judgment, such statements can only be based on facts and factors currently known by us.
•We continue to invest significant resources toward advancements primarily in support of 4G- and 5G-based technologies as well as other technologies to extend the demand for our products and generate new or expanded licensing opportunities, including within adjacent industry segments outside traditional cellular industries, such as automotive, the Internet of Things (IoT) and networking.
Substantially all of our products and services businesses, including QCT, and substantially all of our engineering, research and development functions, are operated by Qualcomm Technologies, Inc. (QTI), a wholly-owned subsidiary of QUALCOMM Incorporated, and QTI’s subsidiaries.
Neither QTI nor any of its subsidiaries has any right, power or authority to grant any licenses or other rights under or to any patents owned by QUALCOMM Incorporated.
Other expenses in the first quarter of fiscal 2017 consisted of a $868 million charge related to the Korea Fair Trade Commission (KFTC) fine and $8 million in restructuring and restructuring-related charges related to our Strategic Realignment Plan.
As a result, we recognized net realized gains and impairment losses on such marketable securities that we sold and expected to sell before their anticipated recovery, respectively, in fiscal 2017.
Tax benefits from foreign income taxed at rates lower than rates in the U.S. are expected to be approximately 20% in fiscal 2018, compared to 32% in fiscal 2017, primarily due to the lower U.S federal statutory income tax rate enacted by the Tax Legislation, partially offset by lower estimated U.S. revenues primarily related to decreased royalty revenues from Apple’s contract manufacturers.
The effective tax rate for the first quarter of fiscal 2018 was higher than the estimated annual effective tax rate primarily resulting from the estimated charge of $6.0 billion recorded to income tax expense in the first quarter of fiscal 2018 related to the effects of certain components of the Tax Legislation, as well as the $1.2 billion fine related to the EC investigation.
We believe that it is reasonably possible that the total amounts of unrecognized tax benefits at December 24, 2017 may increase or decrease in the next 12 months.
