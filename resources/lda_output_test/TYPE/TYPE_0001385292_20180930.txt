These unaudited condensed consolidated interim financial statements should be read in conjunction with the Companys audited consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2017, as reported in the Companys Annual Report on Form 10-K. The Companys significant accounting policies and practices are as described in the Annual Report, except for the adoption of the accounting standards described in Note 3 below.  
At September 30, 2018, our wholly-owned Olapic Argentina S.A. subsidiary employs approximately 99 people whose functions mainly include development, sales support and administration. The monthly operations average between $0.4 million and $0.5 million. The Argentinian economy was recently determined to be highly inflationary. A highly inflationary economy is one where the cumulative inflation rate for the three years preceding the beginning of the reporting period, including interim reporting periods, is in excess of 100 percent. Argentinas inflation rate reached this threshold with the quarterly period ended June 30, 2018. For interim periods ended prior to July 1, 2018, the functional currency for our subsidiary is the Argentinian peso, the foreign entitys local currency.  
For a highly inflationary economy, we followed the guidance in ASC Topic 830, Foreign Currency Matters, (Subtopic ASC 830-10-45) and accounted for the change in functional currency from the Argentinian peso to the U.S. dollar effective July 1, 2018. Under this guidance, translation adjustments are not removed from equity, and the translated amounts for nonmonetary assets and liabilities at the end of the prior period become the accounting basis for those assets both in the period of the change and in subsequent periods. A change in functional currency due to an economys designation as highly inflationary results from changes in economic factors (i.e., inflation); therefore, such a change is not considered a change in accounting policy or accounting principle. The change in functional currency did not have a material impact on financial position, operating results or cash flow.  
Under legacy GAAP, revenue related to our term licenses that were bundled with service-related performance obligations when vendor-specific objective evidence (VSOE) did not exist was required to be recognized ratably over the term of the agreement. Under ASC 606, the Company allocates revenue to each performance obligation in the contract and each performance obligation is accounted for separately; the license revenue is recognized at the time of delivery and the service revenue is recognized over time based on their relative standalone selling prices. The application of this provision is particularly impactful to our new Mosaic product offering which was launched in the first quarter of 2018. This new offering bundles our traditional font licenses with a SaaS based portal, which under legacy GAAP would have been recognized ratably. This provision also has resulted in some revenue from contracts signed prior to 2018 being accelerated and recorded to retained earnings instead of in our operating results in 2018 and beyond.  
ASC 606 requires certain incremental costs related to contract acquisition, such as sales commissions, and contract fulfillment costs to be capitalized and amortized over the expected period of benefit whereas the Company had previously recognized such expenses as incurred.  
In March 2017, the FASB issued ASU No. 2017-07, Compensation-Retirement Benefits (Topic 715)-Improving the Presentation of Net Periodic Pension Cost and Net Periodic Postretirement Benefit Cost. This guidance revises the presentation of the net periodic benefit cost in the income statement. The new standard is effective for annual and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2017. We adopted ASU 2017-07 on January 1, 2018 and there was no material impact on our consolidated financial statements.  
The Company will adopt this ASU on January 1, 2019 and has begun planning for adoption by implementing new lease accounting software, and by working to establish additional changes to our processes and internal controls to ensure all requirements are met upon adoption. The standard allows for a modified retrospective approach or a modified retrospective approach with comparatives under 840 option, where entities would recognize a cumulative effect to retained earnings at the date of adoption without restating prior periods balances or disclosures. The Company plans to use the modified retrospective approach with comparatives under 840 option that will not require revising comparative period information or disclosure. We will elect the package of practical expedients permitted under the transition guidance within the new standard, which among other things, allows us to carryforward the historical lease classification. In addition, we are electing the hindsight practical expedient to determine the lease term for existing leases. We will also elect the practical expedient that allows an accounting policy election to exclude right of use assets and lease obligations from the balance sheet for all leases with an initial term of 12 months or less.  
We adopted ASC 606 on January 1, 2018 using the modified retrospective method for all contracts not completed as of the date of adoption. The reported results for 2018 reflect the application of ASC 606 guidance while the reported results for 2017 were prepared under legacy GAAP. The adoption of ASC 606 represents a change in accounting principle that will more closely align revenue recognition with the delivery of our products and services and will provide financial statement readers with enhanced disclosures.  
 accepted by the customer. In limited cases, the Company has an enforceable right to payment prior to final delivery and acceptance of custom font design work. In these cases, the Company has determined that the proper treatment is a single over-time performance obligation using input methods (incurred hours towards completion) to measure progress towards completion to determine the pattern of satisfaction of the performance obligation.  
For our hosted offerings where we provide our customers the right to access our software without taking possession, revenue is recognized over the contract period on a time-elapsed basis, which is consistent with the transfer of service to the customer. Payment terms and conditions for Creative Professional contracts generally require payment within thirty to sixty days of contract inception. An exception exists for certain contracts for our SaaS offerings or a limited number of multi-year term license agreements which have periodic payment terms, generally quarterly or annually, over the term of the contract. In instances where the timing of revenue recognition differs from the respective payment terms, we have considered whether such contracts include a significant financing component, subject to the applicable practical expedient. The purpose of these payment structures is to align with industry and market standards, not to provide customers with financing. We have determined our contracts generally do not include a significant financing component; however, the Company will continue to assess (1) the length of time between when the goods or services are delivered and expected payment, and (2) prevailing interest rates in the market to re-evaluate this conclusion.

We derive a significant portion of our OEM revenue from a limited number of customers, in particular manufacturers of laser printers and consumer electronic devices. For the three months ended September 30, 2018 and 2017, our top ten licensees by revenue, most of which are OEM customers, accounted for approximately 26.9% and 27.5% of our total revenue, respectively. For the nine months ended September 30, 2018 and 2017, our top ten licensees by revenue accounted for approximately 23.6% and 28.4% of our total revenue, respectively. Although no one customer accounted for more than 10% of our total revenue for the three months or nine months ended September 30, 2018 or 2017, if we are unable to maintain relationships with major customers or establish relationships with new customers, our licensing revenue will be adversely affected.  
Gross profit from license revenue, before amortization of acquired technology, decreased to 84.8% from 86.4%, period over period. Gross profit from service revenue, before amortization of acquired technology, increased to 79.8% and 72.3%. See further discussion below for additional information regarding our period over period revenue and cost of revenue.  
OEM revenue decreased $4.1 million, or 16.0%, to $21.9 million in the three months ended September 30, 2018, as compared to $26.0 million in the three months ended September 30, 2017. Revenue from our printer imaging OEM customers decreased period over period partially due to lower revenue from customers under fixed fee contracts and partially due to $2.0 million of one-time payments recognized in the third quarter of 2017 from the conversion of customers to fixed fee contracts from royalty bearing contracts. There was no corresponding item in the current period. Display imaging revenue decreased mainly due to a few large deals in the third quarter of 2017 that did not repeat in the third quarter of 2018.  
Cost of revenue, excluding amortization of acquired technology, was $9.4 million and $9.7 million for the three months ended September 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively, a decrease of $0.3 million, or 3.3%, mainly due to lower total revenue.  
Research and Development. Research and development expense was $7.7 million and $9.0 million in the three months ended September 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively, a decrease of $1.3 million, or 14.6%, primarily due to lower personnel expenses. Personnel and personnel related expenses decreased $1.2 million, period over period, due to lower headcount mainly from restructuring actions in the second quarter of 2018 and in the fourth quarter of 2017.  
Restructuring. Restructuring expense was $0.2 million in the three months ended September 30, 2018 due to additional severance expense and charges associated with the closure of one of our regional offices. There were no similar charges in the same period in 2017.  
Interest expense, net of interest income was $0.8 million and $0.7 million in the three months ended September 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively, an increase of $0.1 million, or 18.2%, mainly due to increases in interest rates on our outstanding borrowings, partially offset by a reduction in the balance outstanding.  
Losses on foreign exchange were $0.4 million and $1.4 million in the three months ended September 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively, a decrease of $1.0 million, primarily the result of currency fluctuations on our foreign denominated receivables and payables. In the three months ended September 30, 2017, the loss was primarily due to the strengthening of the Euro, as compared to the U.S. dollar, on U.S. dollar denominated receivables held by our foreign subsidiaries.  
In addition, the effective rate for the three months ended September 30, 2018 was reduced by 4.2% for a reduction in reserves resulting from the expiration of statutes of limitations. State and local taxes, net of federal benefit, provided a benefit of 4.3% in the three months ended September 30, 2017, as compared to 0.0% for the three months ended September 30, 2018, mainly due to adjustments to our deferred state tax balances, which resulted from changes in our estimated state tax rate.  
License revenue decreased primarily due to certain one-time printer revenue recognized in the nine months ended September 30, 2017, as a result of conversion of customers to fixed fee contracts from royalty bearing contracts, partially offset by growth in sales to our enterprise customers. There was no corresponding item in the current period. In addition, our royalty based revenue is lower in the nine months ended September 30, 2018, a result of the adoption of ASC 606. We now estimate and accrue our royalty-based revenue in the quarter when the royalty-based units are shipped, as opposed to when those shipments were reported to us by the licensee under legacy GAAP. This change had the effect of shifting traditional holiday seasonality revenue for consumer electronics from the first quarter of 2018 to the fourth quarter of 2017.  
Gross profit from license revenue, before amortization of acquired technology, decreased to 82.9% from 85.3%, primarily due to additional non-recurring royalty expense in the nine months ended September 30, 2018 for which there was no corresponding revenue in the corresponding period in 2017, in accordance with ASC 606. Gross profit from service revenue, before amortization of acquired technology, increased to 77.6% from 73.4%. See further discussion below for additional information regarding our period over period revenue and cost of revenue.  
OEM revenue decreased $12.7 million, or 16.3%, to $65.8 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2018, as compared to $78.5 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2017. Revenue from our printer imaging OEM customers decreased period over period partially due to $6.1 million of one-time payments recognized in the nine months ended September 30, 2017 from the conversion of customers to fixed fee contracts from royalty bearing contracts. There was no corresponding item in the current period. Additionally, we recorded lower royalty based revenue as a result of the adoption of ASC 606. We now estimate and accrue royalty-based revenue in the quarter when the royalty-based units are shipped, as opposed to when those shipments were reported to us by the licensee under legacy GAAP. This change had the effect of shifting traditional holiday seasonality revenue for consumer electronics from the first quarter of 2018 to the fourth quarter of 2017.
