We derive a significant portion of OEM revenue from a limited number of customers, in particular manufacturers of laser printers and consumer electronic devices. For the three months ended June 30, 2019 and 2018, our top ten licensees by revenue, most of which are OEM customers, accounted for approximately 34.9% and 23.8% of total revenue, respectively. One customer accounted for 14.9% of total revenue for the three months ended June 30, 2019. No one customer accounted for more than 10% of total revenue for the three months ended June 30, 2018. For the six months ended June 30, 2019 and 2018, our top ten licensees by revenue accounted for approximately 28.6% and 22.2% of total revenue, respectively. No one customer accounted for more than 10% of revenue for the six months ended June 30, 2019 or 2018. If we are unable to maintain relationships with major customers or establish relationships with new customers, our licensing revenue will be adversely affected.  
License revenue increased primarily due to a large multi-year agreement with one of our display imaging customers signed in the second quarter of 2019. This was partially offset by a decline in printer revenue. Service revenue decreased in the three months ended June 30, 2019, as compared to the same period in 2018, mainly due to increased customer churn in the last half of 2018. Gross profit from license revenue, before amortization of acquired technology, was consistent at 84.8% and 84.9% in the three months ended June 30, 2019 and 2018, respectively. Gross profit from service revenue, before amortization of acquired technology, decreased to 69.7% in the second quarter of 2019, as compared to 78.8% in the same period in 2018. See further discussion below for additional information regarding our period over period revenue and cost of revenue.  
While revenue from services has grown to a level of significance requiring separate disclosure, we continue to operate our business based on our two principal markets, Creative Professional and OEM, which is the basis for the following discussion of operating results.  
Marketing and Selling. Marketing and selling expense was $18.6 million and $20.1 million in the three months ended June 30, 2019 and 2018, respectively, a decrease of $1.5 million, or 7.5%. Personnel and personnel related expenses decreased $1.5 million, period over period, mainly due to our restructuring actions in the second and fourth quarters of 2018. Targeted marketing spending decreased in the second quarter of 2019, as compared to the same period in 2018, due to portfolio decisions around discretionary programs, which was offset by higher rent expense stemming from headcount changes, period over period. 
Research and Development. Research and development expense decreased $1.7 million, or 20.0%, to $6.8 million in the three months ended June 30, 2019, as compared to $8.5 million in the three months ended June 30, 2018, mainly due to lower personnel expenses. Personnel and personnel related expenses decreased primarily due to lower headcount from restructuring actions in the second and fourth quarters of 2018. 
Restructuring. Restructuring expense decreased $6.3 million, or 99.5%, to $32 thousand in the three months ended June 30, 2019, as compared to $6.4 million in the three months ended June 30, 2018, a result of the restructuring action announced June 2018. See Note 14 for further details. 
Amortization of Other Intangible Assets. Amortization of other intangible assets was $0.8 million and $1.0 million for the three months ended June 30, 2019 and 2018, respectively, a decrease of $0.2 million, or 14.1%, mainly due to the write off intangible assets associated with the Swyft business in the second quarter of 2018. 
Interest expense, net of interest income was $0.7 million and $0.8 million for the three months ended June 30, 2019 and 2018, respectively, a decrease of $0.1 million, or 12.6%, mainly due to a reduction in the balance outstanding under our revolving line of credit and partially due to a decrease in interest rates.  
Other was an expense of $0.2 million and income of $0.6 million for the three months ended June 30, 2019 and 2018, respectively, a decrease of $0.8 million, or 137.8%, mainly due to currency fluctuations on our foreign denominated receivables and payables.  
The Company has reflected a reduction in its valuation allowance for foreign tax credits, resulting in a benefit of 10.2%, related to the amount of foreign tax credit carryforwards that the Company is estimating that it will be able to utilize based on 2019 taxable income. In the same period in 2018, there was no change to the valuation allowance.
