In managements opinion, these unaudited condensed consolidated interim financial statements contain all adjustments of a normal recurring nature necessary for a fair presentation of the financial statements for the interim periods presented.
These unaudited condensed consolidated interim financial statements should be read in conjunction with the Companys audited consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2017, as reported in the Companys Annual Report on Form 10-K.
The Companys significant accounting policies and practices are as described in the Annual Report, except for the adoption of the accounting standards described in Note 3 below.
We classify cloud-based subscriptions and other services, such as font related services, custom font design and post contract support as service revenue on our condensed consolidated statements of operations.
In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board, or FASB, and the International Accounting Standards Board jointly issued ASU 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606) (ASC 606), which outlines a comprehensive five-step revenue recognition model based on a principle that replaces virtually all existing revenue recognition rules under U.S. GAAP and which requires revenue to be recognized in a manner to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to a customer at an amount that reflects the consideration expected to be received in exchange for those goods or services.
ASU 2014-09 also provided the guidance in ASC Topic 340, Other Assets and Deferred CostsContracts with Customers (Subtopic 340-40), which includes criteria for the capitalization and amortization of certain contract acquisition and fulfillment costs.
 application; however, it allows entities to choose either full retrospective adoption, in which the standard is applied to all of the periods presented, or modified retrospective adoption, in which the cumulative catch-up adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings is recognized at the date of application, with additional disclosures required to describe these effects.
We adopted the standard on January 1, 2018, and applied the modified retrospective method of adoption and have elected to apply the new standard only to contracts not completed at January 1, 2018, which represents contracts for which all (or substantially all) of the revenues have not been recognized under existing guidance as of the date of adoption.
Thus, revenue from royalties reported to us in the first quarter of 2018 were recorded to retained earnings upon adoption of ASC 606, rather than being recognized as revenue as it would have been under legacy GAAP.
The adoption of ASC 606 represents a change in accounting principle that will more closely align revenue recognition with the delivery of our products and services and will provide financial statement readers with enhanced disclosures.

For the three months ended June 30, 2018 and 2017, our top ten licensees by revenue, most of which are OEM customers, accounted for approximately 23.8% and 29.3% of total revenue, respectively.
License revenue increased primarily due to the growth in sales to enterprise customers, including the launch of our Mosaic product offering.
This growth was partially offset by decreases due to certain one-time printer revenue recognized in the second quarter of 2017, as a result of conversion of customers to fixed fee contracts from royalty bearing contracts.
Creative Professional revenue increased $7.8 million, or 25.4%, to $38.4 million for the three months ended June 30, 2018, as compared to $30.6 million for the three months ended June 30, 2017, mainly due to growth in sales to enterprise customers, including our new Mosaic solution, and increased service revenue as SaaS offerings continue to become a larger part of our portfolio.
OEM revenue decreased $4.9 million, or 18.0%, to $22.3 million for the three months ended June 30, 2018, from $27.2 million for the three months ended June 30, 2017.
Revenue from our printer imaging OEM customers decreased period over period partially due to lower revenue from customers under fixed fee contracts and partially due to $2.4 million of one-time payments recognized in the second quarter of 2017 from the conversion of customers to fixed fee contracts from royalty bearing contracts.
