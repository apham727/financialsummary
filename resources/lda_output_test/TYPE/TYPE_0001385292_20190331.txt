We have elected to present the analysis of changes in stockholders equity quarterly in statement form for the current and comparative year to date interim periods and state the amount of dividends per share in the aggregate for each class of shares in accordance with the provisions in Regulation S-X, Rule 8-03(a)(5) and 10-01(a)(7).  
We adopted ASU 2016-02 on January 1, 2019. We elected the package of practical expedients permitted under the transition guidance within the new standard, which among other things allows us to carryforward the historical lease classification. We also elected the practical expedient that allows an accounting policy election to exclude right of use assets and lease obligations from the balance sheet for all leases with an initial term of 12 months or less.  
As permitted in the standard, the Company is using a modified retrospective approach, where current periods are shown under the new standard, while comparative periods are shown under Accounting Standard Codification No. 840, Leases (prior to the adoption of ASU 2016-02), where entities recognize a cumulative effect to retained earnings at the date of adoption without restating prior periods balances or disclosures.  
Our Creative Professional revenue is primarily derived from rights to use font licenses, custom font design services, our web font and digital ad related services (which includes our web font services and web design tools), and hosted software as a service, or SaaS, offerings. We license fonts directly to end-users through our direct sales organization, e-commerce websites and indirectly through third-party resellers. Our customers include graphic designers, advertising agencies, media organizations and corporations.  
Revenue from font licenses is recognized upfront when the font software is delivered or made available to the customer. Custom font design services are generally not a separate distinct performance obligation and are sold with a license for the custom font, in which case revenue is recognized upon completion of the services and when the font is delivered and accepted by the customer. In limited cases, the Company has an enforceable right to payment prior to final delivery and acceptance of custom font design work. In these cases, the Company has determined that the proper treatment is a single over-time performance obligation using input methods (incurred hours towards completion) to measure progress towards completion to determine the pattern of satisfaction of the performance obligation.  
Our contracts with customers often include promises to transfer multiple products and services to a customer. Determining whether products and services are considered distinct performance obligations that should be accounted for separately versus together may require significant judgment. Once we determine the performance obligations, the Company determines the transaction price, which includes estimating the amount of variable consideration to be included in the transaction price, if any. We then allocate the transaction price to each performance obligation in the contract based on a relative stand-alone selling price method. The corresponding revenue is recognized as the related performance obligations are satisfied as discussed in the revenue categories above.  
Judgment is required to determine the standalone selling price for each distinct performance obligation. We determine standalone selling price based on the price at which the performance obligation is sold separately. If the standalone selling price is not observable through past transactions, we estimate the standalone selling price taking into account available information such as market conditions and internally approved pricing guidelines related to the performance obligations.  
As discussed above, certain of our Creative Professional contracts have payment terms that differ from the timing of revenue recognition which requires us to assess whether the transaction price for those contracts include a significant financing component. We have elected the practical expedient which permits an entity to not adjust for the effects of a significant financing component if we expect that at the contract inception, the period between when the entity transfers a promised good or service to a customer and when the customer pays for that good or service will be one year or less. For those contracts in which the period exceeds the one year threshold, this assessment, as well as the quantitative estimate of the financing component and its relative significance, requires judgment. We estimate the significant financing component provided to our customers with extended payment terms by determining the present value of the future payments by applying a discount rate that reflects the customers creditworthiness.  
Timing of revenue recognition may differ from the timing of invoicing to customers. We record an unbilled receivable, or contract asset, when revenue is recognized prior to invoicing when we have an enforceable right to payment. When invoicing occurs prior to revenue recognition, we have unearned revenue, or contract liabilities, presented on our condensed consolidated balance sheet as deferred revenue within deferred revenue and other long-term liabilities, as appropriate at March 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018. When invoicing occurs after revenue recognition, we have earned revenue, or contract assets, presented on our condensed consolidated balance sheet as unbilled receivables within accounts receivable and other assets, as appropriate at March 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018.  
Revenue recognized during the three months ended March 31, 2019 and March 31, 2018 from amounts included in deferred revenue at the beginning of the periods were approximately $5.7 million and $6.8 million, respectively. Revenue recognized during the three month ended March 31, 2019 and March 31, 2018 from performance obligations satisfied or partially satisfied in previous periods, mainly due to changes in the estimate of royalty revenues, is approximately $5.7 million and $4.3 million, respectively. During the three months ended March 31, 2019 and March 31, 2018, the change in contract assets reclassified to receivables as a result of the right to the transaction consideration becoming unconditional was not material. The contract modifications entered into during the three months ended March 31, 2019 and March 31, 2018 did not have a significant impact on the Companys contract assets or deferred revenue.

License revenue decreased primarily due to the decline in printer revenue from our printer imaging electronic customers and a decline in revenue from our web channels in the three months ended March 31, 2019, as compared to the same period in 2018. Service revenue decreased in the three months ended March 31, 2019, as compared to the same period in 2018, mainly due to increased customer churn in the last half of 2018.  
OEM revenue decreased $3.1 million, or 14.3%, to $18.6 million in the first quarter of 2019, as compared to $21.7 million in the first quarter of 2018, mainly due to a decline in printer revenue. The decrease in printer revenue, period over period, is largely due to a decline in revenue from our printer imaging electronic OEM customers.  
Cost of revenue, excluding amortization of acquired technology, decreased $2.8 million, or 22.8%, to $9.6 million and $12.4 million in the three months ended March 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. In the first quarter of 2018, there was $2.2 million of non-recurring royalty expense in connection with the adoption of ASC 606. As a percentage of sales, cost of revenue, excluding amortization of acquired technology, was 18.7% and 22.0% of total revenue in the three months ended March 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively, a decline of 3.3%.  
Gross profit increased 3.1% to 79.6% in the three months ended March 31, 2019, as compared to 76.5% in the three months ended March 31, 2018. The increase in gross profit in the three months ended March 31, 2019, as compared to the same period in 2018, was primarily due to the one-time additional non-recurring royalty expense in the prior period that did not occur in the current period, as described above.  
Marketing and Selling. Marketing and selling expense decreased $3.0 million, or 14.7%, to $17.1 million in the three months ended March 31, 2019, as compared to $20.1 million in the three months ended March 31, 2018, primarily due to lower personnel expenses. Personnel and personnel related expenses decreased $2.4 million in the first quarter of 2019, as compared to the same period in 2018, primarily due to lower headcount from our restructuring actions in the second and fourth quarters of 2018 and other decreases in headcount and lower variable compensation as a result of lower revenue. Targeted marketing spending decreased $0.4 million in the three months ended March 31, 2019, as compared to the same period in 2018, due to portfolio decisions around discretionary programs.  
Research and Development. Research and development expense decreased $1.9 million, or 20.0%, to $7.4 million in the three months ended March 31, 2019, as compared to $9.3 million in the three months ended March 31, 2018, primarily due to lower personnel expenses. Personnel and personnel related expenses decreased mainly due to lower headcount from restructuring actions in the second and fourth quarters of 2018.  
General and Administrative. General and administrative expense decreased $3.6 million, or 23.0%, to $12.0 million in the three months ended March 31, 2019, as compared to $15.6 million in the three months ended March 31, 2018. Outside consulting and legal expenses decreased $3.2 million in the three months ended March 31, 2019, as compared to the same period in 2018, primarily due to additional expenses incurred in the prior period related to shareholder activities. Personnel and personnel related expenses decreased $0.4 million in the three months ended March 31, 2019, as compared to the same period in 2018, mainly the result of restructuring actions in the fourth quarter of 2018.  
The impact of foreign earnings increased our effective tax rate by 3.6% in the first quarter of 2019, as compared to 33.8% in the same period in 2018, due to our ability to better utilize foreign tax credits and to limit the amount of income subject to the Global Intangible Low Taxed Income (GILTI) provisions. In the prior period, these provisions of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (The Act) resulted in a significantly higher effective tax rate on foreign earnings due to limitations on the Companys ability to utilize foreign tax credits in the first quarter of 2018.  
Non-deductible expenses added 2.4% to the effective tax rate for the three months ended March 31, 2019, as compared to 8.2% for the three months ended March 31, 2018, a result of the acceleration of the final payment of deferred compensation to the founders of Swyft in June 2018 and to two of the founders of Olapic in December 2018, both of which lowered the total amount of non-deductible compensation in the current period.
