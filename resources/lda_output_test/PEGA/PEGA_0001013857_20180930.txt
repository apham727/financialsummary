We encourage you to carefully consider the risk factors identified in Item 1A. Risk Factors of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2017. These risk factors could materially affect our business, financial condition, and future results and could cause our actual business and financial results to differ materially from those contained in forward-looking statements made in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q or elsewhere by management from time to time. There have been no material changes during the nine months ended September 30, 2018 to the risk factors disclosed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2017.

On January 1, 2018, the Company adopted Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606) using the full retrospective method which required that each prior reporting period presented be adjusted to reflect the application of this ASU. See Note 2. New Accounting Pronouncements for additional information.  
In June 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued ASU No. 2016-13, Financial InstrumentsCredit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments, which requires measurement and recognition of expected credit losses for financial assets measured at amortized cost, including accounts receivable, upon initial recognition of that financial asset using a forward-looking expected loss model, rather than an incurred loss model. Credit losses relating to available-for-sale debt securities should be recorded through an allowance for credit losses when the fair value is below the amortized cost of the asset, removing the concept of other-than-temporary impairments. The effective date for the Company will be January 1, 2020, with early adoption permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the effect this ASU will have on its consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.  
In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842), which requires lessees to record most leases on their balance sheets, recognizing a lease liability for the obligation to make lease payments and a right-of-use asset for the right to use the underlying asset for the lease term. The effective date for the Company will be January 1, 2019, with early adoption permitted. The Company expects that most of its operating lease commitments will be subject to this ASU and recognized as operating lease liabilities and right-of-use assets upon adoption with a material impact to the Companys balance sheet but an immaterial impact to its results of operations and cash flows. The Company expects to elect the optional transition method to apply the new lease standard prospectively at the adoption date, as opposed to recasting prior reporting periods. As a result, the Company expects to recognize a cumulative-effect adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings in the period of adoption.  
Perpetual licenses with extended payment terms and term licenses - Revenue from perpetual licenses with extended payment terms and term licenses is now recognized when control is transferred to the client, which is defined as the point in time when the client can use and benefit from the license. Previously, the Company recognized revenue over the term of the agreements as payments became due or earlier if prepaid. Any unrecognized license revenue from these arrangements is recognized in the period that control transfers or as a cumulative adjustment to retained earnings as of December 31, 2015. Unbilled receivables in the Companys unaudited condensed consolidated balance sheets increased significantly upon adoption due to the revenue from term licenses being recognized prior to amounts being due, or prepaid, by clients and perpetual licenses with extended payment terms.  
Allocation of future credits and significant discounts - Perpetual or term licenses delivered are a separate performance obligation which now requires the Company to allocate any future credits and discounts to the performance obligations in the arrangement based upon their relative stand-alone selling prices.  
Includes cash, cash equivalents, marketable securities, income taxes receivable, other current assets, property and equipment, intangible assets, goodwill, and other long-term assets (as reflected in the consolidated balance sheets in the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2017).  
As of September 30, 2018, remaining maturities of marketable securities ranged from October 2018 to August 2021, with a weighted-average remaining maturity of approximately 1.5 years.  
Unbilled receivables are the amounts due from clients where the only condition to the right of payment is the passage of time. As of September 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017, the allowance for doubtful accounts was not material.  
Contract assets are amounts under client contracts where revenue recognized exceeds the amount billed to the client and the right to payment is subject to conditions other than the passage of time, such as the completion of a related performance obligation. Deferred revenue consists of billings and payments received in advance of revenue recognition. Contract assets and deferred revenue are netted at the contract level for each reporting period.  
The Company records its cash equivalents, marketable securities, and investments in privately-held companies at fair value on a recurring basis. Fair value is an exit price, representing the amount that would be received from the sale of an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants based on assumptions that market participants would use in pricing an asset or liability.  
The Companys cash equivalents are composed of money market funds and time deposits, which are classified within Level 1 and Level 2, respectively, in the fair value hierarchy. The Companys marketable securities, which are classified within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy are valued based on a market approach using quoted prices, when available, or matrix pricing compiled by third party pricing vendors, using observable market inputs such as interest rates, yield curves, and credit risk. The Companys investments in privately-held companies are classified within Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy and are valued using model-based techniques, including option pricing models and discounted cash flow models.  
If applicable, the Company will recognize transfers into and out of levels within the fair value hierarchy at the end of the reporting period in which the actual event or change in circumstance occurs. There were no transfers between levels during the nine months ended September 30, 2018.  
For certain other financial instruments, including accounts receivable and accounts payable, the carrying value approximates fair value due to the relatively short maturity of these items.  
Software license revenue is primarily derived from sales of the Companys Pega Platform and software applications.  
Maintenance revenue includes revenue from client support including software upgrades on a when and-if available basis, telephone support, and bug fixes or patches.

We develop, market, license, and support software applications for customer engagement and digital process automation, in addition to licensing our Pega Platform application development product for clients that wish to build and extend their own applications. The Pega Platform and applications help connect enterprises to their customers in real-time across channels, streamline business operations, and adapt to meet changing requirements.  
Our clients include Global 3000 companies and government agencies that seek to manage complex enterprise systems and customer service issues with greater agility and cost-effectiveness. Our strategy is to sell a client a series of licenses, each focused on a specific purpose or area of operations in support of longer term enterprise-wide digital transformation initiatives.  
Note 2. New Accounting Pronouncements, Note 4. Receivables, Contract Assets, and Deferred Revenue, and Note 9. Revenue contained in Item 1. Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarterly period ended September 30, 2018.  
Our clients contracts with us typically contain promises by us to provide multiple products and services. Judgment is required to determine whether each product and service is considered to be a distinct performance obligation that should be accounted for separately under the contract. We allocate the transaction price to the distinct performance obligations based on relative stand-alone selling price. We estimate stand-alone selling price based on the prices charged to clients, or by using information such as market conditions and other observable inputs. However, the selling price of our software licenses and cloud performance obligations are highly variable. Thus, we estimate stand-alone selling price for software licenses and cloud performance obligations using the residual approach, determined based on total transaction price minus the stand-alone selling price of other performance obligations promised in the contract.  
Our license revenue is primarily derived from sales of our applications and Pega Platform. Our cloud revenue is derived from our hosted Pega Platform and software applications. Our consulting revenue is primarily related to new license implementations.  
The decrease in term license revenue in the three months ended September 30, 2018 was primarily due to $17 million of revenue recognized in the three months ended September 30, 2017 from a large term license renewal. The decrease in term license revenue in the nine months ended September 30, 2018 was primarily due to $35.3 million of revenue recognized in the three months ended March 31, 2017 from a large term license renewal.  
The increase in perpetual license revenue in the three months ended September 30, 2018 was primarily due to revenue recognized from license rights which became effective in the current period from perpetual arrangements executed in prior periods, primarily the three months ended June 30, 2018. The decrease in perpetual license revenue in the nine months ended September 30, 2018 reflects the shift in client preferences away from perpetual license arrangements.  
The increases in cloud gross profit percent in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2018 were primarily due to continued growth and scale in our cloud business, partially offset by an increase in client support expenses as we expanded our cloud client support function to sustain our growing cloud business.  
The decreases in consulting gross profit percent in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2018 were driven primarily by increases in compensation and benefits, lower utilization rates, and the impact of our policy introduced late in the three months ended June 30, 2017 to offer our web-based training free of charge to users which reduced training revenue for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2018.  
Includes compensation, benefits, and other headcount-related expenses associated with our selling and marketing personnel as well as advertising, promotions, trade shows, seminars, and the amortization of client-related intangibles.  
The increases in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2018 were primarily due to increases in compensation and benefits of $15.2 million and $40.6 million, as a result of increased headcount, increased deferred contract commission costs amortization of $1.2 million and $3.3 million, and an increase in marketing programs in the nine months ended September 30, 2018 of $3.1 million. The increase in headcount reflects our efforts to increase our sales capacity to deepen relationships with existing clients and target new accounts.
