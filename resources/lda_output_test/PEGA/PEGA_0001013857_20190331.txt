In June 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2016-13, “Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments,” which requires measurement and recognition of expected credit losses for financial assets measured at amortized cost, including accounts receivable, upon initial recognition of that financial asset using a forward-looking expected loss model, rather than an incurred loss model. Credit losses relating to available-for-sale debt securities should be recorded through an allowance for credit losses when the fair value is below the amortized cost of the asset, removing the concept of “other-than-temporary” impairments. The effective date for the Company will be January 1, 2020, with early adoption permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the effect this ASU will have on its consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.
On January 1, 2019, the Company adopted Accounting Standards Codifications 842 “Leases” (“ASC 842”) using the modified retrospective method, reflecting any cumulative effect as an adjustment to equity. Results for reporting periods beginning on or after January 1, 2019 are presented under ASC 842, while prior period amounts were not adjusted and continue to be reported in accordance with the Company’s historic accounting under ASC 840 “Leases”. 
Contract assets are amounts under client contracts where revenue recognized exceeds the amount billed to the client and the right to payment is subject to conditions other than the passage of time, such as the completion of a related performance obligation. Deferred revenue consists of billings and payments received in advance of revenue recognition. Contract assets and deferred revenue are netted at the contract level for each reporting period. 
The change in deferred revenue in the three months ended March 31, 2019 was primarily due to $89.4 million of revenue recognized, excluding the impact of netting contract assets and deferred revenue at the contract level, during the period that was included in deferred revenue at December 31, 2018, partially offset by new billings in advance of revenue recognition.
The Company records its cash equivalents, marketable securities, and investments in privately-held companies at fair value on a recurring basis. Fair value is an exit price, representing the amount that would be received from the sale of an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants based on assumptions that market participants would use in pricing an asset or liability. 
The Company’s cash equivalents are composed of money market funds and time deposits, which are classified within Level 1 and Level 2, respectively, in the fair value hierarchy. The Company’s marketable securities, which are classified within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy are valued based on a market approach using quoted prices, when available, or matrix pricing compiled by third party pricing vendors, using observable market inputs such as interest rates, yield curves, and credit risk. The Company’s investments in privately-held companies are classified within Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy.
If applicable, the Company will recognize transfers into and out of levels within the fair value hierarchy at the end of the reporting period in which the actual event or change in circumstance occurs. There were no transfers between levels during the three months ended March 31, 2019.
All the Company’s leases are operating leases. The Company accounts for a contract as a lease when it has the right to control the asset for a period of time while obtaining substantially all of the asset’s economic benefits. The Company determines the initial classification and measurement of its operating right of use assets and lease liabilities at the lease commencement date and thereafter if modified. Fixed lease costs are recognized on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease. Variable lease costs are recognized in the period in which the obligation for those payments is incurred. The Company combines lease and non-lease components in the determination of lease costs for its office space leases. The lease liability includes lease payments related to options to extend or renew the lease term, if the Company is reasonably certain it will exercise those options. The Company’s leases do not contain any material residual value guarantees or restrictive covenants. 
The Company recognizes stock-based compensation using the accelerated recognition method, treating each vesting tranche as if it were an individual grant. As of March 31, 2019, the Company had $114.1 million of unrecognized stock-based compensation expense, net of estimated forfeitures, related to all unvested restricted stock units (“RSUs”) and stock options. These amounts are expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 2.3 years.
Basic earnings per share is computed using the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during the applicable period. Diluted earnings per share is computed using the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during the applicable period, plus the dilutive effect of outstanding stock options and RSUs, using the treasury stock method. In periods of loss, all stock options and RSUs are excluded, as their inclusion would be anti-dilutive.

The decrease in term license revenue in the three months ended March 31, 2019 was primarily due to lower average revenue per arrangement. The increase in cloud revenue in the three months ended March 31, 2019 reflects the shift in client preferences to cloud arrangements from other types of arrangements.
The decrease in perpetual license revenue in the three months ended March 31, 2019 reflects the shift in client preferences in favor of our cloud offerings and away from perpetual license arrangements.
The recent shift in our revenue mix toward cloud arrangements has resulted in slower total gross profit growth as our cloud business continues to grow and scale. Revenue from cloud arrangements is generally recognized over the service period, while revenue from term and perpetual license arrangements is generally recognized upfront when the license rights become effective.
The decrease in total gross profit in the three months ended March 31, 2019 was primarily due to the decrease in term and perpetual license revenue reflecting the shift in client preferences toward our cloud offerings.
The decrease in total gross profit percent in the three months ended March 31, 2019 was driven by a shift in favor of cloud arrangements, which are lower margin than our term and perpetual license revenue streams. The increase in cloud gross profit percent was driven by cost efficiency gains as our cloud business continues to grow and scale. The decrease in consulting gross profit percent was driven by a decrease in billable hours as consulting resources were transitioning to new projects after completing a large project which began in the second half of 2016 and an increase in consulting resource availability in Europe as we continue growing and leveraging our partner network.
The increase in the three months ended March 31, 2019 was primarily due to an increase in compensation and benefits of $17.7 million, attributable to increased headcount, and an increase of $4.5 million in deferred contract commission amortization. The increase in headcount reflects our efforts to increase our sales capacity to deepen relationships with existing clients and target new accounts.
The increase in the three months ended March 31, 2019 was primarily due to an increase in compensation and benefits of $2.1 million, attributable to an increase in headcount, and an increase of $1.6 million in cloud hosting expenses as we expand our cloud-focused research and development activities.
The decrease in the three months ended March 31, 2019 was primarily due to a decrease in compensation and benefits of $1.2 million, due to a decrease in equity compensation, and a decrease of $1.9 million in legal and other professional services fees. Despite the headcount increase, associated compensation and benefits did not increase because these costs are primarily allocated to other operating expense areas. 
The change in foreign currency transaction loss was primarily due to unrealized losses on foreign currency denominated cash and receivables of our U.K subsidiary due to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates as the British Pound strengthened against the Euro and U.S. dollar.
The inclusion of excess tax benefits from stock-based compensation in the provision for income taxes has increased the variability of the effective tax rates in recent periods. This fluctuation may continue in future periods, as the amount of excess tax benefits from stock-based compensation awards varies depending on our future stock price in relation to the fair value of awards, the timing of RSU vestings, the exercise behavior of our stock option holders, and the total value of future grants of stock-based compensation awards.
As client preferences continue to shift in favor of cloud arrangements, we could continue to experience slower operating cash flow growth in the near term. Cash from cloud arrangements is generally collected throughout the service period of three to five years, while cash from perpetual license arrangements is generally collected upfront, shortly after the license rights become effective.
