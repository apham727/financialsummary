2016-13, “Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments,” which requires measurement and recognition of expected credit losses for financial assets measured at amortized cost, including accounts receivable, upon initial recognition of that financial asset using a forward-looking expected loss model, rather than an incurred loss model.
Results for reporting periods beginning on or after January 1, 2019 are presented under ASC 842, while prior period amounts were not adjusted and continue to be reported in accordance with the Company’s historic accounting under ASC 840 “Leases”.
As of March 31, 2019, maturities of marketable securities ranged from April 2019 to August 2022, with a weighted-average remaining maturity of approximately 1.4 years.
Unbilled receivables are client committed amounts for which revenue recognition precedes billing, and billing is solely subject to the passage of time.
Contract assets are amounts under client contracts where revenue recognized exceeds the amount billed to the client and the right to payment is subject to conditions other than the passage of time, such as the completion of a related performance obligation.
Contract assets and deferred revenue are netted at the contract level for each reporting period.
The change in deferred revenue in the three months ended March 31, 2019 was primarily due to $89.4 million of revenue recognized, excluding the impact of netting contract assets and deferred revenue at the contract level, during the period that was included in deferred revenue at December 31, 2018, partially offset by new billings in advance of revenue recognition.
Deferred costs are amortized on a straight-line basis over the benefit period, which is on average 5 years.
The Company records its cash equivalents, marketable securities, and investments in privately-held companies at fair value on a recurring basis.
The Company’s investments in privately-held companies are classified within Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy.
If applicable, the Company will recognize transfers into and out of levels within the fair value hierarchy at the end of the reporting period in which the actual event or change in circumstance occurs.
For certain other financial instruments, including accounts receivable and accounts payable, the carrying value approximates fair value due to the relatively short maturity of these items.

The decrease in consulting gross profit percent was driven by a decrease in billable hours as consulting resources were transitioning to new projects after completing a large project which began in the second half of 2016 and an increase in consulting resource availability in Europe as we continue growing and leveraging our partner network.
