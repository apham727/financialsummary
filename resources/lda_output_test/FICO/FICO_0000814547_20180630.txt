We have prepared the accompanying unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial statements in accordance with the instructions to Form 10-Q and the applicable accounting guidance.
These unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements and notes thereto should be read in conjunction with our audited consolidated financial statements and notes thereto presented in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended September 30, 2017.
The interim financial information contained in this report is not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for any other interim period or for the entire fiscal year.
For example, we use estimates in determining the collectability of accounts receivable; the appropriate levels of various accruals; labor hours in connection with fixed-fee service contracts; the amount of our tax provision and the realizability of deferred tax assets.
We also use estimates in determining the remaining economic lives and carrying values of acquired intangible assets, property and equipment, and other long-lived assets.
ASU 2014-09 requires an entity to recognize the amount of revenue to which it expects to be entitled for the transfer of promised goods or services to customers.
ASU 2014-09 will replace most existing revenue recognition guidance in U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles when it becomes effective and permits the use of either the retrospective or cumulative effect transition method.We use analytics to help businesses automate, improve and connect decisions across their enterprise, an approach we commonly refer to as decision management.
We also serve consumers through online services that enable people to purchase and understand their FICO® Scores, the standard measure of consumer credit risk in the U.S., and empower them to manage their financial health.
Most of our solutions address customer engagement, including customer acquisition, customer onboarding, customer servicing and management, and customer protection.
Scores revenue increased 32% to $92.1 million during the quarter ended June 30, 2018 from $69.5 million during the quarter ended June 30, 2017, and 29% to $249.9 million during the nine months ended June 30, 2018 from $194.3 million during the nine months ended June 30, 2017.
Scores operating income increased 36% to $75.7 million during the quarter ended June 30, 2018 from $55.5 million during the quarter ended June 30, 2017, and 32% to $201.3 million during the nine months ended June 30, 2018 from $152.5 million during the nine months ended June 30, 2017.
During the quarter ended June 30, 2018, cloud revenues accounted for $58.1 million, or 35% of non-Scores revenues, compared to $51.2 million, or 32% during the quarter ended June 30, 2017.
Operating income increased 17% to $48.4 million for the quarter ended June 30, 2018 from $41.4 million during the quarter ended June 30, 2017 and as a result, net earnings increased 28% to $32.4 million from $25.2 million.We continue to expand the pursuit of our business objective to become a leader in helping businesses automate and improve decisions across their enterprises, an approach that we commonly refer to as Decision Management, or “DM.” Our DM strategy is designed to enable us to increase our business by selling multiple products to clients, as well as to enable the development of custom client solutions that may lead to opportunities to develop new proprietary scores or other new proprietary products.
The market may be unreceptive to our general DM business approach, including being unreceptive to purchasing multiple products from us, unreceptive to our customized solutions, or unreceptive to our cloud-based offerings.
As we continue to pursue our DM strategy, we may experience volatility in our revenues and operating results caused by various factors, including differences in revenue recognition treatment between our cloud-based offerings and on-premises software licenses, the timing of investments and other expenditures necessary to develop and operate our cloud-based offerings, and the adoption of new sales and delivery methods.
We expect that part of the growth that we seek to achieve through our DM strategy will be derived from the sale of DM products and service solutions in industries and markets we do not currently serve.
Our growth and the success of our DM strategy depend upon our ability to develop and sell new products or suites of products, including the development and sale of our cloud-based product offerings.
