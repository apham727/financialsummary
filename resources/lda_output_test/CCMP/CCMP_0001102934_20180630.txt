Cabot Microelectronics Corporation ("Cabot Microelectronics'', "the Company'', "us'', "we'', or "our'') supplies high-performance polishing slurries and pads used in the manufacture of advanced integrated circuit (IC) devices within the semiconductor industry, in a process called chemical mechanical planarization (CMP). CMP polishes surfaces at an atomic level, thereby helping to enable IC device manufacturers to produce smaller, faster and more complex IC devices with fewer defects. We develop, produce and sell CMP slurries for polishing many of the conducting and insulating materials used in IC devices. We develop, manufacture and sell CMP polishing pads, which are used in conjunction with slurries in the CMP process. We also develop and provide products for demanding surface modification applications in other industries through our Engineered Surface Finishes (ESF) business. For additional information, refer to Part 1, Item 1, "Business", in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2017. 
The unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared by Cabot Microelectronics pursuant to the rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (U.S. GAAP). In the opinion of management, these unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements include all adjustments, consisting of normal recurring adjustments, necessary for the fair statement of Cabot Microelectronics' financial position as of June 30, 2018, cash flows for the nine months ended June 30, 2018 and June 30, 2017, and results of operations for the three and nine months ended June 30, 2018 and June 30, 2017. The Consolidated Balance Sheets as of September 30, 2017 were derived from audited financial statements. The results of operations for the three and nine months ended June 30, 2018 may not be indicative of results to be expected for future periods, including the fiscal year ending September 30, 2018. This Report on Form 10-Q does not contain all of the footnote disclosures from the annual financial statements and should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements and related notes thereto included in Cabot Microelectronics' Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2017. 
The results of operations for the quarter ended December 31, 2017 and nine months ended June 30, 2018 include a correction to prior period amounts, which we determined to be immaterial to the prior periods to which they relate and are expected to be immaterial to our fiscal 2018 results. The adjustments, relating primarily to accumulated earnings taxes of a foreign operation, increased the income tax expense for the first quarter of fiscal 2018 by $2,071. Separately, in Note 14 of this Report on Form 10-Q, we discuss the effects of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act ("Tax Act") on our financial statements.  
Fair value is defined as the price that would be received from the sale of an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. The Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") established a three-level hierarchy for disclosure based on the extent and level of judgment used to estimate fair value. Level 1 inputs consist of valuations based on quoted market prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. Level 2 inputs consist of valuations based on quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities, quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in an inactive market, or other observable inputs. Level 3 inputs consist of valuations based on unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity. 
The following table presents financial instruments, other than long-term debt, that we measured at fair value on a recurring basis at June 30, 2018 and September 30, 2017. See Note 8 for a detailed discussion of our long-term debt. We have classified the following assets and liabilities in accordance with the fair value hierarchy set forth in the applicable standards. In instances where the inputs used to measure the fair value of an asset fall into more than one level of the hierarchy, we have classified them based on the lowest-level input that is significant to the determination of the fair value.  
Our cash and cash equivalents consist of various bank accounts used to support our operations and investments in institutional money-market funds that are traded in active markets. We are invested exclusively in AAA-rated, prime institutional money market funds, comprised of high quality, fixed income securities. Our other long-term investments represent the fair value of investments under the Cabot Microelectronics Supplemental Employee Retirement Plan (SERP), which is a nonqualified supplemental savings plan. The fair value of the investments is determined through quoted market prices within actively traded markets. Although the investments are allocated to individual participants and investment decisions are made solely by those participants, the SERP is a nonqualified plan. Consequently, the Company owns the assets and the related offsetting liability for disbursement until a participant makes a qualifying withdrawal. The long-term investment was adjusted to $1,089 in the third quarter of fiscal 2018 to reflect its fair value as of June 30, 2018. 
Our ARS investment at June 30, 2018 consisted of one tax exempt municipal debt security with a par and fair value of $3,975 which has a maturity greater than ten years. The balance of our ARS investment decreased due to redemption of one of our securities during the quarter. The fair value of our ARS was determined using Level 2 fair value inputs. We have classified our ARS as held-to-maturity security based on our intention and ability to hold the security until maturity. There was no unrecognized gain or loss on our ARS investment during the quarter. Although we believe this security will ultimately be collected in full, we believe that it is not likely that we will be able to monetize the security in our next business cycle (which for us is generally one year). We will continue to monitor our ARS for impairment indicators, which may require us to record an impairment charge that is deemed other-than-temporary. 
In the third quarter of fiscal 2015, we amended a supply agreement with an existing supplier. The amended agreement includes a fee of $4,500, of which we already have paid $3,000, which provides us the option to purchase certain raw materials beyond calendar 2016 through the expiration of the agreement in December 2019. This fee was recorded as a long-term asset at its present value and is being amortized into cost of goods sold on a straight-line basis through the expiration date of the agreement. See Note 10 for more information regarding this agreement. 
We are exposed to various market risks, including risks associated with interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates. We enter into certain derivative transactions to mitigate the volatility associated with these exposures. We have policies in place that define acceptable instrument types we may enter into and we have established controls to limit our market risk exposure. We do not use derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes. In addition, all derivatives, whether designated in hedging relationships or not, are required to be recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheets at fair value on a gross basis. 
In the first quarter of fiscal 2015, we entered into floating-to-fixed interest rate swap agreements to hedge the variability in LIBOR-based interest payments on $86,406 of our outstanding variable rate debt. The notional amount of the swaps decreased each quarter by an amount in proportion to our scheduled quarterly principal payment of debt. The interest rate swap agreements were terminated during the third quarter of fiscal 2018 in conjunction with the payoff of the Term Loan. 
We designated these swap agreements as cash flow hedges pursuant to ASC 815, "Derivatives and Hedging". As cash flow hedges, unrealized gains were recognized as assets and unrealized losses were recognized as liabilities. Unrealized gains and losses were designated as effective or ineffective based on a comparison of the changes in fair value of the interest rate swaps and changes in fair value of the underlying exposures being hedged. The effective portion was recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income or loss, while the ineffective portion was recorded as a component of interest expense. Changes in the method by which we paid interest from one-month LIBOR to another rate of interest could create ineffectiveness in the swaps and result in amounts which were reclassified from other comprehensive income into net income. Hedge effectiveness was tested quarterly to determine if hedge treatment continued to be appropriate. 
In September 2017, we entered into two forward foreign exchange contracts in an effort to protect the net investment of our South Korean subsidiary against potential adverse changes resulting from currency fluctuations in the Korean won. We entered into forward contracts to sell 100 billion Korean won and buy U.S. dollars, settling in September 2022. We had designated these forward contracts as an effective net investment hedge. As a result of cash repatriation facilitated by the Tax Act, the Company terminated these foreign exchange contracts in the third quarter of fiscal 2018. 
We have defined benefit plans covering employees in certain foreign jurisdictions as required by local law, which are unfunded. Benefit costs, consisting primarily of service costs, are recorded as fringe benefit expense under cost of goods sold and operating expenses in our Consolidated Statements of Income. The projected benefit obligations and accumulated benefit obligations under all such unfunded plans are updated annually during the fourth quarter of the fiscal year. Benefit payments under all such unfunded plans to be paid over the next ten years are expected to be approximately $5,785. For more information regarding these plans, refer to Note 18 of "Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements" included in Item 8 of Part II of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2017. 
For the nine months ended June 30, 2018, we recorded $2,276 in currency translation gains, net of tax, primarily due to exchange rate fluctuations in the Japanese yen and Korean won versus the U.S. dollar, that are included in other comprehensive income. These gains and losses primarily relate to changes in the U.S. dollar value of assets and liabilities denominated in local currencies when these asset and liability amounts are translated at month-end exchange rates. 
We record share-based compensation expense for all share-based awards, including stock option grants, and restricted stock, restricted stock unit and performance share unit ("PSU") awards, and employee stock purchase plan purchases. We calculate share-based compensation expense using the straight-line approach based on awards ultimately expected to vest, which requires the use of an estimated forfeiture rate. Our estimated forfeiture rate is primarily based on historical experience, but may be revised in future periods if actual forfeitures differ from the estimate. We use the Black-Scholes option-pricing model to estimate the grant date fair value of our stock options and employee stock purchase plan purchases. This model requires the input of highly subjective assumptions, including the price volatility of the underlying stock, the expected term of our stock options, expected dividend yield and the risk-free interest rate. We estimate the expected volatility of our stock options based on a combination of our stock's historical volatility and the implied volatilities from actively-traded options on our stock. We calculate the expected term of our stock options using historical stock option exercise data, and for stock option grants made prior to December 2017, we have added a slight premium to this expected term for employees who meet the definition of retirement-eligible pursuant to their stock option grants during the contractual term of the grant. As of December 2017, the provisions of new stock option grants and restricted stock unit awards state that except in certain circumstances including termination for cause, once an employee meets the retirement eligibility requirements, any remaining unvested share-based awards will continue to vest regardless of termination of service. Consequently, the requisite service period for the award is satisfied upon retirement eligibility. Therefore, for those employees who have met the retirement eligibility at the grant date, we now record the total share-based compensation expense upon award; for those employees who will meet the retirement eligibility during the four-year vesting period, we now record the share-based compensation expense over the period from the grant date through the date of retirement eligibility, rather than over the four-year vesting period stated in the award agreement. 
Our effective tax rate was 18.3% and 47.0% for the three and nine months ended June 30, 2018, respectively, compared to a 22.4% and 21.1% effective income tax rate for the three and nine months ended June 30, 2017. The significant increase in our effective tax rate for the nine months ended June 30, 2018 compared to the prior year is primarily driven by discrete adjustments related to the enactment of the Tax Act in the United States in December 2017. Other factors that impacted the Company's effective tax rate for the three and nine months ended June 30, 2018 were primarily related to benefits in excess of compensation cost from share based compensation recorded in the income statement (as opposed to equity prior to October 2017), the absence of benefits of a tax holiday in South Korea that expired as of October 2017, and benefits related to changes in prior year tax positions.

Gross margin, representing gross profit as a percentage of revenue, for the third quarter of fiscal 2018 was 53.6%, compared to 48.9% for our third quarter of fiscal 2017, both periods of which included 90-basis points of adverse impact of NexPlanar amortization expense. Gross margin for the first nine months of fiscal 2018 was 53.0% of revenue, compared to 49.7% during the same period last year, which includes 90 and 100-basis points of adverse impact of NexPlanar amortization expense, comparatively. Factors affecting our gross margin for both the quarter and the first nine months of fiscal 2018 compared to last year included higher sales volume and a higher value product mix, partially offset by higher fixed manufacturing costs, including higher staffing-related expense. We currently expect our gross margin for the full fiscal year 2018 to be at the high end of our revised guidance range of 52% to 53%, including NexPlanar amortization expense; this is an increase from our prior full year guidance range of 51% to 53%. We may continue to experience fluctuations in our gross margin due to a number of factors, including changes in our product mix and the extent to which we utilize our manufacturing capacity, which may cause our annual and quarterly gross margin to be above or below this annual guidance range. 
The Company reported diluted earnings per share of $1.34 in the third quarter of fiscal 2018, compared to diluted earnings per share of $0.77 in the same quarter last year. The increase was primarily due to higher revenue and a higher gross margin, partially offset by higher operating expenses. Diluted earnings per share were $2.35 for the first nine months of fiscal 2018, compared to $2.37 during the same period last year. The year-over-year decrease was primarily due to the negative impact of the enactment of the Tax Act in December 2017, which reduced diluted earnings per share by $1.24, and the positive impact from higher revenue and a higher gross margin, partially offset by higher operating expenses. 
Total cost of goods sold was $69.7 million for the three months ended June 30, 2018, which represented an increase of 6.6%, or $4.3 million, from the three months ended June 30, 2017. The increase in cost of goods sold was primarily driven by a $3.9 million increase due to higher sales volume, a $1.6 million increase in fixed manufacturing costs, including higher staffing-related expenses, a $0.9 million increase due to foreign exchange fluctuations, and a $0.8 million increase due to product mix, partially offset by a $3.5 million decrease in other variable manufacturing costs, including material costs. Fixed manufacturing costs included $1.3 million of NexPlanar amortization expense compared to $1.2 million in same period of fiscal 2017. 
Total research, development and technical expenses were $13.1 million for the three months ended June 30, 2018, which represented a decrease of 8.9%, or $1.3 million, from the three months ended June 30, 2017. The decrease was primarily due to the absence of an impairment charge of $0.9 million that occurred in the three months ended June 30, 2017, lower supplies and equipment costs used in research and development of $0.5 million, and lower professional expenses of $0.3 million, partially offset by the absence of a gain on equipment disposal of $0.6 million that occurred in the three months ended June 30, 2017. 
Total cost of goods sold was $203.6 million for the nine months ended June 30, 2018, which represented an increase of 9.3%, or $17.3 million, from the nine months ended June 30, 2017. The increase in cost of goods sold was primarily driven by a $9.9 million increase due to higher sales volume, a $6.9 million increase in fixed manufacturing costs, including higher incentive compensation expense, and a $1.9 million increase due to foreign exchange fluctuations, partially offset by a $5.7 million decrease in variable manufacturing costs, including material costs. Fixed manufacturing costs included $3.9 million of NexPlanar amortization expense, compared to $3.6 million in same period of fiscal 2017. 
We generated $104.0 million in cash flows from operating activities in the first nine months of fiscal 2018, compared to $90.0 million in cash from operating activities in the first nine months of fiscal 2017. Our cash provided by operating activities in the first nine months of fiscal 2018 reflected net income of $61.8 million, $69.7 million in non-cash items, including $24.6 million related to the deemed repatriation transition tax of the Tax Act, and a $27.5 million decrease in cash flow due to a net increase in working capital. The increase in cash flows from operating activities compared to the first nine months of fiscal 2017 was primarily due to higher revenue and gross margin, partially offset by a higher increase in working capital. We are still analyzing certain aspects of the Tax Act, which could potentially affect the measurement of these balances or give rise to new deferred tax amounts. Our accruals for incentive compensation under our STIP are higher in fiscal 2018 than in fiscal 2017. In addition, the STIP payment related to our performance in fiscal 2017, which we made in the first quarter of fiscal 2018, was $14.1 million higher than the STIP payment related to our performance in fiscal 2016, which was paid in the first quarter of fiscal 2017. 
 In the first nine months of fiscal 2018, cash flows used in investing activities were $145.3 million, representing $178.4 million in purchases of investments designated as available-for-sale securities under a managed investment arrangement that were offset by $55.2 million in proceeds upon the subsequent sale of part of these investments, property, plant and equipment additions of $15.2 million, and payment for net investment hedge termination of $9.9 million, partially offset by $3.0 million of cash received for the sale of certain ESF assets that occurred in the second quarter of fiscal 2018. In the first nine months of fiscal 2017, cash flows used in investing activities were $15.1 million, representing $15.3 million in purchases of property, plant and equipment, net of $0.6 million in proceeds from sales of property, plant and equipment. We continue to expect our total capital expenditures in fiscal 2018 to be within the range of $18.0 million to $22.0 million. 
In the first nine months of fiscal 2018, cash flows used in financing activities were $177.7 million. We used $144.4 million to payoff the Term Loan, $33.1 million to repurchase common stock, and $20.5 million to pay dividends and dividend equivalents on our common stock. We received $20.3 million from the issuance of common stock related to the exercise of stock options granted under our EIP and OIP, and for the sale of shares to employees under our ESPP. In the first nine months of fiscal 2017, cash flows provided by financing activities were $5.9 million. We received $27.6 million from the issuance of common stock related to the exercise of stock options granted under our EIP and OIP, and for the sale of shares to employees under our ESPP, and $5.8 million in tax benefits related to exercises of stock options and vesting of restricted stock and restricted stock units granted under the EIP and OIP. We used $5.9 million to repurchase common stock, $14.0 million to pay dividends and dividend equivalents on our common stock, and $7.6 million to repay long-term debt.

We conduct business operations outside of the United States through our foreign operations. Some of our foreign operations maintain their accounting records in their local currencies. Consequently, period to period comparability of results of operations is affected by fluctuations in exchange rates. The primary currencies to which we have exposure are the Korean won, Japanese yen, and the New Taiwan dollar. Approximately 26% of our revenue is transacted in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. However, we also incur expenses in foreign countries that are transacted in currencies other than the U.S. dollar, which provides a natural hedge and mitigates the exposure on the Consolidated Statements of Income. We periodically enter into forward contracts in an effort to manage foreign currency exchange exposure on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. However, we are unlikely to be able to hedge these exposures completely. We do not enter into forward contracts or other derivative instruments for speculative or trading purposes.

Because of inherent limitations, our disclosure controls or our internal control over financial reporting may not prevent all errors and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Further, the design of a control system must take into account the benefits of controls relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within the Company have been detected. These inherent limitations include possible faulty judgment in decision-making and breakdowns due to a simple error or mistake. Additionally, controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more people or by management override of the controls. The design of any system of controls also is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions. Over time, controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or the degree of compliance with policies or procedures may deteriorate. Because of the inherent limitations in a cost-effective control system, misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected.

Our business is affected by economic and industry conditions and our revenue is primarily dependent upon semiconductor demand. Historically, semiconductor demand has fluctuated due to economic and industry cycles and seasonal shifts in demand, which can affect our business, causing demand for our products to fluctuate. For example, the strengthening of demand conditions in the semiconductor industry we experienced during the second half of fiscal 2016 through fiscal 2017 continued through our third quarter of fiscal 2018, following relatively soft demand conditions during the second half of fiscal 2015 and the first half of fiscal 2016. Furthermore, competitive dynamics within the semiconductor industry may impact our business. Our limited visibility to future customer orders makes it difficult for us to predict industry trends. If the global economy or the semiconductor industry weakens, whether in general or as a result of specific factors, such as macroeconomic factors, or unpredictable events such as natural disasters or geopolitical events, we could experience material adverse impacts on our results of operations and financial condition. 
Our business is substantially dependent on CMP slurries and pads, which account for the majority of our revenue. Our business would suffer if these products became obsolete or if consumption of these products decreased. Our success depends on our ability to keep pace with technological changes and advances in the semiconductor industry, and to adapt, improve and customize our products for advanced IC applications in response to evolving customer needs and industry trends. Since its inception, the semiconductor industry has experienced technological changes and advances in the design, manufacture, performance and application of IC devices. Our customers continually pursue lower cost of ownership and higher quality and performance of materials consumed in their manufacturing processes, including CMP slurries and pads, as a means to reduce costs, increase the yield in their manufacturing facilities, and achieve desired performance of the IC devices they produce. We expect these technological changes, and this drive toward lower costs, higher quality and performance and higher yields, will continue in the future. Potential technology developments in the semiconductor industry, as well as our customers' efforts to reduce consumption of CMP consumables, including through use of smaller quantities, could render our products less important to the IC device manufacturing process. 
Our CMP consumables customer base is concentrated among a limited number of large customers. Over the past several years, the semiconductor industry has been consolidating as the larger semiconductor manufacturers have generally grown faster than the smaller ones, through business gains, mergers and acquisitions, and strategic alliances. While the pace of consolidation has recently slowed, we believe that consolidation is likely to continue in the future. We have not experienced any notable impact on our sales due to consolidation in the industry. One or more of these principal customers could stop buying CMP consumables from us or could substantially reduce the quantity of CMP consumables purchased from us. Our principal customers also hold considerable purchasing power, which can impact the pricing and terms of sale of our products. Any deferral or significant reduction in the quantity or price of CMP consumables sold to these principal customers could seriously harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.  
We depend on our supply chain to enable us to meet the demands of our customers. Our supply chain includes the raw materials we use to manufacture our products, our production operations and the means by which we deliver our products to our customers. Our business could be adversely affected by any problem or interruption in the supply of the key raw materials we use in our CMP slurries and pads, including raw materials that do not meet the stringent quality and consistency requirements of our customers, any problem or interruption that may occur during production or delivery of our products, such as weather-related problems, natural disasters, or geopolitical, trade, or labor-related issues, or any difficulty in producing sufficient quantities of our products to meet growing demand from our customers. Our supply chain may also be negatively impacted by unanticipated price increases due to supply restrictions beyond the control of our Company or our raw materials suppliers.
