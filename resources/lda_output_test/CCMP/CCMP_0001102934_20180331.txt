CMP polishes surfaces at an atomic level, thereby helping to enable IC device manufacturers to produce smaller, faster and more complex IC devices with fewer defects.
We develop, produce and sell CMP slurries for polishing many of the conducting and insulating materials used in IC devices.
We also develop and provide products for demanding surface modification applications in other industries through our Engineered Surface Finishes (ESF) business.

The unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared by Cabot Microelectronics pursuant to the rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (U.S. GAAP).

Fair value is defined as the price that would be received from the sale of an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date.
The Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") established a three-level hierarchy for disclosure based on the extent and level of judgment used to estimate fair value.
Level 2 inputs consist of valuations based on quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities, quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in an inactive market, or other observable inputs.Additionally, continued capacity expansions in 3D NAND are underway, primarily in Korea and China, which should also continue to provide growth opportunities for us in the future.
The enactment of the Tax Act in the United States in December 2017 facilitated the Company's repatriation of a substantial amount of its non-U.S. cash and available-for-sale securities during the second quarter of fiscal 2018 and following the end of the quarter in early April.
