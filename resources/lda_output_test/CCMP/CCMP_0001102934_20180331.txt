The unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared by Cabot Microelectronics pursuant to the rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (U.S. GAAP). In the opinion of management, these unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements include all adjustments, consisting of normal recurring adjustments, necessary for the fair statement of Cabot Microelectronics' financial position as of March 31, 2018, cash flows for the six months ended March 31, 2018 and March 31, 2017, and results of operations for the three and six months ended March 31, 2018 and March 31, 2017. The Consolidated Balance Sheets as of September 30, 2017 were derived from audited financial statements. The results of operations for the three and six months ended March 31, 2018 may not be indicative of results to be expected for future periods, including the fiscal year ending September 30, 2018. This Report on Form 10-Q does not contain all of the footnote disclosures from the annual financial statements and should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements and related notes thereto included in Cabot Microelectronics' Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2017. 
Fair value is defined as the price that would be received from the sale of an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. The Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") established a three-level hierarchy for disclosure based on the extent and level of judgment used to estimate fair value. Level 1 inputs consist of valuations based on quoted market prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. Level 2 inputs consist of valuations based on quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities, quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in an inactive market, or other observable inputs. Level 3 inputs consist of valuations based on unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity. 
The following table presents financial instruments, other than long-term debt, that we measured at fair value on a recurring basis at March 31, 2018 and September 30, 2017. See Note 8 for a detailed discussion of our long-term debt. We have classified the following assets and liabilities in accordance with the fair value hierarchy set forth in the applicable standards. In instances where the inputs used to measure the fair value of an asset fall into more than one level of the hierarchy, we have classified them based on the lowest-level input that is significant to the determination of the fair value.  
Our cash and cash equivalents consist of various bank accounts used to support our operations and investments in institutional money-market funds that are traded in active markets. We are invested exclusively in AAA-rated, prime institutional money market funds, comprised of high quality, fixed income securities. Our other long-term investments represent the fair value of investments under the Cabot Microelectronics Supplemental Employee Retirement Plan (SERP), which is a nonqualified supplemental savings plan. The fair value of the investments is determined through quoted market prices within actively traded markets. Although the investments are allocated to individual participants and investment decisions are made solely by those participants, the SERP is a nonqualified plan. Consequently, the Company owns the assets and the related offsetting liability for disbursement until a participant makes a qualifying withdrawal. The long-term investment was adjusted to $1,071 in the second quarter of fiscal 2018 to reflect its fair value as of March 31, 2018. 
Goodwill was $102,915 as of March 31, 2018, and $101,932 as of September 30, 2017. The increase in goodwill was due to $1,678 in foreign exchange fluctuations of the New Taiwan dollar, partially offset by a $695 decrease related to the sale of certain ESF assets. As a result of this sale of assets in March 2018, we received net proceeds of $3,249, of which $250 is held in escrow, and recorded a preliminary gain of $956 in other income in the Consolidated Statements of Income. 
In the first quarter of fiscal 2018, we adopted ASU No. 2017-04 "Simplifying the Test for Goodwill Impairment." The provisions of this standard eliminate Step 2 from the goodwill impairment test, which required an entity to determine the fair value of its assets and liabilities at the impairment testing date of its goodwill and compare it to its carrying amount to determine a possible impairment loss. Goodwill impairment testing is now done by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit and its carrying amount. 
Goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets are tested for impairment annually in the fourth quarter of the fiscal year or more frequently if indicators of potential impairment exist, using a fair-value-based approach. The recoverability of goodwill is measured at the reporting unit level, which is defined as either an operating segment or one level below an operating segment. An entity has the option to assess the fair value of a reporting unit either using a qualitative analysis ("step zero") or a quantitative analysis ("step one"). Similarly, an entity has the option to use a step zero or a step one approach to determine the recoverability of indefinite-lived intangible assets. In fiscal 2017, we used a step one analysis for both goodwill impairment and indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment. 
Our ARS investments at March 31, 2018 consisted of two tax exempt municipal debt securities with a total par value of $5,319, both of which have maturities greater than ten years. The fair value of our ARS, determined using Level 2 fair value inputs, was $5,041 as of March 31, 2018. We have classified our ARS as held-to-maturity securities based on our intention and ability to hold the securities until maturity. We believe the gross unrecognized loss of $278 is due to the illiquidity in the ARS market, rather than to credit loss. Although we believe these securities will ultimately be collected in full, we believe that it is not likely that we will be able to monetize the securities in our next business cycle (which for us is generally one year). We will continue to monitor our ARS for impairment indicators, which may require us to record an impairment charge that is deemed other-than-temporary. 
In the first quarter of fiscal 2015, we entered into floating-to-fixed interest rate swap agreements to hedge the variability in LIBOR-based interest payments on $86,406 of our outstanding variable rate debt. The notional amount of the swaps decreases each quarter by an amount in proportion to our scheduled quarterly principal payment of debt. The notional value of the swaps was $68,906 as of March 31, 2018, and the swaps are scheduled to expire on June 27, 2019. 
In September 2017, we entered into two forward foreign exchange contracts in an effort to protect the net investment of our South Korean subsidiary against potential adverse changes resulting from currency fluctuations in the Korean won. We entered into forward contracts to sell Korean won and buy U.S. dollars, settling in September 2022. We have designated these forward contracts as an effective net investment hedge. The total notional amount under the contracts is 100 billion Korean won. For the quarter ended March 31, 2018, the change in the fair value of the forward contracts in the net investment hedge relationship of $2,966 was recorded in foreign currency translation adjustments within Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income. 
The interest rate swap agreements have been deemed to be effective since inception, so there has been no impact on our Consolidated Statements of Income. We recorded a $52 unrealized loss and a $148 unrealized gain, net of tax, in accumulated comprehensive income during the three and six months ended March 31, 2018, respectively, for these interest rate swaps. As of March 31, 2018, during the next 12 months, we expect approximately $413 to be reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive income into interest expense related to our interest rate swaps based on projected rates of the LIBOR forward curve as of March 31, 2018. 
Purchase obligations include take-or-pay arrangements with suppliers, and purchase orders and other obligations entered into in the normal course of business regarding the purchase of goods and services. We have been operating under a fumed silica supply agreement with Cabot Corporation, our former parent company which is not a related party, the current term of which runs through December 2019. This agreement provides us the option to purchase fumed silica, with no minimum purchase requirements as of 2017, for which we have paid a fee of $1,500 in each of calendar years 2017 and 2018, and will pay in 2019. The $1,500 payment due in 2019 is included in accrued expenses on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. As of March 31, 2018, purchase obligations include $5,884 of contractual commitments related to our Cabot Corporation supply agreement for fumed silica. 
We record share-based compensation expense for all share-based awards, including stock option grants, and restricted stock, restricted stock unit and performance share unit ("PSU") awards, and employee stock purchase plan purchases. We calculate share-based compensation expense using the straight-line approach based on awards ultimately expected to vest, which requires the use of an estimated forfeiture rate. Our estimated forfeiture rate is primarily based on historical experience, but may be revised in future periods if actual forfeitures differ from the estimate. We use the Black-Scholes option-pricing model to estimate the grant date fair value of our stock options and employee stock purchase plan purchases. This model requires the input of highly subjective assumptions, including the price volatility of the underlying stock, the expected term of our stock options, expected dividend yield and the risk-free interest rate. We estimate the expected volatility of our stock options based on a combination of our stock's historical volatility and the implied volatilities from actively-traded options on our stock. We calculate the expected term of our stock options using historical stock option exercise data, and for stock option grants made prior to December 2017, we have added a slight premium to this expected term for employees who meet the definition of retirement-eligible pursuant to their stock option grants during the contractual term of the grant. As of December 2017, the provisions of new stock option grants and restricted stock unit awards state that except in certain circumstances including termination for cause, once an employee meets the retirement eligibility requirements, any remaining unvested share-based awards will continue to vest regardless of termination of service. Consequently, the requisite service period for the award is satisfied upon retirement eligibility. Therefore, for those employees who have met the retirement eligibility at the grant date, we now record the total share-based compensation expense upon award; for those employees who will meet the retirement eligibility during the four-year vesting period, we now record the share-based compensation expense over the period from the grant date through the date of retirement eligibility, rather than over the four-year vesting period stated in the award agreement. 
In December 2017, we announced the appointment of Scott D. Beamer as our Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, effective as of January 15, 2018, and the intention of William S. Johnson, the Company's then current Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, to retire. Upon the effective date of Mr. Beamer's appointment, Mr. Johnson resigned as our Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, and now is performing transition responsibilities in a senior advisor role until his retirement date in January 2019 (the "Retirement Date"). Mr. Johnson's currently outstanding non-qualified stock option, restricted stock, and restricted stock unit awards under the OIP remain outstanding in accordance with their terms, which include that he will forfeit any unvested awards as of the Retirement Date. Applying the guidance in ASC 718 "Compensation—Stock Compensation", we recorded $1,744 of related share-based compensation expense in the three months ended December 31, 2017. 
Our effective tax rate was 19.6% and 63.8% for the three and six months ended March 31, 2018, respectively, compared to a 20.8% and 20.5% effective income tax rate for the three and six months ended March 31, 2017. The significant increase in our effective tax rate for the six months ended March 31, 2018 compared to the prior year is primarily driven by discrete adjustments related to recently enacted Tax Act in the United States. Other factors that impacted the Company's effective tax rate for the three and six months ended March 31, 2018 were primarily related to benefits in excess of compensation cost from share based compensation recorded in the income statement (as opposed to equity prior to October 2017) and the absence of benefits of a tax holiday in South Korea, which expired as of October 2017. The Company currently expects its effective tax rate for the remainder quarters to be within the range of 21% to 24%. Previously, before the impact of the Tax Act, the Company had estimated an effective tax rate of 24% to 27% for the full fiscal year. 
Basic earnings per share (EPS) is calculated by dividing net income available to common stockholders by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during the period, excluding the effects of unvested restricted stock awards that have a right to receive non-forfeitable dividends, which are considered participating securities as prescribed by the two-class method under ASC 260 "Earnings per Share". Diluted EPS is calculated in a similar manner, but the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during the period is increased to include the weighted-average dilutive effect of "in-the-money" stock options and unvested restricted stock shares using the treasury stock method.

Revenue for our second quarter of fiscal 2018 was $143.0 million, which represented an increase of 20.0% from the second quarter of fiscal 2017, with revenue in dielectrics slurries and polishing pads product areas increasing 24.0% and 22.6% from the same quarter last year, respectively. Revenue from tungsten slurries increased 16.6% from the same quarter last year. Revenue for the first six month of fiscal 2018 was $283.0 million, which represented an increase of 16.7% from the comparable period of fiscal 2017. 
Gross profit for the second quarter of fiscal 2018 expressed as a percentage of revenue was 52.5%, compared to 50.4% for our second quarter of fiscal 2017, including 90 and 100-basis point of adverse impact of NexPlanar amortization expense, comparatively. Factors affecting our gross profit for the quarter compared to last year included higher sales volume and a higher-valued product mix, partially offset by higher fixed manufacturing costs, including higher incentive compensation expense. Gross profit for the first six months of fiscal 2018 was 52.7% of revenue, compared to 50.1% during the same period last year, which includes 90 and 100-basis points of adverse impact of NexPlanar amortization expense, comparatively. We currently expect our gross profit margin for the full fiscal year 2018 to be between 51% and 53%, an increase from our prior full year guidance range of 50% to 52%. This includes approximately 100 basis points of NexPlanar amortization expense. We may continue to experience fluctuations in our gross profit due to a number of factors, including changes in our product mix and the extent to which we utilize our manufacturing capacity, which may cause our quarterly gross profit to be above or below this annual guidance range. 
The Company reported diluted earnings per share of $1.14 in the second quarter of fiscal 2018, compared to diluted earnings per share of $0.71 in the same quarter last year. The increase was primarily due to higher revenue and a higher gross profit margin, partially offset by higher operating expenses. Diluted earnings per share were $1.02 for the first six months of fiscal 2018, compared to $1.60 during the same period last year. The year-over-year decrease was primarily due to the impact of the enactment of the Tax Act in December 2017, which reduced diluted earnings per share by $1.27.  
Total cost of goods sold was $68.0 million for the three months ended March 31, 2018, which represented an increase of 14.8%, or $8.8 million, from the three months ended March 31, 2017. The increase in cost of goods sold was primarily driven by a $3.4 million increase due to higher sales volume, a $2.3 million increase in fixed manufacturing costs, including higher incentive compensation expense, a $1.5 million increase due to foreign exchange fluctuations, and a $0.9 million increase in other variable manufacturing costs, including material costs. Fixed manufacturing costs included $1.3 million of NexPlanar amortization expense compared to $1.2 million in same period of fiscal 2017. 
Revenue was $283.0 million for the six months ended March 31, 2018, which represented a 16.7%, or $40.5 million, increase from the six months ended March 31, 2017. The increase in revenue was primarily driven by a $27.3 million increase due to higher sales volume, a $14.1 million increase due to product mix, and a $2.3 million increase due to exchange rate fluctuations, partially offset by a $3.2 million decrease due to price changes. Revenue from tungsten slurries, dielectrics slurries and polishing pads increased 15.1%, 16.0%, and 19.6%, respectively, from the comparable period of fiscal 2017. 
Total cost of goods sold was $133.9 million for the six months ended March 31, 2018, which represented an increase of 10.7%, or $13.0 million, from the six months ended March 31, 2017. The increase in cost of goods sold was primarily driven by a $6.1 million increase due to higher sales volume, a $5.3 million increase in fixed manufacturing costs, including higher incentive compensation expense, and a $1.0 million increase due to foreign exchange fluctuations. Fixed manufacturing costs included $2.5 million of NexPlanar amortization expense, compared to $2.4 million in same period of fiscal 2017. 
Total research, development and technical expenses were $25.5 million for the six months ended March 31, 2018, which represented a decrease of 7.2%, or $2.0 million, from the six months ended March 31, 2017. The decrease was primarily due to lower professional expenses of $0.7 million, lower depreciation and amortization expense of $0.6 million, and lower materials and supplies used in research and development of $0.6 million. 
Our effective income tax rate was 63.8% for the six months ended March 31, 2018 compared to 20.5% for the six months ended March 31, 2017. The increase in the effective tax rate during the first six months of fiscal 2018 was primarily due to the one-time unfavorable impact of the Tax Act that occurred in the first quarter of fiscal 2018 and the absence of benefits of a tax holiday in South Korea, which expired as of October 2017, partially offset by the benefit from stock option exercises beginning October 2017.

We conduct business operations outside of the United States through our foreign operations. Some of our foreign operations maintain their accounting records in their local currencies. Consequently, period to period comparability of results of operations is affected by fluctuations in exchange rates. The primary currencies to which we have exposure are the Korean won, Japanese yen, and the New Taiwan dollar. Approximately 25% of our revenue is transacted in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. However, we also incur expenses in foreign countries that are transacted in currencies other than the U.S. dollar, which mitigates the exposure on the Consolidated Statements of Income. We periodically enter into forward contracts in an effort to manage foreign currency exchange exposure on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. However, we are unlikely to be able to hedge these exposures completely. We do not enter into forward contracts or other derivative instruments for speculative or trading purposes.

Because of inherent limitations, our disclosure controls or our internal control over financial reporting may not prevent all errors and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Further, the design of a control system must take into account the benefits of controls relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within the Company have been detected. These inherent limitations include possible faulty judgment in decision-making and breakdowns due to a simple error or mistake. Additionally, controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more people or by management override of the controls. The design of any system of controls also is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions. Over time, controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or the degree of compliance with policies or procedures may deteriorate. Because of the inherent limitations in a cost-effective control system, misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected.

Our business is affected by economic and industry conditions and our revenue is primarily dependent upon semiconductor demand. Historically, semiconductor demand has fluctuated due to economic and industry cycles and seasonal shifts in demand, which can affect our business, causing demand for our products to fluctuate. For example, the strengthening of demand conditions in the semiconductor industry we experienced during the second half of fiscal 2016 through fiscal 2017 continued through our second quarter of fiscal 2018, following relatively soft demand conditions during the second half of fiscal 2015 and the first half of fiscal 2016. Furthermore, competitive dynamics within the semiconductor industry may impact our business. Our limited visibility to future customer orders makes it difficult for us to predict industry trends. If the global economy or the semiconductor industry weakens, whether in general or as a result of specific factors, such as macroeconomic factors, or unpredictable events such as natural disasters or geopolitical events, we could experience material adverse impacts on our results of operations and financial condition. 
Our business is substantially dependent on CMP slurries and pads, which account for the majority of our revenue. Our business would suffer if these products became obsolete or if consumption of these products decreased. Our success depends on our ability to keep pace with technological changes and advances in the semiconductor industry, and to adapt, improve and customize our products for advanced IC applications in response to evolving customer needs and industry trends. Since its inception, the semiconductor industry has experienced technological changes and advances in the design, manufacture, performance and application of IC devices. Our customers continually pursue lower cost of ownership and higher quality and performance of materials consumed in their manufacturing processes, including CMP slurries and pads, as a means to reduce costs, increase the yield in their manufacturing facilities, and achieve desired performance of the IC devices they produce. We expect these technological changes, and this drive toward lower costs, higher quality and performance and higher yields, will continue in the future. Potential technology developments in the semiconductor industry, as well as our customers' efforts to reduce consumption of CMP consumables, including through use of smaller quantities, could render our products less important to the IC device manufacturing process. 
Our CMP consumables customer base is concentrated among a limited number of large customers. Over the past several years, the semiconductor industry has been consolidating as the larger semiconductor manufacturers have generally grown faster than the smaller ones, through business gains, mergers and acquisitions, and strategic alliances. While the pace of consolidation has recently slowed, we believe that consolidation is likely to continue in the future. We have not experienced any notable impact on our sales due to consolidation in the industry. One or more of these principal customers could stop buying CMP consumables from us or could substantially reduce the quantity of CMP consumables purchased from us. Our principal customers also hold considerable purchasing power, which can impact the pricing and terms of sale of our products. Any deferral or significant reduction in the quantity or price of CMP consumables sold to these principal customers could seriously harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.  
We depend on our supply chain to enable us to meet the demands of our customers. Our supply chain includes the raw materials we use to manufacture our products, our production operations and the means by which we deliver our products to our customers. Our business could be adversely affected by any problem or interruption in the supply of the key raw materials we use in our CMP slurries and pads, including raw materials that do not meet the stringent quality and consistency requirements of our customers, any problem or interruption that may occur during production or delivery of our products, such as weather-related problems, natural disasters, or geopolitical, trade, or labor-related issues, or any difficulty in producing sufficient quantities of our products to meet growing demand from our customers. Our supply chain may also be negatively impacted by unanticipated price increases due to supply restrictions beyond the control of our Company or our raw materials suppliers.
