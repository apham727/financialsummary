We have determined that the effect of applying the new revenue standards during the three and six months ended March 31, 2019 was immaterial to our financial statements compared to revenue guidance in effect before the adoption of the new revenue standards. As a result, for the three and six months ended March 31, 2019, we are not disclosing the quantitative amount by which each financial statement line item is affected by the application of the new revenue standards. 
As part of the adoption of ASU 606, the Company elected to use certain allowed practical expedients. For the Company’s contracts that have an original duration of one year or less as of the adoption date, the Company uses the practical expedient applicable to such contracts and does not consider the time value of money. Further, because of the short duration of these contracts, the Company has not disclosed the transaction price for the future performance obligations as of the end of each reporting period for contracts having an expected duration of one year or less. See Note 3 of this Report on Form 10-Q for disaggregated revenue, the reconciliation of contract balances and transaction price allocation to remaining performance obligations for contracts expected to remain effective beyond one year. 
At contract inception, the Company assesses the goods and services promised in its contracts with customers and identifies a performance obligation for each material promise to the customer. A performance obligation is a promise in a contract to transfer a distinct good or service, or a bundle of goods or services, to the customer, and is the unit of accounting under ASC 606. A contract’s transaction price is allocated to each distinct performance obligation and recognized as revenue when, or as, the performance obligation is satisfied. A majority of the Company’s contracts have a single performance obligation which represents, in most cases, the products, equipment or services being sold to the customer. Some contracts include multiple performance obligations including prospective tiered price discounts or delivery of free product that we have concluded represents a material right. Contracts with prospective tiered price discounts require judgment in determining if that discount represents a material right. 
Contracts vary in length and payment terms vary by the type and location of the Company’s customers and the products or services offered. However, the period of time between invoicing and when payment is due is typically not significant and has no significant financing components. Customers pay in accordance with negotiated terms upon receipt of goods or completion of services. For these contracts, the transaction price is determined upon establishment of the contract that contains the final terms of the sale, including the description, quantity, and price of goods or services purchased. In certain instances, we receive consideration from a customer prior to transferring goods or services to the customer under the terms of a sales contract. In such cases, we record deferred revenue until the performance obligation is satisfied, which represents a contract liability, and is included in the contract liabilities discussed in Note 3 of this Form 10-Q. 
The Company recognizes revenue related to product sales at a point in time following the transfer of control of such products to the customer, which generally occurs upon shipment, or delivery depending on the terms of the underlying contracts. The Company considers control to have transferred upon shipment or delivery because the Company has a present right to payment at that time, the customer has legal title to the asset, the Company has transferred physical possession of the asset, and the customer has significant risks and rewards of ownership of the asset. Revenue is recognized on consignment sales when control transfers to the customer, generally at the point of customer usage of the product. The Company also records revenue for services provided to the pipeline and oilfield energy industries. These services include preventive maintenance, repair and specialized isolation sealing on pipelines and training. Revenue is recorded at a point in time when the services are completed as this is when right to payment and customer acceptance occurs. 
The primary type of variable consideration present in the Company’s contracts are rebates and early payment discounts, both of which are immaterial. Early payment discounts are offered on a limited basis and are not significant. The Company also offers rebates based upon cumulative volume of purchases within a quarter and accrues for the rebate obligation within the quarter that the rebate is earned. ASC 606 did not change the accounting for rebates under ASC 605. 
In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-13, "Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments" (Topic 326). The provisions of this standard require financial assets measured at amortized cost to be presented at the net amount expected to be collected. An allowance account would be established to present the net carrying value at the amount expected to be collected. ASU 2016-13 also provides that credit losses relating to available-for-sale debt securities should be recorded through an allowance for credit losses. ASU 2016-13 will be effective for us beginning October 1, 2020, but early adoption is permitted as of October 1, 2019. We are currently evaluating the impact of implementation of this standard on our financial statements. 
In August 2017, the FASB issued ASU No. 2017-12 "Derivatives and Hedging" (Topic 815). The provisions of this standard amend the hedge accounting model in ASC 815 to expand an entity's ability to hedge nonfinancial and financial risk components, reduce complexity in fair value hedges of interest rate risk, eliminate the requirement to separately measure and report hedge ineffectiveness, and generally require the entire change in the fair value of a hedging instrument to be presented in the same income statement line as the hedged item. The guidance also eases certain documentation and assessment requirements and modifies the accounting for components excluded from the assessment of hedge effectiveness. We early adopted this guidance effective January 1, 2019, and we did not have any hedges that existed as of the initial application date. We applied the new guidance to the interest rate swap that we entered into during our second quarter of fiscal 2019. Pursuant to the guidance, we performed initial quantitative hedge effectiveness testing upon the hedge inception, and determined the hedge to be highly effective. Therefore, unrealized changes in fair value are recorded in other comprehensive income. In addition, we reclassify the realized gains and losses out of other comprehensive income, and into interest expense in our Consolidated Statements of Income, which is the same financial statement line as the hedged item. We will perform subsequent assessments of hedge effectiveness qualitatively on a quarterly basis. 
The contract liability balances as of October 1, 2018 in the table above include the amounts recorded upon the adoption of ASC 606. At March 31, 2019, the current portion of contract liabilities of $3,611 is included in accrued liabilities, taxes payable and other current liabilities and the noncurrent portion of $1,414 is included in other long-term liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The amount of revenue recognized during the three and six months ended March 31, 2019 that was included in the opening current contract liability balances in our Performance Materials segment were $2,317 and $4,160, respectively. The amount of revenue recognized during the three and six months ended March 31, 2019 that was included in our opening contract liability balances in our Electronic Materials segment was not material. 
On the Acquisition Date, the Company completed its acquisition of 100% of the outstanding stock of KMG, which was a publicly held company headquartered in Fort Worth, Texas. KMG specializes in producing and distributing electronic chemicals for the semiconductor industry and performance materials for the pipeline, energy, and industrial wood preservation industries. We acquired KMG to extend and strengthen our position as one of the leading suppliers of consumable materials to the semiconductor industry and to expand our portfolio with the addition of KMG’s performance materials business, which we believe will enable us to be a leading global provider of performance products and services to the pipeline operations and energy industries. The purchase consideration was $1,513,235, including consideration transferred of $1,536,452, less cash acquired of $23,217. The consideration was comprised of cash consideration to KMG common shareholders and equity award holders, stock consideration to KMG common shareholders and equity award holders, and cash consideration in the form of the retirement of KMG’s preexisting debt obligations. Under the terms of the definitive agreement to acquire KMG, each share of KMG common stock was converted into the right to receive $55.65 in cash and 0.2000 of a share of Cabot Microelectronics common stock. As a result, we issued 3,237,005 shares of our common stock to KMG’s common stockholders, with a stock price of $102.27 on the Acquisition Date. In connection with the Acquisition, we entered into a credit agreement (the “Credit Agreement”), which provided us with a seven-year, $1,065,000 term loan facility (the “Term Loan Facility”), which we drew on the Acquisition Date to fund the Acquisition along with cash on hand, and a five-year, $200,000 revolving credit facility (the “Revolving Credit Facility”), which has not been drawn. In connection with the borrowing, we incurred $21,408 in debt issuance costs and original issue discount fees, $859 of which relates to the Revolving Credit Facility and is recorded as a prepaid asset, and the remaining $20,549 in debt issuance costs relates to the Term Loan Facility and is presented as a reduction of long-term debt. These debt issuance costs are amortized and recorded in Interest expense in the Consolidated Statements of Income over the life of the Revolving Credit Facility and Term Loan Facility, respectively. See below for a summary of the different components that comprise the total consideration. 
The fair values of identifiable assets and liabilities acquired were developed with the assistance of a third-party valuation firm. The fair value of acquired property, plant and equipment is primarily valued at its “value-in-use.” The fair value of acquired identifiable intangible assets was determined using the “income approach” on an individual asset basis. The key assumptions used in the calculation of the discounted cash flows include projected revenue, gross margin, operating expenses, discount rate and customer attrition. The valuations and the underlying assumptions have been deemed reasonable by the Company’s management. There are inherent uncertainties and management judgment required in these determinations. 
Customer relationships represent the estimated fair value of the underlying relationships and agreements with KMG’s customers and are being amortized on an accelerated basis in order for the expense to most accurately match the periods of highest cash flows attributable to the identified relationships. Technology and know-how represent the estimated fair value of KMG’s technology, processes and knowledge regarding its product offerings, and are being amortized on a straight-line basis. Trade names represents the estimated fair value of the brand and name recognition associated with the marketing of KMG’s product offerings and are being amortized on a straight-line basis, except for the Flowchem trade name, which we believe has an indefinite life. These intangible assets are capitalized and accounted for as indefinite-lived intangible assets and will be subject to impairment testing. The intangible assets subject to amortization have a weighted average useful life of 17.9 years. 
The excess of consideration transferred over the fair value of net assets acquired was recorded as goodwill, and is not deductible for income tax purposes. The goodwill is primarily attributable to anticipated revenue growth from the combined company product portfolio, expected synergies of the combined company, and the assembled workforce of KMG. The preliminary allocation of goodwill to each of the Electronic Materials and Performance Materials segments as a result of this Acquisition was $262,746 and $342,073, respectively. 
KMG’s results of operations have been included in our unaudited Consolidated Statements of Income and Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income from the Acquisition Date. Net sales of the acquired KMG business since the Acquisition Date through March 31, 2019 were $185,127. KMG’s net loss since the Acquisition Date was $5,561, which includes $19,996 of acquisition related costs and a $14,827 charge for fair value write-up of inventory sold. Further, additional amortization and depreciation expense associated with recording KMG’s net assets at fair value decreased KMG’s net income post-Acquisition. 
The historical financial information has been adjusted by applying the Company’s accounting policies and giving effect to the pro forma adjustments, which consist of (i) amortization expense associated with identified intangible assets; (ii) depreciation of fixed asset step-up; (iii) accretion of inventory step-up value; (iv) the elimination of interest expense on pre-acquisition KMG debt and replacement of interest expense related to the acquisition-related financing; (v) transaction-related costs; (vi) accelerated share-based compensation expense; (vii) retention and severance expense incurred as a direct result of the acquisition; and (viii) an adjustment to tax-effect the aforementioned unaudited pro forma adjustments using an estimated weighted-average effective income tax rate of each entity and the jurisdictions to which the above adjustments relate. The pro forma consolidated results are not necessarily indicative of what the consolidated results actually would have been had the Acquisition been completed on October 1, 2017. The pro forma consolidated results do not purport to project future results of combined operations, nor do they reflect the expected realization of any revenue or cost synergies associated with the Acquisition.

In the Electronic Materials segment, our CMP slurries revenue declined this quarter due primarily to softer market conditions, particularly in the memory, but also in the foundry, sectors. Our CMP slurries play a critical role in enabling DRAM and NAND production and this quarter our business was adversely impacted as our customers reduced utilization rates to address higher chip inventories and falling memory prices. In CMP pads, we delivered another quarter of strong results. In electronic chemicals, we saw stable demand this quarter. Looking ahead, recent reports from customers and industry analysts suggest there is still some level of uncertainty in overall semiconductor industry demand given the weakness in certain end markets, but most believe there will be some level of recovery in the second half of calendar 2019. We remain confident about growth in our business from increased future demand for global semiconductor materials, and believe we will continue to benefit from increased device complexity and growing computing power and storage requirements, which translates to additional demand for consumable materials. 
Net income was $27.1 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2019, which represented a decrease of 8.7% from the same quarter of fiscal 2018. Results benefited from the acquisition of KMG, but were more than offset by acquisition-related expenses, a charge for the fair value write-up of acquired inventory sold, increased amortization and depreciation associated with re-valuing KMG assets to fair value, and higher interest expenses resulting from the debt borrowing to finance the Acquisition. For the same reasons, diluted earnings per share decreased from $1.14 in the second quarter of fiscal 2018 to $0.92 in the current quarter.  
Adjusted EBITDA was $85.5 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2019. This represents an increase of $41.9 million, or a 96.0% increase from the same quarter of fiscal 2018. Adjusted EBITDA benefited from the addition of the KMG businesses and improved profitability in the Company’s heritage businesses. Refer to the “Use of certain GAAP and Non-GAAP Financial Information” section below for the calculation of adjusted EBITDA. Adjusted EBITDA margin, which represents adjusted EBITDA as a percentage of revenue, was 32.2% for the second quarter of fiscal 2019, compared to 30.5% for the same quarter of fiscal 2018. 
Revenue was $265.4 million for the three months ended March 31, 2019, which represented an 85.6%, or $122.4 million, increase from the three months ended March 31, 2018, primarily due to the Acquisition. Revenue from Cabot Microelectronics’ heritage businesses decreased slightly by $0.7 million, or 0.5%, primarily due to lower sales volume, partially offset by a higher value product mix and price changes. 
Total cost of sales was $150.6 million for the three months ended March 31, 2019, which represented an increase of 121.6%, or $82.6 million, from the three months ended March 31, 2018, primarily due to the Acquisition. The cost of sales from Cabot Microelectronics’ heritage businesses decreased by $3.2 million, primarily driven by lower sales volume. 
Total research, development and technical expenses were $12.8 million for the three months ended March 31, 2019, which represented a decrease of 4.4%, or $0.6 million, from the three months ended March 31, 2018. The decrease was primarily due to lower staffing-related costs of $0.9 million, including incentive compensation costs. 
 Net income was $27.1 million for the three months ended March 31, 2019, which represented a decrease of 8.7%, or $2.6 million, from the three months ended March 31, 2018. Net income benefited from the addition of the KMG businesses, and was partially offset by acquisition and integration-related expenses, a charge for fair value write-up of acquired inventory sold, increased amortization and depreciation associated with re-valuing KMG assets to fair value, and higher interest expenses resulting from the debt borrowing to finance the Acquisition.  
Revenue was $487.2 million for the six months ended March 31, 2019, which represented a 72.2%, or $204.2 million increase from the six months ended March 31, 2018. The increase in revenue was primarily due to the Acquisition. Revenue from Cabot Microelectronics’ heritage businesses increased by $19.1 million, or 6.7%. This increase was primarily driven by a higher value product mix, selected price increases and higher sales volume. 
Total cost of sales was $273.0 million for the six months ended March 31, 2019, which represented an increase of 103.9%, or $139.1 million, from the six months ended March 31, 2018. The increase in cost of sales was primarily due to the Acquisition. Cost of sales of Cabot Microelectronics’ heritage businesses was relatively flat compared to the same period last year, as the higher costs associated with higher sales volume was offset by lower per unit costs. 
Total research, development and technical expenses were $26.8 million for the six months ended March 31, 2019, which represented an increase of 5.1%, or $1.3 million, from the six months ended March 31, 2018. The increase was primarily due to higher supplies and equipment costs used in research and development of $1.1 million.

Although our product offerings have expanded with the acquisition of KMG, our business remains substantially dependent on products in our Electronic Materials segment, such as CMP slurries, pads and electronic chemicals, which account for the majority of our revenue. We have identified our Performance Materials segment as another area of potential continued growth and the product offerings in our Performance Materials segment are similarly concentrated. As such, our business would suffer if these products became obsolete or if consumption of these products decreased. Our success depends on our ability to keep pace with technological changes and advances in the industries in which we operate, particularly the semiconductor industry, and to adapt, improve and customize our products in response to evolving customer needs and industry trends. Since its inception, the semiconductor industry, which is the largest industry in which we operate, has experienced technological changes and advances in the design, manufacture, performance and application of IC devices. Our customers continually pursue lower cost of ownership and higher quality and performance of materials consumed in their manufacturing processes, including CMP slurries and pads and electronic chemicals, as a means to reduce costs, increase the yield in their manufacturing facilities, and achieve desired performance of the IC devices they produce. We expect these technological changes, and this drive toward lower costs, higher quality and performance and higher yields, will continue in the future. Potential technology developments in the semiconductor industry, as well as our customers' efforts to reduce consumption of CMP consumables, including through use of smaller quantities, could render our products less important to the IC device manufacturing process. 
Our customer base is concentrated among a limited number of large customers in each of our segments. Currently, our principal business is to supply electronic materials primarily to the semiconductor industry. The semiconductor industry has been consolidating as the larger semiconductor manufacturers have generally grown faster than the smaller ones, through business gains, mergers and acquisitions, and strategic alliances. Industry analysts predict that this trend will continue, which means the semiconductor industry will be comprised of fewer and larger participants in the future if their prediction is correct. In addition, our customer base in our pipeline-related businesses is also somewhat concentrated, with large entities predominant, and outside of the United States, these entities frequently are state-owned or sponsored and limited in number per country, as described more above. One or more of these principal customers could stop buying products from us or could substantially reduce the quantity of products purchased from us. Our principal customers also hold considerable purchasing power, which can impact the pricing and terms of sale of our products. Any deferral or significant reduction in the quantity or price of products sold to these principal customers could seriously harm our business, financial condition and results of operations. 
We depend on our supply chain to enable us to meet the demands of our customers. Our supply chain includes the raw materials we use to manufacture our products, our production operations and the means by which we deliver our products to our customers. Our business could be adversely affected by any problem or interruption in the supply of the key raw materials we use in our products, including raw materials that do not meet the stringent quality and consistency requirements of our customers, any problem or interruption that may occur during production or delivery of our products, such as weather-related problems, natural disasters, or geopolitical, trade or labor-related issues, or any difficulty in producing sufficient quantities of our products to meet growing demand from our customers. In particular, severe weather conditions have the potential to adversely affect our operations, damage facilities and increase our costs, and those conditions may also have an indirect effect on our operations by disrupting services provided by service companies or suppliers with whom we have a business relationship. Additionally, some of our full-time employees are represented by labor unions, workers councils or comparable organizations, particularly in Mexico and Europe. As our current agreements expire, we cannot assure you that new agreements will be reached at the end of each period without union action, or that a new agreement will be reached on terms satisfactory to us. An extended work stoppage, slowdown or other action by our employees could significantly disrupt our business. Future labor contracts may be on terms that result in higher labor costs to us, which also could adversely affect our results of operations. Our supply chain may also be negatively impacted by unanticipated price increases due to supply restrictions beyond the control of our Company or our raw materials suppliers. 
In particular, China is a fast-developing market for the semiconductor industry, and is an area of potential continued growth for us. As business volume between China and the rest of the world continues to grow, there is risk that geopolitical, regulatory, trade and political matters could adversely affect business for companies like ours based on the complex relationships among China, the United States, and other countries in the Asia Pacific region, which could have a material adverse impact on our business. In addition, there are risks that the Chinese government may, among other things, require the use of local suppliers, compel companies that do business in China to partner with local companies to conduct business, and, provide incentives to government-backed local customers to buy from local suppliers rather than companies like ours, all of which could adversely impact our business, including our results of operations.
