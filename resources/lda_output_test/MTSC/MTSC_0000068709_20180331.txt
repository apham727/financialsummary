The aforementioned revenue standards and amendments are required to be adopted for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within that annual period, which is our fiscal year 2019. The new standards and amendments may be adopted retrospectively for all periods presented, or adopted using a modified retrospective approach. Early adoption is permitted for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016, and interim periods within that annual period, which is our fiscal year 2018. We intend to adopt the aforementioned revenue standards and amendments for our fiscal year 2019. We currently anticipate utilizing the modified retrospective approach as our method of adoption. We have substantially completed our review and analysis of our sales channels, selected contracts, policies and practices as compared to the new guidance and continue to work through implementation steps. We continue to evaluate our procedural and related system requirements related to the provisions of this standard. We are updating and rewriting our revenue recognition accounting policy as needed to reflect the requirements of this standard. In fiscal year 2018, we expect to draft our new revenue disclosures. We anticipate the revenue recognition methodology may change for certain products and contracts. Certain contracts may have a delay in revenue recognition until the customer takes control of the product, while certain products and contracts may accelerate revenue recognition to recognize revenue over the life of the contract. This change may have a material impact on the timing of revenue recognition in our Test segment. We continue to evaluate the impact that these changes in methodology will have on our consolidated financial statements.
In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02, Leases (Topic 824), which requires lessees to recognize a right-of-use asset, representing the right to use the underlying asset for the lease term, and a lease liability on the balance sheet for all leases with terms greater than 12 months. Lessees can forgo recognizing a right-of-use asset and lease liability with lease terms of 12 months or less on the balance sheet through accounting policy elections as long as the lease does not include options to purchase the underlying assets that are reasonably certain to be exercised. The new guidance also requires certain qualitative and quantitative disclosures designed to assess the amount, timing and uncertainty of cash flows arising from leases, along with additional key information about leasing arrangements. The standard is required to be adopted for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within that annual period, which is our fiscal year 2020. The amendment is to be applied using either a modified retrospective approach, which includes a number of optional practical expedients, with early adoption permitted. We are currently evaluating the impact the adoption of this guidance will have on our financial condition, results of operations and disclosures.
In October 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-16, Income Taxes (Topic 740), Intra-Entity Transfers of Assets Other Than Inventory, which requires companies to account for the income tax effects of intercompany sales and transfers of assets other than inventory when the transfer occurs. Current guidance requires companies to defer the income tax effects of intercompany transfers of assets until the asset has been sold to an outside party or otherwise recognized. The standard is required to be adopted for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within that annual period, which is our fiscal year 2019. The amendment is to be applied using a modified retrospective approach. Early adoption is permitted as of the beginning of an annual period. We are currently evaluating the impact, if any, the adoption of this guidance will have on our financial condition, results of operations and disclosures.
Sales of our products and systems are subject to limited warranty obligations that are included in customer contracts. For sales that include installation services, warranty obligations generally extend for a period of 12 to 24 months from the date of either shipment or acceptance based on the contract terms. Product obligations generally extend for a period of 12 to 24 months from the date of purchase. Certain products offered in our Sensors segment include a lifetime warranty. 
Assets held under capital leases, consisting of machinery and equipment, are recorded at the present value of minimum lease payments and are amortized on a straight-line basis over the estimated life of the asset or the lease term. Amortization of assets held as capital leases is included in depreciation expense in the Consolidated Statements of Income. 
2 The fair value of the tranche B term loan is based on the most recently quoted market price for the outstanding debt instrument, adjusted for any known significant deviations in value. The estimated fair value of the debt obligation is not necessarily indicative of the amount that would be realized in a current market exchange. See Note 8 for additional information on debt instruments.
Currency exchange contracts utilized to maintain the functional currency value of expected financial transactions denominated in foreign currencies are designated as cash flow hedges. Qualifying gains and losses related to changes in the market value of these contracts are reported as a component of AOCI within shareholders' equity in the Consolidated Balance Sheets and reclassified into earnings in the same period during which the underlying hedged transaction affects earnings. The effective portion of the cash flow hedges represents the change in fair value of the hedge that offsets the change in the functional currency value of the hedged item. We periodically assess whether our currency exchange contracts are effective and, when a 
contract is determined to be no longer effective as a hedge, we discontinue hedge accounting prospectively. Subsequent changes in the market value of ineffective currency exchange contracts are recognized as an increase or decrease in revenue in the Consolidated Statements of Income as that is the same line item in which the underlying hedged transaction is reported. 
As of March 31, 2018 and September 30, 2017, we had outstanding cash flow hedge currency exchange contracts with gross notional U.S. dollar equivalent amounts of $47,269 and $29,136, respectively. Upon netting offsetting contracts to sell foreign currencies against contracts to purchase foreign currencies, irrespective of contract maturity dates, the net notional U.S. dollar equivalent amount of contracts outstanding was $43,576 and $24,093 as of March 31, 2018 and September 30, 2017, respectively. As of March 31, 2018, the net market value of the foreign currency exchange contracts was a net liability of $1,338, consisting of $94 in assets and $1,432 in liabilities. As of September 30, 2017, the net market value of the foreign currency exchange contracts was a net liability of $478, consisting of $73 in assets and $551 in liabilities.
The amount recognized in earnings as a result of the ineffectiveness of cash flow hedges was $4 and $5 in the three and six months ended March 31, 2018, respectively, and $6 and $7 in the three and six months ended April 1, 2017, respectively. As of March 31, 2018, the amount projected to be reclassified from AOCI into earnings in the next 12 months was a net loss of $1,001. The maximum remaining maturity of any forward or optional contract as of March 31, 2018 was 1.9 years.
counterparty banks to sell foreign currencies against contracts to purchase foreign currencies, irrespective of contract maturity dates, the net notional U.S. dollar equivalent amount of contracts outstanding as of March 31, 2018 and September 30, 2017 was $18,150 and $14,762, respectively. As of March 31, 2018 and September 30, 2017, the net market value of the foreign exchange balance sheet derivative contracts was a net liability of $235 and a net asset of $77, respectively. 
The primary categories of borrowing include Alternate Base Rate (ABR) Borrowing (ABR Term Loans and ABR Revolving Loans), Swingline Loans and Eurocurrency Borrowing (each as defined in the Credit Agreement). ABR Borrowings and Swingline Loans made in U.S. dollars under the Credit Agreement bear interest at a rate per annum equal to the ABR plus the Applicable Rate (as defined in the Credit Agreement). The ABR is defined as the greater of (a) the Prime Rate (as defined in the Credit Agreement) in effect on such day, (b) the New York Federal Reserve Bank (NYFRB) rate (as defined in the Credit Agreement) in effect on such day plus Â½ of 1.00%, or (c) the Adjusted LIBOR (as defined in the Credit Agreement) for a one-month interest period in dollars on such day plus 1.00%. The ABR for ABR Term Loans shall not be less than 1.75% per 
As of March 31, 2018 and September 30, 2017, there were no outstanding borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility. We had outstanding letters of credit drawn from the Revolving Credit Facility totaling $27,828 and $37,811 as of March 31, 2018 and September 30, 2017, respectively, leaving approximately $92,172 and $82,189, respectively, of unused borrowing capacity. Commitment fees are payable on the unused portion of the Revolving Credit Facility at rates between 0.25% and 0.40% based on our leverage ratio. During the three and six months ended March 31, 2018, commitment fees incurred totaled $77 and $156, respectively. During the three and six months ended April 1, 2017, commitment fees incurred totaled $114 and $215, respectively. 
The Credit Agreement governing the Term Facility requires us to prepay outstanding term loans, subject to certain exceptions, depending on the leverage ratio with (a) up to 50% of the Company's annual Excess Cash Flow (as defined in the Credit Agreement) and (b) 100% of the net cash proceeds of (i) certain asset sales and casualty and condemnation events, subject to reinvestment rights and certain other exceptions; and (ii) any incurrence or issuance of certain debt, other than debt permitted under the Credit Agreement. We may voluntarily prepay outstanding loans under the Term Facility at any time without premium or penalty. All obligations under the Credit Agreement are unconditionally guaranteed by certain of the Company's existing wholly owned domestic subsidiaries, and are secured, subject to certain exceptions, by substantially all of the Company's assets and the assets of the Company's subsidiary guarantors. 
Under the Credit Agreement, we are subject to customary affirmative and negative covenants, including, among others, restrictions on our ability to incur debt, create liens, dispose of assets, make investments, loans, advances, guarantees, and acquisitions, enter into transactions with affiliates, and enter into any restrictive agreements and customary events of default (including payment defaults, covenant defaults, change of control defaults and bankruptcy defaults). The Credit Agreement also contains financial covenants, including the ratio of consolidated total indebtedness to adjusted consolidated earnings before income, taxes, depreciation and amortization (Adjusted EBITDA), as defined in the Credit Agreement, as well as the ratio of Adjusted EBITDA to consolidated interest expense. These covenants restrict our ability to purchase outstanding shares of our common stock. As of March 31, 2018 and September 30, 2017, we were in compliance with these financial covenants.

During the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2017, we initiated a series of Test workforce reductions and facility closures intended to increase organizational effectiveness, gain manufacturing efficiencies and provide cost savings that can be reinvested in our growth initiatives. These actions include the transfer of certain production operations in China to a contract manufacturing partner in fiscal year 2018. As a result, in the three and six months ended March 31, 2018, we recorded $321 and $414 of pre-tax severance and related expense, respectively, and $25 and $187 of pre-tax facility closure costs, respectively. See Note 16 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 1 of Part I of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for further discussion of restructuring initiatives.
See Note 16 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 1 of Part I of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for additional information on restructuring and related costs. In the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2016, we completed the acquisition of PCB Group, Inc. (PCB). As a result of the PCB acquisition, we incurred certain non-recurring costs during fiscal year 2017 including acquisition integration costs and a fair value adjustment on acquired PCB inventory (PCB acquisition inventory adjustment).
Revenue for the three and six months ended March 31, 2018 declined 1.1% and 1.8%, respectively, primarily driven by lower Test revenue, partially offset by growth in our Sensors business and the favorable impact of currency translation. Test revenue decreased $13,602 and $26,525, respectively, primarily driven by a decline in equipment volume resulting from lower trailing 12-month order volume in the ground vehicles sector that continues to operate in a rapidly changing environment. Current year Test revenue was also impacted by higher custom project backlog weighting which takes longer to convert to revenue. Sensors revenue increased $11,958 and $19,764, respectively, primarily driven by continued momentum from new opportunities in the Sensors test sector, along with continued growth in the Sensors position sector and broad demand across the remaining Sensors sectors. Excluding the impact of currency translation, revenue decreased 6.0% and 5.3%, respectively.
Gross profit for the six months ended March 31, 2018 increased 0.3% primarily driven by to the prior year impact of the PCB acquisition inventory adjustment of $7,724 and increased Sensors revenue volume, partially offset by reduced Test revenue volume. Gross margin rate increased 0.8 percentage points primarily due to the prior year impact from the PCB acquisition inventory adjustment and leverage on increased Sensors revenue volume, partially offset by the lower contribution from 
General and administrative expense for the three and six months ended March 31, 2018 declined 19.4% and 16.9%, respectively, primarily due to prior year China investigation expenses of $6,169 and $8,145, respectively, and prior year PCB acquisition integration expenses of $506 and $2,009, respectively, partially offset by an increase in professional fees, the unfavorable impact of currency translation, and higher bad debt expense in Test. Excluding the impact of currency translation, prior year PCB acquisition integration expenses, prior year China investigation expenses, and restructuring costs incurred in both fiscal years, general and administrative expense increased 9.6% and 3.8%, respectively.
Income from operations for the three months ended March 31, 2018 increased 7.8% primarily due to prior year China investigation expenses of $6,759 and leverage on volume growth in Sensors, partially offset by the lower gross margin contribution from product mix, unfavorable leverage on lower Test revenue volume and the impact of higher warranty expense. Excluding the impact of currency translation, prior year non-recurring PCB acquisition integration expenses, prior year China investigation expenses, and restructuring costs incurred in both fiscal years, income from operations decreased 31.7%.
Selling and marketing expense for the three and six months ended March 31, 2018 declined 8.0% and 2.0%, respectively, primarily due to a decrease in commission expense and prior year China investigation expenses, partially offset by the unfavorable impact of currency translation. Excluding the impact of currency translation and prior year China investigation expenses, selling and marketing expense decreased 9.3% and 3.8%, respectively.
General and administrative expense for the three and six months ended March 31, 2018 declined 31.5% and 23.7%, respectively, primarily due to prior year China investigation expenses of $6,169 and $8,145, respectively. The decrease was partially offset by higher bad debt expense and the unfavorable impact of currency translation. Excluding the impact of currency translation, prior year China investigation expenses, and current year restructuring costs, general and administrative expense increased 8.6% and 3.2%, respectively.

Approximately 70% of our revenue has historically been derived from customers outside of the U.S. Our international subsidiaries have functional currencies other than our U.S. dollar reporting currency and, occasionally, transact business in currencies other than their functional currencies. These non-functional currency transactions expose us to market risk on assets, liabilities and cash flows recognized on these transactions.

On March 13, 2018, we announced workforce reductions and manufacturing facility closures in our Test segment corresponding to the transfer of certain production operations in China to a contract manufacturing partner. These changes are designed to increase organizational effectiveness, gain manufacturing efficiencies and provide cost savings that can be reinvested in growth initiatives. We can make no assurances that our current estimates of costs and timing of this restructuring action will be accurate or that additional costs will not be incurred as we continue the restructuring action. Any differences from our current estimates could be material and could adversely impact our business, financial condition and results of operations through delays in our timeline or increased costs. For further information on restructuring actions, see Note 16 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 1 of Part I of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. 
We purchase common stock from time-to-time to mitigate dilution related to new shares issued as equity for employee compensation such as stock options, restricted stock units, performance restricted stock units and employee stock purchase plan activity, as well as to return to shareholders capital not immediately required to fund ongoing operations.
