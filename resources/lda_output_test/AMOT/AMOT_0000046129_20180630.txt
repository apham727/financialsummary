We have foreign operations in The Netherlands, Sweden, Germany, China, Portugal, Canada and Mexico, which expose the Company to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations due to transactions denominated in Euros, Swedish Krona, Chinese Renminbi, Canadian dollar and Mexican pesos, respectively.
For the six months ended June 30, 2018 we estimate that foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations increased sales by $6,300 compared to the six months ended June 30, 2017.
The net effect of these translation adjustments is recorded in the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements as Comprehensive Income.
Net foreign currency transaction gains and losses included in other income, net amounted to a gain of $294 and a loss of $87 for the second quarter of 2018 and 2017, respectively.
For the six months ended June 30, 2018 and 2017, net foreign currency transaction gains and losses included in other income, net were a gain of $156 and a loss of $153, respectively.
A hypothetical 10% change in the value of the U.S. dollar in relation to our most significant foreign currency net assets would have had an impact of approximately $7,470 on our foreign net assets as of June 30, 2018.
