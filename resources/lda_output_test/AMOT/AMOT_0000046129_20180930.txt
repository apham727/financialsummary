The Company believes EBITDA is often a useful measure of a Companys operating performance and is a significant basis used by the Companys management to measure the operating performance of the Companys business because EBITDA excludes charges for depreciation, amortization and interest expense that have resulted from our debt financings, as well as our provision for income tax expense. EBITDA is frequently used as one of the bases for comparing businesses in the Companys industry. 
The Company also believes that Adjusted EBITDA provides helpful information about the operating performance of its business. Adjusted EBITDA excludes stock compensation expense, as well as certain income or expenses which are not indicative of the ongoing performance of the Company. EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA do not represent and should not be considered as an alternative to net income, operating income, net cash provided by operating activities or any other measure for determining operating performance or liquidity that is calculated in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.

We translate all assets and liabilities of our foreign operations, where the U.S. dollar is not the functional currency, at the period-end exchange rate and translate sales and expenses at the average exchange rates in effect during the period. The net effect of these translation adjustments is recorded in the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements as Comprehensive Income. The translation adjustment was a loss of approximately $300 and a gain of approximately $1,800 for the third quarter of 2018 and 2017, respectively. For the nine months ended September 30, 2018 and 2017, the translation adjustment was a loss of approximately $2,100 and a gain of approximately $5,600, respectively. Translation adjustments are not adjusted for income taxes as they relate to permanent investments in our foreign subsidiaries. Net foreign currency transaction gains and losses included in other income, net amounted to approximately a gain of $20 and a loss of $100 for the third quarter of 2018 and 2017, respectively. For the nine months ended September 30, 2018 and 2017, net foreign currency transaction gains and losses included in other income, net were approximately a gain of $200 and a loss of $300, respectively.
