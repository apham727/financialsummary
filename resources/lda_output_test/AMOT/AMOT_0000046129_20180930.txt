The Company believes EBITDA is often a useful measure of a Companys operating performance and is a significant basis used by the Companys management to measure the operating performance of the Companys business because EBITDA excludes charges for depreciation, amortization and interest expense that have resulted from our debt financings, as well as our provision for income tax expense.
EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA do not represent and should not be considered as an alternative to net income, operating income, net cash provided by operating activities or any other measure for determining operating performance or liquidity that is calculated in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.
The cash generated by the increase in net income in 2018 is offset by increases in working capital needs due to the Maval OE Steering business acquisition and significant organic growth.We have foreign operations in The Netherlands, Sweden, Germany, China, Portugal, Czech Republic, Canada and Mexico, which expose the Company to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations due to transactions denominated in Euros, Swedish Krona, Chinese Renminbi, Czech Krona, Canadian dollar and Mexican pesos, respectively.
We estimate that foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations during the quarter ended September 30, 2018 decreased sales in comparison to quarter ended September 30, 2017 by approximately $700.
For the nine months ended September 30, 2018 we estimate that foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations increased sales by approximately $5,500 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2017.
A hypothetical 10% change in the value of the U.S. dollar in relation to our most significant foreign currency net assets would have had an impact of approximately $6,100 on our foreign net assets as of September 30, 2018.Our management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer (principal accounting officer), evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act)) as of September 30, 2018.
