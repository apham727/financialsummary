The accompanying unaudited consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with United States Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (“GAAP”) for interim financial information and the instructions to Form 10-Q and Article 10 of Regulation S-X. Accordingly, they do not include all the information and notes required by GAAP for complete financial statements. 
Effective June 3, 2018, the Company adopted the standard using the modified retrospective method to all contracts. As a result, financial information for the reporting period beginning June 3, 2018 was reported under the new standard, while comparative financial information has not been adjusted and continues to be reported in accordance with the previous standard. The adoption of this standard did not impact the timing of revenue recognition for our customer sales. The adoption did not result in the recognition of a cumulative adjustment to beginning retained earnings, nor did it have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements. For the Company, the most significant impact of the new standard is the addition of required disclosures within the notes to the financial statements. 
During the fourth quarter of each fiscal year, our goodwill balances are reviewed for impairment using the first day of our fourth quarter as the measurement date. If after reviewing the totality of events or circumstances, we determine that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount, then we test for impairment through the application of a fair value based test. We estimate the fair value of each of our reporting units based on projected future operating results, market approach and discounted cash flows.  
Intangible assets are initially recorded at their fair market values determined on quoted market prices in active markets, if available, or recognized valuation models. Intangible assets that have finite useful lives are amortized over their useful lives either on a straight-line basis or over their projected future cash flows and are tested for impairment when events or changes in circumstances occur that indicate possible impairment. Our intangible assets represent the fair value for trade name, customer relationships, non-compete agreements and technology acquired in connection with our acquisitions. 
The Company recognizes services revenue when the repair, installation or training is performed. Based on our analysis of services revenue, ASU 2014-09 has an immaterial impact on the timing, amount or characterization of services revenue recognized by the Company. The services we provide are relatively short in duration, typically completed in one to two weeks, thus, at each reporting date, the amount of unbilled work performed is insignificant. The services revenue has consistently accounted for less than 5% of the Company’s total revenues and is expected to continue at that level. 
A contract is an agreement between two or more parties that creates enforceable rights and obligations. A revenue contract exists for us once a customer purchase order is received, reviewed and accepted. Prior to accepting a customer purchase order, we review the credit worthiness of the customer. Purchase orders are deemed to meet the collectability criterion once the customer’s credit is approved. Contract assets arise when the Company transfers a good or performs a service in advance of receiving consideration from the customer and contract liabilities arise when the Company receives consideration from its customer in advance of performance. 
The transaction price for each product is the amount invoiced to the customer. Each product on a purchase order is a separate performance obligation with an observable standalone selling price. The transaction price is a fixed price per unit, except for the variable consideration. The Company elects to exclude sales tax from the transaction price. With the exception of sale with right of return, variable consideration has been identified only in the form of customer early payment discounts, which are immaterial to the Company’s financial statements. Although there is not a material impact on our financial statements, we will continue to account for customer discounts when they are taken by the customer and address further if they grow. 
We recognize revenue when title transfers to the customer, at the shipping point for FOB shipping contracts and at the customer’s delivery location for FOB destination contracts. We believe that the transfer of title best represents when the customer obtains control of the goods. Prior to that date, we do not have right to payment, and the significant risks and rewards remain with us. The significant risks and rewards of ownership of the inventory transfer simultaneously with the transfer of title. The customer’s acceptance of the goods is based on objective measurements, not subjective. 
The Company maintains a reserve for returns based on historical trends that covers all contracts and revenue streams using the expected value method because we have a large number of contracts with similar characteristics, which is considered variable consideration. The reserve for returns creates a refund liability on our balance sheet as a contra Trade Accounts Receivable as well as an asset in inventory. We value the inventory at cost due to there being minimal or no costs to the Company as we generally require the customer to pay freight and we typically do not have costs associated with activities such as relabeling or repackaging.  
All warranties are considered assurance warranties in that the goods are warranted to work as intended for the period covered. For products the Company does not offer a warranty, these products are covered by our suppliers. We generally offer a one to three year warranty that assures that the goods will perform as intended. The length of the warranty is typical to the industry and generally follows our supplier’s warranty period. This is due to that, in most instances, the Company’s warranty is not utilized due to our supplier’s warranty still covers the necessary repairs or replacements. We also offer a thirty-day assurance warranty on parts sales that parts will work as intended. See Note 7, Warranties, for further information regarding the impact of warranties concerning ASU 2014-09. 
We estimate the cost to perform under the warranty obligation and recognize this estimated cost at the time of the related product sale. We record expense related to our warranty obligations as cost of sales in our consolidated statements of comprehensive (loss) income. Each quarter, we assess actual warranty costs incurred on a product-by-product basis and compare the warranty costs to our estimated warranty obligation. With respect to new products, estimates are based generally on knowledge of the products, the extended warranty period and warranty experience. 
Warranty reserves are established for costs that are expected to be incurred after the sale and delivery of products under warranty. Warranty reserves are included in accrued liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets. The warranty reserves are determined based on known product failures, historical experience and other available evidence. Warranty reserves were approximately $0.2 million as of December 1, 2018 and $0.1 million as of June 2, 2018. 
The new standard is effective for the Company on June 2, 2019, with early adoption permitted. We expect to adopt the new standard on its effective date. A modified retrospective transition approach is required, applying the new standard to all leases existing at the date of initial application. We are in the process of evaluating the impact that the new standard will have on the consolidated financial statements. We expect that this standard will have a material effect on our financial statements. While we continue to assess all of the effects of adoption, we are unable to quantify the impact at this time. We currently believe the most significant effects relate to the recognition of new ROU assets and lease liabilities on our balance sheet for our operating leases and providing significant new disclosures about our leasing activities. We do not expect a significant change in our leasing activities between now and adoption.
