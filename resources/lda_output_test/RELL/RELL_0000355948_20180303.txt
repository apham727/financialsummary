During the fourth quarter of each fiscal year, our goodwill balances are reviewed for impairment using the first day of our fourth quarter as the measurement date.
If after reviewing the totality of events or circumstances, we determine that it is not likely that the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount, then we test for impairment through the application of a fair value based test.
 Intangible assets are initially recorded at their fair market values determined on quoted market prices in active markets, if available, or recognized valuation models.
Intangible assets that have finite useful lives are amortized over their useful lives either on a straight-line basis or over their projected future cash flows and are tested for impairment when events or changes in circumstances occur that indicate possible impairment.
 Goodwill is initially recorded based on the premium paid for acquisitions and is subsequently tested for impairment, using the first day of our fourth quarter as the measurement date.

Prior to liquidating the equity securities, we reinvested proceeds from the sale of securities, and the cost of the equity securities sold was based on a specific identification method.
We also provide extended warranties for some products we sell that lengthen the period of coverage specified in the manufacturer’s original warranty.
With respect to new products, estimates are based generally on knowledge of the products, the extended warranty period and warranty experience.
The warranty reserves are determined based on known product failures, historical experience and other available evidence.
