 The accompanying unaudited consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with United States Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (“GAAP”) for interim financial information and the instructions to Form 10-Q and Article 10 of Regulation S-X. Accordingly, they do not include all the information and notes required by GAAP for complete financial statements.  
 In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) No. 2014-09 (“ASU 2014-09”), Revenue from Contracts with Customers, which amends guidance for revenue recognition. ASU 2014-09 is principles based guidance that can be applied to all contracts with customers, enhancing comparability of revenue recognition practices across entities, industries, jurisdictions and capital markets. The core principle of the guidance is that entities should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods and services. The guidance details the steps entities should apply to achieve the core principle. In August 2015, the FASB issued an amendment to defer the effective date for all entities by one year. For public entities, ASU 2014-09 is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within that reporting period. Early adoption is permitted as of annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016. Companies have the option of using either a full or modified retrospective approach in applying this standard. During fiscal 2016 and 2017, the FASB issued four additional updates which further clarify the guidance provided in ASU 2014-09.  
 We are evaluating the impact of the new standard on our financial statements using a three-phase approach (assessment, conversion and implementation). We continue to work through our assessment phase and further evaluation is needed in order to determine whether or not the new revenue recognition standard will have a material impact on our financial statements and related disclosures upon adoption. We have undertaken a detailed analysis of our various contracts with customers and revenue streams. The Company has engaged a third party to assist in evaluating the impact of this new standard on its consolidated financial statements and related disclosures. We will complete the conversion and implementation phases by the end of fiscal year 2018 in conjunction with future interpretative guidance.  
 Intangible assets are initially recorded at their fair market values determined on quoted market prices in active markets, if available, or recognized valuation models. Intangible assets that have finite useful lives are amortized over their useful lives either on a straight-line basis or over their projected future cash flows and are tested for impairment when events or changes in circumstances occur that indicate possible impairment.  
 As of May 27, 2017, we had invested in time deposits and certificates of deposit in the amount of $8.2 million. Of this, $6.4 million mature in less than twelve months and $1.8 million mature in greater than twelve months. The fair value of these investments is the face value of each time deposit and CD.  
 We liquidated our investments in equity securities in the third quarter of fiscal 2018. Proceeds from the liquidation were $0.9 million with gross realized gains of $0.2 million for the nine months ended March 3, 2018. Prior to the liquidation of our investment in equity securities, our investments in equity securities were classified as available-for-sale and were carried at their fair value based on quoted market prices. Our investments, which were included in non-current assets, had a carrying amount of $0.6 million as of May 27, 2017. Proceeds from the sale of securities were $0.1 million during the third quarter of fiscal 2017. Prior to liquidating the equity securities, we reinvested proceeds from the sale of securities, and the cost of the equity securities sold was based on a specific identification method. Gross realized gains on those sales were less than $0.1 million during the third quarter of fiscal 2017. Net unrealized holding gains of less than $0.1 million during the third quarter of fiscal 2017 were included in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss).  
We offer warranties for the limited number of specific products we manufacture. We also provide extended warranties for some products we sell that lengthen the period of coverage specified in the manufacturer’s original warranty. Our warranty terms generally range from one to three years. 
 We estimate the cost to perform under the warranty obligation and recognize this estimated cost at the time of the related product sale. We record expense related to our warranty obligations as cost of sales in our consolidated statements of comprehensive income (loss). Each quarter, we assess actual warranty costs incurred on a product-by-product basis and compare the warranty costs to our estimated warranty obligation. With respect to new products, estimates are based generally on knowledge of the products, the extended warranty period and warranty experience.  
 Warranty reserves are established for costs that are expected to be incurred after the sale and delivery of products under warranty. Warranty reserves are included in accrued liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets. The warranty reserves are determined based on known product failures, historical experience and other available evidence. Warranty reserves were approximately $0.1 million as of March 3, 2018 and May 27, 2017.  
 In December 2017, the SEC issued Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 118 that allows for a measurement period up to one year after the enactment date of the Act to complete the accounting requirements. The Company will complete the adjustments related to the Act within the allowed period.  
 On September 12, 2017, the Company received an income tax refund from the State of Illinois of approximately $2.0 million, which was inclusive of interest earned. The refund was a result of the conclusion of the Illinois amended return related to the sale of the RF, Wireless and Power Division in 2011. A net benefit of $1.5 million, which includes $0.5 million of professional fee costs incurred to pursue the refund, was recognized in the second quarter of fiscal 2018 in discontinued operations.  
 We have authorized 17,000,000 shares of common stock, and 3,000,000 shares of Class B common stock.

With respect to dividends and distributions, shares of common stock and Class B common stock rank equally and have the same rights, except that Class B common stock cash dividends are limited to 90% of the amount of Class A common stock cash dividends.

 On December 5, 2017, Steven H. Busch filed a Verified Stockholder Derivative Complaint against Edward J. Richardson, Paul Plante, Jacques Belin, James Benham, Kenneth Halverson, and the Company in the Delaware Court of Chancery, captioned Steven H. Busch v. Edward J. Richardson, et al., C.A. No. 2017-0868-AGB. The lawsuit alleges claims for breach of fiduciary duty by the Company’s directors and challenges the decision of a special committee of the Company’s Board to refuse Mr. Busch’s demand that the Company’s Board, among other things, rescind the Company’s May 2013 repurchase of stock from Mr. Richardson and May 2013 and October 2014 repurchases of Company stock from the Richardson Wildlife Foundation. The Company believes the lawsuit to be without merit and that a loss is not probable or estimable based on the information available at the time the financial statements were issued.  
 ASC 820, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures (“ASC 820”), defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States and expands disclosures about fair value measurements.
