The accompanying unaudited interim Consolidated Financial Statements of Accenture plc and its controlled subsidiary companies have been prepared pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) for quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and do not include all of the information and note disclosures required by U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“U.S. GAAP”) for complete financial statements. We use the terms “Accenture,” “we” and “our” in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements to refer to Accenture plc and its subsidiaries. These Consolidated Financial Statements should therefore be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes thereto for the fiscal year ended August 31, 2017 included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC on October 26, 2017.
On March 13, 2018, Accenture Holdings plc merged with and into Accenture plc, with Accenture plc as the surviving entity. As a result, all of the assets and liabilities of Accenture Holdings plc were acquired by Accenture plc, and Accenture Holdings plc ceased to exist. In connection with this internal merger, shareholders of Accenture Holdings plc (other than Accenture entities that held shares of Accenture Holdings plc), who primarily consisted of current and former members of Accenture Leadership and their permitted transferees, received one Class A ordinary share of Accenture plc for each share of Accenture Holdings plc that they owned, and Accenture plc redeemed all Class X ordinary shares of Accenture plc owned by such shareholders.  
Depreciation expense was $101,814 and $315,410 for the three and nine months ended May 31, 2018, respectively, and $86,148 and $255,807 for the three and nine months ended May 31, 2017, respectively. As of May 31, 2018 and August 31, 2017, total accumulated depreciation was $2,028,174 and $1,912,146, respectively.

See Note 5 (Goodwill and Intangible Assets) for intangible asset amortization balances. 
For a cash flow hedge, the effective portion of the change in estimated fair value of a hedging instrument is recorded in Accumulated other comprehensive loss as a separate component of Shareholders’ Equity and is reclassified into Cost of services in the Consolidated Income Statements during the period in which the hedged transaction is recognized. For information related to derivatives designated as cash flow hedges that were reclassified into Cost of services during the three and nine months ended May 31, 2018 and 2017 as well as those expected to be reclassified into Cost of services in the next 12 months, see Note 3 (Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss) to these Consolidated Financial Statements. 
Realized gains or losses and changes in the estimated fair value of foreign currency forward contracts that have not been designated as hedges were net losses of $84,480 and $37,698 for the three and nine months ended May 31, 2018, respectively, and a net gain of $89,035 and a net loss of $29,279 for the three and nine months ended May 31, 2017, respectively. Gains and losses on these contracts are recorded in Other income (expense), net in the Consolidated Income Statements and are offset by gains and losses on the related hedged items.

We use the terms “Accenture,” “we,” “our” and “us” in this report to refer to Accenture plc and its subsidiaries. All references to years, unless otherwise noted, refer to our fiscal year, which ends on August 31. For example, a reference to “fiscal 2018” means the 12-month period that will end on August 31, 2018. All references to quarters, unless otherwise noted, refer to the quarters of our fiscal year.
We use the term “in local currency” so that certain financial results may be viewed without the impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, thereby facilitating period-to-period comparisons of business performance. Financial results “in local currency” are calculated by restating current period activity into U.S. dollars using the comparable prior year period’s foreign currency exchange rates. This approach is used for all results where the functional currency is not the U.S. dollar.
Revenues are driven by the ability of our executives to secure new contracts and to deliver services and solutions that add value relevant to our clients’ current needs and challenges. The level of revenues we achieve is based on our ability to deliver market-leading services and solutions and to deploy skilled teams of professionals quickly and on a global basis. 
As we are a global company, our revenues are denominated in multiple currencies and may be significantly affected by currency exchange rate fluctuations. If the U.S. dollar weakens against other currencies, resulting in favorable currency translation, our revenues, revenue growth and results of operations in U.S. dollars may be higher. If the U.S. dollar strengthens against other currencies, resulting in unfavorable currency translation, our revenues, revenue growth and results of operations in U.S. dollars may be lower. The U.S. dollar weakened against various currencies during the three and nine months ended May 31, 2018 compared to the three and nine months ended May 31, 2017, resulting in favorable currency translation and U.S. dollar revenue growth that was approximately 5% and 4% higher, respectively, than our revenue growth in local currency. Assuming that exchange rates stay within recent ranges for the remainder of fiscal 2018, we estimate that our full fiscal 2018 revenue growth in U.S. dollars will be approximately 3.0% higher in U.S. dollars than our revenue growth in local currency.
and administrative costs primarily include costs for non-client-facing personnel, information systems, office space and certain acquisition-related costs.
Gross margin (Net revenues less Cost of services before reimbursable expenses as a percentage of net revenues) for the third quarter of fiscal 2018 was 32.2%, compared with 32.8% for the third quarter of fiscal 2017. Gross margin for the nine months ended May 31, 2018 was 31.3%, compared with 31.7% for the nine months ended May 31, 2017. The decrease in gross margin for the nine months ended May 31, 2018 was principally due to higher labor costs compared to the same period in fiscal 2017 as well as higher acquisition-related costs, partially offset by other cost efficiencies and improved contract profitability in the third quarter of fiscal 2018.
Sales and marketing and General and administrative costs as a percentage of net revenues were 16.5% for the third quarter of fiscal 2018 and 16.4% for the nine months ended May 31, 2018, compared with 17.3% for the third quarter of fiscal 2017 and 16.7% for the nine months ended May 31, 2017. We continuously monitor these costs and implement cost-management actions, as appropriate. For the third quarter of fiscal 2018 compared to the same period in fiscal 2017, Sales and marketing costs as a percentage of net revenues decreased 40 basis points, principally due to improved operational efficiency in our business development activities, and General and administrative costs as a percentage of net revenues decreased 50 basis points. For the nine months ended May 31, 2018 compared to the same period in fiscal 2017, Sales and marketing and General and administrative costs as a percentage of net revenues each decreased 10 basis points.
Operating margin (Operating income as a percentage of net revenues) for the third quarter of fiscal 2018 was 15.7%, compared with 9.8% for the third quarter of fiscal 2017. Operating margin for the nine months ended May 31, 2018 was 14.9%, compared with 13.0% for the nine months ended May 31, 2017. The pension settlement charge decreased operating margin by 570 and 200 basis points for the three and nine months ended May 31, 2017, respectively. Excluding the effect of the pension settlement charge, operating margin for the three and nine months ended May 31, 2017 would have been 15.5% and 15.0%, respectively. 
The effective tax rates for the three and nine months ended May 31, 2018 were 34.4% and 27.2%, respectively. The effective tax rates for the three and nine months ended May 31, 2017 were 19.4% and 20.2%, respectively. For the three and nine months ended May 31, 2018, we recorded a provisional tax charge associated with the enactment of the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the “Tax Act”) of $41 million and $178 million, respectively. Absent these charges and $81 million of expense from a non-U.S. tax law change, our effective tax rate for the three and nine months ended May 31, 2018 would have been 26.8% and 21.3%, respectively. Absent the pension settlement charge and related taxes, our effective tax rates for the three and nine months ended May 31, 2017 would have been 26.6% and 22.7%, respectively. For additional information see Note 9 (Income Taxes) to our Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 1, “Financial Statements”. 
Diluted earnings per share were $1.60 for the third quarter of fiscal 2018, compared with $1.05 for the third quarter of fiscal 2017. Diluted earnings per share were $4.76 for the nine months ended May 31, 2018, compared with $3.96 for the nine months ended May 31, 2017. The impact of tax law changes decreased diluted earnings per share by $0.19 and $0.40 during the three and nine months ended May 31, 2018, respectively. The impact of the pension settlement 
charge, net of taxes, decreased diluted earnings per share by $0.47 in both the three and nine months ended May 31, 2017. Excluding these impacts, diluted earnings per share would have been $1.79 and $1.52 for the third quarter of fiscal 2018 and 2017, respectively and $5.16 and $4.43 for the nine months ended May 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. 
Operating expenses for the third quarter of fiscal 2018 increased $728 million, or 9%, over the third quarter of fiscal 2017, and decreased as a percentage of revenues to 85.1% from 90.8% during this period. Operating expenses before reimbursable expenses for the third quarter of fiscal 2018 increased $694 million, or 9%, over the third quarter of fiscal 2017, and decreased as a percentage of net revenues to 84.3% from 90.2% during this period.
Cost of services for the third quarter of fiscal 2018 increased $1,073 million, or 17%, over the third quarter of fiscal 2017, and increased as a percentage of revenues to 69.4% from 68.9% during this period. Cost of services before reimbursable expenses for the third quarter of fiscal 2018 increased $1,038 million, or 17%, over the third quarter of fiscal 2017, and increased as a percentage of net revenues to 67.8% from 67.2% during this period. Gross margin for the third quarter of fiscal 2018 decreased to 32.2% from 32.8% during this period . The decrease in gross margin was principally due to higher labor costs as a percentage of net revenues compared to the same period in fiscal 2017, partially offset by other cost efficiencies and improved contract profitability.
We recorded a pension settlement charge of $510 million during the third quarter of fiscal 2017 as a result of the termination of our U.S. pension plan. For additional information, refer to Note 8 (Retirement and Profit Sharing Plans) to our Consolidated Financial Statements above under Item 1, “Financial Statements.” 
Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests for the third quarter of fiscal 2018 decreased $20 million, or 57%, from the third quarter of fiscal 2017 due to the decrease in the non-controlling ownership percentage from 4% held by Accenture Holdings plc and Accenture Canada Holdings Inc. to less than 1% held by only Accenture Canada Holdings Inc. driven by the Accenture Holdings plc merger with and into Accenture plc. 
Diluted earnings per share were $1.60 for the third quarter of fiscal 2018, compared with $1.05 for the third quarter of fiscal 2017. The $0.55 increase in our diluted earnings per share included the impact of tax law changes, which decreased diluted earnings per share for the third quarter of fiscal 2018 by $0.19. The impact of the pension settlement charge, net of taxes, decreased diluted earnings per share by $0.47 for the third quarter of fiscal 2017. Excluding these impacts, diluted earnings per share for the third quarter of fiscal 2018 increased $0.27 compared with the third quarter of fiscal 2017 due to an increase of $0.28 from higher revenues and operating results, $0.01 from lower weighted average shares outstanding and $0.01 from lower net income attributable to other non-controlling interests. These increases were partially offset by decreases of $0.02 from higher non-operating expense and $0.01 from a higher effective tax rate. For information regarding our earnings per share calculations, see Note 2 (Earnings Per Share) to our Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 1, “Financial Statements.” 
Operating expenses for the nine months ended May 31, 2018 increased $2,784 million, or 12%, over the nine months ended May 31, 2017, and decreased as a percentage of revenues to 85.8% from 87.7% during this period.

Gross margin for the nine months ended May 31, 2018 decreased to 31.3% from 31.7% during this period. The decrease in gross margin was principally due to higher labor costs compared to the same period in fiscal 2017 as well as higher acquisition-related costs, partially offset by other cost efficiencies and improved contract profitability in the third quarter of fiscal 2018.
