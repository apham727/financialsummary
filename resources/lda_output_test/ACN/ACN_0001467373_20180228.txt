The accompanying unaudited interim Consolidated Financial Statements of Accenture plc and its controlled subsidiary companies have been prepared pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) for quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and do not include all of the information and note disclosures required by U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“U.S. GAAP”) for complete financial statements. We use the terms “Accenture,” “we” and “our” in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements to refer to Accenture plc and its subsidiaries. These Consolidated Financial Statements should therefore be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes thereto for the fiscal year ended August 31, 2017 included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC on October 26, 2017.
Depreciation expense was $107,445 and $213,596 for the three and six months ended February 28, 2018, respectively, and $84,639 and $169,659 for the three and six months ended February 28, 2017, respectively. As of February 28, 2018 and August 31, 2017, total accumulated depreciation was $2,042,405 and $1,912,146, respectively. Deferred transition amortization expense was $71,288 and $153,142 for the three and six months ended February 28, 2018, respectively, and $69,844 and $139,129 for the three and six months ended February 28, 2017, respectively. See Note 5 (Goodwill and Intangible Assets) for intangible asset amortization balances.  
On March 21, 2018, the Board of Directors of Accenture plc declared a semi-annual cash dividend of $1.33 per share on its Class A ordinary shares for shareholders of record at the close of business on April 12, 2018 payable on May 15, 2018. The payment of the cash dividend will result in the issuance of an immaterial number of additional restricted share units to holders of restricted share units.
In the normal course of business, we use derivative financial instruments to manage foreign currency exchange rate risk. Our derivative financial instruments consist of deliverable and non-deliverable foreign currency forward contracts. 
Our effective tax rates for the three months ended February 28, 2018 and 2017 were 26.1% and 20.7%, respectively. Our effective tax rates for the six months ended February 28, 2018 and 2017 were 23.0% and 20.5%, respectively. Excluding the provisional tax expense, described above, the effective tax rates would have been 15.1% and 18.0% for the three and six months ended February 28, 2018, respectively. The effective tax rates for the three and six months ended February 28, 2018 benefited from lower expenses for adjustments to prior year tax liabilities in fiscal 2018, partially offset by lower benefits from final determinations of prior year U.S. taxes in fiscal 2018. 
We have either the right to purchase at fair value or, if certain events occur, may be required to purchase at fair value outstanding shares of our Avanade Inc. and SinnerSchrader AG subsidiaries. As of February 28, 2018 and August 31, 2017, we have reflected the fair value of $93,358 and $52,996, respectively, related to redeemable common stock and the intrinsic value of the options on redeemable common stock of these subsidiaries in Other accrued liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.

We use the terms “Accenture,” “we,” “our” and “us” in this report to refer to Accenture plc and its subsidiaries. All references to years, unless otherwise noted, refer to our fiscal year, which ends on August 31. For example, a reference to “fiscal 2018” means the 12-month period that will end on August 31, 2018. All references to quarters, unless otherwise noted, refer to the quarters of our fiscal year.
We use the term “in local currency” so that certain financial results may be viewed without the impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, thereby facilitating period-to-period comparisons of business performance. Financial results “in local currency” are calculated by restating current period activity into U.S. dollars using the comparable prior year period’s foreign currency exchange rates. This approach is used for all results where the functional currency is not the U.S. dollar.
•We might be unable to access additional capital on favorable terms or at all. If we raise equity capital, it may dilute our shareholders’ ownership interest in us.
Revenues are driven by the ability of our executives to secure new contracts and to deliver services and solutions that add value relevant to our clients’ current needs and challenges. The level of revenues we achieve is based on our ability to deliver market-leading services and solutions and to deploy skilled teams of professionals quickly and on a global basis. 
As we are a global company, our revenues are denominated in multiple currencies and may be significantly affected by currency exchange rate fluctuations. If the U.S. dollar weakens against other currencies, resulting in favorable currency translation, our revenues, revenue growth and results of operations in U.S. dollars may be higher. If the U.S. dollar strengthens against other currencies, resulting in unfavorable currency translation, our revenues, revenue growth and results of operations in U.S. dollars may be lower. The U.S. dollar weakened against various currencies during the three and six months ended February 28, 2018 compared to the three and six months ended February 28, 2017, resulting in favorable currency translation and U.S. dollar revenue growth that was approximately 6% and 4% higher, respectively, than our revenue growth in local currency. Assuming that exchange rates stay within recent ranges for the remainder of fiscal 2018, we estimate that our full fiscal 2018 revenue growth in U.S. dollars will be approximately 4.0% higher in U.S. dollars than our revenue growth in local currency.
and administrative costs primarily include costs for non-client-facing personnel, information systems, office space and certain acquisition-related costs.

The decrease in gross margin for three and six months ended February 28, 2018 was principally due to lower consulting contract profitability as well as higher acquisition-related costs, partially offset by cost efficiencies.
Operating expenses for the second quarter of fiscal 2018 increased $1,162 million, or 15%, over the second quarter of fiscal 2017, and increased as a percentage of revenues to 87.3% from 87.0% during this period.

•Financial Services operating income increased primarily due to consulting revenue growth, partially offset by lower consulting contract profitability.

Other income (expense), net primarily consists of foreign currency gains and losses as well as gains and losses associated with our investments in privately held companies.

Diluted earnings per share were $1.37 for the second quarter of fiscal 2018, compared with $1.33 for the second quarter of fiscal 2017. The $0.04 increase in our diluted earnings per share included the impact of the $137 million charge associated with the Tax Act, which decreased diluted earnings per share for the second quarter of fiscal 2018 by $0.21. Excluding the impact of this charge, diluted earnings per share for the second quarter of fiscal 2018 increased $0.25 compared with the second quarter of fiscal 2017, due to increases of $0.17 from higher revenues and operating results, $0.10 from a lower effective tax rate and $0.01 from lower weighted average shares outstanding. These increases were partially offset by decreases of $0.02 from higher non-operating expense and $0.01 from higher net income attributable to other non-controlling interests. For information regarding our earnings per share calculations, see Note 2 (Earnings Per Share) to our Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 1, “Financial Statements.”

The following table provides additional information relating to our purchases and redemptions of Accenture Holdings plc ordinary shares and Accenture Canada Holdings Inc. exchangeable shares for cash during the second quarter of fiscal 2018.
