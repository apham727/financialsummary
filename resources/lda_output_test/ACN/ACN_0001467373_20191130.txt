Depreciation expense was $97,090 and $102,713 for the three months ended November 30, 2019 and 2018, respectively. As of November 30, 2019 and August 31, 2019, total accumulated depreciation was $2,096,462 and $1,956,029, respectively. Deferred transition amortization expense was $67,914 and $68,879 for the three months ended November 30, 2019 and 2018, respectively. See Note 6 (Goodwill and Intangible Assets) to these Consolidated Financial Statements for intangible asset amortization balances. 
On September 1, 2019, we adopted FASB ASU No. 2016-02, Leases, and related updates (“Topic 842”) using the effective date method. Prior period amounts were not adjusted. The primary impact of adoption is the requirement for lessees to recognize assets and liabilities on the balance sheet for the rights and obligations created by both operating and finance leases. Enhanced quantitative and qualitative disclosures about leasing arrangements are also required. We elected the package of practical expedients which does not require reassessment of prior conclusions related to identifying leases, lease classification or initial direct costs. We also elected the practical expedient to combine lease and nonlease components, accounting for the combined components as a single lease component, for our office real estate and automobile leases. The standard did not have a material impact on our Consolidated Income Statement.
Deferred transition revenues were $583,531 and $563,245 as of November 30, 2019 and August 31, 2019, respectively, and are included in Non-current deferred revenues. Costs related to these activities are also deferred and are expensed as the services are provided. Generally, deferred amounts are protected in the event of early termination of the contract and are monitored regularly for impairment. Impairment losses are recorded when projected remaining undiscounted operating cash flows of the related contract are not sufficient to recover the carrying amount of contract assets. Deferred transition costs were $691,727 and $681,492 as of November 30, 2019 and August 31, 2019, respectively, and are included in Deferred contract costs.
Revenues recognized during the three months ended November 30, 2019 that were included in Deferred revenues as of August 31, 2019 were $1.8 billion. Revenues recognized during the three months ended November 30, 2018 that were included in Deferred revenues as of September 1, 2018 were $1.8 billion. 
Lease assets and liabilities recognized at the lease commencement date are determined predominantly as the present value of the payments due over the lease term. Unless the implicit rate can be determined, we use our incremental borrowing rate on that date to calculate the present value. Our incremental borrowing rate approximates the rate at which we could borrow, on a secured basis for a similar term, an amount equal to our lease payments in a similar economic environment. 
Effective September 1, 2019, when we are the lessee, all leases are recognized as lease liabilities and associated lease assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. Lease liabilities represent our obligation to make payments arising from the lease. Lease assets represent our right to use an underlying asset for the lease term and may also include advance payments, initial direct costs or lease incentives. Fixed and variable payments that depend upon an index or rate, such as the Consumer Price Index (CPI), are included in the recognition of lease assets and liabilities at the commencement-date rate. Other variable payments, such as common area maintenance, property and other taxes, utilities and insurance that are based on the lessor’s cost, are recognized in the Consolidated Income Statement in the period incurred. 
As of November 30, 2019, we have entered into operating leases that have not yet commenced with future lease payments of $430 million that are not reflected in the table above. These leases are primarily related to office real estate and will commence in or before fiscal year 2022 with lease terms of up to 17 years. 
On December 16, 2019, the Board of Directors of Accenture plc declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.80 per share on its Class A ordinary shares for shareholders of record at the close of business on January 16, 2020 payable on February 14, 2020. The payment of the cash dividend will result in the issuance of an immaterial number of additional restricted share units to holders of restricted share units.
In the normal course of business, we use derivative financial instruments to manage foreign currency exchange rate risk. Our derivative financial instruments consist of deliverable and non-deliverable foreign currency forward contracts. 
In the normal course of business and in conjunction with certain client engagements, we have entered into contractual arrangements through which we may be obligated to indemnify clients with respect to certain matters. 
On July 24, 2019, Accenture was named in a putative class action lawsuit filed by consumers of Marriott International, Inc. (“Marriott”) in the U.S. District Court for the District of Maryland. The complaint alleges negligence by us, and seeks monetary damages, costs and attorneys’ fees and other related relief, relating to a data security incident involving unauthorized access to the reservations database of Starwood Worldwide Resorts, Inc. (“Starwood”), which was acquired by Marriott on September 23, 2016. Since 2009, we have provided certain IT infrastructure outsourcing services to Starwood. We believe the lawsuit is without merit and we will vigorously defend it. We cannot reasonably estimate a range of loss, if any, at this time.

We use the terms “Accenture,” “we,” “our” and “us” in this report to refer to Accenture plc and its subsidiaries. All references to years, unless otherwise noted, refer to our fiscal year, which ends on August 31. For example, a reference to “fiscal 2020” means the 12-month period that will end on August 31, 2020. All references to quarters, unless otherwise noted, refer to the quarters of our fiscal year. 
We use the term “in local currency” so that certain financial results may be viewed without the impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, thereby facilitating period-to-period comparisons of business performance. Financial results “in local currency” are calculated by restating current period activity into U.S. dollars using the comparable prior year period’s foreign currency exchange rates. This approach is used for all results where the functional currency is not the U.S. dollar. 
•Our business depends on generating and maintaining ongoing, profitable client demand for our services and solutions, including through the adaptation and expansion of our services and solutions in response to ongoing changes in technology and offerings, and a significant reduction in such demand or an inability to respond to the evolving technological environment could materially affect our results of operations. 
•If we do not successfully manage and develop our relationships with key alliance partners or if we fail to anticipate and establish new alliances in new technologies, our results of operations could be adversely affected. 
•We are incorporated in Ireland and a significant portion of our assets is located outside the United States. As a result, it might not be possible for shareholders to enforce civil liability provisions of the federal or state securities laws of the United States. We may also be subject to criticism and negative publicity related to our incorporation in Ireland. 
Revenues are driven by the ability of our executives to secure new contracts, to renew and extend existing contracts, and to deliver services and solutions that add value relevant to our clients’ current needs and challenges. The level of revenues we achieve is based on our ability to deliver market-leading services and solutions and to deploy skilled teams of professionals quickly and on a global basis. 
As we are a global company, our revenues are denominated in multiple currencies and may be significantly affected by currency exchange rate fluctuations. If the U.S. dollar weakens against other currencies, resulting in favorable currency translation, our revenues, revenue growth and results of operations in U.S. dollars may be higher. If the U.S. dollar strengthens against other currencies, resulting in unfavorable currency translation, our revenues, revenue growth and results of operations in U.S. dollars may be lower. The U.S. dollar strengthened against various currencies during the first quarter of fiscal 2020 compared to the first quarter of fiscal 2019, resulting in unfavorable currency translation and U.S. dollar revenue growth that was approximately 2% lower than our revenue growth in local currency. Assuming that exchange rates stay within recent ranges for the remainder of fiscal 2020, we estimate that our full fiscal 2020 revenue growth in U.S. dollars will be approximately 1% lower in U.S. dollars than our revenue growth in local currency.
Gross margin (Revenues less Cost of services as a percentage of Revenues) for the first quarter of fiscal 2020 was 32.1%, compared with 31.1% for the first quarter of fiscal 2019. The increase in gross margin for the first quarter of fiscal 2020 was primarily due to lower labor costs as a percentage of revenues compared to the same period in fiscal 2019.
Sales and marketing and General and administrative costs as a percentage of revenues were 16.6% for the first quarter of fiscal 2020, compared with 15.7% for the first quarter of fiscal 2019. For the first quarter of fiscal 2020 compared to the same period in fiscal 2019, Sales and marketing costs as a percentage of revenues increased 40 basis points, primarily due to higher selling and other business development costs, and General and administrative costs as a percentage of revenues increased 50 basis points, primarily due to higher technology and facilities costs. We continuously monitor these costs and implement cost-management actions, as appropriate.
Cost of services for the first quarter of fiscal 2020 increased $403 million, or 6%, over the first quarter of fiscal 2019, and decreased as a percentage of revenues to 67.9% from 68.9% during this period. Gross margin for the first quarter of fiscal 2020 increased to 32.1% from 31.1% during the first quarter of fiscal 2019. The increase in gross margin was primarily due to lower labor costs as a percentage of revenues compared to the same period in fiscal 2019.
Sales and marketing expense for the first quarter of fiscal 2020 increased $121 million, or 11%, over the first quarter of fiscal 2019, and increased as a percentage of revenues to 10.5% from 10.1% during this period. The increase as a percentage of revenues was primarily due to higher selling and other business development costs compared to the same period in fiscal 2019.
General and administrative costs for the first quarter of fiscal 2020 increased $91 million, or 15%, over the first quarter of fiscal 2019, and increased as a percentage of revenues to 6.1% from 5.6% during this period. The increase as a percentage of revenues was primarily due to higher technology and facilities costs compared to the same period in fiscal 2019. 
Other income (expense), net primarily consists of foreign currency gains and losses, non-operating components of pension expense, as well as gains and losses associated with our investments. For the first quarter of fiscal 2020, other income (expense) increased $45 million over the first quarter of fiscal 2019, primarily due to gains on investments, partially offset by foreign exchange losses. 
The effective tax rate for the first quarter of fiscal 2020 was 23.6%, compared with 19.8% for the first quarter of fiscal 2019. The higher effective tax rate for the three months ended November 30, 2019 was primarily due to lower benefits from final determinations of prior year taxes and the phased-in effects of US tax reform. For additional information, see Note 1 (Basis of Presentation) to our Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 1, “Financial Statements.” 
Diluted earnings per share were $2.09 for the first quarter of fiscal 2020, compared with $1.96 for the first quarter of fiscal 2019. The $0.13 increase in our diluted earnings per share was due to an increase of $0.17 from higher revenues and operating results, $0.06 from higher non-operating income, and $0.01 from lower weighted average shares outstanding. These increases were partially offset by a decrease of $0.11 from a higher effective tax rate. For information regarding our earnings per share calculations, see Note 3 (Earnings Per Share) to our Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 1, “Financial Statements.” 
We believe that our current and longer-term working capital, investments and other general corporate funding requirements will be satisfied for the next twelve months and thereafter through cash flows from operations and, to the extent necessary, from our borrowing facilities and future financial market activities. 
Substantially all of our cash is held in jurisdictions where there are no regulatory restrictions or material tax effects on the free flow of funds. Domestic cash inflows for our Irish parent, principally dividend distributions from lower-tier subsidiaries, have been sufficient to meet our historic cash requirements, and we expect this to continue into the future.
