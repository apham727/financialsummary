Existing deferred rent liabilities, resulting from our historical practice of using the straight line method for recognizing lease expense, were reclassified upon adoption to reduce the measurement of the lease assets.
We elected the package of practical expedients permitted under the transition guidance, which among other things, allows us to carry forward the historical accounting relating to lease identification and classification for existing leases at adoption.
Our leases are classified as operating leases and expense is recorded in a manner similar to historical accounting guidance.

During the three months ended March 31, 2019, we recognized a decrease of revenues of $69 for amounts that were included in contract liabilities at the beginning of the period.
The decrease in contract liabilities as of March 31, 2019 is primarily due to the settlement of customer discounts and price concessions recognized at the beginning of the period.
In June 2016, we announced plans to restructure operations by phasing out production at our Elkhart facility and transitioning it into a research and development center supporting our global operations ("June 2016 Plan").
The amendment added an additional $1,100 in planned costs related to the relocation of our corporate headquarters in Lisle, IL and our plant in Bolingbrook, IL, both of which have now been consolidated into a single facility.
Certain processes in the manufacture of our current and past products create by-products classified as hazardous waste.Changes in foreign exchange rates decreased sales by $1,771 year-over-year due to the U.S. Dollar appreciating compared to the Chinese Renminbi and Euro and relating mostly to sales of products to the transportation end market.
The improvement was driven mainly by savings related to cost improvements and the manufacturing transition from Elkhart, Indiana, which were partially offset by material cost and wage increases.
Research and development expenses were $6,791 or 5.8% of sales in the first quarter of 2019 compared to $6,507 or 5.7% of sales in the comparable quarter of 2018.
The charges were mainly for building and equipment relocation, severance, and travel costs related to the restructuring of certain operations as part of the 2016 Restructuring Plan.
Operating earnings were $14,218 or 12.1% of sales in the first quarter of 2019 compared to operating earnings of $13,359 or 11.8% of sales in the first quarter of 2018.
Other income in the first quarter of 2019 was principally driven by foreign currency translation gains, mainly due to the depreciation of the U.S. Dollar compared to the Chinese Renminbi during the quarter, which was partially offset by pension expense.
The decrease in the effective tax rate for the three months ended March 31, 2019, compared with the same period in 2018, was primarily attributed to tax benefits recorded upon vesting of restricted stock units.
