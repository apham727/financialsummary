The accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared by CTS Corporation (“CTS” "we", "our", "us" or the "Company”), without audit, pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission.
Certain information and footnote disclosures normally included in financial statements prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles have been omitted pursuant to such rules and regulations.
In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Accounting Standards Update ("ASU") 2014-09, "Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606)".
This guidance requires a company to recognize revenue to depict the transfer of goods or services to a customer at an amount that reflects the consideration it expects to receive in exchange for those goods or services.
Beginning in January 2018, CTS adopted the provisions of Topic 606 under the modified retrospective method, which requires a cumulative effect adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings on the date of adoption.
Our contracts normally contain a single performance obligation that is fulfilled on the date of delivery based on shipping terms stipulated in the contract.
During the three months period ended March 31, 2018, we recognized revenues of $131 that were included in contract liabilities at the beginning of the period.
The increase in contract liabilities during the three months ended March 31, 2018 is primarily due to net increases in estimated future discounts and price concessions, offset by net settlements of products sold with rights of return.
In June 2016, we announced plans to restructure operations by phasing out production at our Elkhart facility by the end of 2018 and transitioning it into a research and development center supporting our global operations ("June 2016 Plan").
The amendment added an additional $1,100 in planned costs related to the relocation of our corporate headquarters in Lisle, IL and our plant in Bolingbrook, IL, both of which will be consolidated into a single facility.
The total restructuring liability related to severance and other one-time benefit arrangements under the June 2016 Plan was $1,279 at March 31, 2018, and $1,460 at December 31, 2017.
Certain processes in the manufacture of our current and past products create by-products classified as hazardous waste.
We reserve for probable remediation activities and for claims and proceedings against us with respect to other environmental matters.
On May 23, 2016, we requested and received a $100,000 increase in the aggregate revolving credit commitments under the existing credit agreement, which increased the credit line from $200,000 to $300,000.
The Revolving Credit Facility includes a swing line sublimit of $15,000 and a letter of credit sublimit of $10,000.
Borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility bear interest, at our option, at the base rate plus the applicable margin for base rate loans or LIBOR plus the applicable margin for LIBOR loans.
The Revolving Credit Facility requires, among other things, that we comply with a maximum total leverage ratio and a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio.
