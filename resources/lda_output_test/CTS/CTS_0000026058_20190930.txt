Beginning in January 2019, CTS adopted the provisions of Accounting Standards Update ("ASU") 2016-02, "Leases (Topic 842)" under the optional transition method, which requires, if necessary, a cumulative effect adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings. The lease liability is based on the present value of minimum lease payments discounted using our secured incremental borrowing rate at the date of adoption. Existing deferred rent liabilities, resulting from our historical practice of using the straight line method for recognizing lease expense, were reclassified upon adoption to reduce the measurement of the lease assets. We elected the package of practical expedients permitted under the transition guidance, which among other things, allows us to carry forward the historical accounting relating to lease identification and classification for existing leases at adoption. Our leases are classified as operating leases and expense is recorded in a manner similar to historical accounting guidance. We have also elected the practical expedient to not separate lease and non-lease components for the majority of our leases and the election to keep leases with an initial term of 12 months or less off of the balance sheet. Upon adoption we recorded a lease liability of $24,792 and a right of use asset of $22,066. No adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings was required.
To the extent the transaction price includes variable consideration, we estimate the amount of variable consideration that should be included in the transaction price utilizing the most likely amount method based on an analysis of historical experience and current facts and circumstances, which requires significant judgment. Variable consideration is included in the transaction price if, in our judgment, it is probable that a significant future reversal of cumulative revenue under the contract will not occur. 
In June 2016, we announced plans to restructure operations by phasing out production at our Elkhart facility and transitioning it into a research and development center supporting our global operations ("June 2016 Plan"). Additional organizational changes were also implemented in various other locations. During the third quarter of 2017, we revised the June 2016 Plan. The amendment added an additional $1,100 in planned costs related to the relocation of our corporate headquarters in Lisle, IL and our plant in Bolingbrook, IL, both of which have now been consolidated into a single facility. The total restructuring liability under the June 2016 Plan was $333 at September 30, 2019, and $668 at December 31, 2018. Additional costs related to production line movements, equipment charges, and other costs will be expensed as incurred. 
Certain processes in the manufacture of our current and past products create by-products classified as hazardous waste. We have been notified by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, state environmental agencies, and in some cases, groups of potentially responsible parties, that we may be potentially liable for environmental contamination at several sites currently and formerly owned or operated by us. Two of those sites, Asheville, North Carolina and Mountain View, California, are designated National Priorities List sites under the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency’s Superfund program. We accrue a liability for probable remediation activities, claims and proceedings against us with respect to environmental matters if the amount can be reasonably estimated, and provide disclosures including the nature of a loss whenever it is probable or reasonably possible that a potentially material loss may have occurred but cannot be estimated. We record contingent loss accruals on an undiscounted basis. 
On February 12, 2019, we entered into an amended and restated five-year Credit Agreement with a group of banks (the "Credit Agreement") to extend the term of the facility. The Credit Agreement provides for a revolving credit facility of $300,000, which may be increased by $150,000 at the request of the Company, subject to the administrative agent's approval. This new unsecured credit facility replaces the prior $300,000 unsecured credit facility, which would have expired August 10, 2020. Borrowings of $50,000 under the prior credit agreement were refinanced into the Credit Agreement. The prior agreement was terminated as of February 12, 2019.
We continue to monitor the Company’s overall currency exposure and may elect to add cash flow hedges in the future. At September 30, 2019, we had a net unrealized gain of $452 in accumulated other comprehensive (loss) income, of which $432 is expected to be reclassified to income within the next 12 months. At September 30, 2018 we had a net unrealized gain of $867 in accumulated other comprehensive (loss) income. The notional amount of foreign currency forward contracts outstanding was $11,738 at September 30, 2019.
Cumulative translation adjustments relate to our non-U.S. subsidiary companies that have designated a functional currency other than the U.S. dollar. We are required to translate the subsidiary functional currency financial statements to dollars using a combination of historical, period-end, and average foreign exchange rates. This combination of rates creates the foreign currency translation adjustment component of other comprehensive income. 
Certain potentially dilutive restricted stock units are excluded from diluted earning per share because they are anti-dilutive. The number of awards that were anti-dilutive for the nine month periods ended September 30, 2019 and September 30, 2018 were 20,273 and 1,538, respectively. There were no outstanding anti-dilutive awards impacting the three month periods ended September 30, 2019 and September 30, 2018.
During 2015 and 2016, the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors of the Company (the “Committee”) granted a total of 350,000 performance-based stock option awards (“Performance-Based Option Awards”) for certain employees under the 2014 Plan, of which 250,000 remain outstanding after considering forfeitures. The Performance-Based Option Awards have an exercise price of $18.37, a term of five years, and generally will become exercisable (provided the optionee remains employed by the Company or an affiliate) upon our attainment of at least $600,000 in revenues during any of our trailing four quarterly periods (as determined by the Committee) during the term. We have not recognized any expense on these Performance-Based Option Awards for the nine-month periods ended September 30, 2019 and 2018, since the revenue target was not deemed likely to be attained based on our current forecast.
Cash-Settled RSUs entitle the holder to receive the cash equivalent of one share of common stock for each unit when the unit vests. These RSUs are issued to key employees residing in foreign locations as direct compensation. Generally, these RSUs vest over a three-year period. Cash-Settled RSUs are classified as liabilities and are remeasured at each reporting date until settled. At September 30, 2019 and December 31, 2018 we had 17,271 and 17,248 cash-settled RSUs outstanding, respectively. At September 30, 2019 and December 31, 2018, liabilities of $263 and $300, respectively, were included in Accrued liabilities on our Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets.
We use interest rate swaps to convert a portion of our Revolving Credit Facility’s outstanding balance from a variable rate of interest into a fixed rate and foreign currency forward contracts to hedge the effect of foreign currency changes on certain revenues and costs denominated in foreign currencies. These derivative financial instruments are measured at fair value on a recurring basis. 
The fair value of our interest rate swaps and foreign currency hedges were measured using standard valuation models using market-based observable inputs over the contractual terms, including forward yield curves, among others. There is a readily determinable market for these derivative instruments, but that market is not active and therefore they are classified within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy.
We lease certain land, buildings and equipment under non-cancellable operating leases used in our operations. Operating lease assets represent our right to use an underlying asset for the lease term. Operating lease liabilities represent the present value of lease payments over the lease term, discounted using an estimate of our secured incremental borrowing rate because none of our leases contain a rate implicit in the lease arrangement. 
The operating lease assets and liabilities are adjusted to include the impact of any lease incentives and non-lease components. We have elected not to separate lease and non-lease components, which include taxes and common area maintenance in some of our leases. Variable lease payments that depend on an index or a rate are included in lease payments using the prevailing index or rate in effect at lease commencement. 
On July 31, 2019, we acquired 100% of the outstanding shares of Quality Thermistor, Inc. (QTI) for $75 million plus a contingent earn out of up to $5 million based on sales performance objectives. The purchase price includes adjustments for debt assumed and changes in working capital. QTI, doing business as QTI Sensing Solutions, is a leading designer and manufacturer of high-quality temperature sensors serving original equipment manufacturers with mission-critical applications in the industrial, aerospace, defense and medical markets. This acquisition provides us with a new core temperature sensing technology that expands our sensing product portfolio, while increasing our presence in the industrial and medical markets.

Sales were $115,651 in the third quarter of 2019, a decrease of $3,208 or 2.7% from the third quarter of 2018. Sales to transportation markets decreased $3,625 or 4.8%. Sales to other markets increased $417 or 1.0% due to the addition of sales from the QTI acquisition. The QTI acquisition, which was completed in July 2019, added $3,670 in sales for the quarter. Changes in foreign exchange rates decreased sales by $922 year-over-year due to the U.S. Dollar appreciating compared to the Chinese Renminbi and Euro and relating mostly to sales of products to the transportation end market.
Gross margin as a percent of sales was 32.0% in the third quarter of 2019 compared to 35.4% in the third quarter of 2018. The decrease in gross margin was driven primarily by a one-time purchase accounting step-up in the value of finished goods inventory acquired with our QTI acquisition, execution challenges in our ceramic foundry operation, a product replacement charge for a transportation product, and material cost and wage increases. These were partially offset by savings related to the manufacturing transition from Elkhart, Indiana and other cost improvements.
Restructuring charges were $2,342 or 2.0% of sales in the third quarter of 2019. The charges were mainly for building and equipment relocation, severance, and asset impairment charges related to the restructuring of certain operations as part of the 2016 Restructuring Plan, as well as a lease termination fee related to a property lease we acquired in the QTI acquisition. Restructuring charges were $997 or 0.8% of sales in the third quarter of 2018.
Sales were $353,959 in the nine months ended September 30, 2019, an increase of $3,549 or 1.0% from the nine months ended September 30, 2018. Sales to transportation markets increased $7,348 or 3.3%. Sales to other markets declined $3,799 or 3.0%. The QTI acquisition, which was completed in July 2019, added $3,670 in sales for the nine months ended September 30, 2019. Changes in foreign exchange rates decreased sales by $4,554 year-over-year due to the U.S. Dollar appreciating compared to the Chinese Renminbi and Euro and relating mostly to sales of products to the transportation end market.
Gross margin as a percent of sales was 33.6% in the nine months ended September 30, 2019 compared to 34.9% for the nine months ended September 30, 2018. The decrease in gross margin was driven primarily by a one-time purchase accounting step-up in the value of finished goods inventory acquired with our QTI acquisition, execution challenges in our ceramic foundry operation, a product replacement charge for a transportation product, and material cost and wage increases. These were partially offset by savings related to the manufacturing transition from Elkhart, Indiana and other cost improvements.
Restructuring charges were $5,337 or 1.5% of sales in the nine months ended September 30, 2019. The charges were mainly for building and equipment relocation, severance, and asset impairment charges related to the restructuring of certain operations as part of the 2016 Restructuring Plan, as well as a lease termination fee related to a property lease we acquired in the QTI acquisition. Restructuring charges were $3,364 or 1.0% of sales in the nine months ended September 30, 2018.
On February 12, 2019, we entered into an amended and restated five-year Credit Agreement with a group of banks (the "Credit Agreement") to extend the term of the facility. The Credit Agreement provides for a revolving credit facility of $300,000, which may be increased by $150,000 at the request of the Company, subject to the administrative agent's approval. This new unsecured credit facility replaces the prior $300,000 unsecured credit facility, which would have expired August 10, 2020. Borrowings of $50,000 under the prior credit agreement were refinanced into the Credit Agreement. The prior agreement was terminated as of February 12, 2019.
The Revolving Credit Facility requires, among other things, that CTS comply with a maximum total leverage ratio and a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio. Failure to comply with these covenants could reduce the borrowing availability under the Revolving Credit Facility. We were in compliance with all debt covenants at September 30, 2019. 
We have historically funded our capital and operating needs primarily through cash flows from operating activities, supported by available credit under our Revolving Credit Facility. We believe that cash flows from operating activities and available borrowings under our Revolving Credit Facility will be adequate to fund our working capital needs, capital expenditures, and debt service requirements for at least the next twelve months. However, we may choose to pursue additional equity and debt financing to provide additional liquidity or to fund acquisitions.
Provisions for estimated warranty expenses primarily related to our automotive products are made at the time products are sold. These estimates are established using a quoted industry rate. We adjust our warranty reserve for any known or anticipated warranty claims as new information becomes available. We evaluate our warranty obligations at least quarterly and adjust our accruals if it is probable that future costs will be different than our current reserve. Over the last three years, product warranty reserves have ranged from 0.5% to 2.4% of total sales. We believe our reserve level is appropriate considering all facts and circumstances surrounding any outstanding quality claims and our historical experience selling our products to our customers.
We reserve for estimated credit losses based on historical experience and specific customer collection issues. Over the last three years, accounts receivable reserves have been approximately 0.1% to 0.7% of total accounts receivable. We believe our reserve level is appropriate considering the quality of the portfolio. While credit losses have historically been within expectations and the reserves established, we cannot guarantee that our credit loss experience will continue to be consistent with historical experience.
We value our inventories at the lower of the actual cost to purchase or manufacture using the first-in, first-out ("FIFO") method, or net realizable value. We review inventory quantities on hand and record a provision for excess and obsolete inventory based on forecasts of product demand and production requirements.
Actuarial assumptions are used in determining pension income and expense and our pension benefit obligation. We utilize actuaries from consulting companies in each applicable country to develop our discount rates that match high-quality bonds currently available and expected to be available during the period to maturity of the pension benefit in order to provide the necessary future cash flows to pay the accumulated benefits when due. After considering the recommendations of our actuaries, we have assumed a discount rate, expected rate of return on plan assets and a rate of compensation increase in determining our annual pension income and expense and the projected benefit obligation. During the fourth quarter of each year, we review our actuarial assumptions in light of current economic factors to determine if the assumptions need to be adjusted. Changes in the actuarial assumptions could have a material effect on our results of operations.

Item 2.  Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds
On February 7, 2019 the Board of Directors authorized a new stock repurchase program with a maximum dollar limit of $25 million. This program authorizes us to make repurchases of our common stock from time to time on the open market, but does not obligate us to make repurchases, and has no expiration date.
