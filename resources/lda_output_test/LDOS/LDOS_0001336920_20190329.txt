The unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements also include the balances of all voting interest entities in which Leidos has a controlling voting interest (“subsidiaries”) and a variable interest entity ("VIE") in which Leidos is the primary beneficiary. The consolidated balances of the Company’s VIE are not material to the Company’s unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements for the periods presented. Intercompany accounts and transactions between consolidated companies have been eliminated in consolidation. 
Effective the beginning of fiscal 2019, certain contracts were reassigned between the Civil and Defense Solutions reportable segments (see "Note 17–Business Segments"). While this activity did not have a material impact on the Company's reportable segments, prior year segment results have been recast to reflect this change. 
The Company has elected to adopt certain practical expedients provided under ASC 842, including the option to not apply lease recognition for short-term leases, reassessment of whether expired or existing contracts contain leases, reassessment of lease classification for expired or existing leases, applying a single discount rate to a portfolio of leased assets with similar durations, reassessing initial direct costs and combining lease and non-lease components in revenue arrangements. The Company did not elect the hindsight practical expedient to determine the lease term for existing leases and in assessing the impairment for the ROU assets. 
The Company has facilities and equipment lease arrangements. An arrangement is determined to be a lease at inception if it conveys the right to control the use of identified property and equipment for a period of time in exchange for consideration. ROU assets represent the Company’s right to use an underlying asset over the lease term and lease liabilities represent its obligation to make lease payments arising from the lease.
ROU assets and lease liabilities are recorded on the consolidated balance sheet at lease commencement date based on the present value of the future minimum lease payments over the lease term. When the lease does not include an implicit rate, the discount rate used is the Company’s incremental borrowing rate based on information available at the commencement date. An ROU asset is initially measured by the present value of the remaining lease payments, plus initial direct costs and prepaid lease payments, less any lease incentives received before commencement. The remaining lease cost is allocated over the remaining lease term on a straight-line basis unless another systematic or rational basis is more representative of the pattern in which the underlying asset is expected to be used. ROU assets are evaluated for impairment in a manner consistent with the treatment of other long-lived assets.
Certain of the Company’s facility leases contain options to renew or extend the terms of the lease which are included in the determination of the ROU assets and lease liabilities when it is reasonably certain that the Company will exercise the option. The Company's leases may also include variable lease payments such as an escalation clause based on consumer price index rates, maintenance costs and utilities. Variable lease payments that depend on an index or a rate are included in the determination of right-of-use assets and lease liabilities using the index or rate at the lease commencement date, whereas variable lease payments that do not depend on a index or rate are recorded as lease expense in the period incurred. At March 29, 2019, the Company did not have any lease agreements with residual value guarantees.
Changes in estimates related to contracts accounted for using the cost-to-cost method of accounting are recognized in the period in which such changes are made for the inception-to-date effect of the changes, with the exception of contracts acquired through a business combination, where the adjustment is made for the period commencing from the date of acquisition. 
During the quarters ended March 29, 2019 and March 30, 2018, revenue recognized from performance obligations satisfied in previous periods was $4 million and $34 million, respectively. The changes primarily relate to revisions of variable consideration, including award fees, and revisions to estimates at completion resulting from changes in contract scope, mitigation of contract risks or due to true-ups of contract estimates at the end of contract performance.
The Company's cash equivalents are primarily comprised of investments in several large institutional money market funds and bank deposits, with original maturity of three months or less. The Company includes outstanding payments within "Cash and cash equivalents" and correspondingly increases "Accounts payable and accrued liabilities" on the condensed consolidated balance sheets. At March 29, 2019, and December 28, 2018, the Company included $66 million and $56 million, respectively, of outstanding payments within "Cash and cash equivalents."
On January 24, 2018, the Company entered into a lease agreement with its current lessor for office space in a building to be constructed to function as the Company's new corporate headquarters in Reston, Virginia. The Company will occupy the space for an initial term of 148 months and rent expense will be $11 million for the first lease year, with an annual rent expense increase of 2.5%. The Company currently expects construction to be completed and to take occupancy of the building by April 1, 2020, at which point the Company's lease agreements for its current corporate headquarters will terminate. 
Contract assets consist of unbilled receivables, which is the amount of revenue recognized that exceeds the amount billed to the customer, where right to payment is not just subject to the passage of time. Contract liabilities consist of deferred revenue. 
Effective the beginning of fiscal 2019, the Company changed the composition of its Defense Solutions reportable segment, which resulted in the identification of new operating segments and reporting units within Defense Solutions (see "Note 17–Business Segments"). Consequently, the carrying amount of goodwill was re-allocated among the reporting units for the purpose of testing goodwill for impairment for fiscal 2019. In addition, certain contracts were reassigned between the Civil and Defense Solutions reportable segments. This change resulted in the reallocation of $25 million of goodwill between the two reportable segments. 
In conjunction with the changes mentioned above, the Company evaluated goodwill for impairment using a quantitative step one analysis, both before and after the changes were made, and determined that goodwill was not impaired. There were no goodwill impairments during the three months ended March 30, 2018.
On December 31, 2018, the Company closed the sale and leaseback agreement relating to its land and building in Gaithersburg, MD. The Company received proceeds of $31 million, net of selling costs for the property, which had a carrying value of $31 million. The term of the lease is expected to end during fiscal 2020. 
Prior to the adoption of ASC 842, the consideration of $79 million was recorded as a financing transaction. Under ASC 842, the transaction qualified as a sale-leaseback and consequently the debt of $79 million and the carrying value of the property of $14 million, net of the related tax impact of $17 million, were reclassified into retained earnings as a cumulative effect adjustment. The proceeds received in fiscal 2019 were recorded as investing activities on the condensed consolidated statements of cash flows. 
The Company's derivatives consisted of the fair value interest rate swaps on its $450 million, fixed rate 4.45% senior secured notes maturing in December 2020 and cash flow interest rate swaps on $1.5 billion of the Company's variable rate senior secured term loans (see "Note 12–Derivative Instruments"). The fair value of the fair value interest rate swaps and cash flow interest rate swaps is determined based on observed values for underlying interest rates on the LIBOR yield curve and the underlying interest rate, respectively (Level 2 inputs). 
The carrying amounts of the Company's financial instruments, other than derivatives, which include cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable and accrued expenses, are reasonable estimates of their related fair values. The carrying value of the Company's note receivable of $24 million as of March 29, 2019, and December 28, 2018, approximates fair value as the stated interest rate within the agreement is consistent with current market rates used in notes with similar terms in the market (Level 2 inputs). 
As of March 29, 2019, and December 28, 2018, the fair value of debt was $3.1 billion and the carrying amount was $3.0 billion and $3.1 billion, respectively (see "Note 13–Debt"). The fair value of long-term debt is determined based on current interest rates available for debt with terms and maturities similar to the Company’s existing debt arrangements (Level 2 inputs).

Effective the beginning of fiscal 2019, we changed the composition of our Defense Solutions reportable segment to better align the operations within the reportable segment to the customers we serve. This resulted in the identification of new operating segments within Defense Solutions. In addition, certain contracts were reassigned between the Civil and Defense Solutions reportable segments. While this activity did not have a material impact on the Company's reportable segments, prior year segments results have been recast to reflect this change. 
In March 2019, the President submitted the GFY 2020 budget proposal to Congress. The budget includes $750 billion for defense and $563 billion for non-defense spending. The defense budget proposal includes $576 billion for national defense and $165 billion for the Overseas Contingency Operations fund. Congress has begun the process of considering this proposal.
The increase in revenues in constant currency(1) for the three months ended March 29, 2019, was 6.1%, as compared to an actual increase in revenues of 5.5%. The foreign currency impact was mainly attributable to adverse exchange rate movements in the British pound and Australian dollar when compared to the U.S. dollar. 
The increase in revenues for the three months ended March 29, 2019, as compared to the three months ended March 30, 2018, was primarily attributable to new awards and a net increase in program volumes, partially offset by the completion of certain contracts, the adverse impact of foreign exchange rates movement between the U.S. dollar and the Australian dollar and higher net profit write-ups in the prior year quarter.

The increase in operating income for the three months ended March 29, 2019, as compared to the three months ended March 30, 2018, was primarily due to new awards and lower amortization of intangibles, partially offset by higher net profit write-ups in the prior year quarter and the timing of material deliveries on certain contracts.
