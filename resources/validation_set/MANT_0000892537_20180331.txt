ManTech International Corporation (depending on the circumstances, “ManTech” “Company” “we” “our” “ours” or “us”) provide mission focused technology solutions and services for U.S. defense, intelligence community and federal civilian agencies.
Now in our 50th year, we excel in full-spectrum cyber, data collection & analytics, enterprise information technology (IT), systems engineering and software application development solutions that support national and homeland security.
We recognized the cumulative effect of adopting ASC 606 as an increase to the 2018 opening balance of retained earnings in the amount of $0.8 million, with the impact primarily related to fixed-price contracts.
We derive revenue from contracts with customers primarily from contracts with the U.S. government in the areas of defense, intelligence, homeland security and other federal civilian agencies.
On October 2, 2017, we completed the acquisition of InfoZen.
InfoZen is a leading IT solution provider, with domain expertise in modernization, agile/DevOps software development, cloud migration and threat monitoring and assessment capabilities in support of critical national and homeland security missions.
The primary driver of our increase in revenue relates to revenue from new contract awards, acquisitions and growth on certain existing contracts.
These increases were offset by contracts and tasks that ended and reduced scope of work on some contracts.
The increase in cost of services was primarily due to increases in revenue.
The increase in general and administrative expenses was primarily due to an increase in bid and proposal spending, amortization of acquired intangibles and expenditures to support infrastructure.
The increase in interest expense was due to increased borrowings under our credit facility to fund the acquisition of InfoZen in the fourth quarter of 2017 and the purchase of equipment to support a managed IT services contract.
We expect increased levels of capital expenditures, as compared to prior years, for the purchase of equipment to support managed IT service contracts.
