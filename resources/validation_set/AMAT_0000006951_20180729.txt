Applied provides manufacturing equipment, services and software to the semiconductor, display, and related industries.
Applied’s results are driven primarily by customer spending on capital equipment and services to support key technology transitions or to increase production volume in response to worldwide demand for semiconductors and displays.
Investment in semiconductor and display manufacturing equipment and services continued to be a strong driver of revenue during the first nine months of fiscal 2018.
Logic and dynamic random-access memory (DRAM) demand increased, and NAND demand remained strong reflecting increasing memory requirements in smartphones and servers.
Customers continue to invest in a new generation of equipment for producing larger LCD TVs and in new equipment for mobile devices.
The increase in net sales to customers in China for the three and nine months ended July 29, 2018 compared to the same periods in the prior year, also reflected increased investments in display manufacturing equipment.
The decrease in net sales to customers in Taiwan for the nine months ended July 29, 2018 compared to the same periods in the prior year primarily reflected decreased investments in semiconductor equipment.
The decrease in net sales to customers in Korea for the three months ended July 29, 2018 compared to the same period in the prior year primarily reflected decrease in investments in semiconductor and display manufacturing equipment.
Development cycles range from 12 to 36 months depending on whether the product is an enhancement of an existing product, which typically has a shorter development cycle, or a new product, which typically has a longer development cycle.
The Semiconductor Systems segment is comprised primarily of capital equipment used to fabricate semiconductor chips.
Semiconductor industry spending on capital equipment is driven by demand for advanced electronic products, including smartphones and other mobile devices, servers, personal computers, automotive devices, storage, and other products, and the nature and timing of technological advances in fabrication processes, and as a result is subject to variable industry conditions.
Investment in semiconductor manufacturing equipment continued to be a strong driver of revenue during the first nine months of fiscal 2018.
Demand for Applied Global Services’ service solutions are driven by Applied’s large and growing installed base of manufacturing systems, and customers’ needs to shorten ramp times, improve device performance and yield, and optimize factory output and operating costs. Industry conditions that affect Applied Global Services’ sales of spares and services are primarily characterized by increases in semiconductor manufacturers’ wafer starts and continued strong utilization rates, growth of the installed base of equipment, growing service intensity of newer tools, and the company’s ability to sell more comprehensive service agreements.
Certain operations of Applied are conducted in foreign currencies, such as Japanese yen, euro, Israeli shekel and Taiwanese dollar.
Applied’s customer base is highly concentrated, and has become increasingly concentrated as a result of continued consolidation.
