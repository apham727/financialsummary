ASC 606 primarily impacts our revenue recognition for software arrangements and sales to two-tier distributors.
In both areas, the new standard accelerates the recognition of revenue.
We classify our hardware, perpetual software licenses, and software-as-a-service (SaaS) as distinct performance obligations.
Of this total $2.8 billion adjustment, $2.6 billion related to product deferred revenue, of which $1.3 billion relates to our recurring software and subscription offers, $0.6 billion relates to two-tier distribution, and the remainder relates to non-recurring software and other adjustments
The application of ASC 606 increased our total revenue by $276 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2019.
In connection with the adoption of ASC 606, we recorded a transition adjustment to increase retained earnings by $2.3 billion.
Infrastructure Platforms consist of our core networking technologies of switching, routing, data center products, and wireless that are designed to work together to deliver networking capabilities and transport and/or store data.
Applications consists of offerings that utilize the core networking and data center platforms to provide their functions.
Security primarily includes our unified threat management, advanced threat security, and web security products.
Other Products primarily include our Service Provider Video Software Solutions, cloud and system management products.
On September 28, 2018, we completed our acquisition of privately held Duo Security, Inc. ("Duo"), a leading provider of unified access security and multi-factor authentication delivered through the cloud.
Total transaction costs related to acquisition and divestiture activities were $10 million and $9 million for the first quarter of fiscal 2019 and fiscal 2018, respectively.
On May 1, 2018, we announced a definitive agreement to sell our Service Provider Video Software Solutions ("SPVSS") business.
There were no impairment charges related to purchased intangible assets for the first quarter of fiscal 2019 and fiscal 2018, respectively.
We have been asked to indemnify Time Warner Cable (“TWC”) for patent infringement claims asserted against it by Sprint Communications Company, L.P. (“Sprint”) in federal court in Kansas.
Revenue in the United States was $6.9 billion and $6.5 billion for the first quarter of fiscal 2019 and fiscal 2018, respectively.
Product revenue for the emerging countries of BRICM, in the aggregate, experienced 24% product revenue growth, with increases in Mexico, India, Russia and Brazil and product revenue in China being flat.
The Infrastructure Platforms product category represents our core networking offerings related to switching, routing, wireless, and the data center.
Infrastructure Platforms revenue increased by 9%, or $662 million, with strength across the portfolio.
Revenue in our Applications product category increased by 18%, or $216 million, with growth across all of the business.
Revenue in our Security product category increased 11%, or $66 million, driven by higher sales of identity and access, advance threat security and unified threat management products
The decrease in revenue from our Other Products category was primarily driven by a decrease in revenue from Service Provider Video Software Solutions (“SPVSS”).
The increase in product gross margin was also due to a favorable mix of products sold, driven by favorability from the decrease in revenue from SPVSS products.
The negative pricing impact, which was lower than the year-over-year impact we experienced in the first quarter of fiscal 2018, was driven by typical market factors and impacted each of our geographic segments and customer markets.
We experienced a gross margin percentage increase in our Americas segment due to productivity improvements, partially offset by unfavorable impacts from pricing.
We expect to realign and dedicate resources into key priority and growth areas, such as Security and Applications, while also focusing on maintaining leadership in Infrastructure Platforms and in Services
Although product orders from the service provider market increased in the first quarter of fiscal 2019 and fourth quarter of fiscal 2018, service provider product orders decreased in the first nine months of fiscal 2018 and in fiscal 2017, and at various times in the past we have experienced significant weakness in product orders from service providers.
For example, as products related to network programmability, such as SDN products, become more prevalent, we expect to face increased competition from companies that develop networking products based on commoditized hardware, referred to as "white box" hardware, to the extent customers decide to purchase those product offerings instead of ours.
