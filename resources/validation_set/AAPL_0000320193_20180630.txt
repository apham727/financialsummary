The Company distributes its products through cellular network carriers, wholesalers, national and regional retailers and resellers, many of whom distribute products from competing manufacturers.
The Company’s products and services include iPhone®, iPad®, Mac®, Apple Watch®, AirPods®, Apple TV®, HomePod™, a portfolio of consumer and professional software applications, iOS, macOS®, watchOS® and tvOS™ operating systems, iCloud®, Apple Pay® and a variety of other accessory, service and support offerings. The Company sells and delivers digital content and applications through the iTunes Store®, App Store®, Mac App Store, TV App Store, iBooks Store® and Apple Music® (collectively “Digital Content and Services”). 
The Company has historically experienced higher net sales in its first quarter compared to other quarters in its fiscal year due in part to seasonal holiday demand.
During the third quarter of 2018, the Company announced iOS 12, macOS Mojave, watchOS 5 and tvOS 12, updates to its operating systems which are expected to be available in the fall of 2018.
iPhone net sales increased during the third quarter and first nine months of 2018 compared to the same periods in 2017 due primarily to a different mix of iPhones resulting in higher average selling prices.
iPad net sales decreased during the third quarter of 2018 compared to the same period in 2017 due primarily to a different mix of iPads resulting in lower average selling prices. iPad net sales increased year-over-year during the first nine months of 2018 due primarily to higher iPad unit sales and the strength in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar.
Mac net sales decreased during the third quarter and first nine months of 2018 compared to the same periods in 2017 due primarily to lower Mac unit sales. The launch of MacBook Pro® in the first quarter of 2017 and the updated Mac portables in the third quarter of 2017 contributed to higher Mac net sales and unit sales during the first nine months of 2017. 
Gross margin increased during the third quarter and first nine months of 2018 compared to the same periods in 2017 due primarily to higher Services net sales and a favorable shift in the mix of iPhones with higher average selling prices, partially offset by higher product cost structures.
The Company’s financial condition and operating results also depend on its ability to continually improve the Mac platform to maintain its functional and design advantages.
An increasing number of internet-enabled devices that include software applications and are smaller and simpler than traditional personal computers compete for market share with the Company’s existing products.
