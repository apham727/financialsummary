The unaudited condensed consolidated interim financial statements include the accounts of the Company and all wholly owned divisions, including its 60% majority-owned subsidiary, Taitron Components Mexico, S.A. de C.V. All significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.
These unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“GAAP”) for interim financial information and the instructions to Form 10-Q and Article 8 of Regulation S-X.
Operating results for the interim periods are not necessarily indicative of financial results for the full year.
These unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the audited condensed consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2017.
The new standard will require companies to record most leased assets and liabilities on the balance sheet, and also proposes a dual model for recognizing expense.
We have evaluated the impact of adopting this guidance and we are preparing for the changes to be made to our consolidated financial statements.
In January 2017, the FASB issued a new accounting standard which clarifies the definition of a business with the objective of adding guidance to assist entities with evaluating whether transactions should be accounted for as acquisitions or disposals of assets or businesses.
This guidance will be effective for the Company for the year ending December 31, 2019 and interim reporting periods within that year.
We are currently evaluating the effect of the adoption of this guidance on our consolidated financial statements.
In May 2017, the FASB issued a new accounting standard which provides guidance about which changes to the terms or conditions of a share-based payment award require an entity to apply modification accounting in ASC Topic 718.
Under the new guidance, modification accounting is required only if the fair value, the vesting conditions, or the classification of the award (as equity or liability) changes as a result of the change in terms or conditions.
The primary impact of adoption relates to additional disclosures and presentation of revenue by primary geographical market, major product line and the timing of revenue recognition.

The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the condensed consolidated financial statements, including the related notes, appearing in Item 1 of Part 1 of this quarterly report on Form 10-Q, as well as our most recent annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2017.
Revenue Recognition – Revenue is recognized upon shipment of the products, which is when legal transfer of title occurs and control of the product is transferred to the customer.
Sales returns for the three months ended June 30, 2018 and 2017 were $1,000 and $36,000, respectively and for the six months ended June 30, 2018 and 2017 were $3,000 and $148,000, respectively.
Inventory – Inventory, consisting principally of products held for resale, is recorded at the lower of cost (determined using the first in-first out method) or net realizable value.
We had inventory balances in the amount of $4,546,000 and $4,990,000 at June 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017, respectively, which is presented net of valuation allowances of $7,946,000 and $7,848,000, respectively.
However, if all or a substantial portion of the inventory was required to be immediately liquidated, the inventory would not be as readily marketable or liquid as other items included or classified as a current asset, such as cash.
Net sales in the second quarter of 2018 totaled $2,150,000 versus $1,773,000 in the comparable period for 2017, an increase of $377,000 or 21.3% over the same period last year.
Gross profit for the second quarter of 2018 was $979,000 versus $757,000 in the comparable period for 2018, and gross margin percentage of net sales was 45.5% in the second quarter of 2018 versus 42.7% in the comparable period for 2017.
Selling, general and administrative expenses in the second quarter of 2018 totaled $550,000 versus $542,000 in the comparable period for 2017.
Other income, net of other expense, in the second quarter of 2018 was $29,000 versus $31,000 in the comparable period for 2017.
Other income was primarily derived from the rental income of excess office space at our headquarters in Valencia, CA.
Income tax provision was $1,000 for the second quarter of 2018 and 2017, as we do not expect significant taxable income for the year ending December 31, 2018.
