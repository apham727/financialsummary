Our revenues decreased by approximately $6.4 million, or 24%, to $20.0 million for the three months ended June 30, 2018 as compared to $26.4 million for the three months ended June 30, 2017.
The decrease in revenue is the result of a decrease of $6.2 million in our TS segment, combined with a $0.2 million decrease in our HPP segment.
Operating income decreased by approximately $1.1 million from operating income of $1.3 million for the three months ended June 30, 2017 to operating income of $222 thousand for the three months ended June 30, 2018, primarily as a result of a $939 thousand decrease in gross profit combined with an increase of $181 thousand in operating expenses.
The increase in operating expenses was primarily the result of higher compensation costs with an increase in the number of engineers and outside consultants for the development of the new Aria security products in the HPP segment.
Our revenues decreased by approximately $6.4 million to $20.0 million for the three months ended June 30, 2018 as compared to $26.4 million of revenues for the three months ended June 30, 2017.
The HPP product revenues of $1.7 million were relatively unchanged for the three months ended June 30, 2018 compared to the three months ended June 30, 2017, increasing by $30 thousand from $1.6 million.
The decrease in HPP services revenues of $258 thousand is primarily attributed to a $382 thousand decrease in royalties on high-speed processing boards related to the E2D program shipped for the three months ended June 30, 2018 as compared to the three months ended June 30, 2017.
The decrease in TS segment product revenues of $7.0 million during the period was primarily the result of a decrease in product revenues of $7.2 million in our U.S. division, partially offset by an increase of $0.2 million in our U.K. division.
The $7.2 million decrease in the U.S. division was primarily the result of product sales to a major customer in the prior year that were not repeated in the current year.
The increase in TS segment service revenues for the period ended June 30, 2018 as compared to the prior fiscal year three month period was due primarily to an increase of $0.9 million in our U.S. division.
The $0.9 million increase in the U.S. division service revenues was substantially the result of a $0.8 million increase in internal services and a $0.3 million increase in managed service contracts, partially offset by a decrease in third party maintenance revenues of $0.2 million.
The $0.4 million decrease in revenue to Europe is primarily the result of decreased sales by our TS segment U.S division of $1.2 million, partially offset by increased sales by our TS segment U.K. division of $0.7 million to a U.S. division multi-national customer.
Our gross margin ("GM") decreased by $0.9 million to $5.2 million for the three months ended June 30, 2018 as compared to a gross margin of approximately $6.1 million for the three months ended June 30, 2017.
