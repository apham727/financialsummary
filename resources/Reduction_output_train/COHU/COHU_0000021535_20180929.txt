Pursuant to an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the “Merger Agreement”) dated as of May 7, 2018 among Cohu, Inc., a Delaware corporation (“Cohu”), Xcerra Corporation, a Massachusetts corporation (“Xcerra”), and Xavier Acquisition Corporation, a Delaware corporation and a wholly owned subsidiary of Cohu (“Merger Sub”), Merger Sub merged with and into Xcerra (the “Merger”), with Xcerra surviving such merger as a wholly owned subsidiary of Cohu.
Our ability to realize the anticipated benefits of the Merger will depend, to a large extent, on our ability to integrate Xcerra, which is expected to be a complex, costly and time-consuming process.
The integration process may disrupt our business and, if implemented ineffectively, could restrict the realization of the full expected benefits.
In addition, even if Xcerra is integrated successfully, the full anticipated benefits of the Merger may not be realized, including the synergies, cost savings or sales or growth opportunities that are anticipated.
As a result, it cannot be assured that the Merger will result in the realization of the full or any anticipated benefits.
Although we have completed the Merger, we have incurred, and will continue to incur, significant transaction costs in connection with the Merger, including restructuring expenses and the payment of certain fees and expenses incurred in connection with the Merger and related financing transactions.
These could adversely affect our results of operations in the period in which such expenses are recorded or our cash flow in the period in which any related costs are actually paid.This Form 10-Q contains certain forward-looking statements including expectations of market conditions, challenges and plans, within the meaning of Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and is subject to the Safe Harbor provisions created by that statute.
