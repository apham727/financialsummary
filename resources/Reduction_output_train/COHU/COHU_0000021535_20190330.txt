The integration process may disrupt our business and, if implemented ineffectively or delayed, could restrict the realization of the full expected benefits.
In addition, even if Xcerra is integrated successfully, the full anticipated benefits of the Merger may not be realized, including the synergies, cost savings or sales or growth opportunities that are anticipated.
