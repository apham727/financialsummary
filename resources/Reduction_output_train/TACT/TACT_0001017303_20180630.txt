These interim financial statements should be read in conjunction with the audited financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2017 included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K.

As of June 30, 2018, $208 thousand of the accrued product warranty liability is classified as current in "Accrued liabilities" in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets and the remaining $95 thousand is classified as non-current in "Other liabilities".

Through our TransAct Services Group ("TSG"), we provide a complete range of supplies and consumables used in the printing and scanning activities of customers in the restaurant and hospitality, banking, retail, casino and gaming, government and oil and gas exploration markets.
Printer and terminal sales volume increased 6% to approximately 39 thousand units driven primarily by an 81% increase in unit volume from the casino and gaming market and, to a lesser extent, a 14% increase in unit volume from the POS automation and banking market.
The average selling price of our printers and terminals increased 7% in the second quarter of 2018 compared to the second quarter of 2018 due primarily to lower lottery printer sales.
International sales for the second quarter of 2018 increased $2.3 million, or 221%, from the same period in 2017 due primarily to a 267% increase in sales in the international casino and gaming market.
The increase in domestic restaurant solutions terminal sales in the second quarter of 2018 compared to the second quarter of 2017 was driven by the initial shipments of the AccuDate XL to two existing customers in support of large-scale, multi-quarter rollouts of the terminal.
This increase was partially offset by decreased sales of our AccuDate 9700 terminal to our former U.S. distributor during the second quarter of 2018 compared to the second quarter of 2017.
The increase in both domestic and international POS automation and banking product revenue from the second quarter of 2017 was driven by an 21% increase in sales of our IthacaÂ® 9000 printer, as sales to McDonald's have returned to the near record levels experienced during 2017.
This increase was partially offset by 71% lower sales of our legacy banking and other POS printers for the second quarter of 2018 compared to the second quarter of 2017.
The increase in domestic sales of our casino and gaming products was due to an 8% increase in domestic sales of our thermal casino printer sales in the second quarter of 2018 compared to the second quarter of 2017, driven primarily by increased sales to our OEMs.
The increase in international sales in the second quarter of 2018 compared to the second quarter of 2017 was due to a 366% increase in sales of our thermal casino printers and a 153% increase in sales of our off-premise gaming printers in Europe, Australia and Asia.
We expect international sales of both our thermal casino printers and off-premise gaming printers to continue to increase in the second half of 2018, as we benefit from the transition to selling directly to slot machine manufacturers and end user casino and gaming customers in Europe.
The increase in sales of Printrex printers in the second quarter of 2018 compared to second quarter of 2017 resulted from a 84% increase in domestic and international sales of our oil and gas printers.
This increase was partially offset by 76% lower sales of our medical and mobile printers in the second quarter of 2018 compared to the second quarter of 2017.
Service revenue declined 9% in the second quarter of 2018 compared to the second quarter of 2017 due to paper testing sales that occurred in 2017 but did not repeat in 2018.
The decrease in Non-Printrex consumables was partially offset by AccuDate label sales which nearly tripled in second quarter of 2018 compared to the second quarter of 2017.
Internationally, TSG revenue increased due to a 98% increase in sales of replacement parts and accessories in the second quarter of 2018 compared to the second quarter of 2017.
Such expenses increased $163 thousand, or 16% in the second quarter of 2018 compared to the second quarter of 2017 due primarily to the hiring of additional engineering staff and increased prototype expenses to support new product development in the restaurant solutions and casino and gaming markets.
