Each segment had its own segment manager as well as its own engineering, business development, sales and marketing, and operational general and administrative functions.
The Company managed its balance sheet and cash flows centrally at the corporate level, with the exception of trade accounts receivable and inventory which were managed at the segment level.
All of the Company’s accounting and finance, human resources, information technology (“IT”) and legal functions were provided on a centralized basis through the corporate function.
Because the reorganization occurred during the third quarter 2018, this report reflects the segment reporting structure that was in effect for all of 2017 and through August of 2018.

On July 31, 2017, the Company sold substantially all of the assets of the Company’s Engineering Services business to Gabe’s Construction Co., Inc. (“Gabe’s”) for a purchase price of $1.45 million.
The Engineering Services business provided design, testing, commissioning, optimization, and consulting services for cellular, Wi-Fi and public safety networks and was a reporting unit within the RF Solutions segment.
The disposition of Engineering Services qualified as a discontinued operation for reporting purposes due to the material significance of its historical results and because this disposition represented a strategic shift by the Company to focus on products.
The Company restated the results of Engineering Services as discontinued operations for the three and six months ended June 30, 2017.
