The Company adopted the new revenue standard effective May 1, 2018 using the modified retrospective transition method.
The Companys total revenue impact is $1.2 million, with approximately 70% impacting the fiscal year ending April 30, 2019, which is the result of recognizing revenue for the license component of its term licenses and certain perpetual license contracts that were previously recognized over time due to the lack of vendor-specific objective evidence (VSOE) of fair value at the point-in-time at which control of the software license is transferred to the customer, rather than ratably over the term of the contract.
In addition, under the new standard, the Company will capitalize a portion of sales commission expenses and recognize them ratably over the associated period of economic benefit which the Company has determined to be six years, which has an impact of $1.1 million.Corporate capital spending trends and commitments are the primary determinants of the size of the market for business software.
In October 2018, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) provided an update to the World Economic Outlook (WEO) for the 2018 and 2019 world economic growth forecast.
In the United States, momentum is still strong as fiscal stimulus continues to increase, but the forecast for 2019 has been revised down due to recently announced trade measures, including the tariffs imposed on $200 billion of US imports from China.
China and a number of Asian economies are also projected to experience somewhat weaker growth in 2019 in the aftermath of the recently announced trade measures. For fiscal 2019, we expect the global economy to improve modestly when compared to the prior year.
