We are one of the world’s leading revenue management and digital monetization, customer experience, and payment solutions providers, and a trusted partner to some of the most well-known communications, media, and entertainment companies around the globe.
Drawing from real-world knowledge and unparalleled expertise, we design and implement business solutions that make their hardest decisions simpler and smarter so they can focus on evolving their businesses to provide highly sophisticated and competitive multi-product offerings while also delivering increasingly differentiated, real-time, and personalized experiences that meet the ever-changing demands of their customers across all stages of the customer lifecycle.
Our solutions are built on proven public and private cloud platforms, with out-of-the-box and managed service models that adapt to fit their unique business needs and enable the transformative change required to create personalized experiences that drive loyalty and retention.
We generate approximately 55% of our revenues from the North American cable and satellite markets, approximately 20% of our revenues from global wireline and wireless communication providers, and the remainder from a variety of other verticals, such as financial services, healthcare, logistics, and transportation.
Revenues for the first quarter of 2019 were $244.8 million, a 21% increase when compared to revenues of $201.7 million for the first quarter of 2018, with the increase mainly attributed to the additional revenues generated from the acquisitions of Forte on October 1, 2018 and Business Ink on February 28, 2018, and the continued growth in our cloud solutions and managed service arrangements.
Operating income for the first quarter of 2019 was $32.1 million, or a 13.1% operating margin percentage, compared to $25.8 million, or a 12.8% operating margin percentage for the first quarter of 2018.
The increase in operating income is primarily a result of the higher revenues generated in the first quarter of 2019, as reflected by our relatively consistent operating margin percentage.
Diluted EPS for the first quarter of 2019 was $0.59 compared to $0.42 for the first quarter of 2018, reflective of the higher operating income for the first quarter of 2019.
As of March 31, 2019, we had cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments of $141.9 million, as compared to $162.9 million as of December 31, 2018.
Comcast continues to be our largest client, generating 22% of our total revenues for the first quarter of 2019.
In November 2018, Comcast exercised the first of their two one-year renewal options extending the term of their agreement through June 30, 2020.
Terms of the extension remain consistent with the financial terms and obligations under the existing agreement.
Additionally, under the terms of the agreement, Comcast has the right to exercise an additional one-year renewal option no later than January 1, 2020, to extend the term of the Agreement through June 30, 2021.
A copy of the Comcast agreement and related amendments, with confidential information redacted, is included in the exhibits to our periodic filings with the SEC.
The preparation of our Financial Statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires us to select appropriate accounting policies, and to make judgments and estimates affecting the application of those accounting policies.
Cloud and related solutions revenues for the first quarter of 2019 were $219.6 million, a 24% increase when compared to $177.5 million for the first quarter of 2018.
The increase in cloud and related solutions revenues between periods is primarily due to the additional revenues generated from the acquired Business Ink and Forte businesses, discussed above, and to a lesser degree, the execution of and performance under managed services and Ascendon arrangements.
Software and services revenues for the first quarter of 2019 were $13.0 million, a 9% increase when compared to $12.0 million for the first quarter of 2018, with the increase mainly attributed to the timing of work performed and execution of software license agreements.
See our 2018 10-K for a description of the types of costs that are included in the individual line items for cost of revenues.
The cost of cloud and related solutions for the first quarter of 2019 increased 32% to $114.7 million, from $86.9 million for the first quarter of 2018.

The interest rate on our 2016 Convertible Notes is fixed, and thus, as it relates to our convertible debt borrowings, we are not exposed to changes in interest rates.
Our cash and cash equivalents as of March 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018 were $123.6 million and $139.3 million, respectively.
Certain of our cash balances are “swept” into overnight money market accounts on a daily basis, and at times, any excess funds are invested in low-risk, somewhat longer term, cash equivalent instruments and short-term investments.
We have minimal market risk for our cash and cash equivalents due to the relatively short maturities of the instruments.
