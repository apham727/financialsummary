Key Impact of U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act As discussed in Note 2 to our Financial Statements, in January 2018 we adopted ASU 606, a single comprehensive model which supersedes nearly all existing revenue recognition guidance under U.S. GAAP, utilizing the cumulative effect approach.
In conjunction with the adoption of this ASU, we recorded a cumulative adjustment increasing beginning retained earnings (net of tax) by approximately $7 million, primarily related to contracts that we were required to defer revenue as we did not have VSOE for certain undelivered elements.
Certain deferred contract costs that had been included in our client contracts and other current and non-current assets on our Balance Sheet were reclassified and presented separately as a non-current client contract asset, net of related amortization.
For the second quarter and six months ended June 30, 2018, Business Ink contributed cloud and related solutions revenues of $15.7 million and $21.0 million, respectively, of and was slightly dilutive to our results of operations when factoring in acquired amortization expense.
Operating income for the second quarter of 2018 was $24.1 million, or an 11.3% operating income margin percentage, compared to $24.2 million, or a 12.6% operating income margin percentage for the second quarter of 2017, with the decrease in operating margin reflective of costs associated with the integration of Business Ink and the continued increase in planned investments aimed at generating future long-term growth in our business.
Diluted EPS for the second quarter of 2018 was $0.46 compared to $0.35 for the second quarter of 2017, with the increase mainly attributed a lower effective income tax rate, primarily resulting from the U.S. Tax Reform enacted in December 2017.
As of June 30, 2018, we had cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments of $186.4 million, as compared to $222.1 million as of March 31, 2018 and $261.4 million as of as of December 31, 2017.
Our cash flows from operating activities for the quarter ended June 30, 2018 were $(3.6) million, which were negatively impacted by an increase in accounts receivable primarily related to the timing around a recurring client payment that was delayed at quarter-end.
