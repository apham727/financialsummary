The segment table located in Note 4 to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements sets forth the Company’s results of operations (in thousands) including net sales, gross profit, and operating income for each of the Company’s five segments during the periods shown.
For each line item in the table, the total of the outdoor, fitness, marine, auto, and aviation segments' amounts equals the amount in the condensed consolidated statements of income included in Item 1.
Fitness was the largest portion of our revenue mix at 23% in the first quarter of 2018 compared to 22% in the first quarter of 2017.
Auto revenue represented the largest portion of our revenue mix in the first quarter of 2017 at 25% and declined to 20% in the first quarter of 2018.
Total unit sales decreased to 2,956 in the first quarter of 2018 from 3,099 in the same period of 2017.
Revenues in the outdoor segment increased 24% from the year-ago quarter primarily driven by significant growth in the wearable category.
The increase in revenues outpaced the increase in cost of goods sold, which resulted in a 190 basis point decrease in cost of goods sold as a percent of revenues compared to the year-ago quarter.
In the auto segment, the decline in cost of goods sold was largely consistent with the segment revenue declines.
Gross profit dollars in the first quarter of 2018 increased 14% while gross margin increased 190 basis points compared to the first quarter of 2017.
The absolute dollar increase was primarily attributable to personnel costs and expenses from prior year acquisitions in the first quarter of 2018.Item 5.Other Information Item 6.Exhibits Exhibit 31.2Certification of Chief Financial Officer pursuant to Exchange Act Rule 13a-14(a) or 15d-14(a).The following information supplements and amends the discussion set forth under Part I, Item 3 "Legal Proceedings" in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 30, 2017.
