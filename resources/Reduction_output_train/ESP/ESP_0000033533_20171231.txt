However, the concentration of our business in the rail industry, and in equipment for military applications and industrial applications and our customer concentrations expose us to on-going associated risks.
These risks include, without limitation, requirements for power supplies in the rail industry, dependence on appropriations from the United States Government and the governments of foreign nations, program allocations, and the potential of governmental termination of orders for convenience, and the general strength of the industry sectors in which our customers transact business.
In order to maintain a balanced business, we are continuing to place an emphasis on securing “build to print” opportunities, which will allow production work to go directly to the manufacturing floor, limiting the impact on our engineering staff.
New orders received in the six months of fiscal year 2018 were approximately $14.3 million as compared to $10.9 million of new orders received in the first six months of fiscal year 2017.
The estimate of the December 31, 2017 backlog to be shipped in fiscal year 2018 is subject to future events, which may cause the amount of the backlog actually shipped to differ from such estimate.
In addition to the backlog, the Company currently has outstanding opportunities representing in excess of $69 million in the aggregate as of January 30, 2018 for both repeat and new programs.
However, there can be no assurance that the Company will acquire any of the anticipated orders described above, many of which are subject to allocations of the United States defense spending and factors affecting the defense industry.
Net sales to three significant customers represented 63.2% of the Company’s total sales for the three-month period ended December 31, 2017 and net sales to two significant customers represented 38.4% of the Company's total sales for the three-month period ended December 31, 2016.

The estimation of cost at completion of a contract is subject to numerous variables involving contract costs and estimates as to the length of time to complete the contract.
Net sales increased for the three months ended December 31, 2017 to $11,531,105 as compared to $5,667,624 for the same period in 2016.
For the three and six months ended December 31, 2017, the increase in net sales is primarily due to an increase in power supply sales resulting from the commencement of shipments on a new significant military contract in the current fiscal year.
Gross profit as a percentage of sales was 26.7% and 19.1%, for the three months ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively.
Gross profit as a percentage of sales was 23.8% and 20.7%, for the six months ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively.
The gross profits on mature products and build to print contracts are typically higher as compared to products which are still in the engineering development stage or in early stages of production.
In the case of the latter, the Company can incur what it refers to as “loss contracts,” meaning engineering design contracts in which the Company invests with the objective of developing future product sales.Item 5.Other Information Item 6.Exhibits 31.1Certification of the Chief Executive Officer pursuant to Rules 13a-14(a) and 15d-14(a) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as adopted pursuant to Section 302 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 32.1Certification of the Chief Executive Officer pursuant to 18 U.S.C.Item 5.Other Information 31.1Certification of the Chief Executive Officer pursuant to Rules 13a-14(a) and 15d-14(a) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as adopted pursuant to Section 302 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 31.2Certification of the Principal Financial Officer pursuant to Rules 13a-14(a) and 15d-14(a) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as adopted pursuant to Section 302 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 32.1Certification of the Chief Executive Officer pursuant to 18 U.S.C.
