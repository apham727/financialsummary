The interim financial data as of September 30, 2018, and for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2018 are unaudited; however, in the opinion of MKS, the interim data includes all adjustments, consisting of normal recurring adjustments, necessary for a fair statement of the results for the interim periods.
The unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in the MKS Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2017 filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on February 28, 2018.
Until the Company completes its analysis and receives additional guidance, the Company is not able to determine if the impact of ASU 2018-05 is material to the Company’s consolidated financial statements in any period.
In May 2017, the FASB issued ASU 2017-09, “Compensation-Stock Compensation (Topic 718)-Scope of Modification Accounting.” This standard provides guidance about which changes to the terms or conditions of a share-based payment award require an entity to apply modification accounting in Topic 718.
The Company adopted this ASU during the three month period ended March 31, 2018.
The adoption of this ASU did not have a material impact on the Company’s consolidated financial statements.
In March 2017, the FASB issued ASU 2017-07, “Compensation-Retirement Benefits (Topic 715)-Improving the Presentation of Net Periodic Pension Cost and Net Periodic Postretirement Benefit Cost.” This standard requires that an employer disaggregate the service cost component from the other components of net benefit cost.
The Company adopted this ASU during the three month period ended March 31, 2018.
The adoption of this ASU did not have a material impact on the Company’s consolidated financial statements.
In January 2017, the FASB issued ASU 2017-01, “Business Combinations (Topic 805)-Clarifying the Definition of a Business.” This standard clarifies the definition of a business with the objective of adding guidance to assist entities with evaluating whether transactions should be accounted for as acquisitions (or disposals) of assets or businesses.
The Company adopted this ASU during the three month period ended March 31, 2018.
The adoption of this ASU did not have a material impact on the Company’s consolidated financial statements.
This standard requires that a statement of cash flows explain the change during the period in the total of cash, cash equivalents and amounts generally described as restricted cash and restricted cash equivalents.
Therefore, amounts generally described as restricted cash and restricted cash equivalents should be included with cash and cash equivalents when reconciling the beginning-of-period and end-of-period total amounts shown on the statement of cash flows.
The Company adopted this ASU during the three month period ended March 31, 2018.
