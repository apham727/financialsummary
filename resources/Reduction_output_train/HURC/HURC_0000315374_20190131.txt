We design, manufacture and sell computerized (i.e., Computer Numeric Control, or CNC) machine tools, consisting primarily of vertical machining centers (mills) and turning centers (lathes), to companies in the metal cutting industry through a worldwide sales, service and distribution network.
Our computer control systems and software products are primarily sold as integral components of our computerized machine tool products.
We also provide machine tool components, software options, control upgrades, accessories and replacement parts for our products, as well as customer service, training and applications support.
The condensed financial information as of January 31, 2019 and for the three months ended January 31, 2019 and January 31, 2018 is unaudited.

We adopted Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) 606 on November 1, 2018, the start of our 2019 fiscal year, and elected the modified retrospective method as of the date of adoption.
Prior to the adoption of ASC 606, our revenues have already been recognized in the same manner as those required by ASC 606.

The following overview is intended to provide a brief explanation of the principal factors that have contributed to our recent financial performance.
During the first three months of fiscal 2019, approximately 48% of our revenues were attributable to customers in Europe, where we typically sell more of our higher-performance, higher-priced VMX series machines.
We also have our own direct sales and service organizations in China, France, Germany, India, Italy, Poland, Singapore, South Africa, Taiwan, the United Kingdom and certain parts of the United States, which are among the world's principal machine tool consumption markets.
Our sales to foreign customers are denominated, and payments by those customers are made, in the prevailing currencies in the countries in which those customers are located (primarily the Euro, Pound Sterling and Chinese Yuan).
For example, when the U.S. Dollar weakens in value relative to a foreign currency, sales made, and expenses incurred, in that currency when translated to U.S.

Although the majority of our computer control systems and software products are proprietary, they predominantly use industry standard personal computer components.
Our computer control systems and software products are primarily sold as integral components of our computerized machine tool products.

We adopted Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) 606 on November 1, 2018, the start of our 2019 fiscal year, and elected the modified retrospective method as of the date of adoption.
We record revenues based on a five-step model in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board, or FASB, guidance codified in ASC 606 “Revenue from Contracts with Customers.” In accordance with ASC 606, we have defined contracts as agreements with our customers and distributors in the form of purchase orders, packing or shipping documents, invoices, and, periodically, verbal requests for components and accessories.
For each contract, we identify our performance obligations, which is delivering goods or services, determine the transaction price, allocate the contract transaction price to the performance obligations (when applicable), and recognize the revenue when (or as) the performance obligation is transferred to the customer.
For our five-axis machines that we install, we estimate the fair value of the installation performance obligation and defer the recognition of that revenue.
We consider these services to be perfunctory within the context of the contract, as the value of these services typically does not rise to a material level as a component of the total contract value.
Service fees from maintenance contracts are deferred and recognized in earnings on a prorata basis over the term of the contract, and are generally sold on a stand-alone basis.
Customer discounts and estimated product returns are considered variable consideration and are recorded as a reduction of revenue in the same period that the related sales are recorded.
