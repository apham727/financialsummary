Fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability (i.e., the “exit price”) in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date.
Level 1 inputs are quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the Company has the ability to access at the measurement date.
The fair value of the Company’s cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable and accounts payable approximate their carrying value due to their short-term nature.
The income approach is based on a discounted cash flow analysis and calculates the fair value by estimating the after-tax cash flows attributable to a reporting unit and then discounting the after-tax cash flows to a present value using a risk-adjusted discount rate.
Assumptions used in the discounted cash flow analysis require the exercise of significant judgment, including judgment about appropriate discount rates, terminal values, growth rates and the amount and timing of expected future cash flows.
Renewal options are included in the lease term to the extent the Company is reasonably certain to exercise the option.
The incremental borrowing rate represents the Company’s ability to borrow on a collateralized basis over a term similar to the lease term.
The leases typically contain renewal options for periods ranging from one year to ten years and require the Company to pay real estate taxes and other operating costs.
The above payment schedule does not include lease payments of $395 in 2020 and $463 in 2021 for the Company’s idle facility in Fullerton, California that have been accrued on the condensed consolidated balance sheets in accrued liabilities.
For the 13 weeks and 26 weeks ended September 1, 2019, the Company’s operating lease expense was $95 and $190, respectively.
