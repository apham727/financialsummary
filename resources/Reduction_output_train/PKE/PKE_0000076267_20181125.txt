The Company's total net sales from continuing operations in the 13 weeks and 39 weeks ended November 25, 2018 were $12.9 million and $34.5 million, respectively, compared to $10.2 million and $30.3 million in the 13 weeks and 39 weeks ended November 26, 2017, respectively.

The Company’s total net sales from continuing operations worldwide in the 13 weeks ended November 25, 2018 increased to $12.9 million from $10.2 million in the 13 weeks ended November 26, 2017.
The Company’s total net sales from continuing operations worldwide in the 39 weeks ended November 25, 2018 increased to $34.5 million from $30.3 million in the 39 weeks ended November 26, 2017.
The Company’s gross profit from continuing operations in the 39 weeks ended November 25, 2018 was higher than its gross profit from continuing operations in the prior year’s comparable period, and the gross profit from continuing operations as a percentage of sales for the Company’s worldwide operations in the 39 weeks ended November 25, 2018 increased to 29.8% from 27.9% in the 39 weeks ended November 26, 2017.
The higher gross profit margins from continuing operations for the 13 weeks and 39 weeks ended November 25, 2018 compared to the 13 weeks and 39 weeks ended November 26, 2017 were principally a result of higher sales, reduced salaried headcount, primarily through attrition, and the partially fixed nature of overhead expenses in the 13 weeks and 39 weeks ended November 25, 2018 compared to the 13 weeks and 39 weeks ended November 26, 2017.
Selling, general and administrative expenses from continuing operations decreased by $526,000 during the 13 weeks ended November 25, 2018, or by 21%, and decreased by $989,000 during the 39 weeks ended November 25, 2018, or by 14%, compared to last fiscal year's comparable periods, and these expenses, measured as percentages of sales from continuing operations, were 15.4% and 18.0%, respectively, in the 13 weeks and 39 weeks ended November 25, 2018 compared to 24.5% and 23.7%, respectively, in the 13 weeks and 39 weeks ended November 26, 2017.
The decreases in such expenses during the 13 weeks and 39 weeks ended November 25, 2018 were primarily the result of lower payroll, travel and entertainment and stock option expenses.
Selling, general and administrative expenses from continuing operations included stock option expenses of $194,000 and $594,000, respectively, for the 13 weeks and 39 weeks ended November 25, 2018, compared to stock option expenses of $234,000 and $709,000, respectively, for the 13 weeks and 39 weeks ended November 26, 2017.
For the reasons set forth above, the Company’s earnings from continuing operations were $2.3 million and $4.1 million, respectively, for the 13 weeks and 39 weeks ended November 25, 2018 compared to $0.5 million and $1.3 million, respectively, for the 13 weeks and 39 weeks ended November 26, 2017.
Interest and other income from continuing operations was $393,000 and $1.1 million, respectively, for the 13 weeks and 39 weeks ended November 25, 2018, compared to $734,000 and $2.2 million, respectively, for last fiscal year's comparable periods.
Interest income decreased 46% and 51%, respectively, for the 13 weeks and 39 weeks ended November 25, 2018 primarily as a result of lower average balances of marketable securities held by the Company in the 13 weeks and 39 weeks ended November 25, 2018, compared to last fiscal year's comparable periods, partially offset by higher weighted average interest rates.
The Company's effective income tax rates from continuing operations for the 13 weeks and 39 weeks ended November 25, 2018 were 22.9% and 8.8%, respectively, compared to 31.3% and 25.6%, respectively, for the 13 weeks and 39 weeks ended November 26, 2017.

The Company’s net earnings from discontinued operations were higher in the 13 weeks ended November 25, 2018 compared to the 13 weeks ended November 26, 2017 primarily as a result of lower restructuring charges and a gain of $2,945 realized on the sale of its New England Laminates Co., Inc. facility located in Newburgh, New York.
The Company’s net earnings from discontinued operations were higher in the 39-week period ended November 25, 2018 than in last fiscal year’s comparable period, primarily as a result of lower restructuring charges and higher sales, compared to last year’s comparable period, and a one-time litigation expense of $375,000 in the 39-week period ended November 26, 2017.
The restructuring expenses were $61,000 and $231,000 during the 13-week and 39-week periods ended November 25, 2018, respectively, and $360,000 and $4.4 million during the 13-week and 39-week periods ended November 26, 2017, respectively.
