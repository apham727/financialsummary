In October 2015, Corning announced a strategy and capital allocation framework (the “Framework”) that reflects the Company’s financial and operational strengths, as well as its ongoing commitment to increasing shareholder value.
Net sales in the three months ended March 31, 2018 were $2,500 million, compared to $2,375 million in the same period in 2017.
The increase was driven by higher sales in the Optical Communications, Environmental Technologies and Life Sciences segments, up $68 million, $47 million and $22 million, respectively.

The translation impact of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, including the impact of hedges realized in the current quarter, did not materially impact Corning’s consolidated net loss in the three months ended March 31, 2018 when compared to the same period in 2017.
We anticipate Corning’s LCD glass volume will grow faster than the expected LCD glass market growth of mid-single digits, driven by the ramp of our Gen 10.5 facility in China.
In the Optical Communications segment, we expect sales to increase by about 10%, excluding any contribution from the pending acquisition of 3M’s Communications Market Division, driven by strong demand from carrier and enterprise network customers, supported by our planned capacity additions.
We expect sales growth of approximately 10% in our Environmental Technologies segment, driven by continued strength in automotive product sales, on-going improvements in the heavy-duty diesel market and from the commercial launch of gas-particulate filters.

·    An increase of $22 million in the Life Sciences segment, driven by higher sales in North America and China.
Movements in foreign exchange rates impacted Corning’s consolidated net sales in the amount of $87 million in the three months ended March 31, 2018, when compared to the prior year.

As a percentage of sales, these expenses increased slightly in the first quarter, when compared to the same period last year.
Equity in earnings of affiliated companies decreased by $41 million, driven largely by the absence of a $46 million gain recorded in the first quarter of 2017 resulting from the modification of long-term sales agreements with a customer of HSG.

The translation impact of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, including the impact of hedges realized in the current quarter, did not materially impact Corning’s consolidated loss before income taxes in the three months ended March 31, 2018 when compared to the same period in 2017.
For the three months ended March 31, 2018 comprehensive (loss) income decreased by $890 million when compared to the same period in 2017, due to a decrease in net income of $675 million, the negative impact of the change in foreign currency translation gains and losses of $186 million, driven primarily by the Japanese yen and the euro, and a decrease in net unrealized gains of designated hedges of $26 million.

Additionally, Corning has adopted the use of constant currency reporting for our Display Technologies and Specialty Materials segments for the Japanese yen, South Korean won, Chinese yuan and New Taiwan dollar currencies.

In the three months ended March 31, 2018, we generated core earnings of $299 million or $0.31 per share, compared to core earnings generated in the three months ended March 31, 2017 of $376 million, or $0.36 per share.
Included in core earnings for the three months ended March 31, 2018 and 2017 is net periodic pension expense in the amounts of $12 million and $13 million, respectively.
