GAAP”) have been condensed or omitted from these condensed consolidated financial statements pursuant to the rules and regulations, including the interim reporting requirements, of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”).
The Company’s significant accounting policies are summarized in Note 1 of the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018.
In connection with the adoption, we elected to utilize the Comparatives Under 840 Option whereby the Company will continue to present prior period financial statements and disclosures under ASC 840.
In addition, we elected the transition package of three practical expedients permitted within the standard, which eliminates the requirements to reassess prior conclusions about lease identification, lease classification and initial direct costs.
Further, we elected a short-term lease exception policy, permitting us to not apply the recognition requirements of this standard to short-term leases (i.e. leases with terms of 12 months or less) and an accounting policy to account for lease and non-lease components as a single component for certain classes of assets.
The change in balance of our unbilled receivables from December 31, 2018 to September 30, 2019 primarily relates to a timing difference between the Company’s performance (i.e. when our product is shipped to a customer-controlled hub) and the point at which the Company can invoice the customer per the terms of the customer contract (i.e. when the customer pulls our product from the customer-controlled hub).
The aggregate amount of transaction price allocated to remaining performance obligations that have not been satisfied as of September 30, 2019 related to contracts that exceed one year in duration amounted to $15.7 million, with expected contract expiration dates that range from 2020 - 2025.
As of September 30, 2019 and December 31, 2018, our available-for-sale securities primarily consisted of investments held in a rabbi trust which are intended to fund the Company’s Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan (“SERP”) obligations.
The Company does not have any financial assets measured at fair value on a recurring basis categorized as Level 3, and there were no transfers in or out of Level 1, Level 2 or Level 3 during the nine months ended September 30, 2019 or September 30, 2018.
The fair value of the Company’s long-term debt is estimated using a discounted cash flow method based on interest rates that are currently available for debt issuances with similar terms and maturities.
At September 30, 2019 and December 31, 2018, the estimated fair value of total debt was $116.8 million and $117.9 million, respectively, compared to a carrying amount of $112.3 million and $114.2 million, respectively.
The Company did not have any other financial liabilities within the scope of the fair value disclosure requirements as of September 30, 2019.
The Company determined that current business conditions, and the resulting decrease in the Company’s projected undiscounted and discounted cash flows, together with the accompanying stock price decline, constituted a triggering event, which required the Company to perform interim impairment tests related to its long-lived assets and goodwill during the third quarter of 2019.
The Company’s interim test on its long-lived assets indicated that the carrying value of its long-lived assets was recoverable and that no impairment existed as of the July 31, 2019 testing date.
The valuation test, which heavily weights future discounted cash flow projections, indicated impairment of the goodwill associated with the Company’s North America reporting unit.

The Company has also experienced margin pressure throughout 2019 due to lower sales volumes and high material costs from 2018 which continue to run through the Company’s statement of operations.
As a result of these ongoing factors, the Company expects the balance of 2019 to remain challenging from both a sales and margin perspective.
Sales declines in each of our segments during the third quarter of 2019 reflected lower sales into our distribution channel as our distribution partners continue to work down their level of inventory on hand.
Sales in our Asia segment in the third quarter of 2019 were down versus 2018 as a result of customers working down heightened inventory levels which had been built up during 2018 in response to new product launches and the tariffs that went into effect in 2018 and 2019.
Sales of our Connectivity Solutions products during the third quarter of 2019 declined $4.0 million primarily due to lower demand from military customers as compared to last year's third quarter, and reduced volume of product flowing through our distribution channels as our distribution partners continue to work down inventory levels that had been built up in 2018 ahead of the tariffs.
These factors also impacted the nine-month period ended September 30, 2019, which declined $8.9 million from the same period of 2018, partially offset by higher sales to commercial aerospace customers during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2019.
Sales of our Magnetic Solutions products during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2019 were down $13.3 million and $18.0 million, respectively, from the same periods of 2018 while inventory levels built up in advance of a customer's new program launch during 2018 are worked through.
Sales of our Power Solutions and Protection products were $4.7 million lower in the third quarter of 2019 compared to the same quarter of 2018.
Sales during the nine-month period ended September 30, 2019 decreased by $1.2 million from the same period of 2018, as stronger sales into datacenter applications during the first quarter of 2019 lessened the impact of sales declines during the second and third quarters of 2019.
Material costs as a percentage of sales were higher during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2019 compared to the same periods of 2018 primarily due to the industry-wide supply constraints related to certain of our purchased components during 2018.
