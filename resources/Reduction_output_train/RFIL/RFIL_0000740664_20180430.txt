This analysis requires significant judgments, including estimation of future cash flows, which is dependent on internal forecasts, estimation of the long-term rate of growth for our business, estimation of the useful life over which cash flows will occur, and determination of our weighted average cost of capital.

These inputs include the expected term of employee stock options, the expected volatility of the stock price, the risk-free interest rate and expected dividends.
Subsequent to the fiscal year ended October 31, 2017, the Company experienced a substantial increase in orders for its products in the Custom Cabling Manufacturing and Assembly segment.
During the quarter ended April 30, 2018, the Company filled a substantial amount of the January 31, 2018 backlog, which contributed to the large sales for the three months ended April 30, 2018.
Despite shipping most of the January 31, 2018 backlog in the three month period ended April 30, 2018, the Custom Cabling Manufacturing and Assembly segment backlog stood at $9.5 million as of April 30, 2018 as a result of additional new orders received during the second quarter.
The Company is unable to predict future orders for its products, but it currently anticipates that its net sales for second half of the current fiscal year will likely be less than the first half.
Nevertheless, the Company’s liquidity and available capital resources are expected to continue to improve during the balance of the current fiscal year.
The Company generated cash of $2.5 million during the six months ended April 30, 2018 due largely to the impact of increased sales, which resulted in net income of $3.7 million.
This net decrease in cash was partially offset by an increase in cash from noncash credits of $0.5 million primarily from depreciation and amortization related to the acquisitions of Comnet, Rel-Tech and CompPro, and $0.1 million of stock-based compensation expense.
