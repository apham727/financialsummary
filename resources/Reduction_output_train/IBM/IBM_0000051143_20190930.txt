The change in the operating (non-GAAP) tax rate was primarily driven by the same factors mentioned above.
Operating (non-GAAP) income from continuing operations of $2.4 billion decreased 23.6 percent with an operating (non-GAAP) income margin from continuing operations of 13.3 percent, down 3.4 points year to year.
