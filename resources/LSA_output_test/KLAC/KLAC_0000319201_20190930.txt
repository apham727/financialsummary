Certain information and footnote disclosures normally included in financial statements prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America have been condensed or omitted pursuant to such rules and regulations.
All significant intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated.
The reclassifications did not have material effects on the prior year’s Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets, Statements of Operations, Comprehensive Income and Cash Flows.
For additional details, refer to Note 6 “Business Combinations” of the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements.
Prior periods were not retrospectively restated, and accordingly, the Consolidated Balance Sheet as of June 30, 2019, and the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations for the three months ended September 30, 2018 were prepared using accounting standards that were different than those in effect for the three months ended September 30, 2019.
Variable lease payments, consisting primarily of reimbursement of costs incurred by lessors for common area maintenance, real estate taxes, and insurance are not included in the lease liability and are recognized as they are incurred.
As most of our leases do not provide an implicit rate, we use our incremental borrowing rate at lease commencement to measure ROU assets and lease liabilities.
The incremental borrowing rate used by us is based on baseline rates and adjusted by the credit spreads commensurate with our secured borrowing rate, over a similar term.
For leases with a term of one year or less, we have elected not to record the ROU asset or liability.
Consistent with ASC 840, leases will be classified as either finance or operating, with classification affecting the pattern of expense recognition in the statements of operations.In addition to serving the semiconductor industry, we also provide a range of technology solutions to a number of other high technology industries, including advanced packaging, light emitting diode (“LED”), power devices, compound semiconductor, and data storage industries, as well as general materials research.
Our products and services are used by the vast majority of bare wafer, IC, lithography reticle (“reticle” or “mask”) and hard disk drive manufacturers around the world.Ongoing changes in the technology industry, as well as the semiconductor industry in particular, could expose our business to significant risks.
The industries that we serve, including the semiconductor, flat panel display and printed circuit board industries, are constantly developing and changing over time.
•As a result of this consolidation, the customers that survive the consolidation represent a greater portion of our sales and, consequently, have greater commercial negotiating leverage.
Many of our large customers have more aggressive policies regarding engaging alternative, second-source suppliers for the products we offer and, in addition, may seek and, on occasion, receive pricing, payment, intellectual property-related or other commercial terms that may have an adverse impact on our business.
Any of these changes could negatively impact our prices, customer orders, revenues and gross margins.
