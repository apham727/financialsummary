If after reviewing the totality of events or circumstances, we determine that it is not likely that the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount, then we test for impairment through the application of a fair value based test.
Intangible assets are initially recorded at their fair market values determined on quoted market prices in active markets, if available, or recognized valuation models.
Intangible assets that have finite useful lives are amortized over their useful lives either on a straight-line basis or over their projected future cash flows and are tested for impairment when events or changes in circumstances occur that indicate possible impairment.
The goodwill balance in its entirety relates to our IMES reporting unit which is included in our Healthcare segment.
