The Company is currently evaluating the effect this ASU will have on its consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.
Results for reporting periods beginning on or after January 1, 2019 are presented under ASC 842, while prior period amounts were not adjusted and continue to be reported in accordance with the Company’s historic accounting under ASC 840 “Leases”.
As of March 31, 2019, the Company did not hold any investments with unrealized losses that are considered to be other-than-temporary.

As of March 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018, the allowance for doubtful accounts was not material.
The change in deferred revenue in the three months ended March 31, 2019 was primarily due to $89.4 million of revenue recognized, excluding the impact of netting contract assets and deferred revenue at the contract level, during the period that was included in deferred revenue at December 31, 2018, partially offset by new billings in advance of revenue recognition.
