Pegasystems Inc. (together with its subsidiaries, the Company) has prepared the accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements pursuant to the rules and regulations of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) regarding interim financial reporting.
On January 1, 2018, the Company adopted Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No.
2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606) using the full retrospective method which required that each prior reporting period presented be adjusted to reflect the application of this ASU.
In June 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued ASU No.
2016-13, Financial InstrumentsCredit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments, which requires measurement and recognition of expected credit losses for financial assets measured at amortized cost, including accounts receivable, upon initial recognition of that financial asset using a forward-looking expected loss model, rather than an incurred loss model.
The Company is currently evaluating the effect this ASU will have on its consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.
Any unrecognized license revenue from these arrangements is recognized in the period that control transfers or as a cumulative adjustment to retained earnings as of December 31, 2015.
Unbilled receivables in the Companys unaudited condensed consolidated balance sheets increased significantly upon adoption due to the revenue from term licenses being recognized prior to amounts being due, or prepaid, by clients and perpetual licenses with extended payment terms.
Includes cash, cash equivalents, marketable securities, income taxes receivable, other current assets, property and equipment, intangible assets, goodwill, and other long-term assets (as reflected in the consolidated balance sheets in the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2017).
Adoption of ASC 606 and ASC 340-40 did not change the Companys total cash provided by or used in operating, financing, or investing activities in the Companys unaudited condensed consolidated statements of cash flows for the nine months ended September 30, 2017.
As of September 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017, the allowance for doubtful accounts was not material.
The change in deferred revenue in the nine months ended September 30, 2018 was primarily due to $225.1 million of revenue recognized, excluding the impact of netting contract assets and deferred revenue at the contract level, during the period that was included in deferred revenue at December 31, 2017, partially offset by new billings in advance of revenue recognition.

This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q contains or incorporates forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.
We develop, market, license, and support software applications for customer engagement and digital process automation, in addition to licensing our Pega Platform application development product for clients that wish to build and extend their own applications.
The Pega Platform and applications help connect enterprises to their customers in real-time across channels, streamline business operations, and adapt to meet changing requirements.
Subscription revenue reflects client arrangements (term license, cloud, and maintenance) which may be subject to a renewal.
Financial Statements and Supplementary Data both of which are contained in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2017.
We account for revenue in accordance with ASC 606.
Judgment is required to determine whether each product and service is considered to be a distinct performance obligation that should be accounted for separately under the contract.
However, the selling price of our software licenses and cloud performance obligations are highly variable.
Thus, we estimate stand-alone selling price for software licenses and cloud performance obligations using the residual approach, determined based on total transaction price minus the stand-alone selling price of other performance obligations promised in the contract.
In applying our revenue recognition policy, we must determine which portions of our revenue are recognized in the current period and which portions must be deferred and recognized in future periods.
