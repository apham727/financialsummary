Pegasystems Inc. (together with its subsidiaries, the Company) has prepared the accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements pursuant to the rules and regulations of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) regarding interim financial reporting.
On January 1, 2018 the Company adopted Accounting Standards Update (ASU) ASU No.
2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606) using the full retrospective method which required each prior reporting period presented to be adjusted to reflect the application of this ASU.
In June 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued ASU No.
2016-13, Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments, which requires measurement and recognition of expected credit losses for financial assets measured at amortized cost, including accounts receivable, upon initial recognition of that financial asset using a forward-looking expected loss model, rather than an incurred loss model for credit losses.
The Company is currently evaluating the effect this ASU will have on its consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.
2016-02, Leases (Topic 842), which requires lessees to record most leases on their balance sheets, recognizing a lease liability for the obligation to make lease payments and a right-of-use asset for the right to use the underlying asset for the lease term.
Any unrecognized license revenue from these arrangements is recognized in the period that control transfers, as either a cumulative adjustment to retained earnings as of December 31, 2015 or as revenue in periods thereafter.
Unbilled receivables in the Companys unaudited condensed consolidated balance sheets increased significantly due to the revenue from perpetual license with extended payment terms and term license being recognized prior to amounts billed, or prepaid by, clients.
ASC 340-40 requires these costs to be recognized as an asset when incurred and to be expensed over the period of expected benefit, which is on average five years.
This change primarily impacts the Companys contracts related to multi-year cloud offerings, maintenance on term and perpetual licenses, and those long-term term and perpetual licenses with client usage rights that increase over time.
(1)  Includes cash and cash equivalents, marketable securities, income taxes receivable, other current assets, property and equipment, intangible assets, goodwill, and other long-term assets (as reflected in the consolidated balance sheets in the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2017).

This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q contains or incorporates forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.
We develop, market, license, and support software applications for customer engagement and digital process automation, in addition to licensing our Pega Platform application development product for clients that wish to build and extend their own applications.
The Pega Platform and applications help connect enterprises to their customers in real-time across channels, streamline business operations, and adapt to meet changing requirements.
Our consulting revenue is primarily related to new license implementations.
Cloud arrangements are generally recognized in revenue over the term of the cloud contract, as compared to other arrangements, which are generally recognized in revenue on the contract effective date.
We account for revenue in accordance with ASC 606.
Our clients contracts typically contain promises to transfer multiple products and services.
Judgment is required to determine whether each product and service is considered to be a distinct performance obligation that should be accounted for separately under the contract.
However, the selling price of our software licenses and cloud performance obligations are highly variable.
Thus, we estimate stand-alone selling price for software licenses and cloud performance obligations using the residual approach, determined based on total transaction price minus the stand-alone selling price of other performance obligations promised in the contract.
