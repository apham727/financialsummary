Leases will be classified as finance or operating, with classification affecting the pattern and classification of expense recognition in the income statement.
Consequently, financial information will not be updated and the disclosures required under the new standard will not be provided for earlier periods.
Upon adoption, we recognized lease liabilities of approximately $52 million, with corresponding ROU assets of the same amount, based on the present value of the remaining minimum rental payments under current leasing standards for our existing operating leases.
Additionally, we also reclassified approximately $19 million from "Property, plant and equipment, net" to "Operating lease right-of-use assets" related to prepaid leasehold land.
We elected the 'package of practical expedients', which permits us not to reassess under the new standard our prior conclusions about lease identification, lease classification and initial direct costs.
We elected the short-term lease recognition exemption for all leases that qualify.
This means, for those leases that qualify, we will not recognize ROU assets or lease liabilities, and this includes not recognizing ROU assets or lease liabilities for existing short-term leases of those assets in transition.
We also elected the practical expedient to not separate lease and non-lease components for our office leases.
In August 2018, the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") issued Release No.
We adopted this new rule beginning with our financial reporting for the quarter ended March 31, 2019.
The ASU will replace the incurred loss impairment methodology under current GAAP with a methodology that reflects expected credit losses and requires consideration of a broader range of reasonable and supportable information to inform credit loss estimates.
We will be required to use a forward-looking expected credit loss model for accounts receivables and other financial instruments.
Entities are also required to record allowances for available-for-sale debt securities rather than reduce the carrying amount.
We do not plan to adopt the ASU earlier than our required effective date of January 1, 2020.
The impact of this new guidance on our accounting policies and financial statements is described below.
Additionally, in the first quarter of 2019, we granted performance-based restricted stock units to certain executives under our 2015 Equity Incentive Plan ("PRSUs").

We are not currently a party to any material litigation.
However, in the ordinary course of our business, we have in the past, are currently and will likely become involved in various legal proceedings, claims, and regulatory, tax or government inquiries and investigations, and could incur uninsured liability in any one or more of them.
In addition to the other information set forth in this Form 10-Q, you should carefully consider the risk factors discussed below.
Uncertainty about global and regional economic conditions poses a risk to us as businesses may decrease or postpone spending in response to events such as the impending Brexit, continued trade tensions and restrictions between the U.S. and other parts of the world, financial market volatility, tariffs or other trade restrictions, government austerity programs, government regulatory actions, negative financial news, geopolitical instability, declines in income or asset values, or other factors.
Moreover, there can be no assurance that our international sales will continue at existing levels or grow in accordance with our efforts to increase foreign market penetration.
In many foreign countries, particularly in those with developing economies, it is common to engage in business practices that are prohibited by U.S. regulations applicable to us such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act.
Although we have policies and procedures designed to ensure compliance with these laws, there can be no assurance that all of our employees, contractors and agents, including those based in or from countries where practices which violate such U.S. laws may be customary, will not take actions in violation of our policies.
