During the three months ended September 30, 2018, we recorded a non-cash out of period adjustment of $2.3 million related to the deferral of gross profit associated with intercompany purchases from our equity-method investee that should have been recognized when realized, through transactions with third-parties, beginning in January 2011.
We evaluated the adjustment from a qualitative and quantitative perspective and concluded that the amount of income was not material to any individual prior quarter or year and that the cumulative out of period adjustment was not expected to be material to our full year 2018 results.
