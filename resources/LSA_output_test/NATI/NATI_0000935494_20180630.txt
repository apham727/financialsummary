The impact of this new guidance on our accounting policies and operating results is also described below.
There were no other significant changes in our accounting policies during the six months ended June 30, 2018 compared to the significant accounting policies described in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2017.
Our allowance for doubtful accounts is based on historical experience.
We analyze historical bad debts, customer concentrations, customer creditworthiness and current economic trends when evaluating the adequacy of our allowance for doubtful accounts.
The current portion of unbilled receivables is included in accounts receivable, net on the consolidated balance sheet and is not material.
Shipping and handling costs associated with outbound freight after control over a product has transferred to a customer are accounted for as a fulfillment cost and are in included in cost of sales.
Under this method, we evaluated all contracts that were in effect at the beginning of 2018 as if those contracts had been accounted for under the new revenue standard.
A cumulative catch-up adjustment was recorded to beginning retained earnings to reflect the impact of all existing arrangements under the new revenue standard.
Historically, we have had to defer revenue for certain types of licenses arrangements and recognize revenue for such licenses ratably over the license term.
Our historical net cash flows are not impacted by this accounting change.
Revenue is recognized upon transfer of control of the promised products or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration we expect to receive in exchange for those products or services.
We enter into contracts that can include various combinations of our products or services, which are generally capable of being distinct and accounted for as separate performance obligations.
Revenue is recognized net of allowances for returns and any taxes collected from customers, which are subsequently remitted to governmental authorities.
Sales of most hardware components may also include optional extended hardware warranties, which typically provide additional service-type coverage for three years from the purchase date.
We also offer some term-based software licenses that expire, which are referred to as subscription arrangements.
We use a single amount to estimate SSP for items that are not sold separately, including perpetual and term licenses sold with software maintenance.

We are not currently a party to any material litigation.
However, in the ordinary course of our business, we are involved in a limited number of legal actions, both as plaintiff and defendant, and could incur uninsured liability in any one or more of them.
In addition to the other information set forth in this Form 10-Q, you should carefully consider the risk factors discussed below.
Uncertainty about global and regional economic conditions poses a risk to us as businesses may postpone spending in response to tighter credit, higher unemployment, financial market volatility, government austerity programs, negative financial news, geopolitical instability, declines in income or asset values, or other factors.
In March 2018, the U.S. imposed steel, aluminum, and other tariffs on imports from various countries.
We have made and expect to make significant investments in software development related to the new and enhanced features of this product.
