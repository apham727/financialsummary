Leases will be classified as finance or operating, with classification affecting the pattern and classification of expense recognition in the income statement.
Consequently, financial information will not be updated and the disclosures required under the new lease standard will not be provided for earlier periods.
Upon adoption, we recognized lease liabilities of approximately $52 million, with corresponding ROU assets of the same amount, based on the present value of the remaining minimum rental payments under current leasing standards for our existing operating leases.
Additionally, we also reclassified approximately $19 million from "Property, plant and equipment, net" to "Operating lease right-of-use assets" related to prepaid leasehold land.
We elected the short-term lease recognition exemption for all leases that qualify.
This means, for those leases that qualify, we will not recognize ROU assets or lease liabilities, and this includes not recognizing ROU assets or lease liabilities for existing short-term leases of those assets in transition.
We also elected the practical expedient to not separate lease and non-lease components for our office leases.
We adopted this new rule beginning with our financial reporting for the quarter ended March 31, 2019.
