All such adjustments are of a normal recurring nature.
In August 2017, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued Accounting Standards Update 2017-12, Derivatives and Hedging (Topic 815) - Targeted Improvements to Accounting for Hedging Activities (“ASU 2017-12”), which improves the financial reporting of hedging relationships to better portray the economic results of an entity’s risk management activities in its financial statements and makes certain targeted improvements to simplify the qualification and application of the hedge accounting compared to current GAAP.
In March 2017, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update 2017-07, Compensation—Retirement Benefits (Topic 715) - Improving the Presentation of Net Periodic Pension Cost and Net Periodic Postretirement Benefit Cost (“ASU 2017-07”).
If a separate line item is not used, the line item used in the income statement to present the other components of net benefit cost must be disclosed.
The update requires a lessee to recognize assets and liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets for leases with lease terms greater than 12 months.
In May 2014, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No.
2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, as amended (“ASU 2014-09”), to supersede nearly all existing revenue recognition guidance under GAAP.
The core principles of ASU 2014-09 are to recognize revenue when promised goods or services are transferred to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration that is expected to be received for those goods or services.
Application of the guidance in ASU 2014-09 is expected to require more judgment and estimates within the revenue recognition process compared to existing GAAP.
The company has established an implementation team inclusive of external advisors engaged to assist in evaluating potential differences compared to existing GAAP.
The Company has identified its revenue streams and is currently assessing each stream for potential impacts from the adoption of ASU 2014-09.
The Company does not currently expect significant changes in revenue recognition practices for continuing operations compared to existing GAAP.
The cash consideration paid for the acquisition was approximately $841 million, which consisted of £1.85 per share of PF common stock.

The PF acquisition was accounted for as a business combination.
Approximately $10.0 million of goodwill associated with the PF acquisition is expected to be deductible for tax purposes.

Sales taking into account these adjustments are referred to as “organic sales.” Management believes that providing this additional information is useful to readers to better assess and understand operating performance, especially when comparing results with prior periods or forecasting performance for future periods, primarily because management typically monitors the business both including and excluding these adjustments to GAAP results.
Management also uses these non-GAAP measures to establish operational goals and, in many cases, for measuring performance for compensation purposes.
However, any analysis of results on a non-GAAP basis should be used as a complement to, and in conjunction with, results presented in accordance with GAAP.
Avnet creates a vital link in the technology supply chain that connects the world’s leading electronic component manufacturers with a global customer base primarily comprised of original equipment manufacturers, electronic manufacturing services providers and original design manufacturers.
