Topic 842 requires companies to generally recognize operating and financing lease liabilities on the balance sheet and corresponding right-of-use assets created by those leases with lease terms of more than 12 months.
The Company intends to adopt Topic 842 when it becomes effective in the first quarter of fiscal 2020 using a modified retrospective approach.
The Company is currently evaluating the impact of its pending adoption of Topic 842 on its consolidated financial statements and expects that most of its operating lease commitments related to the Company’s real estate portfolio will be subject to the new standard and recognized as operating lease liabilities and right-of-use assets upon adoption, which will materially increase total assets and total liabilities relative to such amounts prior to adoption.Sales taking into account these adjustments are referred to as “organic sales.” Management believes that providing this additional information is useful to readers to better assess and understand operating performance, especially when comparing results with prior periods or forecasting performance for future periods, primarily because management typically monitors the business both including and excluding these adjustments to GAAP results.
Management also uses these non-GAAP measures to establish operational goals and, in many cases, for measuring performance for compensation purposes.
However, any analysis of results on a non-GAAP basis should be used as a complement to, and in conjunction with, results presented in accordance with GAAP.
