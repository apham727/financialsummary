Readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these forward- looking statements as a prediction of actual results.
Any forward-looking statement speaks only as of the date on which it is made.
The Company has no obligation or intent to release publicly any revisions to any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events, or otherwise.
We remain focused on executing our strategy for growth while streamlining the organization and emphasizing continuous improvement in quality, delivery, cost and innovation as we drive the One Allied approach and expand our value proposition for our customers.
Also, we continue to build a pipeline of exciting market-based application opportunities.
Sales cycles are long and the time from being selected for the solution development to full rate production can be longer, yet we believe we are building a scalable foundation which can deliver strong returns on those investments.
Sales to U.S. customers were 55% of total sales for the third quarter 2018 compared with 53% for the same period last year, with the balance of sales to customers primarily in Europe, Canada and Asia.
Sales volume increased by 24% for the nine months ended September 30, 2018, and there was a 3% favorable currency impact.
The Company believes EBITDA is often a useful measure of a Companys operating performance and is a significant basis used by the Companys management to measure the operating performance of the Companys business because EBITDA excludes charges for depreciation, amortization and interest expense that have resulted from our debt financings, as well as our provision for income tax expense.
EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA do not represent and should not be considered as an alternative to net income, operating income, net cash provided by operating activities or any other measure for determining operating performance or liquidity that is calculated in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.
Capital expenditures are expected to increase for the remainder of 2018 to support our new contract wins along with our continued IT infrastructure enhancements.
During the second and third quarters of 2018, we also utilized our foreign revolver to make $3,000 of capital investment into our Changzhou operation funding expansion and future capital spending in support of recently announced contract wins.
During the nine months ended September 30, 2018, we made net borrowings of $9,308 from our Revolving Facility obligation compared to net payments of $9,214 for the same period in 2017.
At September 30, 2018, we had $62,480 of obligations under the Revolving Facility.

We have foreign operations in The Netherlands, Sweden, Germany, China, Portugal, Czech Republic, Canada and Mexico, which expose the Company to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations due to transactions denominated in Euros, Swedish Krona, Chinese Renminbi, Czech Krona, Canadian dollar and Mexican pesos, respectively.
We estimate that foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations during the quarter ended September 30, 2018 decreased sales in comparison to quarter ended September 30, 2017 by approximately $700.
For the nine months ended September 30, 2018 we estimate that foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations increased sales by approximately $5,500 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2017.
For the nine months ended September 30, 2018 and 2017, the translation adjustment was a loss of approximately $2,100 and a gain of approximately $5,600, respectively.
A hypothetical 10% change in the value of the U.S. dollar in relation to our most significant foreign currency net assets would have had an impact of approximately $6,100 on our foreign net assets as of September 30, 2018.
Interest rates on our Revolving Facility are based on the LIBOR plus a margin of 1.00% to 2.25% (currently 1.50%) or the Prime Rate plus a margin of 0% to 1.25% (currently 0.50%), in each case depending on the Companys ratio of total funded indebtedness to Consolidated EBITDA.
