Sales to U.S. customers were 58% of total sales for the quarter compared with 52% for the same period last year, with the balance of sales to customers primarily in Europe, Canada and Asia.

Sales to U.S. customers were 56% of total sales for 2019 compared with 52% for the same period last year, with the balance of sales to customers primarily in Europe, Canada and Asia.
Revenue excluding foreign currency exchange impacts, EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are provided for information purposes only and are not measures of financial performance under GAAP.
The Company believes that revenue excluding foreign currency exchange impacts is a useful measure in analyzing organic sales results.
The Company excludes the effect of currency translation from revenue for this measure because currency translation is not under managements control, is subject to volatility and can obscure underlying business trends.
The Company also believes that Adjusted EBITDA provides helpful information about the operating performance of its business.
EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA do not represent and should not be considered as an alternative to net income, operating income, net cash provided by operating activities or any other measure for determining operating performance or liquidity that is calculated in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.
The Companys liquidity position as measured by cash and cash equivalents increased by $1,790 to a balance of $10,463 at June 30, 2019 from December 31, 2018.
During the second quarter of 2019, the increase in cash provided by operating activities is primarily due to a decrease in working capital needs primarily for inventories despite increased revenues along with higher levels of orders, particularly in the second quarter of 2019.
Purchases of property and equipment were $6,401 during 2019 compared to $5,555 for 2018.
The Credit Agreement contains certain financial covenants related to minimum interest coverage and total leverage ratio at the end of each quarter.

We have foreign operations in The Netherlands, Sweden, Germany, China, Portugal, Canada and Mexico, which expose the Company to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations due to transactions denominated in Euros, Swedish Krona, Chinese Renminbi, Canadian dollar and Mexican pesos, respectively.
For the six months ended June 30, 2019 we estimate that foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations decreased sales by approximately $5,200 compared to the six months ended June 30, 2018.
A hypothetical 10% change in the value of the U.S. dollar in relation to our most significant foreign currency net assets would have had an impact of approximately $7,100 on our foreign net assets as of June 30, 2018.
Interest rates on our Revolving Facility are based on the LIBOR plus a margin of 1.00% to 2.25% (currently 2.0%) or the Prime Rate plus a margin of 0% to 1.25% (currently 1.0%), in each case depending on the Companys ratio of total funded indebtedness to Consolidated EBITDA.
During October 2013, the Company entered into two interest rate swaps with a combined notional of $25,000 that amortized quarterly to a notional of $6,673 at the September 2018 maturity.
Neither of these interest rate swaps is currently active, one was liquidated as part of the 2016 debt refinancing and the other matured in September 2018.
