Effective January 1, 2018, the Company adopted Topic 606 using the modified retrospective transition method, resulting in accounting policy changes surrounding revenue recognition which replaced certain related policies discussed under Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates (in Item 7) and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (in Note 1) of the Company’s 2017 Annual Report.
Less than 5% of our net sales are recognized over time, as the associated contracts relate to the sale of goods with no alternative use as they are only sold to a single customer and whose underlying contract terms provide the Company with an enforceable right to payment, including a reasonable profit margin, for performance completed to date, in the event of customer termination.
Sales to certain distributors and resellers are made under terms allowing certain price adjustments and limited rights of return of the Company’s products held in their inventory or upon sale to their end customers.
The reserve is recorded as a reduction to revenue in the same period that the related revenue is recorded and is calculated based on an analysis of historical claims and returns over a period of time to appropriately account for current pricing and business trends.
Standard product warranty coverage which provides assurance that our products will conform to the contractually agreed-upon specifications for a limited period from the date of shipment is typically offered, while extended or separately-priced warranty coverage is typically not offered.
We estimate our warranty liability based on historical experience, product history, and current trends, and record warranty expense in cost of sales in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income.
Contract assets represent unbilled receivables, which generally arise when revenue recognized over time exceed amounts billed to customers.
Contract liabilities represent billings or advanced consideration received from customers in excess of revenue recognized to date.
Contract assets and contract liabilities recorded in the Company’s Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets were not significant both at the date of adoption and as of September 30, 2018.
The Company evaluates the performance of business units on, among other things, profit or loss from operations before interest, headquarters’ expense allocations, stock-based compensation expense, income taxes, amortization related to certain intangible assets and nonrecurring gains and losses.
These treasury shares have been retired by the Company, accordingly common stock and retained earnings were reduced.
The price and timing of any future purchases under the 2018 Stock Repurchase Program will depend on factors such as levels of cash generation from operations, the volume of stock option exercises by employees, cash requirements for acquisitions, dividends, economic and market conditions and stock price.

The 2004 Directors Option Plan expired in May 2014, except that its terms continue with respect to outstanding options granted thereunder.
The Company offers various defined contribution plans for certain U.S. and foreign employees.
The Company performs its annual evaluation for the impairment of goodwill for the Company’s reporting units as of each July 1 or more frequently if an event occurs or circumstances change that would indicate that a reporting unit’s carrying amount may be impaired.
In accordance with applicable guidance, an entity is not required to calculate the fair value of a reporting unit if, after assessing these qualitative factors, the Company determines that it is more likely than not that its reporting unit’s fair value is greater than its carrying amount.
The Company reviews its identifiable intangible assets subject to amortization whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount may not be recoverable, while any indefinite-lived intangible assets that are not subject to amortization are reviewed at least annually for impairment.
There has been no impairment in 2018, 2017 or 2016 as a result of such reviews.
The USCP Notes are sold under customary terms in the commercial paper market and may be issued at a discount from par, or, alternatively, may be sold at par, and bear varying interest rates on a fixed or floating basis.
The fair value of each series of U.S. Senior Notes is based on recent bid prices in an active market and is therefore classified as Level 1 in the fair value hierarchy (Note 15).
