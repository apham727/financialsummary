Refer to Note 3 herein for further discussion regarding revenue recognition and related policies.
For leases with a term of twelve months or less, ASU 2016‑02 permits an entity to make an accounting policy election to recognize such leases as lease expense, generally on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
Effective January 1, 2018, the Company adopted Topic 606 using the modified retrospective transition method, resulting in accounting policy changes surrounding revenue recognition which replace certain related policies discussed under Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates (in Item 7) and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (in Note 1) of the Company’s 2017 Annual Report.
Our revenues consist of product sales to either end customers and their appointed contract manufacturers (including original equipment manufacturers or OEM) or to distributors, and the vast majority of our sales are recognized at a point-in-time under the core principle of recognizing revenue when control transfers to the customer.
Our contracts do not have any significant financing components, as payment terms are generally due net 30 to 120 days after delivery.
Standard product warranty coverage which provides assurance that our products will conform to the contractually agreed-upon specifications for a limited period from the date of shipment is typically offered, while extended or separately-priced warranty coverage is typically not offered.
We estimate our warranty liability based on historical experience, product history, and current trends, and record warranty expense in cost of sales in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income.
Contract assets represent unbilled receivables, which generally arise when revenue recognized over time exceed amounts billed to customers.
Contract liabilities represent billings or advanced consideration received from customers in excess of revenue recognized to date.
The Company evaluates the performance of business units on, among other things, profit or loss from operations before interest, headquarters’ expense allocations, stock-based compensation expense, income taxes, amortization related to certain intangible assets and nonrecurring gains and losses.
The price and timing of any future purchases under the 2018 Stock Repurchase Program will depend on factors such as levels of cash generation from operations, the volume of stock option exercises by employees, cash requirements for acquisitions, dividends, economic and market conditions and stock price.
On April 24, 2018, the Company’s Board of Directors approved an increase to its quarterly dividend rate from $0.19 to $0.23 per share effective with dividends declared in the second quarter of 2018.
No additional stock options will be granted under the 2009 Employee Option Plan.
The 2000 Employee Option Plan expired in May 2011, except that its terms continue with respect to outstanding options granted thereunder.
The 2004 Directors Option Plan expired in May 2014, except that its terms continue with respect to outstanding options granted thereunder.
In January 2018, the Company made a voluntary cash contribution of approximately $81.0 to fully fund its U.S. Plans, and estimates that, based on current actuarial calculations, cash contributions to the Plans will aggregate approximately $90.0 in 2018.
The Company offers various defined contribution plans for certain U.S. and foreign employees.
The fair value of each series of Senior Notes is based on recent bid prices in an active market and is therefore classified as Level 1 in the fair value hierarchy (Note 15).
Fair value is determined based on the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants.
These requirements establish market or observable inputs as the preferred source of values.
Assumptions based on hypothetical transactions are used in the absence of market inputs.
The Company does not have any non-financial instruments accounted for at fair value on a recurring basis.
The Company does not have any significant financial or non-financial assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value on a non-recurring basis.
The Company does not believe that these future tax payments will have a significant impact on its liquidity or capital resources.
