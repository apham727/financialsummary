In February 2016, the FASB issued a new accounting standard on leasing.
We have evaluated the impact of adopting this guidance and the adoption of these accounting changes have not impacted our assets and liabilities nor our net income or equity, as we currently do not lease any assets.
In May 2017, the FASB issued a new accounting standard which provides guidance about which changes to the terms or conditions of a share-based payment award require an entity to apply modification accounting in ASC Topic 718.
The adoption of this guidance has not had a material effect on our consolidated financial statements.

The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the condensed consolidated financial statements, including the related notes, appearing in Item 1 of Part 1 of this quarterly report on Form 10-Q, as well as our most recent annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018.
Income tax provision was $1,000 for both the second quarter of 2019 and 2018, as we do not expect significant taxable income for the year ending December 31, 2019.
The $36,000 increase was primarily driven by an increase of $66,000 in salaries primarily for severance pay incurred during the second quarter of 2019, offset by a decrease of $23,000 in professional fees paid for engineering design services.
Other income, net of other expenses, in the six months ended June 30, 2019 was $56,000 versus $77,000 in the comparable period for 2018.
Income tax provision was $2,000 for the six months ended June 30, 2019 versus $3,000 in 2018, as we do not expect significant taxable income for the year ending December 31, 2019.
We historically have satisfied our liquidity requirements through cash generated from operations, short-term commercial loans, subordinated related party promissory notes and issuance of equity securities.
We believe that funds generated from operations, existing cash balances and, if necessary, related party short-term loans, are likely to be sufficient to finance our working capital and capital expenditure requirements for the foreseeable future.
If these funds are not sufficient, we may secure new sources of asset-based lending on accounts receivables or issue debt or equity securities.
Inventory is included and classified as a current asset.
However, it is likely to take over one year for the inventory to turn and therefore is likely not saleable within a one-year time frame.
