We have evaluated the impact of adopting this guidance and the adoption of these accounting changes have not impacted our assets and liabilities nor our net income or equity, as we currently do not lease any assets.
In May 2017, the FASB issued a new accounting standard which provides guidance about which changes to the terms or conditions of a share-based payment award require an entity to apply modification accounting in ASC Topic 718.
The adoption of this guidance has not had a material effect on our consolidated financial statements.
Based upon the nature of our contracts with customers and our performance obligations within those contracts, we have no contract assets or liabilities as of September 30, 2019 and December 31, 2018.
Both investments in ZT are accounted for under the cost (plus impairment) basis of accounting.
These payments were for professional fees related to the operational management of our Taiwan office.
At September 30, 2019, the range of individual outstanding weighted average exercise prices was $1.02 to $2.68.

Other income for the three months ended September 30, 2019 was primarily derived from the gain on sale of our Mexico property of $160,000 and rental income of excess office space at our headquarters in Valencia, CA.
Income tax provision was $2,000 for both the third quarter of 2019 and 2018, as we do not expect significant taxable income for the year ending December 31, 2019.
The $58,000 increase was primarily driven by an increase of $81,000 in salaries primarily for severance pay incurred during the second quarter of 2019, offset by a decrease of $18,000 in professional fees paid for engineering design services.
Other income for the nine months ended September 30, 2019 was primarily derived from the gain on sale of our Mexico property of $160,000 and rental income of excess office space at our headquarters in Valencia, CA.
Income tax provision was $4,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2019 versus $5,000 in 2018, as we do not expect significant taxable income for the year ending December 31, 2019.
We historically have satisfied our liquidity requirements through cash generated from operations, short-term commercial loans, subordinated related party promissory notes and issuance of equity securities.
We believe that funds generated from operations, existing cash balances and, if necessary, related party short-term loans, are likely to be sufficient to finance our working capital and capital expenditure requirements for the foreseeable future.
If these funds are not sufficient, we may secure new sources of asset-based lending on accounts receivables or issue debt or equity securities.
Inventory is included and classified as a current asset.
However, it is likely to take over one year for the inventory to turn and therefore is likely not saleable within a one-year time frame.
