This guidance will be effective in the first quarter of 2019 with early adoption permitted.
In May 2017, the FASB issued a new accounting standard which provides guidance about which changes to the terms or conditions of a share-based payment award require an entity to apply modification accounting in ASC Topic 718.
We expect the adoption of this guidance will not have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements.
Our investment in joint venture as of September 30, 2018, relates to our 49% ownership of Grand Shine Management Limited (Dong Guan, China), an electronic device contract manufacturer, and joint venture with its 51% owner, Teamforce Company Limited.
Our investment is accounted for under the equity method basis of accounting.
On April 21, 2008, we entered into a $3,000,000 credit facility, collateralized by real property, from K.S.
Best International Co. Ltd., a company controlled by the brother of our Chief Executive Officer.
These payments were for professional fees related to the operational management of our Taiwan office.

The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the condensed consolidated financial statements, including the related notes, appearing in Item 1 of Part 1of this quarterly report on Form 10-Q, as well as our most recent annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2017.
Reserves for sales allowances and customer returns are established based upon historical experience and our estimates of future returns.
Other income, net of other expense, in the third quarter of 2018 was $29,000 versus $25,000 in the comparable period for 2017.
Interest expense, net of interest income, was $4,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2018 versus $29,000 in the comparable period for 2017.
Other income, net of other losses, in the nine months ended September 30, 2017 was $106,000 versus $85,000 in the comparable period for 2017.
Income tax provision was $5,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2018 versus $3,000 in 2017, as we do not expect significant taxable income for the year ending December 31, 2018.
Cash flows provided by operating activities were $1,409,000 as opposed to $190,000 in the nine months ended September 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively.
The increase of $1,219,000 in cash flows provided by operations compared with the prior period resulted from changes in operating assets and liabilities, primarily from inventory and accounts receivables compared to the prior period.
We believe that funds generated from, or used in operations, in addition to existing cash balances are likely to be sufficient to finance our working capital and capital expenditure requirements for the foreseeable future.
If these funds are not sufficient, we may secure new sources of short-term commercial loans, asset-based lending on accounts receivables or issue debt or equity securities.
As of November 14, 2018, we had no off-balance sheet arrangements.
