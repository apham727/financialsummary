This guidance will be effective in the first quarter of 2019 with early adoption permitted.
The adoption of this standard did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements and disclosures.
In May 2017, the FASB issued a new accounting standard which provides guidance about which changes to the terms or conditions of a share-based payment award require an entity to apply modification accounting in ASC Topic 718.
We expect the adoption of this guidance will not have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements.
Our investment relates to approximately 8.9% of their total outstanding shares although we do not have significant influence or control.
Our $110,000 investment in joint venture as of March 31, 2018, relates to our 49% ownership of Grand Shine Management Limited (Dong Guan, China), an electronic device contract manufacturer, and joint venture with its 51% owner, Teamforce Company Limited.
On April 21, 2008, we entered into a $3,000,000 credit facility, collateralized by real property, from K.S.
As of March 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017, the aggregate outstanding balance on this credit facility was $500,000.
These payments were for professional fees related to the operational management of our Taiwan office.

Inventory â€“ Inventory, consisting principally of products held for resale, is recorded at the lower of cost (determined using the first in-first out method) or net realizable value.
Based on our assumptions about future demand and market conditions, inventories are carried at the lower of cost or net realizable value.
If our assumptions about future demand change, or market conditions are less favorable than those projected, additional write-downs of inventories may be required.
In any case, actual amounts could be different from those estimated.
In accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, we have classified inventory as a current asset in our March 31, 2018, condensed consolidated financial statements representing approximately 50% of current assets and 34% of total assets.
Therefore, it is possible that further declines in our carrying values of inventory may result.
The decrease was primarily due material shortages, longer production lead times and lower valued per unit products shipped.
Cash flows provided by operating activities were $493,000 as opposed to $366,000 used for in the three months ended March 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively.
If these funds are not sufficient, we may secure new sources of short-term commercial loans, asset-based lending on accounts receivables or issue debt or equity securities.
