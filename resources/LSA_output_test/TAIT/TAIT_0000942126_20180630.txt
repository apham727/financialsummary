This guidance will be effective in the first quarter of 2019 with early adoption permitted.
In May 2017, the FASB issued a new accounting standard which provides guidance about which changes to the terms or conditions of a share-based payment award require an entity to apply modification accounting in ASC Topic 718.
We expect the adoption of this guidance will not have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements.

The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the condensed consolidated financial statements, including the related notes, appearing in Item 1 of Part 1 of this quarterly report on Form 10-Q, as well as our most recent annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2017.
In accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, we have classified inventory as a current asset in our June 30, 2018, condensed consolidated financial statements representing approximately 49% of current assets and 34% of total assets.
We cannot assure you that demand in the discrete semiconductor market will increase and that market conditions will improve.
Therefore, it is possible that further declines in our carrying values of inventory may result.
Other income, net of other losses, in the six months ended June 30, 2017 was $77,000 versus $60,000 in the comparable period for 2017.
Income tax provision was $3,000 for the six months ended June 30, 2018 versus $1,000 in 2017, as we do not expect significant taxable income for the year ending December 31, 2018.
Cash flows provided by operating activities were $785,000 as opposed to $70,000 in the six months ended June 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively.
The increase of $715,000 in cash flows provided by operations compared with the prior period resulted from changes in operating assets and liabilities, primarily from inventory, accounts payables and accounts receivables compared to the prior period.
We believe that funds generated from, or used in operations, in addition to existing cash balances are likely to be sufficient to finance our working capital and capital expenditure requirements for the foreseeable future.
If these funds are not sufficient, we may secure new sources of short-term commercial loans, asset-based lending on accounts receivables or issue debt or equity securities.
As of August 14, 2018, we had no off-balance sheet arrangements.
