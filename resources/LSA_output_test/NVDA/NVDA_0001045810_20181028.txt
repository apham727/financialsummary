Except for the accounting policy for revenue recognition, which was updated as a result of adopting a new accounting standard related to revenue recognition, there have been no material changes to our significant accounting policies in Note 1 - Organization and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended January 28, 2018.
Revenue from product sales is recognized upon transfer of control of promised products to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration we expect to receive in exchange for those products.
Revenue is recognized net of allowances for returns, customer programs and any taxes collected from customers.
However, if product returns for a fiscal period are anticipated to exceed historical return rates, we may determine that additional sales return allowances are required to properly reflect our estimated exposure for product returns.
We account for customer programs as a reduction to revenue and accrue for potential rebates and MDFs based on the amount we expect to be claimed by customers.
Software licenses are frequently sold along with post-contract customer support, or PCS.
PCS revenue is recognized ratably over the service period, or as services are performed.
The Financial Accounting Standards Board, or FASB, issued an accounting standards update that creates a single source of revenue guidance under U.S. GAAP for all companies, in all industries.
We adopted this guidance on January 29, 2018 using the modified retrospective approach.
We adopted this guidance in the first quarter of fiscal year 2019 and applied it prospectively.
The adoption of this guidance did not have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements.
We are evaluating the impact of adopting the new lease accounting standards on our consolidated financial statements, systems and processes in conjunction with our review of lease agreements.
On January 29, 2018, we adopted the new revenue accounting standard using the modified retrospective method and applied it to contracts that were not completed as of that date.
We have the intent and ability to hold our investments until maturity.
As of October 28, 2018, we had outstanding inventory purchase obligations totaling $1.56 billion.

We have extended our focus in recent years to the revolutionary field of AI.
Tegra Processor business revenue - which includes automotive, SOC modules for the Nintendo Switch gaming console, and other embedded edge AI platforms - was $407 million, down 3% from a year ago and down 13% sequentially.
Datacenter revenue was $792 million, up 58% from a year ago and up 4% sequentially, led by strong sales of our Volta architecture-based products, including NVIDIA Tesla V100 and DGX systems, with contribution from the new Turing T4 Cloud GPU.
OEM and IP revenue was $148 million, down 23% from a year ago, due to the absence of cryptocurrency mining.
We intend to return an additional $3.00 billion to shareholders by the end of fiscal year 2020, which may begin in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2019.
The decrease was primarily related to third quarter stock repurchases, dividends and taxes paid related to restricted stock units, partially offset by operating income and changes in working capital.
During the second quarter of fiscal year 2019, we marked the launch of the Summit supercomputer at Oak Ridge National Laboratory, powered by NVIDIA Volta Tensor Core GPUs; introduced NVIDIA HGX-2, a unified computing platform for both AI and high performance computing; announced that five of the world’s seven fastest supercomputers are powered by NVIDIA GPUs; introduced the NVIDIA HGX-2 platform for both AI and HPC; and launched AIRI Mini with Pure Storage and ONTAP AI with NetApp for implementing and scaling deep learning.
We also announced a number of Max-Q GeForce gaming notebook designs offered by major OEMs, enabling high-end performance for thin and light notebooks; disclosed that next-generation NVIDIA G-SYNC HDR displays are being shipped, enabling stutter-free gaming; and announced NVIDIA’s role in VirtualLink, a consortium establishing an industry standard to enable next-gen VR headsets to connect with PCs using a single, high-bandwidth USB Type-C connector.
During the first quarter of fiscal year 2019, we announced NVIDIA RTX, a computer graphics technology that produces movie-quality images in real time.
This increase was due primarily to 20% growth in sales of GeForce GPU products for gaming, driven by initial sales of Turing-based GPUs for desktops and by high-performance notebooks based on our Max-Q technology.
Revenue from Quadro GPUs for professional visualization increased 28% due primarily to higher sales across desktop and mobile workstation products.
Revenue from Quadro GPUs for professional visualization increased 23% due primarily to higher sales across desktop and mobile workstation products.
Our PC OEM revenue increased by almost 20% due primarily to sales of GPU products targeted for use in cryptocurrency mining in the first quarter of fiscal year 2019.
