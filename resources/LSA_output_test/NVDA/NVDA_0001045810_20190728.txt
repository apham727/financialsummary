Except for the accounting policy for leases, which was updated as a result of adopting a new accounting standard related to leases, there have been no material changes to our significant accounting policies in Note 1 - Organization and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended January 27, 2019.
We determine if an arrangement is or contains a lease at inception.
In June 2016, the FASB issued a new accounting standard to replace the incurred loss impairment methodology under current GAAP with a methodology that reflects expected credit losses and requires consideration of a broader range of reasonable and supportable information to inform credit loss estimates.
We will be required to use a forward-looking expected credit loss model for accounts receivable and other financial instruments, including available-for-sale debt securities.
We are currently evaluating the impact of this standard on our Consolidated Financial Statements.
In addition, we elected the package of practical expedients permitted under the transition guidance, which allowed us not to reassess (1) whether any expired or existing contracts are or contain leases, (2) lease classification for any expired or existing leases, and (3) initial direct costs for any existing leases.
As of July 28, 2019, we do not believe that our estimates, as otherwise provided for, on such tax positions will significantly increase or decrease within the next twelve months.
These liabilities are carried on our Consolidated Balance Sheets at their original issuance value, net of unamortized debt discount and issuance costs, and are not marked to fair value each period.
These contracts are designated as cash flow hedges for hedge accounting treatment.
We also enter into foreign currency forward contracts to mitigate the impact of foreign currency movements on monetary assets and liabilities that are denominated in currencies other than U.S. dollar.
As of July 28, 2019, all designated foreign currency forward contracts mature within eighteen months.
The expected realized gains and losses deferred into accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) related to foreign currency forward contracts within the next twelve months was not significant.
All existing and future liabilities of our subsidiaries will be effectively senior to the Notes.

We have extended our focus in recent years to the revolutionary field of AI.
GPU business revenue was $2.10 billion, down 21% from a year earlier and up 4% sequentially.
Tegra Processor business revenue - which includes Automotive, SOC modules for gaming platforms, and embedded edge AI platforms - was $475 million, up 2% from a year ago and up 140% sequentially.
The growth in revenue also reflected AI cockpit solutions and other autonomous vehicle development agreements.
We previously communicated our intent to return $3.00 billion to shareholders by the end of fiscal year 2020, including $700 million in share repurchases made during the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2019.
We intend to return the remaining $2.11 billion through a combination of share repurchases and cash dividends.
In our Data Center platform, we announced NVIDIA's DGX SuperPOD, which provides the AI infrastructure for our autonomous-vehicle development program; set eight records in AI training performance in the latest MLPerf benchmarking tests; and announced support for Arm CPUs, providing a new path to build highly energy-efficient, AI-enabled exascale supercomputers.
GPU business revenue decreased by 21% in the second quarter of fiscal year 2020 compared to the second quarter of fiscal year 2019, which reflects declines in gaming GPU and Data Center revenue.
Revenue from Quadro GPUs for professional visualization increased 4%, primarily reflecting strength across mobile workstation products.
GPU business revenue decreased by 24% in the first half of fiscal year 2020 compared to the first half of fiscal year 2019, which reflects declines in gaming GPU and Data Center revenue.
Revenue from Quadro GPUs for professional visualization increased 5% due primarily reflecting strength across mobile workstation products.
The growth in Automotive revenue also reflected AI cockpit solutions and other autonomous vehicle development agreements.
These decreases reflect lower Gaming and Data Center margins, driven primarily by product costs.
The gross margin of our GPU business decreased during the second quarter and first half of fiscal year 2020 compared to the second quarter and first half of fiscal year 2019, primarily reflecting lower gaming GPU and data center margins driven by product costs.
