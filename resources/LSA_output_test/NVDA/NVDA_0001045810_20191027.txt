Except for adopting a new accounting standard related to leases, there have been no material changes to our significant accounting policies in Note 1 - Organization and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended January 27, 2019.
We determine if an arrangement is or contains a lease at inception.
In June 2016, the FASB issued a new accounting standard to replace the incurred loss impairment methodology under current GAAP with a methodology that reflects expected credit losses and requires consideration of a broader range of reasonable and supportable information to inform credit loss estimates.
We will be required to use a forward-looking expected credit loss model for accounts receivable and other financial instruments, including available-for-sale debt securities.
While we are still evaluating the impact of this standard on our Consolidated Financial Statements, we do not currently believe it will have a material impact upon adoption.
In addition, we elected the package of practical expedients permitted under the transition guidance, which allowed us not to reassess (1) whether any expired or existing contracts are or contain leases, (2) lease classification for any expired or existing leases, and (3) initial direct costs for any existing leases.
As of October 27, 2019, we do not believe that our estimates, as otherwise provided for, on such tax positions will significantly increase or decrease within the next twelve months.
These contracts are designated as cash flow hedges for hedge accounting treatment.
We also enter into foreign currency forward contracts to mitigate the impact of foreign currency movements on monetary assets and liabilities that are denominated in currencies other than U.S. dollar.
As of October 27, 2019, all designated foreign currency forward contracts mature within eighteen months.
The expected realized gains and losses deferred into accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) related to foreign currency forward contracts within the next twelve months was not significant.
During the third quarter and first nine months of fiscal years 2020 and 2019, the impact of derivative financial instruments designated for hedge accounting treatment on other comprehensive income or loss was not significant and all such instruments were determined to be highly effective.
All existing and future liabilities of our subsidiaries will be effectively senior to the Notes.

GPU business revenue was $2.56 billion, down 8% from a year earlier and up 22% sequentially.
Tegra Processor business revenue - which includes Automotive, SOC modules for gaming platforms, and embedded edge AI platforms - was $449 million, up 10% from a year ago and down 5% sequentially.
The sequential increase reflects growth primarily from GeForce desktop and notebook GPUs.
The sequential increase was primarily due to growth in entry-level GPUs for notebooks PCs.
The sequential increase also reflects higher average selling prices for GeForce GPUs.
We previously communicated our intent to return $3.00 billion to shareholders by the end of fiscal year 2020, including $700 million in share repurchases made during the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2019.
We intend to return the remaining $2.01 billion through a combination of share repurchases and cash dividends.
In our Professional Visualization platform, we announced that a number of creative and design applications are now accelerated by RTX ray tracing.
In our Data Center platform, we announced NVIDIA's DGX SuperPOD, which provides the AI infrastructure for our autonomous-vehicle development program; set eight records in AI training performance in the latest MLPerf benchmarking tests; and announced support for Arm CPUs, providing a new path to build highly energy-efficient, AI-enabled exascale supercomputers.
GPU business revenue decreased by 8% in the third quarter of fiscal year 2020 compared to the third quarter of fiscal year 2019, which reflects declines in GPUs sold for gaming and Data Center revenue.
Revenue from Quadro GPUs for professional visualization increased 6%, primarily reflecting strength across mobile workstation products.
GPU business revenue decreased by 18% in the first nine months of fiscal year 2020 compared to the first nine months of fiscal year 2019, which reflects declines in GPUs sold for gaming and Data Center revenue.
