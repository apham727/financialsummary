These Consolidated Financial Statements should therefore be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes thereto for the fiscal year ended August 31, 2018 included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC on October 24, 2018.
The core principle of Topic 606 is that an entity should recognize revenue for the transfer of goods or services equal to the amount that it expects to be entitled to receive for those goods or services.
Topic 606 has been applied to contracts that were not completed as of September 1, 2018.
Results for reporting periods beginning after September 1, 2018 are presented under Topic 606, while prior period amounts are not adjusted and continue to be reported in accordance with our historic accounting.
See Note 2 (Revenues) to these Consolidated Financial Statements for further details.
Prior period results have been revised to reflect this change in presentation.
A contract’s transaction price is allocated to each distinct performance obligation and recognized as revenue when, or as, the performance obligation is satisfied.
For contracts with multiple performance obligations, we allocate the contract’s transaction price to each performance obligation based on the relative standalone selling price.
Contract modifications are routine in the performance of our contracts.
Contracts are often modified to account for changes in the contract specifications, requirements or duration.
We include these variable fees in the estimated transaction price when there is a basis to reasonably estimate the amount of the fee and it is not probable a significant reversal of revenue will occur.
Outsourcing contracts require us to provide a series of distinct services each period over the contract term.
When contractual billings represent an amount that corresponds directly with the value provided to the client (e.g., time-and-materials contracts), revenues are recognized as amounts become billable in accordance with contract terms.

For example, a reference to “fiscal 2019” means the 12-month period that will end on August 31, 2019.
Financial results “in local currency” are calculated by restating current period activity into U.S. dollars using the comparable prior year period’s foreign currency exchange rates.
•If we are unable to manage the organizational challenges associated with our size, we might be unable to achieve our business objectives.
There also continues to be volatility in foreign currency exchange rates.
This change has no impact on operating income but does affect ratios calculated as a percentage of revenue, such as operating margin.
Prior period results have been revised to reflect the fiscal 2019 presentation.
For additional information, see Note 1 (Basis of Presentation) to our Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 1, “Financial Statements.” If the U.S. dollar weakens against other currencies, resulting in favorable currency translation, our revenues, revenue growth and results of operations in U.S. dollars may be higher.
If the U.S. dollar strengthens against other currencies, resulting in unfavorable currency translation, our revenues, revenue growth and results of operations in U.S. dollars may be lower.
Prior period results have been revised to reflect the fiscal 2019 presentation.
We continuously monitor these costs and implement cost-management actions, as appropriate.
For the third quarter of fiscal 2019 compared to the same period in fiscal 2018, Sales and marketing costs as a percentage of revenues increased 40 basis points, primarily due to higher selling and other business development costs and General and administrative costs as a percentage of revenues increased 10 basis points.
For additional information, see Note 1 (Basis of Presentation) to our Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 1, “Financial Statements.” The effective tax rates for the three and nine months ended May 31, 2019 were 25.6% and 21.1%, respectively.
Absent these charges and $81 million of expense from a non-U.S. tax law change recorded during the third quarter of fiscal 2018, our effective tax rate for the three and nine months ended May 31, 2018 would have been 26.8% and 21.3%, respectively.
The impact of tax law changes decreased diluted earnings per share by $0.19 and $0.40 during the three and nine months ended May 31, 2018, respectively.
Excluding the impact of these changes, diluted earnings per share for the three and nine months ended May 31, 2018 would have been $1.79 and $5.16, respectively.
