The core principle of Topic 606 is that an entity should recognize revenue for the transfer of goods or services equal to the amount that it expects to be entitled to receive for those goods or services.
Topic 606 has been applied to contracts that were not completed as of September 1, 2018.
Results for reporting periods beginning after September 1, 2018 are presented under Topic 606, while prior period amounts are not adjusted and continue to be reported in accordance with our historic accounting.
See Note 2 (Revenues) to these Consolidated Financial Statements for further details.
In connection with the adoption of Topic 606, we are now presenting total revenues and no longer reporting revenues before reimbursements.
Prior period results have been revised to reflect this change in presentation.
A contract’s transaction price is allocated to each distinct performance obligation and recognized as revenue when, or as, the performance obligation is satisfied.
For contracts with multiple performance obligations, we allocate the contract’s transaction price to each performance obligation based on the relative standalone selling price.We use the terms “Accenture,” “we,” “our” and “us” in this report to refer to Accenture plc and its subsidiaries.
For example, a reference to “fiscal 2019” means the 12-month period that will end on August 31, 2019.
Financial results “in local currency” are calculated by restating current period activity into U.S. dollars using the comparable prior year period’s foreign currency exchange rates.
•If we are unable to manage the organizational challenges associated with our size, we might be unable to achieve our business objectives.
There also continues to be volatility in foreign currency exchange rates.
Effective January 10, 2019, the Board of Directors appointed David Rowland, who was serving as our chief financial officer, as the interim chief executive officer and a director of Accenture, and KC McClure, who was serving as our managing director—Finance Operations, as our chief financial officer, and named our lead independent director, Marge Magner, as the non-executive chair of the board.
We subsequently announced the passing of Mr. Nanterme on January 31, 2019.
This change has no impact on operating income but does affect ratios calculated as a percentage of revenue, such as operating margin.
Prior period results have been revised to reflect the fiscal 2019 presentation.
For additional information, see Note 1 (Basis of Presentation) to our Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 1, “Financial Statements.” If the U.S. dollar weakens against other currencies, resulting in favorable currency translation, our revenues, revenue growth and results of operations in U.S. dollars may be higher.
