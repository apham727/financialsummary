The accompanying unaudited interim Consolidated Financial Statements of Accenture plc and its controlled subsidiary companies have been prepared pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) for quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and do not include all of the information and note disclosures required by U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“U.S.
These Consolidated Financial Statements should therefore be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes thereto for the fiscal year ended August 31, 2017 included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC on October 26, 2017.
During the six months ended February 28, 2018, we completed individually immaterial acquisitions for total consideration of $313,814, net of cash acquired.
Goodwill includes immaterial adjustments related to prior period acquisitions.
In the normal course of business, we use derivative financial instruments to manage foreign currency exchange rate risk.
Our derivative financial instruments consist of deliverable and non-deliverable foreign currency forward contracts.

We use the terms “Accenture,” “we,” “our” and “us” in this report to refer to Accenture plc and its subsidiaries.
We use the term “in local currency” so that certain financial results may be viewed without the impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, thereby facilitating period-to-period comparisons of business performance.
Financial results “in local currency” are calculated by restating current period activity into U.S. dollars using the comparable prior year period’s foreign currency exchange rates.
•Our global delivery capability is increasingly concentrated in India and the Philippines, which may expose us to operational risks.
•If we are unable to manage the organizational challenges associated with our size, we might be unable to achieve our business objectives.
If we raise equity capital, it may dilute our shareholders’ ownership interest in us.
There also continues to be volatility in foreign currency exchange rates.
If the U.S. dollar weakens against other currencies, resulting in favorable currency translation, our revenues, revenue growth and results of operations in U.S. dollars may be higher.
If the U.S. dollar strengthens against other currencies, resulting in unfavorable currency translation, our revenues, revenue growth and results of operations in U.S. dollars may be lower.
The U.S. dollar weakened against various currencies during the three and six months ended February 28, 2018 compared to the three and six months ended February 28, 2017, resulting in favorable currency translation and U.S. dollar revenue growth that was approximately 6% and 4% higher, respectively, than our revenue growth in local currency.
Assuming that exchange rates stay within recent ranges for the remainder of fiscal 2018, we estimate that our full fiscal 2018 revenue growth in U.S. dollars will be approximately 4.0% higher in U.S. dollars than our revenue growth in local currency.
The decrease in gross margin for three and six months ended February 28, 2018 was principally due to lower consulting contract profitability as well as higher acquisition-related costs, partially offset by cost efficiencies.
We continuously monitor these costs and implement cost-management actions, as appropriate.
Amounts in table may not total due to rounding.
•North America net revenues increased 8% in local currency, driven by the United States.
•Europe net revenues increased 10% in local currency, driven by Germany, Italy, France and Spain.
Operating expenses before reimbursable expenses for the second quarter of fiscal 2018 increased $1,124 million, or 16%, over the second quarter of fiscal 2017, and increased as a percentage of net revenues to 86.6% from 86.3% during this period.
•Products operating income increased primarily due to revenue growth, partially offset by lower consulting contract profitability and higher sales and marketing costs as a percentage of net revenues.
•Resources operating income increased primarily due to revenue growth, partially offset by lower contract profitability.
Other income (expense), net primarily consists of foreign currency gains and losses as well as gains and losses associated with our investments in privately held companies.
