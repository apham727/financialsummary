The unaudited consolidated financial statements of Encore Wire Corporation (the “Company”) have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”) for interim information and the instructions to Form 10-Q and Rule 10-01 of Regulation S-X.
Accordingly, they do not include all of the information and footnotes required by U.S. GAAP for complete annual financial statements.
Amounts billed and due from our customers are classified as accounts receivables on the balance sheet and require payment on a short-term basis through standard payment terms.
The Financial Accounting Standards Board (the “FASB”) Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) is the sole source of authoritative U.S. GAAP other than Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") issued rules and regulations that apply only to SEC registrants.
In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU No.
2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (ASC Topic 606), which replaces numerous requirements in U.S. GAAP, including industry-specific requirements, and provides companies with a single revenue recognition model for recognizing revenue from contracts with customers.
Upon completing our implementation assessment of Topic ASC 606, we concluded that no adjustment was required to the opening balance of retained earnings at the date of initial application.
The comparative information has also not been restated and continues to be reported under the accounting standards in effect for those periods.
Additional disclosures required by ASC Topic 606 are presented under Revenue Recognition above.
2016-02, “Leases (Topic 842).” Under the new guidance, a lessee will be required to recognize a right to use asset and a lease liability for all leases with terms of twelve months or longer.
The new standard will be effective for us beginning January 1, 2019.
The Company is evaluating the effect that ASU 2016-02 will have on its consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.
LIFO pools are established at the end of each fiscal year.

Encore believes it is a low-cost manufacturer of electrical building wire and cable.
The Company is a significant supplier of building wire for interior electrical wiring in commercial and industrial buildings, homes, apartments, and manufactured housing.
Price competition for electrical wire and cable is intense, and the Company sells its products in accordance with prevailing market prices.
Additionally, the SEC allows shares of certain physically backed copper exchange-traded funds (“ETFs”) to be listed and publicly traded.
In addition to rising copper prices and potential supply shortages, we believe that ETFs and similar copper-backed derivative products could lead to increased price volatility for copper.
Wire prices can, and frequently do, change on a daily basis.
Historically, the Company has not engaged in hedging strategies for raw material purchases.
Net sales were $291.4 million in the first quarter of 2018 compared to $279.4 million in the first quarter of 2017.
This 4.3% increase in net sales is primarily the result of a 6.4% increase in copper wire sales, driven by a 15.6% increase in the average selling price of copper wire offset by a 7.9% decrease in copper wire unit volume shipped.
Unit volume decreased in the first quarter of 2018 compared to the first quarter of 2017 primarily due to particularly rough winter weather that slowed construction and impacted our volumes, particularly in January.
The decrease in gross profit margin percentage was driven by multiple factors, including a 7.9% decline in copper wire unit sales, which was more than offset by the increase of the copper wire spread.
Lower overhead costs as a percentage of net sales somewhat offset this increase in total raw materials cost as a percentage of net sales.
The Company maintains two inventory pools for LIFO purposes.
