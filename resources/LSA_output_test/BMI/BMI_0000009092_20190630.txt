Historically, the Company maintained a non-contributory defined benefit pension plan that covered substantially all U.S. employees who were employed on December 31, 2011.
After that date, no further benefits were accrued in this plan.
For the frozen pension plan, benefits were based primarily on years of service and, for certain individuals, levels of compensation.
The Company maintains supplemental non-qualified plans for certain officers and other key employees, and an Employee Savings and Stock Ownership Plan for the majority of the U.S. employees.
The Company additionally has a postretirement healthcare benefit plan that provides medical benefits for certain U.S. retirees and eligible dependents hired prior to November 1, 2004.
Employees are eligible to receive postretirement healthcare benefits upon meeting certain age and service requirements.
No employees hired after October 31, 2004 are eligible to receive these benefits.
This plan requires employee contributions to offset benefit costs.
The Company disclosed in its financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2018 that it estimated it would pay $0.4 million in other postretirement benefits in 2019 based on actuarial estimates.
The amount of benefits paid in calendar year 2019 will not impact the expense for postretirement benefits for 2019.The majority of water meters sold by the Company continue to be mechanical in nature; however, ultrasonic meters are gaining in penetration due to a variety of factors, including their ability to maintain near absolute measurement accuracy over their useful life.
Meters equipped with radio technology (endpoints) receive flow measurement data from battery-powered encoder registers attached to the water meter, which is encrypted and transmitted via radio frequency to a receiver that collects and formats the data appropriately for water utility usage and billing systems.
These remotely read systems are classified as either automatic meter reading (AMR) systems, where a vehicle equipped for meter reading purposes, including a radio receiver, computer and reading software, collects the data from utilities’ meters; or advanced metering infrastructure (AMI) systems, where data is gathered utilizing a network (either fixed or cellular) of data collectors or gateway receivers that are able to receive radio data transmission from the utilities’ meters.
These systems provide the utilities with more frequent and diverse data from their meters at specified intervals.
ORION Migratable makes the migration to fixed network easier for utilities that prefer to start with mobile reading and later adopt fixed network communications, allowing utilities to choose a solution for their current needs and be positioned for their future operational changes.
BEACON AMA is a secure, cloud-hosted software suite that includes a customizable dashboard, and has the ability to establish alerts for specific conditions.
It also allows for consumer engagement tools that permit end water users (such as homeowners) to view and manage their water usage activity.
Water meter replacement and the adoption and deployment of new technology comprise the majority of water meter product sales, including radio products.
Over the last decade, there has been a growing trend in the conversion from manually read water meters to meters with radio technology.
