These condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (GAAP) for interim financial information and the instructions to Rule 10-01 of Regulation S-X.
Accordingly, they do not include all of the information and notes required by GAAP for complete financial statements.
These condensed consolidated financial statements are unaudited and should be read in conjunction with our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2018.
We operate and report using a 52-53 week fiscal year ending on the last Sunday in September.
In connection with the preparation of our condensed consolidated financial statements for the three months ended December 30, 2018, we identified an immaterial error related to the recognition of certain royalty revenues of our QTL (Qualcomm Technology Licensing) segment in the quarterly and annual periods in fiscal 2018 and third and fourth quarters and annual period in fiscal 2017.
A summary of revisions to our previously reported financial statements is presented in Note 11.
At December 30, 2018, we had outstanding 29.4 million restricted stock units that contain only a service requirement and 3.9 million stock options.
Previously, we recognized sales-based royalties as revenues in the period in which such royalties were reported by licensees, which was after the conclusion of the quarter in which the licensees’ sales occurred and when all other revenue recognition criteria had been met.Although forward-looking statements in this Quarterly Report reflect our good faith judgment, such statements can only be based on facts and factors currently known by us.
Readers are urged not to place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date of this Quarterly Report.
We undertake no obligation to revise or update any forward-looking statements in order to reflect any event or circumstance that may arise after the date of this Quarterly Report.
As a result of estimation, adjustments will be recorded in subsequent quarters to reflect changes in estimates as new information becomes available, primarily when actual amounts are reported by licensees.
QTL is operated by QUALCOMM Incorporated, which owns the vast majority of our patent portfolio.
Additionally, beginning in the first quarter of fiscal 2019, certain research and development costs associated with early research and development that have historically been included in our QCT segment are allocated to our QTL segment.
The net effect of these changes negatively impacted QTL’s EBT (earnings before taxes) by $122 million and did not have a significant impact on QCT EBT in the first quarter of fiscal 2019.
In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018, we implemented a stock repurchase program to repurchase up to $30 billion of our outstanding common stock.
Stock repurchases made under this program have significantly reduced the amount of our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, resulting in a decrease to interest and dividend income.
As a result of making these check-the-box elections in the first quarter of fiscal 2019, we recorded a tax benefit of $570 million due to establishing new U.S. net deferred tax assets resulting from the difference between the GAAP basis and the U.S. federal tax carryover basis of the existing assets and liabilities of those foreign subsidiaries, primarily related to customer incentive liabilities that have not been deducted for tax purposes.
We believe that it is reasonably possible that the total amounts of unrecognized tax benefits at December 30, 2018 may increase or decrease in the next 12 months.
