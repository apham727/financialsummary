These condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (GAAP) for interim financial information and the instructions to Rule 10-01 of Regulation S-X.
Accordingly, they do not include all of the information and notes required by GAAP for complete financial statements.
These condensed consolidated financial statements are unaudited and should be read in conjunction with our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2018.
We operate and report using a 52-53 week fiscal year ending on the last Sunday in September.
As previously disclosed, in connection with the preparation of our condensed consolidated financial statements for the three months ended December 30, 2018, we identified an immaterial error related to the recognition of certain royalty revenues of our QTL (Qualcomm Technology Licensing) segment in the quarterly and annual periods in fiscal 2018 and third and fourth quarters and annual period in fiscal 2017.
Accordingly, we have revised previously reported financial information for such immaterial error, as previously disclosed in our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the first and second quarters of fiscal 2019.
A summary of revisions to certain previously reported financial information presented herein for comparative purposes is included in Note 11.
At June 30, 2019, we had outstanding 26.9 million restricted stock units and 1.1 million stock options that contain only a service requirement.
Prior to adoption, we recognized sales-based royalties as revenues in the period in which such royalties were reported by licensees, which was after the conclusion of the quarter in which the licensees’ sales occurred and when all other revenue recognition criteria had been met.
Since we do not invoice for sales-based royalties estimated and recognized in any given quarter until after the conclusion of that quarter (which is generally the following quarter when such royalties are reported by licensees), revenues recognized from sales-based royalties results in unbilled receivables (included in accounts receivable, net on the consolidated balance sheet).

•We continued to invest significant resources toward advancements primarily in support of 4G- and 5G-based technologies as well as other technologies to extend the demand for our products and generate new or expanded licensing opportunities, including within adjacent industry segments outside traditional cellular industries, such as automotive, the Internet of Things (IoT) and networking.
•We adopted new revenue recognition accounting guidance in the first quarter of fiscal 2019 that requires us to estimate and recognize QTL royalties in the period in which the associated sales occur, resulting in an acceleration of royalty revenues by one quarter compared to the prior method.
As a result of recognizing royalties using estimates, adjustments are recorded in subsequent quarters to reflect changes in estimates as new information becomes available, primarily when actual amounts are reported by licensees.
•During the third quarter of fiscal 2019, the United States Treasury Department issued new temporary regulations that resulted in a change to the deductibility of dividend income received by a U.S. stockholder from a foreign corporation.
Therefore, the related deferred tax asset previously recognized was written-off, resulting in a $2.5 billion charge to income tax expense in the third quarter of fiscal 2019.

•On July 18, 2019, the European Commission (EC) issued a decision ruling that between 2009 and 2011 we engaged in predatory pricing with respect to two customers and imposed a fine (2019 EC fine) of approximately 242 million Euros (approximately $275 million based on the exchange rate at June 30, 2019), which was recorded as a charge to other expenses in the third quarter of fiscal 2019.
QTL is operated by QUALCOMM Incorporated, which owns the vast majority of our patent portfolio.
+$4.7 billion in licensing revenues recorded in the third quarter of fiscal 2019 resulting from the settlement with Apple and its contract manufacturers (which were not allocated to our segment results) First nine months 2019 vs. 2018 +$4.7 billion in licensing revenues recorded in the third quarter of fiscal 2019 resulting from the settlement with Apple and its contract manufacturers -$1.7 billion in lower equipment and services revenues from our QCT segment First nine months 2019 vs. 2018 In fiscal 2018, all of the costs related to pre-commercial research and development of 5G technologies, of which we recorded $124 million and $340 million in the third quarter and first nine months of fiscal 2018, respectively, were included in unallocated corporate research and development expenses.
Additionally, beginning in the first quarter of fiscal 2019, certain research and development costs associated with early research and development that were historically included in our QCT segment are allocated to our QTL segment.
The net effect of these changes negatively impacted QTL’s EBT by $127 million and $368 million in the third quarter and first nine months of fiscal 2019, respectively.
QCT’s EBT was positively impacted by $53 million and $97 million in the third quarter and first nine months of fiscal 2019, respectively.
Stock repurchases made under this program have significantly reduced the amount of our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, resulting in a decrease to interest and dividend income.
The increase in net gains on marketable securities in the three and nine months ended June 30, 2019 was primarily driven by a gain resulting from the initial public offering of one of our non-marketable equity investments.
In response to the Tax Legislation and to better align our profits with activities, we implemented certain tax restructuring in fiscal 2018 and 2019.
During the third quarter of fiscal 2019, the United States Treasury Department issued new temporary regulations that resulted in a change to the deductibility of dividend income received by a U.S. stockholder from a foreign corporation.
