Refer to Note 1 - Basis of Presentation - Corporate Reorganization, for additional information.
The Reorganization was accounted for as a transaction among entities under common control and is expected to be a tax-free transaction for U.S. federal income tax purposes.
Shares of Xerox Holdings common stock will trade on the New York Stock Exchange under the current ticker symbol “XRX”, formerly used by Xerox.
Accordingly, we reclassified approximately $221 from Xerox’s Common stock to Additional paid-in capital.
In March 2019, as part of Project Own It, we entered into a shared services arrangement with HCL Technologies (HCL) pursuant to which we are outsourcing certain global administrative and support functions, including, among others, selected information technology and finance functions (excluding accounting).
However, we can terminate the arrangement at any time at our discretion, subject to payment of termination fees that decline over the term or for cause.
In August 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-15, Intangibles - Goodwill and Other - Internal Use Software (Subtopic 350-40), Customer's Accounting for Implementation Costs Incurred in a Cloud Computing Arrangement That is a Service Contract.
This update aligns the requirements for capitalizing implementation costs incurred in a hosting arrangement that is a service contract with the requirements for capitalizing implementation costs incurred to develop or obtain internal-use software (and hosting arrangements that include an internal-use software license).
This update is effective for our fiscal year beginning January 1, 2020.
Some of these conforming changes, such as those related to the definition of lease term and minimum lease payments, resulted in certain lease arrangements, that would have been previously accounted for as operating leases, to be classified and accounted for as sales-type leases with a corresponding up-front recognition of equipment sales revenue.
The incremental borrowing rate is the rate of interest that we would have to pay to borrow, on a collateralized basis, an amount equal to the lease payments, in a similar economic environment and over a similar term.

Management believes the constant currency measure provides investors an additional perspective on revenue trends.
In addition, lower revenues were offset by the continued benefits of cost savings and productivity improvements from our Project Own It transformation actions.
These benefits were partially offset by higher Restructuring and related costs.
Revenue associated with equipment installations may be reflected up-front in Equipment sales or over time either through rental income or as part of our Xerox Services revenues (which are both reported within our post sale revenues), depending on the terms and conditions of our agreements with customers.
Installs include activity from Xerox Services and Xerox-branded products shipped to our XBS sales unit.
Lower activity from iGen and Versant production systems provided a partial headwind.
•6% decrease in high-end color installs reflecting lower activity from iGen and Versant production systems, partially offset by continued strong demand for our Iridesse production press in EMEA and higher installs of our inkjet cut-sheet systems.
