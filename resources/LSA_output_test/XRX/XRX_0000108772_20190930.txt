Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements reflect the activity for both Xerox Holdings and Xerox for all periods presented, unless otherwise noted.
The Reorganization was accounted for as a transaction among entities under common control and is expected to be a tax-free transaction for U.S. federal income tax purposes.
In addition, the capital structure of Xerox was modified such that In March 2019, as part of Project Own It, we entered into a shared services arrangement with HCL Technologies (HCL) pursuant to which we are outsourcing certain global administrative and support functions, including, among others, selected information technology and finance functions (excluding accounting).
However, we can terminate the arrangement at any time at our discretion, subject to payment of termination fees that decline over the term or for cause.
Xerox Holdings and Xerox consider the applicability and impact of all Accounting Standards Updates (ASUs) issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB).
In August 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-15, Intangibles - Goodwill and Other - Internal Use Software (Subtopic 350-40), Customer's Accounting for Implementation Costs Incurred in a Cloud Computing Arrangement That is a Service Contract.
This update aligns the requirements for capitalizing implementation costs incurred in a hosting arrangement that is a service contract with the requirements for capitalizing implementation costs incurred to develop or obtain internal-use software (and hosting arrangements that include an internal-use software license).
This update is effective for our fiscal year beginning January 1, 2020.
Since we currently capitalize these implementation costs, we do not currently expect the new guidance to have a material impact on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.
Short-term leases with a term of 12 months or less are not required to be recognized.

We believe implementation of a holding company structure will provide us with flexibility to develop and realize a range of strategic growth opportunities, including by pursuing different capital structures for new businesses, whether incubated or acquired.
Management believes the constant currency measure provides investors an additional perspective on revenue trends.
In addition, lower revenues were more than offset by the continued benefits of cost savings and productivity improvements from our Project Own It transformation actions.
We expect total revenues to decline approximately 7.9% in 2019, including an approximate 1.5-percentage point unfavorable impact from currency.
As part of the new arrangement, we will start sourcing certain A4 and entry-level A3 products from HP to diversify our supply chain.
Many of these devices will operate with our ConnectKey software, a key differentiator in the marketplace.
Further, as part of our growth strategy to increase our penetration of the small-to-medium size business (SMB) market, Xerox will also become a Device as a Service (DaaS) partner for HP in the US.
