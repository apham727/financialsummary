Our services contracts may also include the sale or lease of equipment and software.
Certain document management services arrangements may also include an embedded lease of equipment.
We consider the economic life of most of our products to be five years, since this represents the most frequent contractual lease term for our principal products and only a small percentage of our leases are for original terms longer than five years.
Leases will be classified as either finance or operating, with classification affecting the pattern of expense recognition.

Accordingly, since the update must be applied retrospectively, our reported 2017 operating and investing cash flows were revised in 2018 to report this amount as investing cash flows.
