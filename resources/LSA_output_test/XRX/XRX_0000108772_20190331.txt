The increase in Net income attributable to Xerox for the three months ended March 31, 2019 as compared to the prior year period, was primarily due to the continued benefits of cost savings and productivity improvements from our Project Own It transformation actions, which offset the impact of lower revenues, as well as lower Transaction and related costs, net, lower Income tax expense and higher Equity in net income of unconsolidated affiliates.
These benefits were partially offset by higher Restructuring and related costs.
The increase reflects improved cash flow from earnings and lower restructuring payments, which were partially offset by a use of cash for working capital2 and accrued compensation.
For the three months ended March 31, 2019 these revenues decreased 8.3% as compared to the first quarter 2018, including a 2.5-percentage point unfavorable impact from currency.3.2 By-Laws of the Registrant as amended through May 14, 2018.
