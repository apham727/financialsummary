In third quarter 2018, we determined that the Pension Benefit Obligation (PBO) for our UK funded pension plan at December 31, 2017 was overstated by approximately GBP 40 million (approximately USD $53 or $43 after-tax).
Our services contracts may also include the sale or lease of equipment and software.
Certain document management services arrangements may also include an embedded lease of equipment.
We consider the economic life of most of our products to be five years, since this represents the most frequent contractual lease term for our principal products and only a small percentage of our leases are for original terms longer than five years.
Leases will be classified as either finance or operating, with classification affecting the pattern of expense recognition.
Some of these conforming changes such as those related to the definition of minimum lease payments, may potentially result in certain lease arrangements, which are currently accounted for as operating leases, being classified and accounted for as sales-type leases with a corresponding up-front recognition of equipment sales revenue.
This update is effective for our fiscal year beginning January 1, 2019 and certain practical expedients can be elected upon adoption.
