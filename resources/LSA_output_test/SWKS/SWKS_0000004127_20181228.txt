The Company’s analog semiconductors are connecting people, places, and things, spanning a number of new applications within the aerospace, automotive, broadband, cellular infrastructure, connected home, industrial, medical, military, smartphone, tablet and wearable markets.
In August 2015, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) deferred the effective date of Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606), (“ASU 2014-09”), which outlines a single comprehensive model for entities to use in accounting for revenue arising from contracts with customers and will supersede most current revenue recognition guidance.
This ASU requires a financial asset (or a group of financial assets) measured on the basis of amortized cost to be presented at the net amount expected to be collected.
This ASU requires lessees to reflect most leases on their balance sheet as assets and obligations.
Accounts receivable represents the Company’s unconditional right to receive consideration from its customer.
Payments are due within one year of invoicing and do not include a significant financing component.
To date, there have been no material impairment losses on accounts receivable.
The Company has a single reportable operating segment which designs, develops, manufactures and markets similar proprietary semiconductor products, including intellectual property.
The Company assesses its determination of operating segments at least annually.
Accordingly, the Company considers its product offerings to be similar in nature and therefore not segregated for reporting purposes.
The contractual maturities of noncurrent available-for-sale marketable securities were due within two years or less.

We, together with our consolidated subsidiaries, are empowering the wireless networking revolution.
Our analog semiconductors are connecting people, places, and things spanning a number of new applications within the aerospace, automotive, broadband, cellular infrastructure, connected home, industrial, medical, military, smartphone, tablet and wearable markets.
Selling, general and administrative expenses remained consistent as a percentage of net revenue.
The increase in cash from operating activities during the three months ended December 28, 2018, was primarily related to an increase in cash generated from collecting receivables and reduced payments of payables totaling $218.7 million.
Cash provided by investing activities was $171.5 million during the three months ended December 28, 2018, as compared with $34.2 million cash used in investing activities during the three months ended December 29, 2017.
•$67.1 million related to the payment of cash dividends on our common stock; and •$19.4 million related to the minimum statutory payroll tax withholdings upon vesting of employee performance and restricted stock awards.
Based on our historical results of operations, we expect that our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities on hand and the cash we expect to generate from operations will be sufficient to fund our research and development, capital expenditures, potential acquisitions, working capital, quarterly cash dividend payments (if such dividends are declared by the Board of Directors), outstanding commitments and other liquidity requirements associated with existing operations for at least the next 12 months.
However, we cannot be certain that our cash on hand and cash generated from operations will be available in the future to fund all of our capital and operating requirements.

Our cash equivalent investments have short-term maturity periods that dampen the impact of market or interest rate risk.
However, we may choose not to hedge certain foreign exchange exposures for a variety of reasons, including, but not limited to, accounting considerations and the prohibitive economic cost of hedging particular exposures.
