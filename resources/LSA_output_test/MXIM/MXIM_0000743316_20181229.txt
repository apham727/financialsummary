The year-end condensed consolidated balance sheet data were derived from audited consolidated financial statements but do not include all disclosures required by GAAP.
In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued Accounting Standard Update ("ASU") 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606).
Under the new standard, revenue is recognized when a customer obtains control of promised goods or services in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services.
On July 1, 2018, the Company adopted Topic 606 and related amendments (ASU 2015-14, Deferral of the Effective Date; ASU 2016-08, Principal versus Agent Considerations; ASU 2016-10, Identifying Performance Obligations and Licensing, ASU 2016-12, Narrow-Scope Improvements and Practical Expedients and ASU 2016-20, Technical Corrections and Improvements to Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers) using the modified retrospective method applied to all contracts that are not completed at the date of initial application (i.e., July 1, 2018).
Results for reporting periods beginning after July 1, 2018 are presented under Topic 606, while prior period amounts are not adjusted and continue to be reported in accordance with historic accounting standards under Topic 605.
There was no impact on the opening retained earnings as of July 1, 2018 due to the adoption of Topic 606.
•The Company does not disclose the value of unsatisfied performance obligations for (i) contracts with an original expected length of one year or less and (ii) contracts for which the Company recognizes revenue at the amount to which it has the right to invoice for services performed.
•The Company has elected to exclude sales, use, value added, and some excise taxes, if applicable, from the measurement of the transaction price.
The transaction price excludes sales and other similar taxes.
The Company recognizes revenue for sales to direct customers and distribution customers ("distributors") when a customer obtains control of promised goods or services in an amount that reflects the consideration which the Company expects to receive in exchange for those goods or services.
Specific customer returns and allowances are considered within this estimate.
Customers are generally required to pay for products and services within the Company’s standard terms, which is net 30 days from the date of invoice.
The Company does not have any significant financing components greater than one year.
To date, actual distributor claims activity has been materially consistent with the estimates that the Company has made based on its historical rates.
Both finance leases and operating leases will result in the lessee recognizing a right-of-use asset and a corresponding lease liability.
Level 1 - Quoted (unadjusted) prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
Level 2 - Observable inputs other than quoted prices included in Level 1, such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active, or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the asset or liability.
The Company’s Level 2 assets and liabilities consist of U.S. Treasury securities, agency securities, corporate debt securities, certificates of deposit, commercial paper and foreign currency forward contracts that are valued using quoted market prices or are determined using a yield curve model based on current market rates.

The major end-markets in which our products are sold are the Automotive, Communications and Data Center, Computing, Consumer and Industrial markets.
Except for the accounting policies and estimates outlined under Part I, Item 1.
Revenue from industrial products are down by 14%, mainly due to a decline in shipments of control and automation products.
Revenue from communications and data center products are down by 20%, due to generally lower shipments of server, basestation and data center products.
Revenue from automotive products are up by 3%, driven by higher demand for auto powertrain, and auto safety and security products.
In addition, the decrease in revenue was partially driven by a one-time incremental $22.0 million of revenue recognized as a result of the sell-in accounting revenue transition during the second quarter of fiscal 2018.
