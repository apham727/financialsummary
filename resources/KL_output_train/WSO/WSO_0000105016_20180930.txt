In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (the FASB) issued a standard on revenue recognition that provides a single, comprehensive revenue recognition model for all contracts with customers.
Under the new guidance, modification accounting is required only if the fair value, the vesting conditions or the classification of the award (as equity or liability) changes as a result of the change in terms or conditions.
We adopted the New Revenue Standard on January 1, 2018 using the modified retrospective approach.
Revenue primarily consists of sales of air conditioning, heating and refrigeration equipment and related parts and supplies.
We satisfy our performance obligations for services when we render the services within the agreed-upon service period.
Total service revenue is not material and accounted for less than 1% of our consolidated revenues for both the quarter and nine months ended September 30, 2018.
We estimate product returns based on historical experience and record them on a gross basis.
Sales incentives are accounted for as a reduction in the transaction price and are generally paid on an annual basis.
We generally expense sales commissions when incurred because the amortization period is one year or less.
We do not disclose the value of unsatisfied performance obligations for contracts with an original expected length of one year or less.
borrowings outstanding under the credit agreement are classified as current liabilities in our condensed consolidated unaudited balance sheet at September 30, 2018.
