Certain amounts in the prior year consolidated financial statements have been reclassified to the current year presentation.
The impact of the reclassifications made to prior year amounts is not material and did not affect net income.
This update is effective for public companies for annual reporting periods beginning after  December 15, 2019.
Management is currently evaluating the impact of ASU 2016-13 on our consolidated financial statements.
In  February 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-02, "Income Statement - Reporting Comprehensive Income."
The adoption of this standard has not had a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.
The amendments in ASU 2018-14 would need to be applied on a retrospective basis.
Management is currently assessing the impact ASU 2018-14 will have on our disclosures.
The Company early adopted this standard effective  April 1, 2019, utilizing the prospective approach to all implementation costs incurred after the date of adoption.
The adoption of ASU 2018-15 has not had a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.
As discussed in Note 1, the Company adopted the new leasing standard using the modified retrospective approach with an effective date of  April 1, 2019.
When available, we use the rate implicit in the lease to discount lease payments to present value; however, most of our leases do not provide a readily determinable implicit rate.
Therefore, we must estimate our incremental borrowing rate to discount the lease payments based on information available at lease commencement.
Our incremental borrowing rate is based on a credit-adjusted risk-free rate at commencement date, which best approximates a secured rate over a similar term of lease.
Basic earnings per share are computed by dividing net earnings by the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding for the period.
