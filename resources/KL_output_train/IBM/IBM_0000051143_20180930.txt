The periods presented in this Form 10-Q are reported on a comparable basis.
Financial results adjusted for currency are calculated by translating current period activity in local currency using the comparable prior year periods currency conversion rate.
Generally, when the dollar either strengthens or weakens against other currencies, the growth at constant currency rates or adjusting for currency will be higher or lower than growth reported at actual exchange rates.
In the third quarter of 2018, the company reported $18.8 billion in revenue, $2.7 billion in income from continuing operations and operating (non-GAAP) earnings of $3.1 billion, resulting in diluted earnings per share from continuing operations of $2.94 as reported and $3.42 on an operating (non-GAAP) basis.
The annual exit run rate for as-a-Service revenue increased to $11.4 billion in the third quarter of 2018 compared to $9.4 billion in the third quarter of 2017.
This benefit was partially offset by a lower level of intellectual property (IP) income (1 point) compared to the prior year.
Net income of $2.7 billion decreased 1.2 percent year to year.
Operating (non-GAAP) income from continuing operations of $3.1 billion increased 2.9 percent with an operating (non-GAAP) income margin from continuing operations of 16.7 percent, an increase of 0.8 points year to year.
The operating (non-GAAP) effective tax rate from continuing operations in the third quarter of 2018 was 12.8 percent, a decline of 2.0 points.
Net cash used in financing activities of $0.4 billion decreased $2.3 billion compared to the third quarter of 2017, driven primarily by a decrease in net cash used for debt transactions ($2.0 billion) and a decrease in cash used for gross common share repurchases ($0.3 billion).
The company continues to expect free cash flow to be approximately $12 billion in 2018.
Free cash flow realization is expected to be in excess of 100 percent of GAAP net income.
