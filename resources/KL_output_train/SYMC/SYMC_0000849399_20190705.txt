Third parties may be unwilling to enter into material agreements with respect to the Enterprise Security business or the Cyber Safety Security business.
New or existing customers, suppliers and business partners may prefer to enter into agreements with our competitors who have not expressed an intention to sell their business because customers, suppliers and business partners may perceive that such new relationships are likely to be more stable.
The completion of the Sale is subject to the satisfaction or waiver of various conditions, which may not be satisfied in a timely manner or at all.
If the Sale is not completed, we may have difficulty recouping the costs incurred in connection with negotiating the Sale.
An alternative sale transaction, if available, may yield lower consideration than the proposed Sale, be on less favorable terms and conditions than those contained in the agreement and involve significant delay.
