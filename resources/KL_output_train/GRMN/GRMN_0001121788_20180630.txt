Total unit sales in the second quarter of 2018 decreased to 3,783 when compared to total unit sales of 3,904 in the second quarter of 2017.
Auto segment revenue decreased 19% from the year-ago quarter, primarily due to the ongoing PND market contraction.

The outdoor segment increase in cost of goods sold as a percent of revenue primarily resulted from increased promotional activity during the second quarter of 2018.
Gross profit dollars in the second quarter of 2018 increased 8% while gross margin increased 30 basis points compared to the year-ago quarter.
Gross margin in the marine segment increased compared to the year-ago quarter, as discussed above.
Advertising expense increased 4% in absolute dollars and was relatively flat as a percent of revenues compared to the year-ago quarter.
The total absolute dollar increase was driven primarily by increased cooperative advertising associated with higher sales.
Advertising expense, as a percent of revenues, decreased in the fitness segment due to greater leverage on fitness advertising spend.
Selling, general and administrative expense increased 14% in absolute dollars and was relatively flat as a percent of revenues compared to the year-ago quarter.
The auto segment increase as a percent of revenues in the second quarter of 2018 was primarily attributable to accelerated amortization of an intangible asset related to a previous acquisition.
The increase in absolute dollars and as a percent of revenues in the marine segment was primarily attributable to expenses associated with recent acquisitions.
The growth in operating income in absolute dollars is primarily attributable to revenue growth while the slight decrease in operating income as a percent of revenues is primarily attributable to the increased operating expenses, as discussed above.
The Company recorded income tax expense of $45.7 million in the 13-week period ended June 30, 2018, compared to income tax expense of $57.3 million in the 13-week period ended July 1, 2017, which included tax expense of $7.3 million associated with the expiration of share-based awards.
