"Risk Factors" of the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 30, 2017.
For the third quarter of 2018, the Company recognized net sales of $439.2 million compared to $317.9 million in the third quarter of 2017 representing an increase of $121.3 million, or 38.2%.
The increase was primarily driven by the acquisition of IXYS, which added $99.7 million in sales.
The increase in net income reflects operating income increases across the Electronics segment, partially offset by lower operating income in the Automotive segment.
Additionally, the per share results reflect an increase in the weighted average diluted shares outstanding of 2.1 million resulting from the shares issued in conjunction with the acquisition of IXYS.
Net cash provided by operating activities was $252.1 million for the nine months ended September 29, 2018 as compared to $181.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2017.
