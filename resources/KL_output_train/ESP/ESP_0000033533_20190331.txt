There is competition in all classes of products manufactured by the Company, ranging from divisions of the largest electronic companies, to many small companies.
The Company's sales do not represent a significant share of the industry's market for any class of its products.
Our business is not seasonal.
As part of our strategy, we adjust our pricing in order to achieve a balance which enables us both to retain repeat programs while being more competitive in bidding on new programs.
In order to maintain a balanced business, we are continuing to place an emphasis on securing “build to print” opportunities, which will allow production work to go directly to the manufacturing floor, limiting the impact on our engineering staff.
Management expects revenues in fiscal year 2019 to be higher than revenues during fiscal year 2018, but expects the gross profit margin to be lower in fiscal year 2019 as compared to the gross profit margin during fiscal year 2018.
New orders received in the first nine months of fiscal year 2019 were approximately $22.2 million as compared to $28.6 million of new orders received in the first nine months of fiscal 2018.
It is presently anticipated that a minimum of $12.2 million of orders comprising the March 31, 2019 backlog will be filled during the fiscal year ending June 30, 2019.
The minimum of $12.2 million does not include any shipments, which may be made against orders subsequently received during the fiscal year ending June 30, 2019.
The estimate of the March 31, 2019 backlog to be shipped in fiscal year 2019 is subject to future events, which may cause the amount of the backlog actually shipped to differ from such estimate.
In addition to the backlog, the Company currently has outstanding opportunities representing approximately $58 million in the aggregate as of May 1, 2019 for both repeat and new programs.
A significant portion of the Company’s business is the production of military and industrial electronic equipment for use by the U.S. and foreign governments and certain industrial customers.
We assess each contract at its inception to determine whether it should be combined with other contracts.
We evaluate the products or services promised in each contract at inception to determine whether the contract should be accounted for as having one or more performance obligation.
We determine the transaction price for each contract based on the consideration we expect to receive for the products or services being provided under the contract.
The transaction price for each performance obligation is based on the estimated standalone selling price of the product or service underlying each performance obligation.
Transaction prices on our contracts subject to the Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR) are typically based on estimated costs plus a reasonable profit margin.
The provision for losses on contracts is included in other accrued expenses on the Company’s balance sheet.
The costs attributed to units delivered under contracts are based on the estimated average cost of all units expected to be produced.
Certain contracts are expected to extend beyond twelve months.
Although shipments supporting the rail industry remain strong, the overall decline in power supply shipments in the current fiscal year relates primarily to the timing of shipments related to a specific military contract which had significant shipments in the prior fiscal year.
In the case of the latter, the Company can incur what it refers to as “loss contracts,” meaning engineering design contracts in which the Company invests with the objective of developing future product sales.
The gross profit percentage increased in the three months ended March 31, 2019 compared to the same period in 2018 primarily due to an increase in sales while expenditures incurred during the period related to engineering design investments remained comparable to those incurred in the same period in 2018 offset, in part, by a slight overall decline in the gross profit percentage on product shipments.
The gross profit percentage decreased in the nine months ended March 31, 2019 as compared to the same period in 2018 primarily due to the increase in expenditures incurred related to engineering design investments primarily pertaining to a specific contract while sales for the period remained flat when compared to the same period in 2018.
