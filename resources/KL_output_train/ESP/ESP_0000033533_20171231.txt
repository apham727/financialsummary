There is competition in all classes of products manufactured by the Company from divisions of the largest electronic companies, as well as many small companies.
The Company's sales do not represent a significant share of the industry's market for any class of its products.
Our business is not seasonal.
Uncertainty in federal defense spending and future procurement needs supporting the rail industry continues to drive competition.
Accordingly, we adjust our pricing strategy in order to achieve a balance which enables us both to retain repeat programs while being more competitive in bidding on new programs.
In order to maintain a balanced business, we are continuing to place an emphasis on securing “build to print” opportunities, which will allow production work to go directly to the manufacturing floor, limiting the impact on our engineering staff.

In addition to the backlog, the Company currently has outstanding opportunities representing in excess of $69 million in the aggregate as of January 30, 2018 for both repeat and new programs.
The outstanding quotations encompass various new and previously manufactured power supplies, transformers, and subassemblies.
