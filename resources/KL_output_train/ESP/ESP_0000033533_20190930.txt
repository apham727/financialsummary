Our business is not seasonal.
These risks include, without limitation, fluctuating requirements for power supplies in the rail industry, dependence on appropriations from the United States Government and the governments of foreign nations, program allocations, the potential of governmental termination of orders for convenience, and the general strength of the industry sectors in which our customers transact business.
In order to maintain a balanced business, we are continuing to place an emphasis on securing “build to print” opportunities, which will allow production work to go directly to the manufacturing floor, limiting the impact on our engineering staff.
We continue to experience technical and schedule delays with our major development programs.
Management expects revenues in fiscal year 2020 to approximate revenues during fiscal year 2019 and expects the gross profit margin to be higher in fiscal year 2020 than the gross profit margin during fiscal year 2019.
New orders received in the first three months of fiscal year 2020 were approximately $7.0 million as compared to $6.9 million of new orders received in the first three months of fiscal 2019.
The outstanding quotations encompass various new and previously manufactured power supplies, transformers, and subassemblies.
This high concentration level with these customers presents significant risk.
We assess each contract at its inception to determine whether it should be combined with other contracts.
When making this determination, we consider factors such as whether two or more contracts were negotiated and executed at or near the same time, or were negotiated with an overall profit objective.
We evaluate the products or services promised in each contract at inception to determine whether the contract should be accounted for as having one or more performance obligations.
We determine the transaction price for each contract based on the consideration we expect to receive for the products or services being provided under the contract.
Transaction prices on our contracts subject to the Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR) are typically based on estimated costs plus a reasonable profit margin.
Balances for slow-moving and obsolete inventory are reviewed on a regular basis by analyzing estimated demand, inventory on hand, sales levels, market conditions, and other information and reduce inventory balances based on this analysis.
The provision for losses on contracts is included in other accrued expenses on the Company’s balance sheet.
Certain contracts are expected to extend beyond twelve months.
Gross profits for the three months ended September 30, 2019 and 2018 were $1,136,348 and $992,934, respectively.
Gross profit as a percentage of sales was 19.2% and 11.9%, for the same periods, respectively.
The gross profits on mature products and build to print contracts are typically higher as compared to products which are still in the engineering development stage or in early stages of production.
The gross profit percentage increased in the three months ended September 30, 2019 as compared to the same period in 2018 primarily due to the decrease in incurred spending related to a specific engineering design contract when compared to the same period in 2018.
Other income for the three months ended September 30, 2019 and 2018 was $47,489 and $76,070, respectively.
The decrease for the three months ended is primarily due to the reduction in investment securities offset, in part, by the gradual increase in the current yield percentages earned on the investment securities.
The effective tax rate in fiscal 2020 is less than the statutory tax rate mainly due to the benefit derived from the ESOP dividends paid on allocated shares.
The effective tax rate in fiscal 2019 is less than the statutory tax rate mainly due to the benefit derived from the ESOP dividends paid on allocated shares.
