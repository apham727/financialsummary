The relevant business combination disclosures will be included in the Company’s consolidated financial statements once preliminary accounting has been completed.We derive our revenues from the delivery of products and services to clients primarily in the financial services and healthcare industries.
Fluctuations in the value of assets under our clients’ management could also adversely affect our revenues because pricing in many of our agreements is adjusted based on assets under management.
In addition, any other events that adversely affect our clients’ businesses, rates of growth or numbers of clients they serve could decrease demand for our products and services and the number of transactions we process.
We may be unsuccessful in predicting the needs of changing industries and whether potential clients will accept our products or services.
If trends or events do not occur as we expect, our business could be negatively impacted.
We derive significant revenues from asset management, administration and distribution contracts with such clients.
