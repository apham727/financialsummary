The Company has a limited number of long-term contracts.
Long-term contracts are primarily requirements based and do not guarantee quantities.
The Company’s total net sales from continuing operations worldwide in the 13 weeks ended August 26, 2018 decreased to $11.2 million from $11.4 million in the 13 weeks ended August 27, 2017.
The Company’s total net sales from continuing operations worldwide in the 26 weeks ended August 26, 2018 increased to $21.6 million from $20.1 million in the 26 weeks ended August 27, 2017.
The lower gross profit margin from continuing operations for the 13 weeks ended August 26, 2018 compared to the 13 weeks ended August 27, 2017 was principally due to the lower sales in the 13 weeks ended August 26, 2018 compared to the 13 weeks ended August 27, 2017.
The higher gross profit margin from continuing operations for the 26 weeks ended August 26, 2018 compared to the 26 weeks ended August 27, 2017 was principally a result of higher sales in the 26 weeks ended August 26, 2018 compared to the 26 weeks ended August 27, 2017.
Selling, general and administrative expenses from continuing operations decreased by $124,000 during the 13 weeks ended August 26, 2018, or by 6%, and decreased by $463,000 during the 26 weeks ended August 26, 2018, or by 10%, compared to last fiscal year's comparable periods, and these expenses, measured as percentages of sales from continuing operations, were 18.9% and 19.5%, respectively, in the 13 weeks and 26 weeks ended August 26, 2018 compared to 19.7% and 23.3%, respectively, in the 13 weeks and 26 weeks ended August 27, 2017.

On July 25, 2018, the Company entered into a definitive agreement to sell its Electronics Business for $145.0 million in cash.
The Company expects this transaction to be completed in the fourth quarter of the 2019 fiscal year.
During the 2018 fiscal year, the Company consolidated its Nelco Products, Inc. Electronics Business Unit located in Fullerton, California and its Neltec, Inc. Electronics Business Unit located in Tempe, Arizona.
income taxes payable decreased by 8% at August 26, 2018 compared to February 25, 2018 primarily due to income tax payments made during the 26 weeks ended August 26, 2018.
The decrease in working capital at August 26, 2018 compared to February 25, 2018 was due principally to the decrease in accounts receivable, partially offset by the decrease in accounts payable.
The Company believes its financial resources will be sufficient, through the 12 months following the filing of this Form 10-Q Quarterly Report and for the foreseeable future thereafter, to provide for continued investment in working capital and property, plant and equipment and for general corporate purposes.
The Company’s financial resources are also available for purchases of the Company's common stock, appropriate acquisitions and other expansions of the Company's business.
The increase in working capital at August 26, 2018 compared to February 25, 2018 was due principally to the increase in inventory levels.
The Company's contractual obligations and other commercial commitments to make future payments under contracts, such as lease agreements, consist only of (i) operating lease commitments and (ii) commitments to purchase raw materials.
The Company has no other long-term debt, capital lease obligations, unconditional purchase obligations or other long-term obligations, standby letters of credit, guarantees, standby repurchase obligations or other commercial commitments or contingent commitments, other than two standby letters of credit in the total amount of $980,000 to secure the Company's obligations under its workers' compensation insurance program.
