Selling, general and administrative expenses included stock option expenses of $234,000 and $709,000, respectively, for the 13 weeks and 39 weeks ended November 26, 2017, compared to stock option expenses of $264,000 and $968,000, respectively, for the 13 weeks and 39 weeks ended November 27, 2016.
