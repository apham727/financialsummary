The core principle of ASC 842 is that a lessee should recognize on the balance sheet the assets and liabilities that arise from leases.
Lease contracts may include lease components and non-lease components, such as common area maintenance and utilities for property leases.
The Company’s incremental borrowing rate is the rate of interest that the Company would have to pay to borrow an amount equal to the lease payments over a similar term, which is the three-month London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) plus a 2.5% credit risk spread.
The lease liability is reduced by the cash payment less the interest each period.
