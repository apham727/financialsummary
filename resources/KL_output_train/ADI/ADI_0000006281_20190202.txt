The categorization of revenue by end market is determined using a variety of data points including the technical characteristics of the product, the “sold to” customer information, the “ship to” customer information and the end customer product or application into which our product will be incorporated.
As data systems for capturing and tracking this data evolve and improve, the categorization of products by end market can vary over time.
When this occurs, we reclassify revenue by end market for prior periods.
