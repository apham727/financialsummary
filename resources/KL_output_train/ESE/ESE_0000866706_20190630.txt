Revenue is recognized when control of the goods or services promised under the contract is transferred to the customer either at a point in time (e.g., upon delivery) or over time (e.g., as we perform under the contract).
For contracts with multiple performance obligations, the expected consideration, or the transaction price, is allocated to each performance obligation identified in the contract based on the relative standalone selling price of each performance obligation.
Revenue is then recognized for the transaction price allocated to the performance obligation when control of the promised goods or services underlying the performance obligation is transferred.
Arrangements with customers that include payment terms extending beyond one year are not significant.
The contracts may contain multiple products, which are capable of being distinct as the customer could benefit from each product on its own or together with other readily available resources.
Each product is separately identifiable from the other products in the contract.
We generally use the cost-to-cost method to measure progress for our Filtration segment contracts the rate at which costs are incurred to fulfill a contract best depicts the transfer of control to the customer.In the third quarter of 2019, sales, net earnings and diluted earnings per share were $199.8 million, $20.1 million and $0.77 per share, respectively, compared to $192.2 million, $19.0 million and $0.73 per share, respectively, in the third quarter of 2018.
