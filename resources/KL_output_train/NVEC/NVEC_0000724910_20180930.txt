Financial Statements.
We recognize revenue when we satisfy performance obligations by the transfer of control of products or services to our customers, in an amount that reflects the consideration we expect to be entitled to in exchange for those products or services.
We recognize revenue over a period of time using costs incurred as the measurement of progress towards completion.
A contract asset is recognized when we have a right to consideration from the transfer of goods or services to a customer but have not completed our performance obligation.
A contract liability is recognized when we have been paid by a customer but have not yet satisfied the performance obligation by transferring goods or services.
We had no material contract assets or contract liabilities as of  September 30, 2018 or  March 31, 2018.
Unsatisfied performance obligations represent contracts with an original expected duration of one year or less.
As permitted under Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, we are using the practical expedient not to disclose the value of these unsatisfied performance obligations.

Level 1 – Financial instruments with quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
Level 2 – Financial instruments with quoted prices in active markets for similar assets or liabilities.
Level 2 fair value measurements are determined using either prices for similar instruments or inputs that are either directly or indirectly observable, such as interest rates.
Level 3 – Inputs to the fair value measurement are unobservable inputs or valuation techniques.
We calculate the share-based compensation expense using the Black-Scholes standard option-pricing model.
The increase in stock-based compensation expense for fiscal 2019 compared to fiscal 2018 was due to an increase in the model valuation for the same number of options to purchase shares.
