We undertake no obligation to update any of these forward-looking statements for any reason.
We discuss certain factors in greater detail in Business Overview below.
The terms fiscal 2018 and fiscal 2017 refer to our fiscal years ending April 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively.
Corporate capital spending trends and commitments are the primary determinants of the size of the market for business software.
In January 2018, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) provided an update to the World Economic Outlook (WEO) for the 2018 and 2019 world economic growth forecast.
The update noted that, Global economic activity continues to firm up.
Global output is estimated to have grown by 3.7 percent in 2017, which is 0.1 percentage point faster than projected in the fall and  1⁄2 percentage point higher than in 2016.
The pickup in growth has been broad based, with notable upside surprises in Europe and Asia.
Global growth forecasts for 2018 and 2019 have been revised upward by 0.2 percentage point to 3.9 percent.
We believe information technology spending will incrementally improve over the long term as increased global competition forces companies to improve productivity by upgrading their technology systems.
Customers continue to take long periods to evaluate discretionary software purchases.
We believe the improvement in economic conditions may be driving some businesses to invest in achieving more process and efficiency enhancements in their operations and to invest in solutions that improve operating margins, rather than make large infrastructure-type technology purchases.
We provide our software solutions through three major business segments, which are further broken down into a total of six major product and service groups.
The three business segments are (1) Supply Chain Management (SCM), (2) Information Technology (IT) Consulting and (3) Other.
Our selling expenses generally include the salary and commissions paid to our sales professionals, along with marketing, promotional, travel and associated costs.
   Dependence on Capital Spending Patterns.
