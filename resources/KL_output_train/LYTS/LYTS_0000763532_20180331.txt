Fiscal 2018 third quarter operating income of $743,000 increased $1.5 million from an operating loss of $(774,000) in the third quarter of fiscal 2017.
Fiscal 2018 nine month operating loss of $(19,524,000) represents a $22.6 million change from operating income of $3,110,000 in the first nine months of fiscal 2017.
The change from operating income in fiscal 2017 to an operating loss in fiscal 2018 is primarily the result of a $28 million goodwill impairment in fiscal 2018 with no corresponding event in fiscal 2017.
We believe that these adjusted supplemental measures are useful in assessing the operating performance of our business.
Below is a reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures to operating income, net income, and earnings per share for the periods indicated.
The reconciliation of reported net income and earnings per share to adjusted net income and earnings per share may not agree due to rounding differences and due to the difference between basic and dilutive weighted average shares outstanding in the computation of earnings per share.
Our comparable selling and administrative expenses excluding Atlas increased 3.5% in the third quarter of fiscal 2018 from the same period of fiscal 2017.
The Lighting Segment third quarter fiscal 2018 operating income of $2,982,000 decreased $1.1 million or 27.6% from operating income of $4,120,000 in the same period of fiscal 2017.

The Company incurred $185,000 in the third quarter of fiscal 2017 related to the closure of its Woonsocket, Rhode Island facility with no comparable expense in fiscal 2018.
The $0.4 million decrease is primarily the result of decreased employee compensation and benefit expense ($0.2 million decrease) and an impairment of an intangible asset in fiscal 2017 of $479,000 with no comparable charge in fiscal 2018 partially offset by small increases in other cost categories.
The Graphics Segment third quarter fiscal 2018 operating income of $415,000 increased $0.9 million from and operating loss of $(480,000) in the same period of fiscal 2017.
