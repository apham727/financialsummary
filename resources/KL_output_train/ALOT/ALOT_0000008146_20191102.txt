We normally do not have contract assets, which are primarily unbilled accounts receivable that are conditional on something other than the passage of time.
These costs are deferred and amortized based on the forecasted number of units sold over the estimated benefit term, which was estimated to be approximately 10 years.
The balance of these contract assets at January 31, 2019 was $903,000.
These outstanding common equivalent shares were not included due to their anti-dilutive effect.

Product Identification (PI)  offers digital label printers, over-printers, labeling software, spare parts, service contracts and related printing supplies such as pressure sensitive labels, tags, inks, toners and thermal transfer ribbons used in those product identification digital printers.
Three Months Ended November 2, 2019 vs. Three Months Ended October 27, 2018 Supplies revenue in the current quarter was $17.7 million, a 2.5% decrease over prior years third quarter supplies revenue of $18.1 million.
The decrease in the current quarter supplies revenue as compared to the third quarter of the prior year is primarily attributable to a decrease in revenue of QuickLabel product supplies in the Product Identification segment.
Current quarter other expense primarily includes interest expense on the Companys debt and revolving line of credit of $0.2 million.
This compares to the prior years third quarter tax provision of $0.4 million, which reflected a benefit of $0.1 million related to windfall tax benefits related to the Companys stock and an effective tax rate of 22.3%.
The current years first nine months of international revenue reflected an unfavorable foreign exchange rate impact of $1.2 million.
Supplies revenue in the first nine months of the current year was $55.5 million, representing a 5.3% increase over the prior years first nine months revenue of $52.7 million.
The current year increase in supplies revenue is due primarily to the increase in inkjet printer supplies and label sales, tempered by lower thermal film and electrophotographic supplies revenue in the Product Identification segment.
Service and other revenues were $10.0 million in the first nine months of the current year, a 13.4% increase compared to the prior years first nine months service and other revenues of $8.8 million.
