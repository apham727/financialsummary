Our second quarter fiscal 2019 revenue increased by 9.3% compared to the second quarter of fiscal 2018.
Revenue decreased in our network systems category by 22.7%, for the second quarter of fiscal 2019, compared to the same quarter last year.
Our second quarter fiscal year 2019 gross profit increased by 4.9%, compared to the second quarter of fiscal year 2018.
The increase in gross profit was primarily the result of the increase in revenue discussed above.
In addition, many manufacturers sell direct.
We believe, however, that our strength in service, the breadth and depth of our product offering, our information technology system, industry experience and knowledge, and our large customer base and purchasing relationships with approximately 440 manufacturers, provide us with a significant competitive advantage over new entrants to the marketplace.
Total Revenues.
Revenues for the second quarter of fiscal 2019 increased 9.3% compared with the second quarter of fiscal 2018.
Overall gross profit margin decreased slightly from 20.6% in the second quarter of fiscal 2018 to 19.8% in the second quarter of fiscal 2019.
Within our commercial segment, gross profit in our public carrier, and integrators and value-added reseller markets increased by 26.6%, and 3.1%, respectively.
We continue to experience margin compression within the public carrier market because of increases in sales with larger customers.
Within our retail market, gross profit decreased by 0.4% in the second quarter of fiscal 2019 as compared to 2018, due to higher freight costs, particularly air freight from foreign vendors.
There were a few isolated incidences which resulted in a higher than usual bad debt expense during the second quarter of fiscal 2019.
