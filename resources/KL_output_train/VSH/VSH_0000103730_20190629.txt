The four fiscal quarters in 2019 end on March 30, 2019, June 29, 2019, September 28, 2019, and December 31, 2019, respectively.
In February 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued Accounting Standards Update ("ASU") No.
2016-02 and all related ASUs is codified in Accounting Standard Codification (“ASC”) Topic 842, Leases.
The difference between the initial right of use asset and lease liability balances recognized upon adoption of ASC Topic 842 is primarily due to accrued lease incentive balances at December 31, 2018.
The transactions did not qualify as a completed sale and leaseback under previous GAAP.
However, pursuant to ASC Topic 842’s sale and leaseback guidance, the transaction would qualify as a completed sale.
Leases with a duration less than or equal to twelve months are considered short-term leases.
Variable lease payments based on an index or rate are included in the right of use assets and lease liabilities based on the effective rates at lease commencement.

This Management's Discussion and Analysis ("MD&A") is intended to provide an understanding of Vishay's financial condition, results of operations and cash flows by focusing on changes in certain key measures from period to period.
"Risk Factors," filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on February 15, 2019.
As a result of these transactions, we reduced the principal amount of outstanding convertible senior debentures due 2040, 2041, and 2042 from $575 million to $36.6 million.
We continued to repurchase convertible senior debentures in open market and privately-negotiated transactions with holders, further reducing the principal amount of outstanding convertible senior debentures to $21.1 million in 2019.
Substantially all of these amounts will be used to repay certain intercompany indebtedness, to pay the US transition tax, and to fund capital expansion projects.
See further discussion in “Financial Metrics” and “Financial Condition, Liquidity, and Capital Resources” below.
This decrease has negatively impacted almost all key financial metrics, including net revenues.
Net revenues for the fiscal quarter ended June 29, 2019 were $685.2 million, compared to $745.2 million and $761.0 million for the fiscal quarters ended March 30, 2019 and June 30, 2018, respectively.
The net earnings attributable to Vishay stockholders for the fiscal quarter ended June 29, 2019 were $44.5 million, or $0.31 per diluted share, compared to $75.5 million, or $0.52 per diluted share for the fiscal quarter ended March 30, 2019, and $103.1 million, or $0.65 per diluted share for the fiscal quarter ended June 30, 2018.
Net revenues for the six fiscal months ended June 29, 2019 were $1,430.4 million, compared to $1,477.8 million for the six fiscal months ended June 30, 2018.
The net earnings attributable to Vishay stockholders for the six fiscal months ended June 29, 2019 were $119.9 million, or $0.83 per diluted share, compared to $165.5 million, or $1.04 per diluted share for the six fiscal months ended June 30, 2018.
We define free cash as the cash flows generated from continuing operations less capital expenditures plus net proceeds from the sale of property and equipment.
The reconciliations below include certain financial measures which are not recognized in accordance with GAAP, including adjusted net earnings, adjusted earnings per share, and free cash.
These non-GAAP measures should not be viewed as alternatives to GAAP measures of performance or liquidity.
These measures, as calculated by Vishay, may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies.
Our free cash results were significantly impacted by the payment of cash taxes related to the cash repatriated to the U.S. in the second fiscal quarters of 2019 and 2018 of $20.5 million and $92.1 million in the second fiscal quarters of 2019 and 2018, respectively, and the installment payments of the U.S. transition tax of $14.8 million and $14.4 million in the second fiscal quarters of 2019 and 2018, respectively.
These key financial measures and metrics include net revenues, gross profit margin, operating margin, segment operating income, end-of-period backlog, and the book-to-bill ratio.
