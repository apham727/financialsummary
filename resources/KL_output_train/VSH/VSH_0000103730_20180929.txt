Since 1985, we have pursued a business strategy of growth through focused research and development and acquisitions.
We expect to continue our strategy of acquisitions while also maintaining a prudent capital structure.
In addition to our growth plan, we also have opportunistically repurchased our stock.
The quarterly cash dividend was increased by 26% to $0.085 per share in the second fiscal quarter of 2018.
In December 2015, we amended our credit facility to increase our ability to repurchase shares of stock or pay cash dividends.
The Company repurchased 2,250,236 shares of stock for $39.9 million pursuant to the stock repurchase plan that expired on June 1, 2018.
In the second fiscal quarter of 2018, we issued $600 million convertible senior notes due 2025.
We recognized a loss of $17.3 million due to the early extinguishment of the repurchased convertible senior debentures.
A portion of the amounts repatriated in the third fiscal quarter were used to eliminate the remaining outstanding balance of the credit facility.
For several years, we implemented aggressive cost reduction programs.
In the fourth fiscal quarter of 2017, we substantially completed our cost reduction programs, which had been ongoing since 2013.
We utilize several financial metrics, including net revenues, gross profit margin, segment operating income, end-of-period backlog, book-to-bill ratio, inventory turnover, change in average selling prices, net cash and short-term investments (debt), and free cash generation to evaluate the performance and assess the future direction of our business.
See additional information in Note 1 to the consolidated condensed financial statements included in Item 1.
We continued to experience excellent business conditions in virtually all end-markets in the third fiscal quarter of 2018.
