Each quarter, we review the carrying value of this cash advance, and determine if an impairment reserve is necessary.

Substantially all assets and liabilities associated with the Content Delivery business were assigned to Vecima as part of the transaction.
A special committee of the Board, the Investment Committee, was established upon the signing of the CDN APA for the purpose of considering alternative means to deploy the proceeds of the sale of the Content Delivery business and other corporate assets to maximize long-term value for our stockholders.
We continually identify and evaluate a wide range of opportunities in an effort to reinvest the proceeds of our calendar year 2017 business dispositions and maximize use of other assets such as our NOLs.
We believe that these activities will enable us to identify, acquire and grow businesses and assets that will maximize value for all of our stockholders.
Our acquisition process is focused on identifying fairly- to under-valued businesses that have growth potential.
