NOTE 1. BASIS OF PRESENTATION AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES



Fiscal Years



Cypress Semiconductor Corporation (together with its consolidated subsidiaries, "Cypress" or the "Company") reports on a fiscal-year basis. The Company ends its quarters on the Sunday closest to the end of the applicable calendar quarter, except in a 53-week fiscal year, in which case the additional week falls into the fourth quarter of that fiscal year. Fiscal years 2019 and 2018 each contain(ed) 52 weeks. The first quarter of fiscal 2019 ended on March 31, 2019 and the first quarter of fiscal 2018 ended on April 1, 2018.



Basis of Presentation



The consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States ("GAAP") and include the accounts of Cypress Semiconductor Corporation and its subsidiaries. All intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated in consolidation.



In the opinion of management, the accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements contain all adjustments of a normal, recurring nature, which are necessary to state fairly the financial information included therein. These financial statements should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and related notes thereto included in Cypress' Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 30, 2018. The year-end condensed balance sheet data was derived from audited financial statements, but does not include all disclosures required by GAAP.



Results reported in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations for the three months ended March 31, 2019 are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for the full fiscal year.



Summary of Significant Accounting Policies



Leases



The Company applies the guidance in Accounting Standards Codification ("ASC") Topic 842 to individual leases of assets. When the Company receives substantially all of the economic benefits from and directs the use of specified property, plant and equipment, transactions give rise to leases.



The Company’s classes of assets include real estate leases, equipment leases, and vehicles leases.



Operating leases are included in operating lease right-of-use ("ROU") assets, other current liabilities, and operating lease liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets. ROU assets represent our right to use an underlying asset for the lease term and lease liabilities represent our obligation to make lease payments arising from the lease. Finance leases are included in property and equipment, current portion of long-term debt, revolving credit facility and long-term portion of debt in our consolidated balance sheets. 



The Company has elected the practical expedient within ASC Topic 842 to not separate lease and non-lease components within lease transactions for all classes of assets. Additionally, the Company has elected the short-term lease exception for all classes of assets, does not apply the recognition requirements for leases of 12 months or less, and recognizes lease payments for short-term leases as expense either straight-line over the lease term or as incurred depending on whether the lease payments are fixed or variable. These elections are applied consistently for all leases.



The Company subleases certain portions of buildings and land subject to operating leases. The terms and conditions of the subleases are commensurate with the terms and conditions within the original operating leases. The term of the subleases range from one to eight years, payments are fixed within the contracts, and there are no residual value guarantees or other restrictions or covenants in the leases. 



When discount rates implicit in leases cannot be readily determined, the Company uses the applicable incremental borrowing rate at lease commencement to perform lease classification tests on lease components and to measure lease liabilities and ROU assets. The incremental borrowing rate used by the Company was based on baseline rates and adjusted by the credit spreads 



9



commensurate with the Company’s secured borrowing rate, over a similar term. At each reporting period when there is a new lease initiated, the rates established for that quarter will be used. 



Other significant accounting policies are described in Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 30, 2018.



Recent Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet Adopted



In August 2018, the FASB issued Accounting Standard Update ("ASU") No. 2018-13, "Fair Value Measurement (Topic 820): Disclosure Framework - Changes to the Disclosure Requirements for Fair Value Measurement." The standard modifies the disclosure requirements on fair value measurements in Topic 820 by removing the requirement to disclose the reasons for transfers between Level 1 and Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy and the policy for timing of such transfers. The standard expands the disclosure requirements for Level 3 fair value measurement, primarily focused on changes in unrealized gains and losses included in other comprehensive income. The amendment is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019. The Company is currently evaluating the impact that the adoption of this standard will have on its consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.



In August 2018, the FASB issued ASU No. 2018-14, "Compensation - Retirement Benefits - Defined Benefit Plans - General (Subtopic 715-20): Disclosure Framework - Changes to the Disclosure Requirements for Defined Benefit Plans." The standard is designed to improve the effectiveness of disclosures by removing and adding disclosures related to defined benefit plans. The update is effective for fiscal years ending after December 15, 2020 with early adoption permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the impact that the adoption of this standard will have on its consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.



Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements



In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02, "Leases (ASC Topic 842)". The standard introduces new requirements to increase transparency and comparability among organizations for leasing transactions for both lessees and lessors. ASU No. 2016-02 requires a lessee to record a right-of-use asset and a lease liability for all leases with terms longer than 12 months. These leases will be either finance or operating, with classification affecting the pattern of expense recognition. 



In July 2018, the Board issued ASU 2018-11, which provided an alternative modified retrospective transition method. Under this method, the cumulative-effect adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings is recognized on the date of adoption (December 31, 2018). The Company adopted ASC Topic 842, as of December 31, 2018 and applied the alternative modified retrospective transition method requiring application of the new guidance to all leases existing at, or entered into on or after, the date of adoption, i.e. December 31, 2018.



As part of applying the transition method, the Company has elected to apply the package of transition practical expedients within the new guidance. As required by the new standard, these expedients have been elected as a package and are consistently applied across the Company’s lease portfolio. Given this election, the Company need not reassess:



•whether any expired or existing contracts are or contain leases



•the lease classification for any expired or existing leases



•treatment of initial direct costs relating to any existing leases 



As a result of adoption of this standard, and election of the transition practical expedients, the Company recognized ROU assets and lease liabilities for those leases classified as operating leases under ASC Topic 840 that continued to be classified as operating leases under ASC Topic 842 at the date of initial application. Leases classified as a capital lease under ASC 840 are classified as ‘Finance lease’ under this new standard. 



In applying the alternative modified retrospective transition method, the Company measured lease liabilities at the present value of the sum of remaining minimum rental payments (as defined under ASC Topic 840). The present value of lease liabilities has been measured using the Company’s incremental borrowing rates as of December 31, 2018 (the date of initial application). Additionally, ROU assets for these operating leases have been measured as the initial measurement of applicable lease liabilities adjusted for any unamortized initial direct costs, prepaid/accrued rent, unamortized lease incentives, and any ASC Topic 420 liabilities.



The adoption of this new standard at December 31, 2018, and the application of the modified retrospective transition approach resulted in the following changes: 



10



(1) assets increased by $54.3 million, primarily representing the recognition of ROU assets for operating leases and finance leases partially offset by derecognition of assets for capital leases previously designated under ASC Topic 840; and



(2) liabilities increased by $57.2 million, primarily representing the recognition of lease liabilities for operating leases and finance leases partially offset by derecognition of liabilities for capital leases previously designated under ASC Topic 840.



Other Recently Adopted Pronouncements:



In August 2017, the FASB issued ASU No. 2017-12, "Derivatives and Hedging (Topic 815): Targeted Improvements to Accounting for Hedging Activities." The amendments in ASU 2017-12 are intended to more closely align hedge accounting with companies’ risk management strategies, simplify the application of hedge accounting, and increase transparency as to the scope and results of hedging programs. The Company adopted this guidance in the first quarter of fiscal 2019. The adoption of this guidance did not have a material impact on the Company's consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.



In February 2018, the FASB issued ASU No. 2018-02, "Income Statement-Reporting Comprehensive Income (Topic 220): Reclassification of Certain Tax Effects from Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income." The amendments in ASU 2018-02 are intended to allow a reclassification from accumulated other comprehensive income to retained earnings for stranded tax effects resulting from the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. The Company adopted this guidance in the first quarter of fiscal 2019. The adoption of this guidance did not have a material impact on the Company's consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.



In June 2018, the FASB issued ASU No. 2018-07, "Compensation - Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Nonemployee Share-Based Payment Accounting." The standard expands the scope of ASC 718 to include all share-based payment arrangements related to the acquisition of goods and services from both nonemployees and employees. Under the amended guidance, equity-classified share-based payment awards issued to nonemployees will be measured at grant date fair value. Upon transition, the entity is required to remeasure these nonemployee awards at fair value as of the adoption date. The Company adopted this guidance in the first quarter of fiscal 2019. The adoption of this guidance did not have a material impact on the Company's consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.

NOTE 5. ASSETS HELD FOR SALE



Sale of NAND business



On April 1, 2019, the Company closed the transfer of its NAND business to a newly-formed joint venture between the Company and SK hynix system ic ("SKHS"). The joint venture entity will be called SkyHigh Memory Limited ("SkyHigh") and its headquarter will be in Hong Kong, China. SkyHigh will be 60-percent-owned by SKHS and 40-percent-owned by Cypress. The Company paid $2.4 million in cash as its capital contribution in SkyHigh upon close of the transaction. Additionally, Cypress will provide certain transition and back-end manufacturing services to SkyHigh. 



In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018, the Company allocated $65.7 million of goodwill previously recorded in the MPD segment to the NAND business being divested. The allocation was based on the relative estimated enterprise value of the NAND business and that of the MPD business. The intangible assets attributable to the NAND business acquired as part of a previous acquisition were $10.9 million. Based on an analysis carried out in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018, the Company recorded an impairment charge of $76.6 million which related to the goodwill and intangible assets allocated to the NAND business and classified as held-for-sale. During the first quarter of the fiscal 2019, the Company recognized an incremental loss of $3.5 million related to adjustments in the carrying value of certain assets and estimated costs of certain transition services.



As of March 31, 2019 and December 30, 2018 inventories related to the NAND business in the amount of $10.8 million and $13.5 million, respectively, were classified as held-for-sale assets as SkyHigh has agreed to purchase such inventories. SkyHigh will pay cash consideration for these inventories to the Company of a fixed amount and a contingent amount to be determined based on the profit on sales of such inventories generated by SkyHigh, if any. 



NOTE 6. EQUITY METHOD INVESTMENTS



Privately-held equity investments in entities the Company does not control are accounted for under the equity method of accounting if the Company has an ownership interest of 20% or greater or if it has the ability to exercise significant influence over the operations of such companies. 



Deca Technologies Inc. ("Deca")



Deca continues to be in the process of developing and testing a fan-out wafer level packaging technology. Deca’s estimated enterprise value is sensitive to its ability to achieve key product development and testing milestones. Additional delays or failure by Deca to complete these milestones - similar to those previously experienced by Deca in fiscal 2018 - may have a significant adverse impact on Deca’s estimated enterprise value. In addition, Deca’s current and future revenues are dependent on a small number of significant customers. The loss of, material delay in placing orders by, or significant decrease in demand from any of its key customers would have a material adverse effect on Deca’s business, results of operations and financial condition. Deca may need to secure additional funding to support its growth and cash needs. Failure to secure such funding, if needed, will impact its ability to continue as a going concern.



Deca management is currently working with its significant customers to secure their long-term commitment to use Deca’s technology given the current downturn in the semiconductor industry and is in the process of evaluating certain alternative strategic options.



During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018, the Company determined that its investment in Deca was other-than temporarily impaired and recognized a charge of $41.5 million in order to write down the carrying amount of the investment in Deca to the estimated fair value as of the end of fiscal 2018. Given the factors described above, there continues to be a substantial risk that the carrying value of our investment in Deca may become impaired in the future. If Deca is unable to (a) secure sufficient orders from its existing significant customers or other new customers, (b) raise sufficient funding, if needed, for continuing its operations, (c) consummate a strategic transaction that allows realization of its economic value, Cypress will be required to partially or fully impair the carrying value of its investment in Deca. The Company’s carrying value in Deca was $61.6 million and $65.1 million as of March 31, 2019 and December 30, 2018, respectively.



The Company held 52.5% of Deca's outstanding voting shares as of March 31, 2019 and December 30, 2018. The Company's investment in Deca is accounted for as an equity method investment. 



The below table presents the changes in carrying value of the equity method investment related to Deca.

The Company's 2% 2023 Exchangeable Notes are traded in the secondary market and the fair value is determined using Level 2 inputs. The principal and the estimated fair value of the principal of these notes as of March 31, 2019 were $150.0 million and $152.7 million, respectively. See Note 10 for further details.



NOTE 8. RESTRUCTURING



Since 2016, the Company has launched certain long-term strategic corporate transformation initiatives which required restructuring activities to streamline internal processes and redeploy personnel and resources to target markets as discussed below:



17



2018 Restructuring Plan 



In fiscal 2018, the Company began implementation of a reduction in workforce (the "2018 Plan") which resulted in the elimination of approximately 130 positions across various functions. The Company anticipates that the remaining restructuring accrual balance of $0.1 million will be paid out in cash through the second quarter of fiscal 2019. 



2017 Restructuring Plan



In December 2017, the Company began implementation of a reduction in workforce (the "2017 Plan") which resulted in the elimination of approximately 80 positions worldwide across various functions. The restructuring accrual has been fully settled in the first quarter of fiscal 2019.



Spansion Integration-Related Restructuring Plan ("Spansion Integration Plan")



In March 2015, the Company began implementation of cost reduction and restructuring activities in connection with its merger with Spansion. The restructuring charge of $90.1 million recorded for the fiscal year ended January 3, 2016 primarily consists of severance costs, lease termination costs and impairment of property, plant and equipment.



As part of this restructuring plan, the Company exited an office space leased by Spansion and recorded a reserve related to excess lease obligation for the building. During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018, the Company signed a termination agreement with the building’s owner. The lease termination cost was approximately $19.0 million. The Company paid $4.7 million during the fiscal 2018 and paid the remaining $14.3 million during the first quarter of fiscal 2019.

NOTE 12. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES



Product Warranties



25



The Company generally warrants its products against defects in materials and workmanship for a period of one year, and that product warranty is generally limited to a refund of the original purchase price of the product or a replacement part. The Company estimates its warranty costs based upon its historical warranty claim experience. Warranty returns are recorded as an allowance for sales returns. The allowance for sales returns is reviewed quarterly to verify that it reflects the remaining obligations based on the anticipated returns over the balance of the obligation period.



The following table presents the Company's warranty reserve activities:



[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]



Contractual Obligations



The Company has entered into agreements with certain vendors that include "take or pay" terms. Take or pay terms obligate the Company to purchase a minimum required amount of materials or services or make specified payments in lieu of such purchase. The Company may not be able to consume minimum commitments under these take or pay terms, requiring payments to vendors, which may have a material adverse impact on the Company’s earnings.



Litigation and Asserted Claims



The Company is currently involved in various legal proceedings, claims, and disputes arising in the ordinary course of business, including intellectual property claims and other matters. 



For many legal matters, particularly those in early stages, the Company cannot reasonably estimate the possible loss (or range of loss), if any. The Company records an accrual for legal matters at the time or times it determines that a loss is both probable and reasonably estimable. Amounts accrued as of March 31, 2019 were not material. Regarding matters for which no accrual has been made (including the potential for losses in excess of amounts accrued), the Company currently believes, based on its own investigations, that any losses (or ranges of losses) that are reasonably possible and estimable will not, in the aggregate, have a material adverse effect on its financial position, results of operations, or cash flows. However, the ultimate outcome of legal proceedings involves judgments, estimates, and inherent uncertainties and cannot be predicted with certainty. Should the ultimate outcome of any legal matter be unfavorable, the Company's business, financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows could be materially and adversely affected. The Company may also incur substantial legal fees, which are expensed as incurred, in defending against legal claims.



Indemnification Obligations



The Company is a party to a variety of agreements pursuant to which it may be obligated to indemnify other parties to such agreements with respect to certain matters. Typically, these obligations arise in the context of contracts that the Company has entered into, under which the Company customarily agrees to hold the other party harmless against losses arising from a breach of representations and covenants or terms and conditions related to such matters as the sale and/or delivery of its products, title to assets sold, certain intellectual property claims, defective products, specified environmental matters and certain income taxes. With respect to the sale of a manufacturing facility or subsidiary business, such indemnification may also cover tax matters and the Company's management of the facility or business prior to the sale. In the foregoing circumstances, payment by the Company is customarily conditioned on the other party making a claim pursuant to the procedures specified in the particular contract, which procedures typically allow the Company to challenge the other party’s claims and vigorously defend itself and the other party against related third-party claims. Further, the Company's obligations under these agreements may be limited in terms of time, amount or the scope of its responsibility and in some instances, the Company may have recourse against third parties for certain payments made under these agreements.



It is not possible to predict the maximum potential amount of future payments under these agreements due to the conditional nature of the Company's obligations and the unique facts and circumstances involved in each particular agreement. Historically, payments the Company has made under these agreements have not had a material effect on the Company’s business, financial 



26



condition or results of operations. As of March 31, 2019, management believes that if the Company were to incur a loss (in excess of amounts already recognized) in any of these matters, such loss would not have a material effect on its business, financial condition, cash flows or results of operations, though there can be no assurance in this regard. 



NOTE 13. FOREIGN CURRENCY AND INTEREST RATE DERIVATIVES



The Company enters into multiple foreign exchange forward contracts to hedge certain foreign currency risk resulting from fluctuations in Japanese yen (¥) and Euro (€) exchange rates. In addition, the Company entered into fixed-for-interest rate forward swap agreements and has designated these swaps as hedging instruments. The Company does not enter into derivative securities for speculative purposes. The Company’s hedging policy is designed to mitigate the impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations on its operating results. Some foreign currency forward contracts are considered to be economic hedges that were not designated as hedging instruments while others were designated as cash flow hedges. Whether designated or undesignated as cash flow hedges or not, these forward contracts protect the Company against the variability of forecasted foreign currency cash flows resulting from revenues, expenses and net asset or liability positions designated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. The maximum original duration of any contract allowable under the Company’s hedging policy is thirteen months for foreign currency hedging contracts.



Cash Flow Hedges



The Company enters into cash flow hedges to protect non-functional currency inventory purchases and certain other operational expenses, in addition to its ongoing program of cash flow hedges to protect its non-functional currency revenues against variability in cash flows due to foreign currency fluctuations. The Company’s foreign currency forward contracts that were designated as cash flow hedges generally have maturities between three and thirteen months. All hedging relationships are formally documented, and the hedges are designed to offset changes to future cash flows on hedged transactions at the inception of the hedge. The Company recognizes derivative instruments from hedging activities as either assets or liabilities on the balance sheet and measures them at fair value on a monthly basis. The Company records changes in the intrinsic value of its cash flow hedges in accumulated other comprehensive income on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets, until the forecasted transaction occurs. Prior to the second quarter of 2018, interest charges or "forward points" on the forward contracts are excluded from the assessment of hedge effectiveness and were recorded in interest and other income, net in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations. In the second quarter of 2018, the Company entered into cash flow hedges, in which interest charges or "forward points" on the forward contracts are included in the assessment of hedge effectiveness, and are recorded in the underlying hedged items in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations. When the forecasted transaction occurs, the Company reclassifies the related gain or loss on the cash flow hedge to revenue or costs, depending on the risk hedged. In the event the underlying forecasted transaction does not occur, or it becomes probable that it will not occur, the Company will reclassify the gain or loss on the related cash flow hedge from accumulated other comprehensive income to interest and other income, net in its Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations at that time. For the three months ended March 31, 2019 and April 1, 2018, the Company had a loss of $0.8 million and a gain of $0.9 million, which was related to cash flow hedges, recorded in other comprehensive income, respectively.



The Company evaluates hedge effectiveness at the inception of the hedge prospectively as well as retrospectively and records any ineffective portion of the hedge in other income, net in its Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations.



Designated Hedges



Total notional amounts of net outstanding contracts were as summarized below:

Non-designated hedges



Total notional amounts of net outstanding contracts were as summarized below:



[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]



In December 2017, the Company entered into fixed-for-floating interest rate forward swap agreements starting April 2018 with two counterparties to swap future variable interest payments on certain debt for fixed interest payments; these agreements will 



27



expire in July 2021. The objective of the swaps was to effectively fix the interest rate at current levels without having to refinance the outstanding term loan, thereby avoiding the incurrence of transaction costs. The interest rate on the variable debt was fixed in December 2017 and became effective in April 2018.



On January 3, 2018, the Company evaluated the hedge effectiveness of the interest rate swaps and designated these swaps as hedging instruments. Upon designation as cash flow hedge instruments, future changes in fair value of these swaps are recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). 



In October 2018, the Company entered into fixed-for-floating interest rate forward swap agreements starting in July 2021 with two counterparties to swap future variable interest payments on existing debt for fixed interest payments; these agreements will expire in December 2024. The objective of the swaps was to effectively fix the future interest rate at the level currently available to avoid the uncertainty in financing cost for a portion of debt due to future interest rate fluctuations. The aggregate notional amount of these interest rate swaps was $300 million. The Company has evaluated the hedge effectiveness of the interest rate swaps and has designated these swaps as cash flow hedges of the debt with future changes in fair value of these swaps to be recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss).



For the three months ended March 31, 2019, the Company has recognized a loss in other comprehensive income of $7.1 million for these interest rate swaps. 



The effect of derivative instruments on the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations for the three months ended March 31, 2019 was as follows:

The gross fair values of derivative instruments on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets as of March 31, 2019 and December 30, 2018 were as follows:

NOTE 14. NET INCOME PER SHARE



The following table sets forth the computation of basic and diluted net income per share:



[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]



For the three months ended March 31, 2019 and April 1, 2018, approximately 4.3 million and 2.5 million weighted average potentially dilutive shares underlying outstanding stock-based awards and convertible debt, respectively, were excluded in the computation of diluted net loss per share because their effect would have been anti-dilutive. 



NOTE 15. INCOME TAXES



The Company's income tax (benefit) / expense was $(0.7) million and $5.1 million for the three months ended March 31, 2019 and April 1, 2018, respectively. The provision for the fiscal quarter ended March 31, 2019 was primarily due to profits from continuing operations, offset by a net discrete benefit of $6.8 million during the period. Income tax expense for the three months ended April 1, 2018 was primarily attributable to non-U.S. taxes associated with the Company's non-U.S. operations.



A valuation allowance is established or maintained when, based on currently available information and other factors, it is more likely than not that all or a portion of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. We regularly assess our valuation allowance against deferred tax assets on a jurisdiction by jurisdiction basis. We consider all available positive and negative evidence, including future reversals of temporary differences, projected future taxable income, tax planning strategies and recent financial results. During the fourth quarter of 2018, the Company emerged from a cumulative loss position over the previous three years. The cumulative three-year pre-tax income is considered positive evidence which is objective and verifiable and thus received significant weighting. The continued pattern of income before tax, recent global restructuring executed in fiscal 2018 and projected future operating income in the U.S. was additional positive evidence. As a result, the Company released $343.3 



29



million of the valuation allowance attributable to certain U.S. deferred tax assets during 2018. Based on management’s assessment of the realizability of deferred tax assets, there was no change to the previously recorded valuation allowances during the quarter ending March 31, 2019.



Unrecognized Tax Benefits



Gross unrecognized tax benefits were $121.7 million and $121.9 million as of March 31, 2019 and December 30, 2018, respectively. As of March 31, 2019, and December 30, 2018, the amount of unrecognized tax benefits that, if recognized, would affect the Company's effective tax rate totaled $66.3 million and $65.8 million, respectively.



Management believes events that could occur in the next 12 months and cause a change in unrecognized tax benefits include, but are not limited to, the following:



•completion of examinations by the U.S. or foreign taxing authorities; and



•expiration of statutes of limitations on the Company's tax returns.



The calculation of unrecognized tax benefits involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex global tax regulations. Management regularly assesses the Company’s tax positions in light of legislative, bilateral tax treaty, regulatory and judicial developments in the countries in which the Company does business. Given the uncertainty in the development of ongoing tax examinations and tax correspondence with taxing authorities, it is possible that the Company’s balance of gross unrecognized tax benefits could materially change in the next 12 months. As a result, we are unable to estimate the full range of possible adjustments to this balance. 



Classification of Interest and Penalties



The Company's policy is to classify interest expense and penalties, if any, as components of the income tax provision in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations. As of March 31, 2019 and December 30, 2018, the amounts of accrued interest and penalties totaled $13.6 million and $13.0 million, respectively.

ITEM 1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS



The information required by this item is included in Note 11 of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements in Part I Item 1, of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and is incorporated herein by reference.



ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS



You should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties discussed in Part I, Item 1A (Risk Factors) of our Annual Report, any of which could materially affect our business, financial condition, and/or future results. Part I, Item 1A of our Annual Report is incorporated herein by reference. The risk factors in our Annual Report are not repeated in this Quarterly Report, unless the underlying risks have materially changed. The risks described in our Annual Report and this Quarterly Report are not the only risks we face. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and/or future results.



Our joint venture for NAND flash memory products might not be successful. 



On April 1, 2019, we launched a joint venture in Hong Kong with SK hynix system ic Inc. ("SKHS"), which is a wholly-owned subsidiary of SK hynix Inc. ("SKH"), a South Korean company. The joint venture entity, SkyHigh Memory Limited ("SkyHigh") is controlled by SKHS. We contributed our NAND flash memory business to the joint venture. NAND is a commoditized product line that has traditionally experienced volatile sales results with low gross margins. Upon launch, SkyHigh entered into a wafer supply agreement with SKH, and back-end manufacturing and transition services agreements with Cypress. 



Although we expect to have influence over SkyHigh's operations, they are not under our control and we might be unaware of, or unable to correct, any operating or product issues that may develop. Any failure by SkyHigh to satisfy customer expectations could adversely impact our own relationships with such customers and/or the reputation of our brand. Any failure by SkyHigh to meet its commitments to Cypress under our back-end manufacturing agreement could cause Cypress's assembly and testing facilities to be underutilized and could adversely affect Cypress's operating margins. In addition, there can be no assurance that the joint venture will be profitable. SkyHigh's governing documents do not require it to distribute its profits (if any) regularly, or at all (apart from a commitment to distribute to us our share of profit on a specified portion of sales through January 31, 2021). We therefore face a risk that our investment might not generate meaningful cash flows to re-invest, for example, in higher-margin areas of our business. The success of this joint venture investment will depend on various other factors over which we may have limited or no control and will require ongoing and effective cooperation with SKHS, which might be difficult to maintain. Such risks could be exacerbated by unfavorable financial market and macroeconomic conditions, causing the value of this joint venture investment to decline and leading to impairment charges. Any failure to realize the anticipated benefits of the joint venture could adversely affect our stock price.



Our financial results could be adversely impacted if privately-held companies in which we have invested fail to launch new products or maintain key customer relationships.



We have invested in certain privately-held companies. There can be no guarantee that such businesses will perform as initially expected, launch new products and solutions as initially expected, or gain or maintain market acceptance. During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017, we determined that our investment in Enovix Corporation, which is accounted for as an equity method investment, was other-than temporarily impaired as Enovix did not achieve key planned product development milestones. Consequently, we recognized an impairment charge of $51.2 million related to our investment in Enovix, reducing its carrying value on our books to zero. During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018, we determined that our investment in another equity investee, Deca Technologies Inc. ("Deca"), was other-than temporarily impaired due to significant delays in Deca's commercialization and achievement of scalable production of certain key products, and consequently we recognized an impairment charge of $41.5 million to write down the carrying value of our investment in Deca to its estimated fair value as of the end of fiscal 2018. 



If any of our other privately-held businesses fail to introduce new products and solutions or successfully develop new technologies, or if their customers do not successfully introduce new systems or products incorporating the products or solutions offered by these businesses, or if market demand for the products or solutions offered by these businesses is not created or sustained, or if these or any of our other privately-held businesses are not able to raise capital to fund their 



40



operations, then we might fail to realize any benefit from our investments in such privately-held companies and our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be materially harmed as a result of impairment of the carrying value of such investments.



In particular, there is a substantial risk that the carrying value of our investment in Deca may become further impaired. Deca’s current and future revenues are dependent on a small number of significant customers. The loss of, material delay in placing orders by, or significant decrease in demand from, any of Deca's key customers would have a material adverse effect on Deca’s business, results of operations, and financial condition. Deca may need to secure additional funding to support its growth and cash needs. Failure to secure such funding, if needed, will impact its ability to continue as a going concern. Deca's management is currently working with its significant customers to secure their long-term commitment to use Deca's technology given the current downturn in the semiconductor industry, and is in the process of evaluating certain alternative strategic options. If Deca is unable to (a) secure sufficient orders from its existing significant customers or new customers, (b) raise sufficient funding, if needed, for continuing its operations, or (c) consummate a strategic transaction that allows realization of its economic value, we will be required to record an impairment charge to partially or fully write down the carrying value of our investment in Deca. As of March 31, 2019, the carrying value of our investment in Deca was $61.6 million.
