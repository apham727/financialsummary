Trends and Key Factors Affecting our Financial Performance


â€¢General economic conditions are a key factor affecting our results as they impact our customers' willingness to spend on information technology.
This is particularly the case for our Corporate and Small Business customers, as their purchases tend to reflect confidence in their business prospects, which are driven by their discrete perceptions of business and general economic conditions.
