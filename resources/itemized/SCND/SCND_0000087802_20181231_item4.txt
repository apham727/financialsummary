Controls and Procedures 

  Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures.
As of the end of the period covered by this report, based on an evaluation of the Company's disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934), the Chief Executive and Chief Financial Officer of the Company has concluded that the Company's disclosure controls and procedures are effective to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the Company in its Exchange Act reports is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the applicable time periods specified by the SEC's rules and forms.
The Company also concluded that information required to be disclosed in such reports is accumulated and communicated to the Company's management, including its principal executive and principal financial officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.
Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting.
There was no change in the Company's internal controls over financial reporting that occurred during the most recently completed fiscal quarter that materially affected or is reasonably likely to materially affect the Company's internal controls over financial reporting.
