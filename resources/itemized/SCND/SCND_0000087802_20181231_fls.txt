Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 

  Forward-Looking statements.
Certain statements contained in this report are not based on historical facts, but are forward-looking statements that are based upon various assumptions about future conditions.
Actual events in the future could differ materially from those described in the forward-looking information.
Numerous unknown factors and future events could cause such differences, including but not limited to, product demand, market acceptance, success of marketing strategy, success of expansion efforts, impact of competition, adverse economic conditions, and other factors affecting the Company’s business that are beyond the Company’s control, which are discussed elsewhere in this report.
Consequently, no forward-looking statement can be guaranteed.
The Company undertakes no obligation to publicly update forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.
This Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations should be read in conjunction with the Company’s financial statements and the related notes included elsewhere in this report.
