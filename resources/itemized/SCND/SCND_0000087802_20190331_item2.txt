The Company has a Demand Line of Credit through December 2019 with First National Bank of Pennsylvania which provides for borrowings of up to $300,000 for regular working capital needs, bearing interest at prime, currently 5.50%.
Advances on the line, are secured by a pledge of the Company’s assets including inventory, accounts, chattel paper, equipment and general intangibles.

Management believes that the Company will be able to meet its cash flow needs during the 12 months ending March 31, 2020 from its available financial resources including the lines of credit, its cash and investment securities, and operations.
Item 4.
Controls and Procedures 

  Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures.
As of the end of the period covered by this report, the Company's management performed an evaluation of the effectiveness of the Company's disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934).
Based on this evaluation, the Chief Executive and Chief Financial Officer of the Company has concluded that the Company's disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of March 31, 2019, because of the identification of a material weakness in internal control over financial reporting which related to the accounting for the fair market value of a contingent consideration liability related to its Bioprocessing Systems Operations.
Notwithstanding the material weakness that existed as of March 31, 2019, the Chief Executive and Chief Financial Officer of the Company has concluded that the financial statements included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position, results of operations, and cash flows of the Company and its subsidiaries in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ("GAAP").
