  Forward-Looking statements.
Certain statements contained in this report are not based on historical facts, but are forward-looking statements that are based upon various assumptions about future conditions.
Actual events in the future could differ materially from those described in the forward-looking information.
Numerous unknown factors and future events could cause such differences, including but not limited to, product demand, market acceptance, success of marketing strategy, success of expansion efforts, impact of competition, adverse economic conditions, and other factors affecting the Company’s business that are beyond the Company’s control, which are discussed elsewhere in this report.
Consequently, no forward-looking statement can be guaranteed.
The Company undertakes no obligation to publicly update forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.
This Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations should be read in conjunction with the Company’s financial statements and the related notes included elsewhere in this report.
Overview.
The Company reflected income before tax expense of $177,500 for the three months ended September 30, 2018 compared to a loss before income tax benefit of $306,500 for the three months ended September 30, 2017, primarily the result of increased revenues across all business segments.
The results reflected total non-cash amounts for depreciation and amortization of $75,900 and $77,100 for the three months ended September 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively.
Results of Operations.
Net revenues for the three months ended September 30, 2018 increased $757,800 (59.2%) to $2,038,600 from $1,280,800 for the three months ended September 30, 2017, reflecting an increase of $492,500 (41.1%) in net sales of benchtop laboratory equipment.
The benchtop laboratory equipment sales reflected $425,300 of Torbal brand product sales for the three months ended September 30, 2018, compared to $304,200 in the three months ended September 30, 2017 as a result of continued growth in sales of the new force gauges product line.
Sales of catalyst research instruments increased by $188,800 to $217,500 for the three months ended September 30, 2018 compared to $28,700 for the three months ended September 30, 2017 because there were no large orders shipped during the prior year period.
As of September 30, 2018, the order backlog for catalyst research instruments was $329,400, all of which is expected to be shipped during the fiscal year ending June 30, 2019, compared to $323,900 as of September 30, 2017.
Revenues derived from the Bioprocessing Systems Operations which comprise primarily of net royalties accrued from sublicensees increased by $76,500 (145.2%) to $129,200 for the three months ended September 30, 2018 compared to $52,700 for the three months ended September 30, 2017.
The gross profit percentage for the three months ended September 30, 2018 was 46.4% compared to 35.3% for the three months ended September 30, 2017.
The current period gross margin reflected increased gross profit margin percentage for the Benchtop Laboratory Operations as a result of higher sales and lower overhead costs.
The gross profit margin percentage for catalyst research instruments was higher for the current period compared to the same period last year because the prior year period was negatively impacted by fixed overhead on significantly lower sales.
General and administrative expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2018 amounted to $416,500 compared to $428,400 for the three months ended September 30, 2017 due to various minor decreases in expenses for the Bioprocessing Systems Operations and the Catalyst Research Instruments Operations.
Selling expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2018 increased $35,100 (17.5%) to $236,100 from $201,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2017 primarily due to increased sales and marketing activities by the Benchtop Laboratory Equipment Operations.
Research and development expenses decreased by $11,700 (9.1%) to $117,400 for the three months ended September 30, 2018 compared to $129,100 for the three months ended September 30, 2017, primarily because of reduced new product development activities in the current year period for benchtop laboratory equipment.
Total other income was $1,800 for the three months ended September 30, 2018 compared to $300 for the three months ended September 30, 2017, due primarily to unrealized holding gains on equity securities.
The Company reflected income tax expense of $35,500 for the three months ended September 30, 2018 compared to a tax benefit of $73,900 for the three months ended September 30, 2017, primarily due to the income generated during the three months ended September 30, 2018.
As a result of the foregoing, the Company recorded net income of $142,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2018 compared to a net loss of $232,600 for the three months ended September 30, 2017.
Liquidity and Capital Resources.
Cash and cash equivalents increased by $454,200 to $1,507,300 as of September 30, 2018 from $1,053,100 as of June 30, 2018.
Net cash provided by operating activities was $460,700 for the three months ended September 30, 2018 compared to $103,600 used during the three months ended September 30, 2017, primarily as a result of the income for the current year period.
Net cash used in investing activities was $4,900 for the three months ended September 30, 2018 compared to $41,500 used during the three months ended September 30, 2017 principally due to new capital equipment purchased during the prior year period by the Benchtop Laboratory Equipment Operations.
The Company used $1,600 in financing activities in the three months ended September 30, 2018 compared to $144,300 in the three months ended September 30, 2017 due to the contingent consideration paid in the prior year period.
The Company's working capital increased by $159,600 to $4,277,800 as of September 30, 2018 compared to $4,118,200, as of June 30, 2018 due to the income generated during the period.
The Company has a Demand Line of Credit through December 2018 with First National Bank of Pennsylvania which provides for borrowings of up to $300,000 for regular working capital needs, bearing interest at prime, currently 5.25%.
Advances on the line, are secured by a pledge of the Company’s assets including inventory, accounts, chattel paper, equipment and general intangibles of the Company.
As of September 30, 2018 no borrowings were outstanding under such line.
Management believes that the Company will be able to meet its cash flow needs during the 12 months ending September 30, 2019 from its available financial resources including the lines of credit, its cash and investment securities, and operations.
Item 4.
Controls and Procedures 

  Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures.
As of the end of the period covered by this report, based on an evaluation of the Company's disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934), the Chief Executive and Chief Financial Officer of the Company has concluded that the Company's disclosure controls and procedures are effective to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the Company in its Exchange Act reports is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the applicable time periods specified by the SEC's rules and forms.
The Company also concluded that information required to be disclosed in such reports is accumulated and communicated to the Company's management, including its principal executive and principal financial officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.
As a result of our adoption of the new revenue standard (Topic 606), we implemented controls to ensure adequate evaluation of contracts and assessment of the impact of the new accounting standard related to revenue recognition on our financial statements to facilitate its adoption on July 1, 2018.
There were no significant changes to our internal control over financial reporting due to the adoption of the new standard, as such term is defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) during the period covered by this Quarterly Report or in other factors that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal controls over financial reporting.
