ITEM 2.
MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
The Company’s condensed consolidated financial statements, accompanying notes and the “Safe Harbor” Statement, each as appearing earlier in this report, should be referred to in conjunction with this Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.
Summary Comments
Fiscal 2019 first quarter net sales of $84,957,000 decreased $2.5 million or 2.9% as compared to first quarter fiscal 2018.
Net sales were favorably influenced by increased net sales of the Graphics Segment (up $4.5 million or 23.6%) more than offset by decreased net sales of the Lighting Segment (down $7.0 million or 10.2%).
Fiscal 2019 first quarter operating income of $2.9 million increased $27.7 million from an operating loss of $(24,814,000) in the first quarter of fiscal 2018.
The $27.7 million change from an operating loss in fiscal 2018 to operating income in fiscal 2019 was mostly the result of a pre-tax $28 million goodwill impairment charge in the Lighting Segment in fiscal 2018.
Adjusted fiscal 2019 operating income of $3.5 million (which reflects the removal of plant closure costs) increased 10.6% from adjusted fiscal 2018 operating income of $3.2 (which reflects the removal of the goodwill impairment).
Refer to “Non-GAAP Financial Measures” below.
The increase in adjusted operating income was the result of decreased net sales and decreased gross profit more than offset by a decrease in selling and administrative expenses.
Also contributing to the period-over-period results is a one-time adjustment to the Company’s paid-time-off policy in fiscal 2019 which resulted in a favorable pre-tax adjustment to earnings of $1.2 million.
On October 29, 2018, The Company announced that it will permanently close its New Windsor, New York manufacturing facility.
The facility manufactures indoor lighting products and is included in the results of the Lighting Segment.
Production will be transferred to the Company’s Erlanger, Kentucky and Blue Ash, Ohio facilities, also included in the Lighting Segment.
The New Windsor facility has a workforce of 140 employees.
The closure is part of ongoing actions to align the Company’s supply chain to more cost effectively serve the changing requirements of the lighting market.
The closure will also allow the Company to improve utilization of existing manufacturing capacity.
The transfer of production is expected to be completed by June 30, 2019.
Non-GAAP Financial Measures
The Company believes it is appropriate to evaluate its performance after making adjustments to the as-reported U.S. GAAP operating income, net income, and earnings per share.
Adjusted operating income, net income and earnings per share, which exclude the impact of goodwill impairment and restructuring and plant closure costs, are non-GAAP financial measures.
We believe that these adjusted supplemental measures are useful in assessing the operating performance of our business.
These supplemental measures are used by our management, including our chief operating decision maker, to evaluate business results.
We exclude these items because they are not representative of the ongoing results of operations of our business.
Below is a reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures to operating income, net income, and earnings per share for the periods indicated.
Results of Operations
THREE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2018 COMPARED TO THREE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2017
Lighting Segment net sales of $61,432,000 in the first quarter of fiscal 2019 decreased 10.2% from fiscal 2018 same period net sales of $68,428,000.
The Lighting Segment’s net sales of light fixtures having solid-state LED technology totaled $49.7 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2019 which represent 91% of total lighting product net sales.
There continues to be a reduction in the Company’s traditional lighting sales (metal halide and fluorescent light sources) as customers convert from traditional lighting to light fixtures having solid-state LED technology.
Gross profit of $15,475,000 in the first quarter of fiscal 2019 decreased $3.2 million or 17.1% from the same period of fiscal 2018, and decreased from 27.0% to 25.0% as a percentage of Lighting Segment net sales (customer plus inter-segment net sales).
The Company incurred restructuring and plant closure costs that were recorded in cost of sales related to the closure of its Hawthorne, California facility of $590,000 in fiscal 2019 with no comparable costs in fiscal 2018.
The remaining decrease in amount of gross profit is due to the effect of reduced sales volume, competitive pricing pressures, and inflationary pressures of certain commodities, partially offset by manufacturing efficiencies as a result of the Company’s lean initiatives.
Selling and administrative expenses of $11,625,000 in the first quarter of fiscal year 2019 decreased $30 million from the same period of fiscal 2018 selling and administrative expenses of $41,603,000, primarily due to the $28 million goodwill impairment charge in fiscal 2018.
When the goodwill impairment charge is removed from fiscal 2018 results, there was a $2.0 million or 14.4% reduction in selling and administrative expenses.
The reduction in selling and administrative expenses is mostly driven by lower commission expense which is due to lower sales volume and a reduction of wage and benefit expense.
The Lighting Segment first quarter fiscal 2019 operating income of $3,850,000 increased $26.8 million from an operating loss of $(22,930,000) in the same period of fiscal 2018 primarily due to a $28 million pre-tax goodwill impairment charge.
When the impact of the goodwill charge is removed from fiscal 2018 results and the restructuring and plant closure costs of $590,000 are removed from the fiscal 2019 results, fiscal 2019 adjusted operating income of $4,440,000 was $630,000 lower than fiscal 2018 adjusted operating income of $5,070,000.
The reduction in sales volume and gross profit was partially offset by lower selling and administrative expenses.
Graphics Segment net sales of $23,525,000 in the first quarter of fiscal 2019 increased $4.5 million or 23.6% from fiscal 2018 same period net sales of $19,038,000.
Most of the increase in sales is from growth in sales to the Petroleum and Quick Service Restaurant markets including digital technology.
Gross profit of $5,782,000 in the first quarter of fiscal 2019 increased $0.7 million or 14.2% from the same period of fiscal 2018.
Gross profit as a percentage of segment net sales (customer plus inter-segment net sales) decreased from 26.6% in the first quarter of fiscal 2018 to 24.5% in the first quarter of fiscal 2019.
The change in amount of gross profit is due to the net effect of increased net sales (customer plus inter-segment net sales) partially offset by a change in product mix.
Also contributing to the year-over-year change in gross profit was a $0.6 million increase in overhead spending mostly driven by an increase in wage expense.
Selling and administrative expenses of $3,395,000 in the first quarter of fiscal 2019 decreased $0.2 million or 5.4% from the same period of fiscal 2018 primarily as a result of decreased wage and benefit expense.
The Graphics Segment first quarter fiscal 2019 operating income of $2,387,000 increased $0.9 million or 61.7% from operating income of $1,476,000 in the same period of fiscal 2018.
The net increase of $0.9 million was primarily the net result of increased net sales, increased gross profit, decreased gross profit margin as a percentage of sales, and decreased selling and administrative expenses.
The gross profit or loss relates to the elimination of intercompany profit in inventory.
Administrative expenses of $3,307,000 in the first quarter of fiscal 2019 decreased slightly from the same period of the prior year.
The change is primarily the result of a decrease in employee compensation and benefit expense ($0.6 million) offset by an equal an increase in outside service expense ($0.4 million), and a net increase in various other expense categories ($0.2 million).
Consolidated Results
The Company reported $518,000 net interest expense in the first quarter of fiscal 2019 compared to $403,000 net interest expense in the first quarter of fiscal 2019.
The change from interest expense from fiscal 2018 to fiscal 2019 is the result of higher interest rates on the Company’s line of credit and higher commitment fees on its unused portion of the line of credit.
The $667,000 income tax expense in the first quarter of fiscal 2019 represents a consolidated effective tax rate of 27.6% influenced by certain permanent book-tax differences and by an expense related to uncertain income tax positions.
The $9,588,000 income tax benefit in the first quarter of fiscal 2018 represents a consolidated effective tax rate of 38% influenced by the goodwill impairment.
The Company reported a net income of $1,749,000 in the first quarter of fiscal 2019 compared to a net loss of $(15,629,000) in the same period of the prior year.
The change between a net loss in fiscal 2018 to net income in fiscal 2019 is mostly driven by the $28 million pre-tax goodwill impairment charge in fiscal 2018 with no comparable event in fiscal 2019.
When the impact of the fiscal 2018 goodwill impairment charge and the fiscal 2019 restructuring and plant costs are removed from the reported results, the fiscal 2019 adjusted net income of $2,203,000 increased $0.5 million or 27% from fiscal 2018 adjusted net income of $1,734,000.
The change in adjusted net income is primarily the net result of decreased net sales, decreased gross profit, decreased selling and administrative expenses, increased interest expense, and a lower tax rate.
Diluted earnings per share of $0.07 was reported in the first quarter of fiscal 2019 as compared to $(0.61) diluted loss per share in the same period of fiscal 2018.
The weighted average common shares outstanding for purposes of computing diluted earnings per share in the first quarter of fiscal 2019 were 26,365,000 shares as compared to 25,791,000 shares in the same period last year.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
The Company considers its level of cash on hand, borrowing capacity, current ratio and working capital levels to be its most important measures of short-term liquidity.
For long-term liquidity indicators, the Company believes its ratio of long-term debt to equity and its historical levels of net cash flows from operating activities to be the most important measures.
At September 30, 2018, the Company had working capital of $72.6 million, compared to $67.9 million at June 30, 2018.
The ratio of current assets to current liabilities was 2.59 to 1 as compared to a ratio of 2.61 to 1 at June 30, 2018.
The $4.7 million increase in working capital from June 30, 2018 to September 30, 2018 was primarily related to the net effect of increased cash and cash equivalents ($1.0 million), increased net accounts receivable ($9.2 million), decreased net inventory ($1.4 million), an increase in accrued expenses ($2.3 million), a decrease in refundable income taxes ($0.6 million), and an increase in accounts payable ($5.8 million).
The $4.1 million of the increase in accounts receivable is the result of the adoption of the new revenue guidance.
The Company has a strategy of aggressively managing working capital, including reduction of the accounts receivable days sales outstanding (DSO) and reduction of inventory levels, without reducing service to its customers.
The Company generated $2.2 million of cash from operating activities in the first quarter of fiscal 2019 as compared to a use of cash of $2.7 million in the same period of the prior year.
This $4.9 million increase in net cash flows from operating activities is primarily the net result of an increase rather than a decrease in accounts payable (favorable change of $7.3 million), a smaller increase in net accounts receivable (favorable change of $1.2 million), an increase rather than a decrease in net inventory (unfavorable change of $4.2 million), a smaller decrease in refundable income taxes (favorable change of $0.2 million), an increase in customer prepayments (favorable change of $0.4 million), and an increase in net income in fiscal 2019 from a net loss in fiscal 2018 offset by several non-cash add-backs (favorable change of $0.4 million).
Net accounts receivable were $59.8 million and $50.6 million at September 30, 2018 and June 30, 2018, respectively.
DSO increased to 59 days at September 30, 2018 from 53 days at June 30, 2018.
The Company believes that its receivables are ultimately collectible or recoverable, net of certain reserves, and that aggregate allowances for doubtful accounts are adequate.
Net inventories of $49.6 million at September 30, 2018 decreased $1.4 million from $51.0 million at June 30, 2018.
The decrease of $1.4 million is the result of a decrease in gross inventory of $0.9 million and an increase in obsolescence reserves of $0.5 million.
Based on a strategy of balancing inventory reductions with customer service and the timing of shipments, net inventory increased 1.8 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2019 in the Graphics Segment which was more than offset by a decrease in net inventory in the Lighting Segment of $3.2 million.
Cash generated from operations and borrowing capacity under the Company’s line of credit is the Company’s primary source of liquidity.
The Company has a secured $100 million revolving line of credit with its bank, with $46.1 million of the credit line available as of October 29, 2018.
This line of credit is a $100 million five year credit line expiring in the third quarter of fiscal 2022.
The Company believes that its $100 million line of credit plus cash flows from operating activities are adequate for the Company’s fiscal 2019 operational and capital expenditure needs.
The Company is in compliance with all of its loan covenants.
The Company used cash of $0.7 million related to investing activities in the first quarter of fiscal 2019 as compared to a source of $1.0 million in the same period of the prior year, resulting in an unfavorable change of $1.7 million.
Capital expenditures for the first quarter of fiscal 2019 increased $0.2 million to $0.6 million from the same period in fiscal 2018.
The Company sold its Woonsocket manufacturing facility for $1.5 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2018 which contributed to the change in cash flow from investing activities from fiscal 2018 to fiscal 2019.
The Company used $0.6 million of cash related to financing activities in the first quarter of fiscal 2019 compared to a source of cash of $0.8 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2018.
The $1.3 million unfavorable change in cash flow was the net result of borrowings in excess of payments of long term debt of $1.4 million.
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
The Company has no financial instruments with off-balance sheet risk and has no off-balance sheet arrangements, except for various operating leases.
However, none of these operating leases, individually or in the aggregate have or are reasonably likely to have a current effect on the Company’s financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures, or capital resources that is material.
Cash Dividends
In November 2018, the Board of Directors declared a regular quarterly cash dividend of $0.05 per share payable November 27, 2018 to shareholders of record as of November 16, 2018.
The indicated annual cash dividend rate for fiscal 2019 is $0.20 per share.
The Board of Directors has adopted a policy regarding dividends which indicates that dividends will be determined by the Board of Directors in its discretion based upon its evaluation of earnings, cash flow requirements, financial condition, debt levels, stock repurchases, future business developments and opportunities, and other factors deemed relevant.
Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates
A summary of the Company’s significant accounting policies is included in Note 1 to the audited consolidated financial statements of the Company’s fiscal 2018 Annual Report on Form 10-K.
New Accounting Pronouncements
In February 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued ASU 2016-02, “Leases.” The amended guidance requires an entity to recognize assets and liabilities that arise from leases.
The amended guidance is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal and interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2018, or the Company’s fiscal 2020, with early adoption permitted.
The Company has not yet determined the impact the amended guidance will have on its financial statements.
