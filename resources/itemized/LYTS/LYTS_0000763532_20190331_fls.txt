This Form 10-Q contains certain forward-looking statements that are subject to numerous assumptions, risks or uncertainties.
The Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 provides a safe harbor for forward-looking statements.
Forward-looking statements may be identified by words such as “estimates,” “anticipates,” “targets,” “hopes,” “projects,” “plans,” “expects,” “intends,” “believes,” “seeks,” “may,” “will,” “see,” “should” and similar expressions and the negative versions of those words, and by the context in which they are used.
Such statements, whether expressed or implied, are based upon current expectations of the Company and speak only as of the date made.
Reliance should not be placed on forward-looking statements because they involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors which may cause actual results, performance or achievements to differ materially from those expressed or implied.
Forward-looking statements include statements that address activities, events or developments that LSI expects, believes or anticipates will or may occur in the future, such as earnings estimates (including projections and guidance), other predictions of financial performance.
Forward-looking statements are based on LSI’s experience and perception of current conditions, trends, expected future developments and other factors it believes are appropriate under the circumstances and are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties, many of which are beyond LSI’s control.
These risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to the following: the impact of competitive products and services; product and pricing demands, and market acceptance risks; potential costs associated with litigation and regulatory compliance; LSI’s ability to develop, produce and market quality products that meet customers’ needs; additional restructuring costs or a failure to realize anticipated savings or benefits from past or future cost reduction actions; failure to realize all of the anticipated benefits from initiatives to increase our productivity, efficiency and cash flow and to reduce costs; inventory management decisions and sourcing practices; compliance with financial and other restrictive covenants in debt agreements; information technology security threats and computer crime; reliance on key customers; financial difficulties experienced by customers; the cyclical and seasonal nature of our business; the adequacy of reserves and allowances for doubtful accounts; fluctuations in operating results or costs whether as a result of uncertainties inherent in tax and accounting matters or otherwise; failure of an acquisition or acquired company to achieve its plans or objectives generally; unexpected difficulties in integrating acquired businesses; the ability to retain key employees, including key employees of acquired businesses; unfavorable economic and market conditions; the results of asset impairment assessments; the ability to maintain an effective system of internal control over financial reporting; the ability to remediate any material weakness in internal control over financial reporting; and the other risk factors LSI describes from time to time in SEC filings, such as reliance on third party manufacturers and suppliers, litigation or other proceedings, government regulation, and stock price volatility.
You are cautioned to not place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements.
LSI does not guarantee any forward-looking statement, and actual results may differ materially from those projected.
In addition to the factors described in this paragraph, the risk factors identified in our Form 10-K and other filings LSI may make with the SEC constitute risks and uncertainties that may affect the financial performance of the Company and are incorporated herein by reference.
LSI does not undertake and hereby disclaims any duty to update any forward-looking statements to reflect subsequent events or circumstances.
