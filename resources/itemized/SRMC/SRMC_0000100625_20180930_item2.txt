Results of Operations
For the three-month period ended September 30, 2018, Sierra Monitor Corporation (“we” or the “Company”) reported net sales of $5,994,234 compared to $5,177,199 for the three-month period ended September 30, 2017.
For the nine-month period ended September 30, 2018, net sales were $16,695,848 compared with $14,539,809 in the prior year nine-month period.
The sales results for the three and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2018 represent an increase of 16% and 15% compared to each of the same periods in 2017.
For the three-month period ended September 30, 2018, sales of our instrumentation products, including fire and gas detection, military sales and environment controllers, were approximately $2,813,000 compared to approximately $2,536,000 in the three-month period ended September 30, 2017, representing an 11% increase.
For the nine-month period ended September 30, 2018, sales of our instrumentation products were approximately $8,116,000 compared to approximately $6,906,000 in the same period in 2017 representing an 18% increase.
In the three-month period ended September 30, 2018, sales of FieldServer products were approximately $3,181,000 compared to approximately $2,641,000 in the same period in 2017, representing a 20% increase.
In the nine-month period ended September 30, 2018, sales of our FieldServer products were approximately $8,580,000, compared to approximately $7,634,000 in sales reported in the same period in 2017, representing a 12% increase.
Page 12 of 22
FieldServer sales include both box products and original equipment manufacturer (“OEM”) modules.
Box products provide a platform for delivery and operation of our software for integration with building automation systems and are generally sold to building automation integrators.
Strong increases in OEM sales offset lower sales of box products.
Gross profit for the three-month period ended September 30, 2018 was approximately $3,630,000, or 61% of net sales, compared to approximately $3,105,000, or 60% of net sales, in the same period in the previous year.
Gross profit for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2018 was approximately $10,006,000, or 60% of net sales, compared to approximately $8,626,000, or 59% of net sales, in the same period in the previous year.
Our gross margins are influenced primarily by product mix and discount level based on order size and sales channels.
Generally sales to OEM accounts generate lower margins.
Expenses for research and development, which include new product development and engineering to sustain existing products, were approximately $805,000, or 13% of net sales, for the three-month period ended September 30, 2018 compared to approximately $768,000, or 15% of net sales, in the comparable period in 2017.
In the nine-month periods ended September 30, 2018 and September 30, 2017, research and development expenses were approximately $2,371,000, or 14% of net sales, and approximately $2,296,000, or 16% of net sales, respectively.
Research and development expenses remain relatively constant as we continue to invest in new products for both our gas detection and our protocol gateway business.
Selling and marketing expenses, which consist primarily of salaries, commissions and promotional expenses were approximately $1,490,000, or 25% of net sales for the three-month period ended September 30, 2018, compared to approximately $1,225,000, or 24% of net sales, in the comparable period in the prior year.
For the nine-month periods ended September 30, 2018 and 2017, selling and marketing expenses were approximately $4,220,000, or 25% of net sales, and approximately 3,841,000, or 26% of net sales, respectively.
The increase in our selling expenses in the three and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2018 compared to the same period in the prior year are primarily attributed to the addition of resources.
General and administrative expenses, which consist primarily of salaries, building rent, insurance expenses, information technology expenses and fees for professional services, were approximately $1,014,000, or 17% of net sales, for the three-month period ended September 30, 2018 compared to approximately $743,000, or 14% of net sales, in the three-month period ended September 30, 2017.
For the nine-month periods ended September 30, 2018 and September 2017, general and administrative expenses were approximately $2,917,000, or 17% of net sales, and approximately $2,356,000, or 16% of net sales, respectively.
General and administrative expenses have increased 36% in the three-month period and increased 24% in the nine-month reporting periods ended September 30, 2018 compared to the same periods in 2017, primarily due to increased salary expenses and outsourced professionals.
In the three-month period ended September 30, 2018, our income from operations was approximately $321,000 compared to income from operations of approximately $369,000 for the three-month period ended September 30, 2017.
In the nine-month period ended September 30, 2018, our income from operations was approximately $498,000 compared to a loss from operations of approximately $447,000 in the nine-month period ended September 30, 2017.
The loss in the nine-month period of 2017 was due to non-recurring expenses.
After interest income and provision for income tax expense, our net income for the three-month period ended September 30, 2018 was approximately $214,000 compared to net income of approximately $192,000 in the same period of 2017.
For the nine-month period ended September 30, 2018, our net income was approximately $311,000 compared to a net loss of approximately $367,000 in the same period of 2017.

Liquidity and Capital Resources
During the nine months ended September 30, 2018, net cash provided by operating activities was approximately $1,020,000 compared to approximately $210,000 for the same period in 2017.
Working capital was approximately $8,558,000 at September 30, 2018, an increase of approximately $100,000 from December 31, 2017.
At September 30, 2018, our balance sheet reflected approximately $3,617,000 of cash and approximately $2,929,000 of net trade receivables.
At December 31, 2017, our total cash on hand was approximately $3,192,000 and our net trade receivables were approximately $3,255,000
At September 30, 2018 and 2017, we had no long-term liabilities.
We maintain a line of credit with our commercial bank in the maximum amount of $2,000,000.
No borrowings have been made under our line of credit during the first nine months of fiscal year 2018 and there were no outstanding balances at September 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017.
As of September 30, 2018, we were in compliance with the financial covenants of the line of credit.
We believe that our present resources, including cash and accounts receivable, are sufficient to fund our anticipated level of operations through at least December 2019.
There are no current plans for significant capital equipment expenditures and no other known demands, commitments, events or uncertainties that will result in or that are reasonably likely to result in our liquidity increasing or decreasing in any material way.
Critical Accounting Policies
a) Revenue Recognition
In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued ASU 2014-09, “Revenue from Contracts with Customers” (Topic 606).
ASC 606 requires the recognition of revenue when promised goods or services are transferred to customers in an amount that reflects the considerations to which the entity expects to be entitled to in exchange for those goods or services.
On January 1, 2018, the Company adopted ASC 606 by using the modified retrospective method.
The comparative information has not been recast and continues to be reported under the accounting standards in effect for those periods.
The adoption did not have a material impact to the nature and timing of its revenues, condensed statements of operations, condensed statements cash flows and condensed balance sheets.
The majority of the impact has been on sales returns and the impact has been deemed immaterial.
The Company’s revenues are derived from the sale of FieldServer products, FieldServer products services, Gas Detection and Environment Control products, and Gas Detection and Environment Control products services.
The Company accounts for a contract with a customer when there’s approval and commitment from both parties, the rights of the parties are identified, payment terms are identified, the contract has commercial substance and collectability of consideration is probable.
Page 14 of 22
The Company’s revenue arrangements consist of multiple performance obligations including hardware, software, and services.
Determining the stand-alone selling price (“SSP”) and allocation of consideration from an arrangement to the individual performance obligations, and the appropriate timing of revenue recognition are significant judgments with respect to these arrangements.
The Company does not provide credits, incentives or retroactive discounts, which may be required to be accounted for as variable consideration when estimating the amount of revenue to be recognized.
The Company from time to time provides a right of return to its customers and the Company uses expected value method to estimate the potential value of the customer returns to reduce the transaction price.
The impact has been deemed to be immaterial, thus there is no disclosure related to sales returns, return on assets and refund liability.
Gas Detection and Environment Control Products
Gas Detection and Environment Control Products are sold as off-the-shelf products with prices fixed at the time of order.
Orders delivered to the Company by phone, fax, mail or email are considered valid purchase orders and once accepted by the Company are deemed to be the final understanding between us and our customer as to the specific nature and terms of the agreed-upon sale transaction.
The creditworthiness of customers is assessed prior to the Company accepting a customer’s first order.
Additionally, international customers and customers who have developed a history of payment problems are generally required to prepay or pay through a letter-of-credit.
Revenue is recognized at a point in time when control of the product is transferred to the customer, generally occurring upon the shipment or delivery dependent upon the terms of the underlying contract when (a) for FOB factory orders they leave our shipping dock or (b) for FOB customer dock orders upon confirmation of delivery.
Gas Detection and Environment Control Services
Gas detection and environment control services consist of field service orders (technical support) and training, which are provided separate from product orders.
Orders are accepted in the same forms as discussed for Gas Detection and Environment Control Products above with hourly prices fixed at the time of order.
Revenue recognition occurs only when the service activity is completed.
Such services are provided to current and prior customers, and, as noted above, creditworthiness has generally already been assessed.
In cases where the probability of receiving payment is low, a credit card number is collected in advance of the provision of services for immediate processing.
Revenue is recognized in the period the technical support and training are performed.

FieldServer Products
FieldServer Services
FieldServer services consist of orders for custom development of protocol drivers.
Generally customers place orders for FieldServer products concurrently with their order for protocol drivers.
However, if custom development of the protocol driver is required, the product order is not processed until development of the protocol driver is complete.
The driver development involves further research after receipt of order, preparation of a scope document to be approved by the customer and then engineering time to write, test and release the driver program.
When development of the driver is complete the customer is notified and can proceed with a FieldServer product.
Revenues for protocol driver development are recognized at a point in time when the control of the product is transferred to the customer generally occurring upon shipment or delivery of the related product that includes the developed protocol drivers (as noted in FieldServer Products above).
Discounts and Allowances
Discounts are applied at time of order entry and sales are processed at net pricing.
No allowances are offered to customers.
b) Contract Costs
Applying the practical expedient, the Company recognizes the incremental costs of obtaining contracts as an expense when incurred if the amortization period of the assets that otherwise would have been recognized is one year or less.
These costs mainly include the Company’s internal sales force compensation program and are included in sales and marketing expenses at the time the revenue is recognized.
c) Warranty
The Company provides a warranty on all products sold for a period of two years after the date of shipment.
Warranty issues are usually resolved with repair or replacement of the product.
This standard warranty is assurance type warranty and does not offer any services in addition to the assurance that the product will continue working as specified.
Therefore, warranties are not considered separate performance obligations in the arrangement.
Instead, estimated future warranty obligations related to products are provided by charges to condensed statements of operations in the period in which the related revenue is recognized.
Page 16 of 22
d) Contract Balances
The Company records accounts receivable when it has an unconditional right to consideration.
Contract liabilities are recorded when cash payments are received or due in advance of performance.
Contract liabilities consist of only advance payments, where the Company has unsatisfied performance obligations.
Contract liabilities are classified as deferred revenue and included within “Other current liabilities” on the condensed balance sheets.
At times, billing may occur subsequent to revenue recognition, resulting in an unbilled receivable which represents a contract asset.
The Company does not have any unbilled receivable on the condensed balance sheets.
Payment terms vary by customer.
The time between invoicing and when payment is due is not significant.
For certain products or services and customer types, payment is required before the products or services are delivered to the customer.
There were no significant changes in estimates during the period that would affect the contract balances.
The amounts of revenue recognized during the nine months ended September 30, 2018 and September 30, 2017 from the opening deferred revenue balances were $32,059 and $8,167, respectively.
For the three and nine month periods ended September 30, 2018, and September 30, 2017 no impairment losses related to contract balances were recognized in the condensed statement of operations.
e) Disaggregation of Revenue
f) Shipping and Handling
The Company has elected to account for shipping and handling activities related to contracts with customers as costs to fulfill the promise to transfer the associated products.
g) Remaining Performance Obligations
Remaining performance obligations represent the transaction price allocated to performances obligations that are unsatisfied or partially unsatisfied as of the end of the reporting period.
Unsatisfied and partially unsatisfied performance obligations consist of contract liabilities and non-cancellable backlog.
Non-cancellable backlog includes goods and services for which customer purchase orders have been accepted that are scheduled or in the process of being scheduled for shipment.
As of September 30, 2018, the remaining performance obligation is approximately $4,693,000, 51% or $2,409,000 of which is expected to be recognized in 3 months and 21% or $998,000 of which is expected to be recognized in the next fiscal year.
The remainder is expected to be recognized after fiscal year 2019.

h) Accounts Receivable and Related Allowances
Our domestic sales are generally made on an open account basis unless specific experience or knowledge of the customer’s potential inability or unwillingness to meet the payment terms dictate secured payments.
Our international sales are generally made based on secure payment terms including cash wire advance payments and letters of credit.
International sales are made on open account terms where sufficient historical experience justifies the assumption of customer credit risk.
In many of our larger sales, our customers are frequently construction contractors who are in need of our field services to complete their work and obtain payment.
Management’s ability to manage the credit terms and utilize the leverage provided by the clients’ need for our services is critical to the effective application of credit terms and minimization of accounts receivable losses.
We maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts which is analyzed on a periodic basis to determine adequacy.
We believe that we have demonstrated the ability to make reasonable and reliable estimates of allowances for doubtful accounts based on significant historical experience.
i) Inventories
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or estimated market, with cost being determined on the first-in, first-out method.
We use an Enterprise Requirements Planning (“ERP”) software system which provides data upon which management relies to determine inventory trends and identify excesses.
The carrying value of inventory is reduced to market for slow moving and obsolete items based on historical experience and current product demand.
We evaluate the carrying value of inventory quarterly.
The adequacy of carrying amounts is dependent upon management’s ability to forecast demands accurately, manage product changes efficiently, and interpret the data provided by the ERP system.
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
None.
Contractual Obligations
Not applicable.
ITEM 2.
UNREGISTERED SALES OF EQUITY SECURITIES AND USE OF PROCEEDS
