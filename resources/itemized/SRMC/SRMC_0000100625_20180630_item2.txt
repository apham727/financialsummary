Results of Operations
For the three-month period ended June 30, 2018, Sierra Monitor Corporation (“we” or the “Company”) reported net sales of $5,550,598 compared to $4,835,420 for the three-month period ended June 30, 2017.
For the six-month period ended June 30, 2018, net sales were $10,701,614 compared with $9,362,610 for the six-month period ended June 30, 2017.
Sales of gas detection products, including industrial accounts, military sales and environment controllers for telephone company applications, increased by approximately 23% in the second quarter of 2018 compared to the same period in 2017.
As of the second quarter of 2018, sales of gas detection products were 21% higher compared to the same period in 2017.
Increased shipments in our military segment were a significant contributor to our increases in the second quarter of 2018 and year-to-date revenue for 2018.

Sales of our FieldServer product line increased by 8% in the second quarter of 2018 compared to the second quarter of 2017.
As of the second quarter of 2018, sales of FieldServer products increased by 8% compared to the same period in 2017.
FieldServer units include box products and original equipment manufacturer (“OEM”) modules.
Box products provide a platform for delivery and operation of our software for building automation projects and are generally sold to integrators.
OEM modules are sold to companies that integrate our products into their commercial offerings.
Our OEM module sales increased by 11% as of the second quarter of 2018 compared to the same period in 2017.
Gross profit for the three-month period ended June 30, 2018 was approximately $3,210,000, or 58% of net sales, compared to approximately $2,787,000, or 58% of net sales, in the same period in 2017.
Gross profit for the six-month period ended June 30, 2018 was approximately $6,376,000, or 60% of net sales, compared to approximately $5,521,000, or 59% of net sales, in the same period in 2017.
The margins in each of the first half and second quarter of 2018 are generally consistent with our historical results.
Expenses for research and development, which include new product development and engineering to sustain existing products, were approximately $791,000, or 14% of net sales, for the three-month period ended June 30, 2018 compared to approximately $768,000, or 16% of net sales, in the comparable period in 2017.
In the six-month periods ended June 30, 2018 and June 30, 2017, research and development expenses were approximately $1,566,000, or 15% of net sales, and approximately $1,529,000, or 16% of net sales, respectively.
Our slightly increased research and development spending is consistent with our strategy of developing products that we anticipate will have a positive impact on revenues in future periods.
Selling and marketing expenses, which consist primarily of salaries, commissions and promotional expenses were approximately $1,343,000, or 24% of net sales, for the three-month period ended June 30, 2018, compared to approximately $1,260,000, or 26% of net sales, in the comparable period in the prior year.
For the six-month periods ended June 30, 2018 and June 30, 2017, selling and marketing expenses were approximately $2,730,000, or 26% of net sales, and approximately $2,616,000, or 28% of net sales, respectively.
Selling expenses have increased in the three and six-month periods ending June 30, 2018 primarily because we added a Regional Sales Manager for Asia and Canada as well as a Regional Sales Manager for Latin America.
General and administrative expenses, which consist primarily of salaries, building rent, insurance expenses, information technology expenses and fees for professional services, were approximately $989,000, or 18% of net sales, for the three-month period ended June 30, 2018 compared to approximately $825,000, or 17% of net sales, in the three-month period ended June 30, 2017.
For the six-month periods ended June 30, 2018 and June 30, 2017, general and administrative expenses were approximately $1,904,000, or 18% of net sales, and approximately $1,613,000, or 17% of net sales, respectively.
Our general and administrative expenses have acclimated to a higher run-rate in 2018 primarily due to technology upgrades to key customer and delivery focused systems.
There were no non-recurring costs for the three-month and six-month period of 2018.
In the second quarter of 2017, costs of approximately $580,000 related to compensation expense were incurred as a result of the departure of Varun Nagaraj as CEO and President and Anders Axelsson as Vice President of Sales and Marketing.
In the three-month period ended June 30, 2018, our income from operations was approximately $86,000, representing an increase of approximately $733,000 compared to our loss from operations of approximately $647,000 in the three-month period ended June 30, 2017.
In the six-month period ended June 30, 2018, our income from operations was approximately $177,000 representing an increase of approximately $993,000 compared to our loss from operations of $816,000 in the six-month period ended June 30, 2017.
The increase in income in both the second quarter and first half of 2018 compared to the same periods in 2017 is due primarily to the non-recurring expense for separation packages for our two former senior executives.

After interest and tax provisions, our net income for the three-month period ended June 30, 2018 was approximately $46,000 compared to a net loss of approximately $425,000 in the same period of 2017.
For the six-month period ended June 30, 2018, our net income was approximately $97,000 compared to a net loss of approximately $559,000 in the same period of 2017.
In July 2018, the Board of Directors also increased the size of the Board of Directors from five to six members and appointed Ross DeMont as a member of the Board of Directors.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
During the six months ended June 30, 2018, net cash used by operating activities was approximately $113,000 compared to net cash provided by operating activities of approximately $184,000 for the same period in 2017.
As summarized below, the cash provided during the six months ended June 30, 2017 was due primarily to cash received by a potential strategic partner offset by changes in income.
Working capital was approximately $8,414,000 at June 30, 2018, a decrease of approximately $43,000 from December 31, 2017.
At June 30, 2018, our balance sheet reflected approximately $2,731,000 of cash and approximately $2,957,000 of net trade receivables.
At December 31, 2017, our total cash on hand was approximately $3,192,000 and our net trade receivables were approximately $3,255,000.
In connection with the Company’s discussions regarding potential alternative strategic transactions, on April 10, 2017, the Company received $1,000,000 in cash from a potential strategic partner.
Of the total cash received, $500,000 was an expense reimbursement for some of the out-of-pocket costs the Company had incurred in connection with its consideration of strategic alternatives.
The other $500,000 was a fully refundable amount which the Company returned to the payer in August 2017.
At June 30, 2018 and 2017, we had no long-term liabilities.
We maintain a line of credit with our commercial bank in the maximum amount of $2,000,000.
No borrowings have been made under our line of credit during the first six months of fiscal year 2018 and there were no outstanding balances at June 30, 2018 or December 31, 2017.
As of June 30, 2018, we were in compliance with the financial covenants of the line of credit.
We believe that our present resources, including cash and accounts receivable, are sufficient to fund our anticipated level of operations through at least September 2019.
There are no current plans for significant capital equipment expenditures and no other known demands, commitments, events or uncertainties that will result in or that are reasonably likely to result in our liquidity increasing or decreasing in any material way.
Critical Accounting Policies
  Page 12 of 20
a) Revenue Recognition
In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued ASU 2014-09, “Revenue from Contracts with Customers” (Topic 606).
ASC 606 requires the recognition of revenue when promised goods or services are transferred to customers in an amount that reflects the considerations to which the entity expects to be entitled to in exchange for those goods or services.
On January 1, 2018, the Company adopted ASC 606 by using the modified retrospective method.
The comparative information has not been recast and continues to be reported under the accounting standards in effect for those periods.
The adoption did not have a material impact to the nature and timing of its revenues, condensed statements of operations, condensed statements cash flows and condensed balance sheets.
The majority of the impact has been on sales returns and the impact has been deemed immaterial.
The Company’s revenues are derived from the sale of FieldServer products, FieldServer products services, Gas Detection and Environment Control products, and Gas Detection and Environment Control products services.
The Company accounts for a contract with a customer when there’s approval and commitment from both parties, the rights of the parties are identified, payment terms are identified, the contract has commercial substance and collectability of consideration is probable.
The Company’s revenue arrangements consist of multiple performance obligations including hardware, software, and services.
Determining the stand-alone selling price (“SSP”) and allocation of consideration from an arrangement to the individual performance obligations, and the appropriate timing of revenue recognition are significant judgments with respect to these arrangements.
The Company does not provide credits, incentives or retroactive discounts, which may be required to be accounted for as variable consideration when estimating the amount of revenue to be recognized.
The Company from time to time provides a right of return to its customers and the Company uses expected value method to estimate the potential value of the customer returns to reduce the transaction price.
The impact has been deemed to be immaterial, thus there is no disclosure related to sales returns, return on assets and refund liability.
Gas Detection and Environment Control Products
Gas Detection and Environment Control Products are sold as off-the-shelf products with prices fixed at the time of order.
Orders delivered to the Company by phone, fax, mail or email are considered valid purchase orders and once accepted by the Company are deemed to be the final understanding between us and our customer as to the specific nature and terms of the agreed-upon sale transaction.
The creditworthiness of customers is assessed prior to the Company accepting a customer’s first order.
Additionally, international customers and customers who have developed a history of payment problems are generally required to prepay or pay through a letter-of-credit.
Revenue is recognized at a point in time when control of the product is transferred to the customer, generally occurring upon the shipment or delivery dependent upon the terms of the underlying contract when (a) for FOB factory orders they leave our shipping dock or (b) for FOB customer dock orders upon confirmation of delivery.
  Page 13 of 20
Gas Detection and Environment Control Services
Gas detection and environment control services consist of field service orders (technical support) and training, which are provided separately from product orders.
Orders are accepted in the same forms as discussed for Gas Detection and Environment Control Products above with hourly prices fixed at the time of order.
Revenue recognition occurs only when the service activity is completed.
Such services are provided to current and prior customers, and, as noted above, creditworthiness has generally already been assessed.
In cases where the probability of receiving payment is low, a credit card number is collected for immediate processing.
Revenue is recognized in the period the technical support and training are performed.
FieldServer Products
FieldServer Services
FieldServer services consist of orders for custom development of protocol drivers.
Generally, customers place orders for FieldServer products concurrently with their order for protocol drivers.
However, if custom development of the protocol driver is required, the product order is not processed until development of the protocol driver is complete.
The driver development involves further research after receipt of order, preparation of a scope document to be approved by the customer and then engineering time to write, test and release the driver program.
When development of the driver is complete the customer is notified and can proceed with a FieldServer product.
Revenues for protocol driver development are recognized at a point in time when the control of the product is transferred to the customer generally occurring upon shipment or delivery of the related product that includes the developed protocol drivers (as noted in FieldServer Products above).
Discounts and Allowances
Discounts are applied at time of order entry and sales are processed at net pricing.
No allowances are offered to customers.
b) Contract Costs
Applying the practical expedient, the Company recognizes the incremental costs of obtaining contracts as an expense when incurred if the amortization period of the assets that otherwise would have been recognized is one year or less.
These costs mainly include the Company’s internal sales force compensation program and are included in sales and marketing expenses at the time the revenue is recognized.
  Page 14 of 20
c) Warranty
The Company provides a warranty on all products sold for a period of two years after the date of shipment.
Warranty issues are usually resolved with repair or replacement of the product.
This standard warranty is assurance type warranty and does not offer any services in addition to the assurance that the product will continue working as specified.
Therefore, warranties are not considered separate performance obligations in the arrangement.
Instead, estimated future warranty obligations related to products are provided by charges to condensed statements of operations in the period in which the related revenue is recognized.
d) Contract Balances
The Company records accounts receivable when it has an unconditional right to consideration.
Contract liabilities are recorded when cash payments are received or due in advance of performance.
Contract liabilities consist of only advance payments, where the Company has unsatisfied performance obligations.
Contract liabilities are classified as deferred revenue and included within “Other current liabilities” on the condensed balance sheets.
At times, billing may occur subsequent to revenue recognition, resulting in an unbilled receivable which represents a contract asset.
The Company does not have any unbilled receivable on the condensed balance sheets.
Payment terms vary by customer.
The time between invoicing and when payment is due is not significant.
For certain products or services and customer types, payment is required before the products or services are delivered to the customer.
There were no significant changes in estimates during the period that would affect the contract balances.
The amounts of revenue recognized during the six months ended June 30, 2018 and June 30, 2017 from the opening deferred revenue balances were $1,133 and $2,708, respectively.
For the periods ended June 30, 2018, and June 30, 2017 no impairment losses related to contract balances were recognized in the condensed statement of operations.
e) Disaggregation of Revenue
  Page 15 of 20
f) Shipping and Handling
The Company has elected to account for shipping and handling activities related to contracts with customers as costs to fulfill the promise to transfer the associated products.
g) Remaining Performance Obligations
Remaining performance obligations represent the transaction price allocated to performances obligations that are unsatisfied or partially unsatisfied as of the end of the reporting period.
Unsatisfied and partially unsatisfied performance obligations consist of contract liabilities and non-cancellable backlog.
Non-cancellable backlog includes goods and services for which customer purchase orders have been accepted that are scheduled or in the process of being scheduled for shipment.
As of June 30, 2018, the remaining performance obligation is approximately $4,386,000, 60% or $2,617,000 of which is expected to be recognized in 3 months and 80% or $3,497,000 of which is expected to be recognized within six months.
The remainder is expected to be recognized after fiscal year 2018.
h) Accounts Receivable and Related Allowances
Our domestic sales are generally made on an open account basis unless specific experience or knowledge of the customer’s potential inability or unwillingness to meet the payment terms dictates secured payments.
Our international sales are generally made based on secure payments, including cash wire advance payments and letters of credit.
International sales are made on open account terms where sufficient historical experience justifies the credit risks involved.
In many of our larger sales, the customers are construction contractors who are in need of our field services to complete their work and obtain payment.
Management’s ability to manage the credit terms and utilize the leverage provided by the clients’ need for our services is critical to the effective application of credit terms and minimization of accounts receivable losses.
We maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts which is analyzed on a periodic basis to determine whether it is adequate.
We believe that we have demonstrated the ability to make reasonable and reliable estimates of allowances for doubtful accounts based on significant historical experience.
i) Inventories
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value, cost being determined on the first-in, first-out method.
The Company uses an Enterprise Requirements Planning (“ERP”) software system which provides data upon which management relies to determine inventory trends and identify excesses.
The carrying value of inventory is reduced to net realizable value for slow moving and obsolete items based on historical experience and current product demand.
We evaluate the carrying value of inventory quarterly.
The adequacy of carrying amounts is dependent upon management’s ability to forecast demands accurately, manage product changes efficiently, and interpret the data provided by the ERP system.
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements.
None.
Contractual Obligations
Not applicable.
