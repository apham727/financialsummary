ITEM 3.Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk
Interest Rate Exposure
In the fiscal year ended October 28, 2017, we borrowed $2.5 billion of 3-year term loans and $2.5 billion of 5-year term loans as part of the financing for the acquisition of Linear Technology Corporation.
As of August 4, 2018, we have paid $1.9 billion of principal on the 3-year unsecured term loan and paid $1.2 billion of principal on the 5-year unsecured term loan.
The term loans accrue interest at a floating rate, equal to the LIBOR rate corresponding with the tenor of the borrowing period plus the applicable spread (112.5 basis points for the 3-year term loan and 125 basis points for the 5-year term loan).
Based on the $2.0 billion of floating rate debt outstanding as of August 4, 2018, of which $1 billion is hedged, our annual interest expense would change by approximately $10.0 million for each 100 basis point increase in interest rates.
There were no other material changes in the nine-month period ended August 4, 2018 to the information provided under Item 7A.
“Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk,” set forth in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended October 28, 2017.
