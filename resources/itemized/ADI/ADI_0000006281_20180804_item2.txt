Results of Operations


Overview


The fiscal year ending November 3, 2018 (fiscal 2018) is a 53-week year and the fiscal year ended October 28, 2017 (fiscal 2017) was a 52-week year.
The additional week in fiscal 2018 was included in the first quarter ended February 3, 2018.
Therefore, the first nine months of fiscal 2018 included an additional week of operations as compared to the first nine months of fiscal 2017.
Acquisition of Linear Technology Corporation

On March 10, 2017 (Acquisition Date), we completed the acquisition of Linear Technology Corporation (Linear), a designer, manufacturer and marketer of high performance analog integrated circuits.
The total consideration paid to acquire Linear was approximately $15.8 billion.
The acquisition of Linear is referred to as the Acquisition.
The condensed consolidated financial statements included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q include the financial results of Linear prospectively from the Acquisition Date.
See Note 13, Acquisitions, in the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements contained in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for further information.
Revenue Trends by End Market

The following tables summarize revenue by end market for the three- and nine-month periods ended August 4, 2018 and July 29, 2017.
The categorization of revenue by end market is determined using a variety of data points including the technical characteristics of the product, the “sold to” customer information, the “ship to” customer information and the end customer product or application into which our product will be incorporated.
As data systems for capturing and tracking this data evolve and improve, the categorization of products by end market can vary over time.
When this occurs, we reclassify revenue by end market for prior periods.
Such reclassifications typically do not materially change the sizing of, or the underlying trends of results within, each end market.
Industrial - Industrial end market revenue increased in the three-month period ended August 4, 2018, as compared to the same period of the prior fiscal year, primarily as a result of a broad-based increase in demand for our products in this end market.
The Industrial end market included $691.4 million of revenue in the nine-month period ended August 4, 2018, as compared to $277.5 million of revenue in the nine-month period ended July 29, 2017, as a result of the Acquisition.
Industrial end market revenue increased in the nine-month period ended August 4, 2018, as compared to the same period of the prior fiscal year, primarily as a result of the Acquisition, a broad-based increase in demand for our products in this end market and an additional week of operations in the first nine months of fiscal 2018 as compared to the first nine months of fiscal 2017.
Automotive -  Automotive end market revenue increased in the three-month period ended August 4, 2018, as compared to the same period of the prior fiscal year, primarily as a result of a broad-based increase in demand for our products in this end market.
The Automotive end market included $250.2 million of revenue in the nine-month period ended August 4, 2018, as compared to $113.4 million of revenue in the nine-month period ended July 29, 2017, as a result of the Acquisition.
Automotive end market revenue increased in the nine-month period ended August 4, 2018, as compared to the same period of the prior 


fiscal year, primarily as a result of the Acquisition, a broad-based increase in demand for our products in this end market and an additional week of operations in the first nine months of fiscal 2018 as compared to the first nine months of fiscal 2017.
Consumer - Consumer end market revenue decreased in the three-month period ended August 4, 2018, as compared to the same period of the prior fiscal year, primarily as a result of a decreased demand for products used in portable consumer applications.
Consumer end market revenue decreased in the nine-month period ended August 4, 2018, as compared to the same period of the prior fiscal year, primarily as a result of a decreased demand for products used in portable consumer applications, partially offset by an increase in revenue due to the Acquisition, which was not significant, and an additional week of operations in the first nine months of fiscal 2018 as compared to the first nine months of fiscal 2017.
Communications - Communications end market revenue increased in the three-month period ended August 4, 2018, as compared to the same period of the prior fiscal year as a result of a broad-based increase in demand for our products sold into this end market.
The Communications end market included $258.9 million of revenue in the nine-month period ended August 4, 2018, as compared to $73.7 million of revenue in the nine-month period ended July 29, 2017, as a result of the Acquisition.
Communications end market revenue increased in the nine-month period ended August 4, 2018, as compared to the same period of the prior fiscal year, primarily as a result of the Acquisition, a broad-based increase in demand for our products in this end market and an additional week of operations in the first nine months of fiscal 2018 as compared to the first nine months of fiscal 2017.

The sales decrease in the United States in the three-month period ended August 4, 2018, as compared to the same period of the prior fiscal year, was primarily a result of a decrease in demand for our products sold into the Consumer end market, partially offset by an increase in demand for our products sold into the Industrial end market.
The United States and Rest of North and South America included $304.1 million of revenue in the nine-month period ended August 4, 2018, as compared to $109.6 million of revenue in the nine-month period ended July 29, 2017, as a result of the Acquisition.
The sales increase in the United States in the nine-month period ended August 4, 2018, as compared to the same period of the prior fiscal year, was 


primarily a result of the Acquisition, an increase in demand for our products sold into the Industrial end market and an additional week of operations in the first nine months of fiscal 2018 as compared to the first nine months of fiscal 2017, partially offset by a decrease in demand for our products sold into the Consumer end market.
The sales increase in Europe in the three-month period ended August 4, 2018, as compared to the same period of the prior fiscal year, was primarily a result of an increase in demand for our products sold into the Industrial and Communications end markets.
Europe included $271.1 million of revenue in the nine-month period ended August 4, 2018, as compared to $129.3 million of revenue in the nine-month period ended July 29, 2017, as a result of the Acquisition.
The sales increase in Europe in the nine-month period ended August 4, 2018, as compared to the same period of the prior fiscal year, was primarily a result of the Acquisition, an increase in demand for our products sold into the Industrial and Communications end markets and an additional week of operations in the first nine months of fiscal 2018 as compared to the first nine months of fiscal 2017, partially offset by a decrease in demand for our products sold into the Automotive end market.
The sales increase in Japan in the three-month period ended August 4, 2018, as compared to the same period of the prior fiscal year, was primarily a result of an increase in demand for our products sold into the Industrial end market.
Japan included $205.3 million of revenue in the nine-month period ended August 4, 2018, as compared to $55.8 million of revenue in the nine-month period ended July 29, 2017, as a result of the Acquisition.
The sales increase in Japan in the nine-month period ended August 4, 2018, as compared to the same period of the prior fiscal year, was primarily a result of the Acquisition, an increase in demand for our products sold into the Industrial end market and an additional week of operations in the first nine months of fiscal 2018 as compared to the first nine months of fiscal 2017.
The sales increase in China and the Rest of Asia in the three-month period ended August 4, 2018, as compared to the same period of the prior fiscal year, was primarily a result of a broad-based increase in demand for our products sold into all end markets.
China included $272.5 million of revenue in the nine-month period ended August 4, 2018, as compared to $126.6 million of revenue in the nine-month period ended July 29, 2017, as a result of the Acquisition.
The Rest of Asia included $192.7 million of revenue in the nine-month period ended August 4, 2018, as compared to $94.8 million of revenue in the nine-month period ended July 29, 2017, as a result of the Acquisition.
The sales increase in China and the Rest of Asia in the nine-month period ended August 4, 2018, as compared to the same period of the prior fiscal year, was primarily a result of the Acquisition, a broad-based increase in demand for our products sold into all end markets and an additional week of operations in the first nine months of fiscal 2018 as compared to the first nine months of fiscal 2017.
Gross Margin


Gross margin percentage increased by 1,460 basis points and 1,060 basis points in the three- and nine-month periods ended August 4, 2018, respectively, as compared to the same periods of the prior fiscal year, primarily because the three- and nine-month periods ended July 29, 2017 included cost of sales adjustments of $195.6 million and $316.7 million, respectively, related to the sale of acquired inventory written up to fair value.
Additionally, the increases in gross margin percentages in the three- and nine-month periods ended August 4, 2018, as compared to the same periods of the prior fiscal year, were a result of lower cost of sales resulting from increased efficiencies at our manufacturing facilities.
The increase in gross margin percentage in the nine-month period ended August 4, 2018 was partially offset by increases in amortization expense of developed technology intangible assets and depreciation expense related to the write-up of fixed assets acquired to fair value as a result of the Acquisition.
Amortization of Intangibles


Amortization expenses decreased in the three-month period ended August 4, 2018, as compared to the same period of the prior fiscal year, primarily as a result of changes to the amortization period of certain acquired intangible assets resulting from the Acquisition during the measurement period.
Amortization expenses increased in the nine-month period ended August 4, 2018, as compared to the same period of the prior fiscal year, as a result of the purchase of intangible assets as part of the Acquisition, and to a lesser extent, other immaterial acquisitions in fiscal 2018.
Special Charges

We monitor global macroeconomic conditions on an ongoing basis and continue to assess opportunities for improved operational effectiveness and efficiency, as well as a better alignment of expenses with revenues.
As a result of these assessments, we have undertaken various restructuring actions over the past several years, which resulted in special charges of $16.1 million and $8.1 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2018 and fiscal 2017, respectively, in an effort to reduce overall operating costs.
In addition, in the first quarter of fiscal 2017 we recorded a special charge of $41.3 million related to an early retirement offer action, which we expect to result in estimated annual salary, variable compensation, and employee benefit savings of approximately $28.4 million once fully implemented.
In the first nine months of fiscal 2018, we recorded special charges of $43.4 million as a result of our decision to consolidate certain wafer and test facility operations acquired as part of the Acquisition.
Over the next three to five years, we plan to close our Hillview wafer fabrication facility located in Milpitas, California and our Singapore test facility.
We intend to transfer Hillview wafer fabrication production to our other internal facilities and to external foundries.
In addition, we are planning to transition testing operations currently handled in our Singapore facility to our facilities in Penang, Malaysia and the Philippines, in addition to our outsourced assembly and test partners.
The special charge recognized as a result of this action consists of severance and related benefit costs.
We expect that this action will result in estimated annual salary, variable compensation and employee benefit savings of approximately $60.0 million once fully implemented.
See Note 6, Special Charges, in the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements contained in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for further information.
Operating Income




Nonoperating Expense (Income)


The year-over-year decrease in nonoperating expense in the three-month period ended August 4, 2018 was primarily the result of a decrease in interest expense related to financing commitments which were entered into prior to and upon the Acquisition and which have subsequently been repaid in part or in full, partially offset by rising interest rates.
The year-over-year increase in nonoperating expense in the nine-month period ended August 4, 2018 was primarily the result of a decrease in interest income as a result of lower invested cash balances in the first nine months of fiscal 2018 as compared to the first nine months of fiscal 2017, and an increase in interest expense related to a 3-year unsecured term loan in the principal amount of $2.5 billion and a 5-year unsecured term loan in the principal amount of $2.5 billion entered into in the second quarter of fiscal 2017, $2.1 billion of senior unsecured notes issued in the first quarter of fiscal 2017 in connection with the Acquisition and $750 million of senior unsecured notes issued in the second quarter of fiscal 2018, partially offset by a reduction in fees related to financing commitments which were entered into prior to and upon the Acquisition and which terminated during fiscal 2017.
Provision for Income Taxes


Our effective tax rate reflects the applicable tax rate in effect in the various tax jurisdictions around the world where our income is earned.
Our effective income tax rate can also be impacted each year by discrete factors or events.
The tax rate for the three- and nine-month periods ended August 4, 2018 was below our blended U.S. federal statutory tax rate of 23.4% for fiscal 2018 resulting from the passage of the Tax Legislation, primarily due to lower statutory tax rates applicable to our operations in the foreign jurisdictions in which we earn income.
Similarly, the tax rate for the nine-month period ended July 29, 2017 was below the then U.S. statutory tax rate of 35%, primarily due to lower statutory tax rates applicable to our operations in the foreign jurisdictions in which we earn income, and for the three month period ended July 29, 2017, it exceeded the U.S. statutory tax rate, primarily due to approximately $98 million of tax expense incurred during the quarter as part of the post-Acquisition integration, partially offset by a tax benefit of $51 million related to the reduction of reserves and related interest resulting from the U.S. Tax Court's favorable ruling.
Our effective tax rate for the nine-month period ended August 4, 2018 includes a provisional estimate for a discrete tax benefit of $639.7 million from remeasuring our U.S. deferred tax liabilities at the lower 21% statutory tax rate.
The nine-month period ended August 4, 2018 also includes a provisional estimate of $687.1 million for the discrete tax charge from the Tax Legislation’s one-time transition tax associated with our undistributed foreign earnings, which is comprised of the $751.1 million transitional tax liability less a deferred tax liability of $64.0 million that was recorded in prior years.
Additionally, we recorded discrete benefits for excess tax benefits from share-based payments of $6.0 and $24.2 million in the three- and nine-month periods ended August 4, 2018, respectively.
Our effective tax rate for the three- and nine-month periods ended August 4, 2018 also included a tax benefit of $4.2 million and $7.9 million, respectively, resulting from the release of uncertain tax positions due to a statute of limitation expiration during the quarter.
Our effective tax rate for the three- and nine-month periods ended July 29, 2017 included a tax benefit of $15.0 million for the release of a state tax credit valuation allowance as a result of the Acquisition.
The Tax Legislation contains many provisions that are effective for tax years beginning on or after January 1, 2018.
Because we are a fiscal year U.S. taxpayer, certain provisions, such as the global intangible low-taxed income tax and foreign-derived intangible income deduction on certain foreign-source income and new limitations on certain business deductions, will begin applying to us for our fiscal year ending November 2, 2019 (fiscal 2019).
For fiscal 2018, the most significant impacts include a lower U.S. federal corporate income tax rate, a re-measurement of certain net deferred taxes to reflect the revised tax rates and a new transition tax on the deemed repatriation of certain foreign earnings.
The phasing in of the lower corporate income tax rate results in a blended federal tax rate of 23.4% for fiscal 2018, compared with the previous 35% rate.
The federal tax rate will be reduced to 21% in subsequent fiscal years.
Non-U.S. jurisdictions accounted for approximately 76.0% of our total revenues for the nine-month period ended August 4, 2018, compared to approximately 79.3% of our total revenues for the nine-month period ended July 29, 2017.
This revenue generated outside of the U.S. results in a material portion of our pretax income being taxed outside the U.S., primarily in Bermuda, Ireland and Singapore, at tax rates ranging from 0% to 33.3%.
The Company has a partial tax holiday in Singapore through August 2019 and a partial tax holiday in Malaysia through July 2025.
The impact on our provision for income taxes on income earned in foreign jurisdictions being taxed at rates different than the U.S. statutory rate was a benefit of approximately $123.8 million and a foreign effective tax rate of approximately 4.5% for the three-month period ended August 4, 2018, compared to a benefit of approximately $182.6 million and a foreign effective tax rate of approximately 5.8% for the three-month period ended July 29, 2017.
The impact on our provision for income taxes on income earned in foreign jurisdictions being taxed at rates different than the U.S. statutory rate was a benefit of approximately $334.9 million and a foreign effective tax rate of approximately 5.3% for the nine-month period ended August 4, 2018, compared to a benefit of approximately $266.7 million and a foreign effective tax rate of approximately 5.1% for the nine-month period ended July 29, 2017.
A reduction in the ratio of domestic taxable income to worldwide taxable income effectively lowers our overall tax rate, due to the fact that the tax rates in the majority of foreign jurisdictions where we earn income are lower than the U.S. statutory rate.
In addition, our effective income tax rate can be impacted each year by amounts for discrete factors or events, and acquisition-related accounting adjustments.
Net Income


Net income increased in the three-month period ended August 4, 2018, as compared to the same period of the prior fiscal year, as a result of a $304.2 million increase in operating income, partially offset by a $9.6 million decrease in nonoperating expense and a $31.8 million decrease in provision for income taxes.
Net income increased in the nine-month period ended August 4, 2018, as compared to the same period of the prior fiscal year, as a result of a $761.4 million increase in operating income, partially offset by a $27.3 million increase in nonoperating expense and a $51.3 million increase in provision for income taxes.
Liquidity and Capital Resources

At August 4, 2018, our principal source of liquidity was $772.6 million of cash and cash equivalents, of which approximately $369.7 million was held in the United States.
The balance of our cash and cash equivalents was held outside the United States in various foreign subsidiaries.
We continue to assert our intent to reinvest substantially all of our foreign earnings indefinitely, however we are in the process of analyzing the impact that the Tax Legislation has on this indefinite reinvestment assertion.
As we intend to reinvest substantially all of our foreign earnings indefinitely at this time, certain cash held outside the United States is not available for repatriation as dividends to the United States.
If such funds are needed for U.S. operations, we would be required to accrue and pay foreign withholding and U.S. state income taxes to the extent not already subject to taxation.
Our cash and cash equivalents consist of highly liquid investments with maturities of three months or less, including money market funds.
We maintain these balances with high credit quality counterparties, continually monitor the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer and diversify our investments in order to minimize our credit risk.
On the Acquisition Date, we borrowed under a term loan agreement consisting of a 3-year unsecured term loan in the principal amount of $2.5 billion, due March 10, 2020 and a 5-year unsecured term loan in the principal amount of $2.5 billion, due March 10, 2022.
As of August 4, 2018, we have paid $1.9 billion of principal on the 3-year unsecured term loan and paid $1.2 billion of principal on the 5-year unsecured term loan.
We believe that our existing sources of liquidity and cash expected to be generated from future operations, together with existing and anticipated available long-term financing, will be sufficient to fund operations, capital expenditures, research and development efforts and dividend payments (if any) in the immediate future and for at least the next twelve months.
At August 4, 2018, cash and cash equivalents totaled $772.6 million.
The following changes contributed to the net decrease in cash and cash equivalents in the nine-month period ended August 4, 2018 as compared to the same period in fiscal 2017.
Operating Activities

Cash provided by operating activities is net income adjusted for certain non-cash items and changes in assets and liabilities.
The increase in cash provided by operating activities during the nine-month period ended August 4, 2018, as compared to the same period of the prior fiscal year, was primarily a result of higher net income income adjusted for non-cash items, and changes in working capital, primarily resulting from changes to income taxes related to the Tax Legislation.
Investing Activities

Investing cash flows consist primarily of capital expenditures, investment purchases, maturities and sales of available-for-sale securities, as well as cash used for acquisitions.
The decrease in cash used for investing activities during the nine-month period ended August 4, 2018, as compared to the same period of the prior fiscal year, was primarily the result of a decrease in payments for acquisitions, partially offset by a decrease of proceeds from the sale of available for sale securities.
Financing Activities 

Financing cash flows consist primarily of payments of dividends to stockholders, repurchases of common stock, issuance and repayment of long-term debt, and proceeds from the sale of shares of common stock pursuant to employee equity incentive plans.
The change in cash related to financing activities during the nine-month period ended August 4, 2018, as compared to the same period of the prior fiscal year, was primarily due to a decrease in net proceeds of $10.4 billion received from the issuance of senior unsecured notes and financing commitments, and repayments of $1.3 billion on the 3-year unsecured term loan and $750.0 million on the 5-year unsecured term loan.
Working Capital



The increase in accounts receivable in dollars was primarily the result of higher product shipments in the third quarter of fiscal 2018 as compared to the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017.
Inventory in dollars increased, primarily as a result of our efforts to balance manufacturing production, demand and inventory levels.
Our inventory levels are impacted by our need to support forecasted sales demand and variations between those forecasts and actual demand.
Current liabilities decreased to $1.3 billion at August 4, 2018 from $1.6 billion at the end of fiscal 2017.
The decrease was primarily due to a decrease in the current portion of our debt.
As of August 4, 2018 and October 28, 2017, we had gross deferred revenue of $679.9 million and $589.5 million, respectively, and gross deferred cost of sales of $132.6 million and $115.5 million, respectively.
Deferred income on shipments to distributors increased in the first nine months of fiscal 2018, primarily as a result of higher demand for products sold into the channel.
Sales to certain distributors are made under agreements that allow distributors to receive price-adjustment credits and to return qualifying products for credit, as determined by us, in order to reduce the amounts of slow-moving, discontinued or obsolete product from their inventory.
Given the uncertainties associated with the levels of price-adjustment credits to be granted to certain distributors, the sales price to the distributors is not fixed or determinable until the distributors resell the products to their customers.
Therefore, we defer revenue recognition from sales to distributors until the distributors have sold the products to their customers.
The amount of price-adjustments is dependent on future overall market conditions, and therefore the levels of these adjustments could fluctuate significantly from period to period.
To the extent that we experience a significant increase in the amount of credits we issue to our distributors, there could be a material impact on the ultimate revenue and gross margin recognized relating to these transactions.

$5.0 Billion Aggregate Principal Term Loans

On the Acquisition Date, we drew down on a 3-year unsecured term loan in the principal amount of $2.5 billion, due March 10, 2020 and a 5-year unsecured term loan in the principal amount of $2.5 billion, due March 10, 2022.
The term loans bear interest at a rate per annum equal to the Eurodollar Rate plus a margin based on our debt ratings from time to time of between 0.75% and 1.63% in the case of the 3-year unsecured term loan, and a margin of between 0.88% and 1.75% in the case of the 5-year unsecured term loan.
As of August 4, 2018, we have paid $1.9 billion of principal on the 3-year unsecured term loan and paid $1.2 billion of principal on the 5-year unsecured term loan.
Revolving Credit Facility 

We have a senior unsecured revolving credit facility with certain institutional lenders that expires on July 10, 2020.
The agreement for such revolving credit facility (Credit Agreement) provides that we may borrow up to $1.0 billion.
To date, we have not borrowed under this credit facility, but we may borrow in the future and use the proceeds for repayment of existing indebtedness, stock repurchases, acquisitions, capital expenditures, working capital and other lawful corporate purposes.
The terms of the Credit Agreement impose restrictions on our ability to undertake certain transactions, to create certain liens on assets and to incur certain subsidiary indebtedness.
In addition, the Credit Agreement contains a consolidated leverage ratio covenant of total consolidated funded debt to consolidated earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) of not greater than 5.0 to 1.0.
The debt covenant will be reduced over time to 3.0 to 1.0 which began in May 2018.
As of August 4, 2018, we were in compliance with these covenants.
Stock Repurchase Program

Our common stock repurchase program has been in place since August 2004.
In the aggregate, our Board of Directors has authorized us to repurchase $6.2 billion of our common stock under the program.
Under the program, we may repurchase outstanding shares of our common stock from time to time in the open market and through privately negotiated transactions.
Unless terminated earlier by resolution of our Board of Directors, the repurchase program will expire when we have repurchased all shares authorized under the program.
As of August 4, 2018, we had repurchased a total of approximately 147.0 million shares of our common stock for approximately $5.4 billion under this program.
As of August 4, 2018, an additional $792.5 million remains available for repurchase under the current authorized program.
The repurchased shares are held as authorized but unissued shares of common stock.
In connection with the Acquisition, we had temporarily suspended our share repurchase program.
On August 21, 2018, the Board of Directors approved an increase to the current authorization for the stock repurchase program by an additional $2.0 billion to $8.2 billion in the aggregate.
We also, from time to time, repurchase shares in settlement of employee minimum tax withholding obligations due upon the vesting of restricted stock units.
Capital Expenditures

Net additions to property, plant and equipment were $168.9 million in the first nine months of fiscal 2018 and were funded with a combination of cash on hand and cash generated from operations.
We expect capital expenditures for fiscal 2018 to be in the range of $230.0 million to $270.0 million.
These capital expenditures will be funded with a combination of cash on hand and cash generated from operations.
Dividends

On August 21, 2018, our Board of Directors declared a cash dividend of $0.48 per outstanding share of common stock.
The dividend will be paid on September 12, 2018 to all shareholders of record at the close of business on August 31, 2018 and is expected to total approximately $178.4 million.
We currently expect quarterly dividends to continue at $0.48 per share, although they remain subject to determination and declaration by our Board of Directors.
The payment of future dividends, if any, will be based on several factors, including our financial performance, outlook and liquidity.
Contractual Obligations

In the first quarter of fiscal 2018, we entered into a lease agreement for approximately 445,000 sq.
ft. for a facility in Santa Clara, California.
The lease term is through October 2030 and we expect to occupy the building beginning January 1, 2019.
The Tax Legislation, enacted on December 22, 2017, contains significant changes to U.S. tax law, including lowering the U.S. corporate income tax rate to 21.0%, implementing a territorial tax system, and imposing a one-time tax on deemed repatriated earnings of foreign subsidiaries.
As part of transitioning to the territorial tax system, the Tax Legislation includes a one-time transition tax that we intend to elect to pay over a period of eight years that begins in fiscal 2019 on an interest free basis.
In the second quarter of fiscal 2018, in an underwritten public offering, we issued the 2020 Notes and the January 2021 Notes.
There have not been any other material changes during the nine-month period ended August 4, 2018 to the amounts presented in the table summarizing our contractual obligations included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended October 28, 2017.
New Accounting Pronouncements

From time to time, new accounting pronouncements are issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) that are adopted by us as of the specified effective date.
Unless otherwise discussed, management believes that the impact of recently issued standards will not have a material impact on our future financial condition and results of operations.
See Note 15, New Accounting Pronouncements, of the Notes to our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements contained in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for a description of recently issued and adopted accounting pronouncements, including the dates of adoption and impact on our historical financial condition and results of operations.
Revenue Recognition

In May 2014, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (ASU 2014-09), which supersedes nearly all existing revenue recognition guidance under generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (U.S. GAAP).
The core principle of ASU 2014-09 is that an entity should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services.
Additionally, the guidance requires improved disclosures to help users of financial statements better understand the nature, amount, timing, and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from contracts with customers.
The FASB has issued several amendments and updates to the new revenue standard, including guidance related to when an entity should recognize revenue gross as a principal or net as an agent and how an entity should identify performance obligations.
As amended, ASU 2014-09 is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2017, which is our first quarter of fiscal 2019.
We have developed a project plan for the implementation of the guidance, including a review of all revenue streams to identify any differences in the timing, measurement or presentation of revenue recognition.
We have reviewed our revenue streams, including those from the Acquisition, and are nearing completion in assessing all potential impacts of the standard on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures, including any impacts from recently issued amendments, and retrospectively adjusting financial information for prior fiscal years.
While we are still in the process of completing our evaluation of the standard, we currently believe the most significant impact will be related to the timing of recognition of sales to certain distributors.
As described in Note 2, Revenue Recognition, of the Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements contained in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, we currently defer revenue and the related cost of sales on shipments to certain distributors until the distributors resell the products to their customers.
Upon adoption of ASU 2014-09, we will no longer be permitted to defer revenue until sale by the distributor to the end customer, but rather, will be required to estimate the effects of returns and allowances provided to distributors and record revenue at the time of sale to the distributor.
We will adopt ASU 2014-09, using the full retrospective method, upon its effective date for us which is our first quarter of fiscal 2019.
