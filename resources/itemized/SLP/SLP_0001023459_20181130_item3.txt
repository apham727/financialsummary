Item 3.
Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk 

As of November 30, 2018 and August 31, 2018, we had cash and cash equivalents of $9.35 million and $9.40 million, respectively.
We do not hold any investments that are exposed to market risk related to changes in interest rates, which could adversely affect the value of our assets and liabilities, and we do not hold any instruments for trading purposes and investment.
Some of our cash and cash equivalents are held in money market accounts; however, they are not exposed to market rate risk.
In the three months ended November 30, 2018 and 2017, we sold $809,000 and $670,000, respectively of software through representatives in certain Asian markets in local currencies.
As a result, our financial position, results of operations, and cash flows can be affected by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, particularly fluctuations in the yen and RMB exchange rates.
These transactions give rise to receivables that are denominated in currencies other than the entityâ€™s functional currency.
The value of these receivables are subject to changes because the receivables may become worth more or less due to changes in currency exchange rates.
The majority of our software license agreements are denominated in U.S. dollars.
We record foreign gains and losses as they are realized.
We mitigate our risk from foreign currency fluctuations by adjusting prices in our foreign markets on a periodic basis.
We base these changes on market conditions while working closely with our representatives.
We do not hedge currencies or enter into derivative contracts.
