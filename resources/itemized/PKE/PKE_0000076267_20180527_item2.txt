Item 2.
Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.
Financial Overview
The Company's total net sales worldwide in the 13 weeks ended May 27, 2018 were 13% higher than in the 13 weeks ended May 28, 2017 principally as a result of higher sales of the Company’s electronics products in Asia, North America and Europe, and higher sales of the Company’s aerospace composite materials, structures and assemblies.
The Company’s total net sales worldwide in the 13 weeks ended May 27, 2018 were 12% higher than in the 13 weeks ended February 25, 2018 principally as a result of higher sales of the Company’s electronics products in Asia and higher sales of aerospace composite materials, structures and assemblies in North America.
The Company’s gross profit margin, measured as a percentage of sales, increased to 27.4% in the 13 weeks ended May 27, 2018 from 23.1% in the 13 weeks ended May 28, 2017 principally as a result of higher sales and production levels of its electronics products in Asia, North America and Europe, higher sales of aerospace composite materials, structures and assemblies and reduced costs due to the consolidation of the Company’s electronics business units in California and Arizona during the 2018 fiscal year.
The Company’s earnings from operations and net earnings were 1,398% higher and 127% higher, respectively, in the 13 weeks ended May 27, 2018 than in last fiscal year’s comparable period, primarily as a result of the aforementioned higher sales and increase in the gross profit margin and the higher costs recorded in the 13 weeks ended May 28, 2017 for the consolidation of the Company’s electronics business units in California and Arizona.
Earnings from operations in the 13 weeks ended May 27, 2018 included pre-tax restructuring charges of $183,000 in connection with the aforementioned consolidation and the closure in fiscal year 2009 of the electronics facility located in Newburgh, New York and pretax advisory fees of $120,000.
Earnings from operations in the 13 weeks ended May 28, 2017 included pre-tax restructuring charges of $1,361,000 in connection with the consolidation of the California and Arizona business units and the Newburgh facility closure.
The global markets for the Company’s products continue to be very difficult to forecast, and it is not clear to the Company what the demand for the Company’s products will be in the remainder of the 2019 fiscal year or beyond.
Net Sales
The Company’s total net sales worldwide in the 13 weeks ended May 27, 2018 increased to $31.1 million from $27.4 million in the 13 weeks ended May 28, 2017, primarily as a result of higher sales of the Company’s electronics products in Asia, North America and Europe, and higher sales of the Company’s aerospace composite materials, structures and assemblies.
The Company’s total net sales of its aerospace composite materials, structures and assemblies were $10.4 million in the 13 weeks ended May 27, 2018, or 33% of the Company’s total net sales worldwide in such period, compared to $8.7 million in the 13 weeks ended May 28, 2017, or 32% of the Company’s total net sales worldwide in such period.
The Company’s total net sales of its electronics products were $20.7 million in the 13 weeks ended May 27, 2018, or 67% of the Company’s total net sales worldwide in such period, compared to $18.7 million in the 13 weeks ended May 28, 2017, or 68% of the Company’s total net sales worldwide in such period.
The Company's foreign sales were $14.5 million in the 13 weeks ended May 27, 2018, or 47% of the Company's total net sales worldwide in such period, compared to $12.0 million of foreign sales, or 44% of total net sales worldwide in last fiscal year's comparable period.
The Company’s foreign sales in the 13-week period ended May 27, 2018 increased 20% from last fiscal year’s comparable period, primarily due to higher sales in North America, Asia and Europe.
In the 13 weeks ended May 27, 2018, the Company’s sales in North America, Asia and Europe were 53%, 37% and 10%, respectively, of the Company’s total net sales worldwide compared to 56%, 37% and 7%, respectively, in the 13 weeks ended May 28, 2017.
The Company’s sales in North America increased 8%, its sales in Asia increased 14% and its sales in Europe increased 54% in the 13-week period ended May 27, 2018 compared to the 13-week period ended May 28, 2017.
During the 13 weeks ended May 27, 2018, the Company’s sales of its high performance electronics materials were 94% of the Company’s total net sales worldwide of electronics materials compared to 92% during the 13 weeks ended May 28, 2017.
Gross Profit
The Company’s gross profit in the 13 weeks ended May 27, 2018 was higher than the gross profit in the prior year’s comparable period, and the gross profit as a percentage of sales for the Company’s worldwide operations in the 13 weeks ended May 27, 2018 increased to 27.4% from 23.1% in the 13 weeks ended May 28, 2017, primarily due to higher sales and production levels of its electronics products in North America, Asia and Europe, higher sales and production levels of its aerospace composite materials, structures and assemblies and the benefits in the 2018 fiscal year from the consolidation of the Company’s electronics business units in California and Arizona.
Selling, General and Administrative Expenses
Selling, general and administrative expenses increased by $92,000 during the 13 weeks ended May 27, 2018, or by 2%, compared to last fiscal year's comparable period, and these expenses, measured as a percentage of sales, were 15.5% and 17.2% in the 13 weeks ended May 27, 2018 and May 28, 2017, respectively.
The increase in such expenses during the 13 weeks ended May 27, 2018 was primarily the result of higher bonus, profit sharing and shipping expenses and higher foreign exchange losses, partially offset by lower payroll, and stock option expenses.
During the 13 weeks ended May 27, 2018 selling, general and administrative expenses included advisory fees of $120,000.
During the 13 weeks ended May 28, 2017, selling, general and administrative expenses included a one-time litigation expense of $375,000.
Selling, general and administrative expenses included stock option expenses of $201,000 and $240,000 for the 13 weeks ended May 27, 2018 and May 28, 2017, respectively.
Restructuring Charges
In the 13 weeks ended May 27, 2018, the Company recorded pre-tax restructuring charges of $183,000 in connection with the consolidation of the Company’s California and Arizona electronics business units and the closure in fiscal year 2009 of the New England Laminates Co., Inc. facility located in Newburgh, New York.
In the 13 weeks ended May 28, 2017 the Company recorded a pre-tax restructuring charge of $1,361,000 related to the consolidation of the Company’s California and Arizona business units and the closure in fiscal year 2009 of the Newburgh facility.
Earnings from Operations
For the reasons set forth above, the Company's earnings from operations were $3.5 million for the 13 weeks ended May 27, 2018, which included the aforementioned restructuring charge of $183,000 and the advisory fees of $120,000, compared to $0.2 million for the 13 weeks ended May 28, 2017, which included the aforementioned restructuring charge of $1,361,000 and the one-time litigation expense of $375,000.
Interest Expense
Interest expense in the 13 weeks ended May 28, 2017 related to the Company’s outstanding borrowings under the three-year revolving credit facility agreement, as amended, that the Company entered into with HSBC Bank in the fourth quarter of the 2016 fiscal year.
On January 3, 2018, the Company voluntarily prepaid the remaining loan balance of $68.5 million and terminated the credit facility agreement.
See “Liquidity and Capital Resources” elsewhere in this Item 2 and Note 5 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Report for additional information.
Interest Income
Interest income was $340,000 and $749,000 for the 13 weeks ended May 27, 2018 and May 28, 2017, respectively.
Interest income decreased 55% for the 13 weeks ended May 27, 2018, primarily as a result of lower average balances of marketable securities held by the Company in the 13 weeks ended May 27, 2018 compared to last fiscal year's comparable period, the repayment of the entire loan balance with HSBC Bank and the $3.00 per share special dividend paid during the fourth quarter of the 2018 fiscal year.
During the 13 weeks ended May 27, 2018, the Company earned interest income principally from its investments, which were primarily in short-term instruments and money market funds.
Income Tax Provision
The Company's effective income tax rate for the 13 weeks ended May 27, 2018 was 17.6% compared to negative 194.3% for the 13 weeks ended May 28, 2017.
The effective tax rate for the 13 weeks ended May 27, 2018 was higher than the effective tax rate for the 13 weeks ended May 28, 2017, primarily due to the the reversal of a tax reserve of $688,000 in the 13 weeks ended May 28, 2017.
Net Earnings
For the reasons set forth above, the Company's net earnings for the 13 weeks ended May 27, 2018 were $3.2 million, including the pre-tax restructuring charge and the pretax advisory fees described above, compared to net earnings of $1.4 million for the 13 weeks ended May 28, 2017, including the pre-tax restructuring charge and one-time litigation expense described above.
Basic and Diluted Earnings Per Share
Basic and diluted earnings per share for the 13 weeks ended May 27, 2018 were $0.16, including the pretax restructuring charges and the pretax advisory fees described above, compared to basic and diluted earnings per share of $0.07 for the 13 weeks ended May 28, 2017, including the pretax restructuring charges and the one-time litigation expense described above.
The net impact of the items described above was to reduce basic and diluted earnings per share by $0.01 and $0.05 in the 13 weeks ended May 27, 2018 and May 28, 2017, respectively.
The Company’s total net sales of its electronics products were $20.7 million in the 13 weeks ended May 27, 2018.
Electronics materials sales increased $2.0 million for the 13 weeks ended May 27, 2018, or 11%, compared to the 13 weeks ended May 28, 2017.
The increase in sales was due to growing demand in North America, Asia and Europe for the Company’s recently introduced products, which are used by OEMs in the manufacture of equipment for the internet and telecommunications infrastructure.
Electronics operating income increased $1.2 million for the 13 weeks ended May 27, 2018, or 49%, compared to the 13 weeks ended May 28, 2017.
The increase in operating profit was due to the increased sales mentioned above and the elimination of duplicate costs in the U.S.
The aerospace segment designs, develops and manufactures advanced composite materials, primary and secondary structures and assemblies and low-volume tooling for the aerospace markets.
The Company’s total net sales of its aerospace composite materials, structures and assemblies were $10.4 million in the 13 weeks ended May 27, 2018.
Aerospace composite materials, structures and assemblies sales increased $1.7 million for the 13 weeks ended May 27, 2018, or 19%, compared to the 13 weeks ended May 28, 2017.
The increase in sales was primarily due to higher sales to a major customer following completion of that customer’s inventory correction.
Aerospace operating income increased $0.4 million for the 13 weeks ended May 27, 2018, or 20%, compared to the 13 weeks ended May 28, 2017.
The increase in operating profit was primarily due to the increased sales mentioned above.
Cash and Marketable Securities
Of the $106.1 million of cash and marketable securities at May 27, 2018, $104.4 million was owned by certain of the Company’s wholly owned foreign subsidiaries.
The Company believes it has sufficient liquidity to fund its operating activities through the end of the 2019 fiscal year and for the foreseeable future thereafter.
●
accounts receivable increased 8% at May 27, 2018 compared to February 25, 2018 due to an increase in sales during the 13 weeks ended May, 27, 2018;
●
inventories increased by 13% at May 27, 2018 compared to February 25, 2018, primarily due to increases in raw materials, work-in-process and finished goods;
●
prepaid expenses and other current assets increased by 14% at May 27, 2018 compared to February 25, 2018, primarily due to higher VAT receivables and prepaid support contracts offset by lower accrued interest receivable on marketable securities;
●
accounts payable increased by 12% at May 27, 2018 compared to February 25, 2018, primarily due to the timing of raw material purchases from, and payments to, suppliers;
●
accrued liabilities increased by 7% at May 27, 2018 compared to February 25, 2018, primarily due to higher travel and entertainment and professional fee accruals, partially offset by payments against restructuring accruals and lower payroll accruals; and
●  income taxes payable decreased by 8% at May 27, 2018 compared to February 25, 2018 due to payments of income taxes during the quarter.
In addition, the Company paid $2.0 million in cash dividends in each of the 13-week periods ended May 27, 2018 and May 28, 2017.
During the 13 weeks ended May 28, 2017, the Company also made a $750,000 principal payment on its long-term debt.
Working Capital
The decrease in working capital at May 27, 2018 compared to February 25, 2018 was due principally to the increases in accounts payable and accrued expenses and decreases in cash and marketable securities, partially offset by increases to accounts receivable and inventories.
The Company's current ratio (the ratio of current assets to current liabilities) was 10.9 to 1 at May 27, 2018 compared to 11.6 to 1 at February 25, 2018.
Cash Flows
During the 13 weeks ended May 27, 2018, the Company's net earnings, before depreciation and amortization, stock-based compensation and amortization of bond premium, were $4.1 million.
Such earnings were reduced by changes in operating assets and liabilities of $4.4 million, resulting in $0.3 million of cash used in operating activities.
During the same 13-week period, the Company expended $13,000 for the purchase of property, plant and equipment, compared with $105,000 during the 13 weeks ended May 28, 2017.
The Company paid $2.0 million in cash dividends in each of the 13-week periods ended May 27, 2018 and May 28, 2017.
In addition, during the 13-week period ended May 28, 2017, the Company made a $750,000 principal payment on its long-term debt.
Other Liquidity Factors
The Company believes its financial resources will be sufficient, for the twelve months following the filing of this Form 10-Q Quarterly Report and for the foreseeable future thereafter, to provide for continued investment in working capital and property, plant and equipment and for general corporate purposes.
The Company’s financial resources are also available for purchases of the Company's common stock, appropriate acquisitions and other expansions of the Company's business.
The Company is not aware of any circumstances or events that are reasonably likely to occur that could materially affect its liquidity.
The Company’s contractual obligations and other commercial commitments to make future payments under contracts, such as lease agreements, consist only of (i) operating lease commitments and (ii) commitments to purchase raw materials.
The Company has no other long-term debt, capital lease obligations, unconditional purchase obligations or other long-term obligations, standby letters of credit, guarantees, standby repurchase obligations or other commercial commitments or contingent commitments, other than two standby letters of credit in the total amount of $980,000 to secure the Company’s obligations under its workers’ compensation insurance program.
The Company’s liquidity is not dependent on the use of, and the Company is not engaged in, any off-balance sheet financing arrangements, such as securitization of receivables or obtaining access to assets through special purpose entities.
The foregoing Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations is based upon the Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.
The preparation of these Consolidated Financial Statements requires the Company to make estimates, assumptions and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses and the related disclosure of contingent liabilities.
On an ongoing basis, the Company evaluates its estimates, including those related to sales allowances, allowances for doubtful accounts, inventories, valuation of long-lived assets, income taxes, contingencies and litigation, and employee benefit programs.
The Company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources.
Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.
The Company’s critical accounting policies that are important to the Consolidated Financial Statements and that entail, to a significant extent, the use of estimates and assumptions and the application of management’s judgment are described in Item 2, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations”, in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended February 25, 2018.
There have been no significant changes to such accounting policies during the 2018 fiscal year first quarter.
In May 2014, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Codification Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, which supersedes the revenue recognition requirements in ASC Topic 605, Revenue Recognition, including most industry-specific revenue recognition guidance throughout the Industry Topics of the Codification.
This guidance requires that an entity recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services, and expands the related disclosure requirements.
The new standard was originally scheduled to be effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016, including interim reporting periods within those fiscal years.
In August 2015, the FASB delayed the effective date of this guidance for one year.
With the delay, the new standard is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, and interim periods therein, with an option to adopt the standard on the originally scheduled effective date.
The Company has adopted the guidance effective February 26, 2018, the first day of the 2019 fiscal year, and the adoption of this guidance did not have an impact on its consolidated results of operations, cash flows, financial position and disclosures.
The Company is subject to a number of proceedings, lawsuits and other claims related to environmental, employment, product and other matters.
The Company is required to assess the likelihood of any adverse judgments or outcomes in these matters as well as potential ranges of probable losses.
A determination of the amount of reserves required, if any, for these contingencies is made after careful analysis of each individual issue.
The required reserves may change in the future due to new developments in each matter or changes in approach, such as a change in settlement strategy in dealing with these matters.
Factors That May Affect Future Results.
Certain portions of this Report which do not relate to historical financial information may be deemed to constitute forward-looking statements that are subject to various factors which could cause actual results to differ materially from the Company’s expectations or from results which might be projected, forecasted, estimated or budgeted by the Company in forward-looking statements.
Such factors include, but are not limited to, general conditions in the electronics and aerospace industries, the Company’s competitive position, the status of the Company’s relationships with its customers, economic conditions in international markets, the cost and availability of raw materials, transportation and utilities, and the various factors set forth under the caption “Factors That May Affect Future Results” in Item 1 and in Item 1A “Risk Factors” of the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended February 25, 2018.
