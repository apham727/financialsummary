Item 2.
Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.
Financial Overview
The Company's total net sales worldwide in the 13 weeks and 39 weeks ended November 26, 2017 were 1% and 4% lower, respectively, than in the 13 weeks and 39 weeks ended November 27, 2016 principally as a result of lower sales of the Company’s printed circuit materials in Asia and North America, partially offset by higher sales of the Company’s aerospace composite materials, structures and assemblies.
The Company’s total net sales worldwide in the 13 weeks ended November 26, 2017 were lower than such sales in the 13 weeks ended August 27, 2017 primarily as a result of lower sales of the Company’s printed circuit materials in the 13 weeks ended November 26, 2017.
The Company’s gross profit margins, measured as percentages of sales, decreased to 23.2% and 23.5%, respectively, in the 13 weeks and 39 weeks ended November 26, 2017 from 25.1% and 26.0%, respectively, in the 13 weeks and 39 weeks ended November 27, 2016.
The lower gross profit margin for the 13 weeks ended November 26, 2017 compared to the 13 weeks ended November 27, 2016 was due principally to operating inefficiencies in connection with the consolidation of the Company’s Nelco Products, Inc. and Neltec, Inc. electronics Business Units located in California and Arizona, respectively, partially offset by higher sales of the Company’s aerospace composite materials, structures and assemblies.
The lower gross profit margin for the 39 weeks ended November 26, 2017 compared to the 39 weeks ended November 27, 2016, was principally a result of lower sales and production levels of printed circuit materials products in Asia and North America, duplicate costs in connection with the consolidation of the Company’s Nelco Products, Inc. and Neltec, Inc. electronics Business Units, and the inefficiencies mentioned above, partially offset by higher sales of aerospace materials, structures and assemblies.
The Company’s earnings from operations and net earnings were 58% and 62% lower, respectively, in the 13 weeks ended November 26, 2017 compared to the 13 weeks ended November 27, 2016 primarily as a result of the aforementioned decrease in sales and reduction in gross profit margin, the restructuring charges recorded in the 13 weeks ended November 26, 2017 in connection with the consolidation of the Company’s Nelco Products, Inc. and Neltec, Inc. electronics Business Units, advisory fees of $190,000 and a higher effective tax rate compared to last year’s comparable period.
The Company’s earnings from operations and net earnings were 88% and 61% lower, respectively, in the 39 weeks ended November 26, 2017 than in last fiscal year’s comparable period primarily as a result of the restructuring charges related to the consolidation of the Company’s electronics Business Units and advisory fees mentioned above, a one-time litigation expense of $375,000, the aforementioned decrease in sales and reduction in the gross profit margin and a higher effective tax rate compared to last year’s comparable period.
The global markets for the Company’s products continue to be very difficult to forecast, and it is not clear to the Company what the demand for the Company’s products will be in the remainder of the 2018 fiscal year or beyond.
Net Sales
The Company’s total net sales worldwide in the 13 weeks ended November 26, 2017 decreased to $26.1 million from $26.5 million in the 13 weeks ended November 27, 2016 primarily as a result of lower sales of the Company’s printed circuit materials products in Asia and North America, partially offset by higher sales of the Company’s aerospace composite materials, structures and assemblies.
The Company’s total net sales worldwide in the 39 weeks ended November 26, 2017 decreased to $83.4 million from $87.0 million in the 39 weeks ended November 27, 2016 primarily as a result of lower sales of the Company’s printed circuit materials products in Asia and North America, partially offset by higher sales of the Company’s aerospace composite materials, structures and assemblies.
The Company’s total net sales of its aerospace composite materials, structures and assemblies products were $10.2 million and $30.3 million, respectively, in the 13 weeks and 39 weeks ended November 26, 2017, or 39% and 36%, respectively, of the Company’s total net sales worldwide in such periods, compared to $7.5 million and $24.0 million, respectively, in the 13 weeks and 39 weeks ended November 27, 2016, or 28% of the Company’s total net sales worldwide in each such periods.
The Company’s total net sales of its printed circuit materials products were $15.9 million and $53.1 million, respectively, in the 13 weeks and 39 weeks ended November 26, 2017, or 61% and 64%, respectively, of the Company’s total net sales worldwide in such periods, compared to $19.0 million and $63.0 million, respectively, in the 13 weeks and 39 weeks ended November 27, 2016, or 72% of the Company’s total net sales worldwide in each such periods.
The Company's foreign sales were $9.6 million and $33.4 million, respectively, during the 13 weeks and 39 weeks ended November 26, 2017, or 37% and 40%, respectively, of the Company's total net sales worldwide during such periods, compared with $13.4 million and $41.1 million, respectively, of foreign sales, or 51% and 47%, respectively, of total net sales worldwide during last fiscal year's comparable periods.
The Company’s foreign sales during the 13-week and 39-week periods ended November 26, 2017 decreased 28% and 19%, respectively, from the comparable 2016 fiscal year periods.
The decreases in the 13-week and 39-week periods were primarily due to the lower sales in Asia described above.
In the 13 weeks ended November 26, 2017, the Company’s sales in North America, Asia and Europe were 63%, 28% and 9%, respectively, of the Company’s total net sales worldwide compared to 49%, 41% and 10%, respectively, in the 13 weeks ended November 27, 2016.
In the 39 weeks ended November 26, 2017, the Company’s sales in North America, Asia and Europe were 60%, 32% and 8%, respectively, of the Company’s total net sales worldwide compared to 53%, 39% and 8%, respectively, in the 39 weeks ended November 27, 2016.
The Company’s sales in North America increased 27%, its sales in Asia decreased 32% and its sales in Europe decreased 15% in the 13-week period ended November 26, 2017 compared to the 13-week period ended November 27, 2016, and its sales in North America increased 9%, its sales in Asia decreased 21% and its sales in Europe decreased 10% in the 39-week period ended November 26, 2017 compared to the 39-week period ended November 27, 2016.
The decreases in Asia and Europe were primarily due to declines in the Company’s sales of printed circuit materials.
During the 13-week and 39-week periods ended November 26, 2017, total net sales worldwide of high performance printed circuit materials were 92% and 93%, respectively, of the Company’s total net sales worldwide of printed circuit materials compared to the 13-week and 39-week periods ended November 27, 2016, during which total net sales worldwide of high performance printed circuit materials were 94% and 93% respectively, of the Company’s total net sales worldwide of printed circuit materials.
Gross Profit
The Company’s gross profits in the 13 weeks and 39 weeks ended November 26, 2017 were lower than its gross profits in the prior year’s comparable periods, and the gross profits as percentages of sales for the Company’s worldwide operations in the 13 weeks and 39 weeks ended November 26, 2017 decreased to 23.2% and 23.5%, respectively, from 25.1% and 26.0%, respectively, in the 13 weeks and 39 weeks ended November 27, 2016.
The lower gross profit margin for the 13 weeks ended November 26, 2017 compared to the 13 weeks ended November 27, 2016 was principally due to the operating inefficiencies in connection with the consolidation of the Company’s Nelco Products, Inc. and Neltec, Inc. electronics Business Units located in California and Arizona, respectively.
The lower gross profit margin for the 39 weeks ended November 26, 2017 compared to the 39 weeks ended November 27, 2016 was principally a result of lower sales and production levels of printed circuit materials products in Asia and North America, duplicate costs incurred in connection with the consolidation of the Company’s Nelco Products, Inc. and Neltec, Inc. electronics Business Units and the duplicate costs mentioned above, partially offset by higher sales of aerospace materials, structures and assemblies.
Selling, General and Administrative Expenses
Selling, general and administrative expenses increased by $193,000 during the 13 weeks ended November 26, 2017, or by 4%, and decreased by $1,084,000 during the 39 weeks ended November 26, 2017, or by 7%, compared to last fiscal year's comparable periods, and these expenses, measured as percentages of sales, was 18.4% and 16.7%, respectively, in the 13 weeks and 39 weeks ended November 26, 2017 compared to 17.4% and 17.3%, respectively, in the 13 weeks and 39 weeks ended November 27, 2016.
The increase in such expenses during the 13 weeks ended November 26, 2017 were primarily the result of advisory fees of $190,000.
The decrease in such expenses during the 39 weeks ended November 26, 2017 was primarily the result of lower payroll, profit sharing and stock option expenses.
During the 39 weeks ended November 26, 2017, selling, general and administrative expenses included the advisory fees mentioned above and a one-time litigation expense of $375,000.
Selling, general and administrative expenses included stock option expenses of $234,000 and $709,000, respectively, for the 13 weeks and 39 weeks ended November 26, 2017, compared to stock option expenses of $264,000 and $968,000, respectively, for the 13 weeks and 39 weeks ended November 27, 2016.
Restructuring Charges
In the 13 weeks and 39 weeks ended November 26, 2017, the Company recorded pre-tax restructuring charges of $472,000 and $4,735,000, respectively, compared to $113,000 and $206,000, respectively, in the 13 weeks and 39 weeks ended November 27, 2016, in connection with the consolidation of the Company’s electronics Business Units in North America in the 2018 fiscal year and the closure, in a prior year, of its facility located in Newburgh, New York.
Earnings from Operations
For the reasons set forth above, the Company’s earnings from operations were $801,000 and $867,000, respectively, for the 13 weeks and 39 weeks ended November 26, 2017, which included the aforementioned restructuring charges of $472,000 and $4.7 million, respectively, and the $375,000 litigation expense in the 39-week period, compared to $1.9 million and $7.4 million, respectively, for the 13 weeks and 39 weeks ended November 27, 2016, which included the aforementioned restructuring charges of $113,000 and $206,000, respectively.
Interest Expense
Interest expense in the 13 weeks and 39 weeks ended November 26, 2017 related to the Company’s borrowings under the three-year revolving credit facility agreement that the Company entered into with HSBC Bank in the fourth quarter of the 2016 fiscal year.
The agreement provided for an interest rate on the outstanding loan balance of LIBOR plus 1.15% to 2.65%.
Other interest rate options are were available to the Company under the agreement.
On January 3, 2018 the company voluntarily prepaid the remaining loan balance of $68.5 million.
See “Liquidity and Capital Resources” elsewhere in this Item 2 and Note 5 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Report for additional information.
Interest and Other Income
Interest income was $734,000 and $2.2 million, respectively, for the 13 weeks and 39 weeks ended November 26, 2017 compared to $430,000 and $1.2 million, respectively, for last fiscal year's comparable periods.
Interest income increased 71% and 90%, respectively, for the 13 weeks and 39 weeks ended November 26, 2017 primarily as a result of higher weighted average interest rates and larger average balances of marketable securities held by the Company in the 13 weeks and 39 weeks ended November 26, 2017, compared to last fiscal year's comparable periods.
During the 39 weeks ended November 26, 2017, the Company earned interest income principally from its investments, which consisted primarily of short-term instruments and money market funds.
Income Tax Provision
The Company's effective income tax rates for the 13 weeks and 39 weeks ended November 26, 2017 were 15.4% and negative 102.5%, respectively, compared to 6.4% and 10.0%, respectively, for the 13 weeks and 39 weeks ended November 27, 2016.
The differences in effective tax rates were primarily due to the benefit from high restructuring charges in the 13 weeks and 39 weeks ended November 26, 2017 and the benefit from the reversal of a $688,000 tax reserve in the 13 weeks ended May 28, 2017 related to certain foreign tax deductions taken in prior years.
Net Earnings
For the reasons set forth above, the Company's net earnings for the 13 weeks and 39 weeks ended November 26, 2017 were $716,000 and $2.6 million, respectively, including the pre-tax restructuring charges, described above, compared to net earnings of $1.9 million and $6.8 million, respectively, for the 13 weeks and 39 weeks ended November 27, 2016, including the pre-tax restructuring charges described above.
Basic and Diluted Earnings Per Share
In the 13 weeks and 39 weeks ended November 26, 2017, basic and diluted earnings per share were $0.04 and $0.13, respectively, including, in both such periods, the restructuring charges, litigation expense and advisory fees described above.
This compared to basic and diluted earnings per share of $0.09 and $0.34 in the 13 weeks and 39 weeks ended November 27, 2016, respectively, including, in both such periods, the restructuring charges described above.
The net impact of the restructuring charges, litigation and advisory fees described above reduced basic and diluted earnings per share by $0.02 and $0.16, respectively, in the 13 weeks and 39 weeks ended November 26, 2017.
Cash and Marketable Securities
Of the $241.8 million of cash and cash equivalents, marketable securities and restricted cash at November 26, 2017, $233.0 million was owned by certain of the Company’s wholly owned foreign subsidiaries.
The Company believes it has sufficient liquidity to fund its operating activities through the next 12 months and for the foreseeable future thereafter after giving consideration to the repayment of the Company’s debt in January 2018, payment of income taxes on repatriated foreign earnings in January 2018 and the expected payment of a special dividend in February 2018.
●
accounts receivable decreased by 5% at November 26, 2017 compared to February 26, 2017 primarily due to lower sales in the quarter ended November 26, 2017 than in the fourth quarter of the 2017 fiscal year;
●
inventories increased by 3% at November 26, 2017 compared to February 26, 2017 primarily due to an increase in raw materials;
    ●   prepaid expenses increased by 9% at November 26, 2017 compared to February 26, 2017 primarily due to an increase in accrued interest on our marketable securities;
●
accounts payable decreased by 18% at November 26, 2017 compared to February 26, 2017 primarily due to the timing of vendor payments and raw material purchases from suppliers;
    ●   accrued liabilities increased by 94% at November 26, 2017 compared to February 26, 2017 primarily due to the accrual of restructuring costs related to the consolidation of the Company’s Nelco Products, Inc. Electronics Business Unit in California and its Neltec, Inc. Electronics Business Unit in Arizona; and
●
income taxes payable decreased by 80% at November 26, 2017 compared to February 26, 2017 primarily due to income tax payments made during the 39 weeks ended November 26, 2017.
In addition, the Company paid $6.1 million in cash dividends in each of the 39-week periods ended November 26, 2017 and November 27, 2016.
During the 39 weeks ended November 26, 2017, the Company also made $2.75 million of principal payments on its long-term debt.
Working Capital
The decrease in working capital at November 26, 2017 compared to February 26, 2017 was due principally to the increase in accrued liabilities and the decreases in accounts receivable, cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities, partially offset by increases in inventories and prepaid expenses and other current assets, and decreases in income taxes payable, accounts payable and the current portion of long-term debt.
The Company's current ratio (the ratio of current assets to current liabilities) was 19.2 to 1 at November 26, 2017 compared to 19.1 to 1 at February 26, 2017.
Cash Flows
During the 39 weeks ended November 26, 2017, the Company's net earnings, before depreciation and amortization, stock-based compensation, amortization of bond premium and changes in operating assets and liabilities, were $5.0 million.
During the same 39 week period, the Company expended $703,000 for the purchase of property, plant and equipment, compared with $194,000 during the 39 weeks ended November 27, 2016.
The Company paid $6.1 million in cash dividends in each of the 39-week periods ended November 26, 2017 and November 27, 2016.
Debt
At November 26, 2017 and February 26, 2017, the Company had $69.3 million and $72.0 million of bank debt, respectively.
In the fourth quarter of the 2016 fiscal year, the Company entered into a three-year revolving credit facility agreement (the “Credit Agreement”) with HSBC Bank.
The Credit Agreement provided for loans up to $75.0 million to the Company and letters of credit up to $2.0 million for the account of the Company, and subject to the terms and conditions of the Credit Agreement, an interest rate on the outstanding loan balance of LIBOR plus 1.15% to LIBOR plus 2.65%.
The Credit Agreement contained certain customary affirmative and negative covenants and customary financial covenants.
On January 3, 2018 the company voluntarily prepaid the remaining loan balance of $68,500 and terminated the Credit Agreement.
For additional information, see Note 5 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Report.
Other Liquidity Factors
The Company believes its financial resources will be sufficient, through the next 12 months and for the foreseeable future thereafter, to provide for continued investment in working capital and property, plant and equipment and for general corporate purposes after giving consideration to the repayment of the Company’s debt in January 2018, payment of income taxes on repatriated foreign earnings in January 2018 and the expected payment of a special dividend in February 2018.
The Company’s financial resources are also available for purchases of the Company's common stock, appropriate acquisitions and other expansions of the Company's business.
The Company is not aware of any circumstances or events that are reasonably likely to occur that could materially affect its liquidity.
The Company's contractual obligations and other commercial commitments to make future payments under contracts, such as lease agreements, consist only of (i) operating lease commitments and (ii) commitments to purchase raw materials.
The Company has no other long-term debt, capital lease obligations, unconditional purchase obligations or other long-term obligations, standby letters of credit, guarantees, standby repurchase obligations or other commercial commitments or contingent commitments, other than two standby letters of credit in the total amount of $1.0 million to secure the Company's obligations under its workers' compensation insurance program.
The Company's liquidity is not dependent on the use of, and the Company is not engaged in, any off-balance sheet financing arrangements, such as securitization of receivables or obtaining access to assets through special purpose entities.
The foregoing Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations is based upon the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.
The preparation of these Consolidated Financial Statements requires the Company to make estimates, assumptions and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses and the related disclosure of contingent liabilities.
On an ongoing basis, the Company evaluates its estimates, including those related to sales allowances, allowances for doubtful accounts, inventories, valuation of long-lived assets, income taxes, contingencies and litigation, and employee benefit programs.
The Company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources.
Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.
The Company’s critical accounting policies that are important to the Consolidated Financial Statements and that entail, to a significant extent, the use of estimates and assumptions and the application of management’s judgment are described in Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations”, in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended February 26, 2017.
There have been no significant changes to such accounting policies during the 2018 fiscal year third quarter.
In May 2014, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, which supersedes the revenue recognition requirements in ASC Topic 605, Revenue Recognition, including most industry-specific revenue recognition guidance throughout the Industry Topics of the Codification.
This guidance requires that an entity recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services, and expands the related disclosure requirements.
The new standard was originally scheduled to be effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016, including interim reporting periods within those fiscal years.
In August 2015, the FASB delayed the effective date of this guidance for one year.
With the delay, the new standard is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, and interim periods therein, with an option to adopt the standard on the originally scheduled effective date.
The Company has concluded that this new guidance will not have a significant impact on its consolidated results of operations, cash flows, financial position and disclosures.
The Company is subject to a number of proceedings, lawsuits and other claims related to environmental, employment, product and other matters.
The Company is required to assess the likelihood of any adverse judgments or outcomes in these matters as well as potential ranges of probable losses.
A determination of the amount of reserves required, if any, for these contingencies is made after careful analysis of each individual issue.
The required reserves may change in the future due to new developments in each matter or changes in approach, such as a change in settlement strategy in dealing with these matters.
Factors That May Affect Future Results.
Certain portions of this Report which do not relate to historical financial information may be deemed to constitute forward-looking statements that are subject to various factors which could cause actual results to differ materially from the Company’s expectations or from results which might be projected, forecast, estimated or budgeted by the Company in forward-looking statements.
Such factors include, but are not limited to, general conditions in the electronics and aerospace industries, the Company's competitive position, the status of the Company's relationships with its customers, economic conditions in international markets, the cost and availability of raw materials, transportation and utilities, and the various factors set forth in Item 1A “Risk Factors” and under the caption "Factors That May Affect Future Results" after Item 7 of the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended February 26, 2017.
