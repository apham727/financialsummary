Financial Overview 



The Company's total net sales from continuing operations in the 13 weeks and 39 weeks ended November 25, 2018 were $12.9 million and $34.5 million, respectively, compared to $10.2 million and $30.3 million in the 13 weeks and 39 weeks ended November 26, 2017, respectively. 



The Company’s gross profit margins from continuing operations, measured as percentages of sales, were 33.3% and 29.8%, respectively, in the 13 weeks and 39 weeks ended November 25, 2018 compared to 29.0% and 27.9%, respectively, in the 13 weeks and 39 weeks ended November 26, 2017. 



The Company’s earnings from continuing operations and net earnings from continuing operations were 405% and 504% higher, respectively, in the 13 weeks ended November 25, 2018 compared to the 13 weeks ended November 26, 2017 and 219% and 270% higher, respectively, in the 39 weeks ended November 25, 2018 than in last fiscal year’s comparable period primarily as a result of higher sales, higher net interest income due to the elimination of interest expense as a result of the Company’s voluntary prepayment of long-term debt and a lower tax provision compared to last year’s comparable periods. 



The Company has a number of long-term contracts pursuant to which certain of its customers, some of which represent a substantial portion of the Company’s revenue, place orders. Long-term contracts with the Company’s customers are primarily requirements based and do not guarantee quantities. An order forecast is generally agreed concurrently with pricing for any applicable long-term contract. This order forecast is then typically updated periodically during the term of the underlying contract. Purchase orders generally are received in excess of three months in advance of delivery. 











Net Sales 



The Company’s total net sales from continuing operations worldwide in the 13 weeks ended November 25, 2018 increased to $12.9 million from $10.2 million in the 13 weeks ended November 26, 2017. The Company’s total net sales from continuing operations worldwide in the 39 weeks ended November 25, 2018 increased to $34.5 million from $30.3 million in the 39 weeks ended November 26, 2017. The increase in sales was due to the ramping up of programs on which the Company’s materials are qualified. 



Gross Profit 



The Company’s gross profit from continuing operations in the 13 weeks ended November 25, 2018 was higher than its gross profit from continuing operations in the prior year’s comparable period, and the gross profit from continuing operations as a percentage of sales for the Company’s worldwide operations in the 13 weeks ended November 25, 2018 increased to 33.3% from 29.0% in the 13 weeks ended November 26, 2017. The Company’s gross profit from continuing operations in the 39 weeks ended November 25, 2018 was higher than its gross profit from continuing operations in the prior year’s comparable period, and the gross profit from continuing operations as a percentage of sales for the Company’s worldwide operations in the 39 weeks ended November 25, 2018 increased to 29.8% from 27.9% in the 39 weeks ended November 26, 2017. The higher gross profit margins from continuing operations for the 13 weeks and 39 weeks ended November 25, 2018 compared to the 13 weeks and 39 weeks ended November 26, 2017 were principally a result of higher sales, reduced salaried headcount, primarily through attrition, and the partially fixed nature of overhead expenses in the 13 weeks and 39 weeks ended November 25, 2018 compared to the 13 weeks and 39 weeks ended November 26, 2017. 





Selling, General and Administrative Expenses 



Selling, general and administrative expenses from continuing operations decreased by $526,000 during the 13 weeks ended November 25, 2018, or by 21%, and decreased by $989,000 during the 39 weeks ended November 25, 2018, or by 14%, compared to last fiscal year's comparable periods, and these expenses, measured as percentages of sales from continuing operations, were 15.4% and 18.0%, respectively, in the 13 weeks and 39 weeks ended November 25, 2018 compared to 24.5% and 23.7%, respectively, in the 13 weeks and 39 weeks ended November 26, 2017. The decreases in such expenses during the 13 weeks and 39 weeks ended November 25, 2018 were primarily the result of lower payroll, travel and entertainment and stock option expenses. 



Selling, general and administrative expenses from continuing operations included stock option expenses of $194,000 and $594,000, respectively, for the 13 weeks and 39 weeks ended November 25, 2018, compared to stock option expenses of $234,000 and $709,000, respectively, for the 13 weeks and 39 weeks ended November 26, 2017. 



Earnings from Continuing Operations 



For the reasons set forth above, the Company’s earnings from continuing operations were $2.3 million and $4.1 million, respectively, for the 13 weeks and 39 weeks ended November 25, 2018 compared to $0.5 million and $1.3 million, respectively, for the 13 weeks and 39 weeks ended November 26, 2017. 



Interest Expense 



Interest expense in the 13 weeks and 39 weeks ended November 26, 2017 related to the Company’s borrowings under the three-year revolving credit facility agreement that the Company entered into with HSBC Bank in the fourth quarter of the 2017 fiscal year. The agreement provided for an interest rate on the outstanding loan balance of LIBOR plus 1.15% to 2.65%. Other interest rate options were available to the Company under the agreement. On January 3, 2018, the Company voluntarily prepaid the remaining loan balance of $68.5 million. See “Liquidity and Capital Resources” elsewhere in this Item 2 and Note 5 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements elsewhere in this Report for additional information. 



Interest and Other Income 



Interest and other income from continuing operations was $393,000 and $1.1 million, respectively, for the 13 weeks and 39 weeks ended November 25, 2018, compared to $734,000 and $2.2 million, respectively, for last fiscal year's comparable periods. Interest income decreased 46% and 51%, respectively, for the 13 weeks and 39 weeks ended November 25, 2018 primarily as a result of lower average balances of marketable securities held by the Company in the 13 weeks and 39 weeks ended November 25, 2018, compared to last fiscal year's comparable periods, partially offset by higher weighted average interest rates. During the 39 weeks ended November 25, 2018, the Company earned interest income principally from its investments, which consisted primarily of short-term instruments and money market funds. 





Income Tax Provision 



The Company's effective income tax rates from continuing operations for the 13 weeks and 39 weeks ended November 25, 2018 were 22.9% and 8.8%, respectively, compared to 31.3% and 25.6%, respectively, for the 13 weeks and 39 weeks ended November 26, 2017. Tax rates during fiscal year 2019 benefitted from lower U.S. federal tax rates pertaining to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act enacted in December 2017. The low effective income tax rate in the 2019 fiscal year 39-week period was due to a tax benefit of $788,000 related to clarifying regulations pertaining to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act enacted in December 2017. 



Net Earnings from Continuing Operations 



For the reasons set forth above, the Company's net earnings from continuing operations for the 13 weeks and 39 weeks ended November 25, 2018 were $2.1 million and $4.7 million, respectively, compared to net earnings of $344,000 and $1.3 million, respectively, for the 13 weeks and 39 weeks ended November 26, 2017. 



Discontinued Operations 



On July 25, 2018, the Company entered into a definitive agreement to sell its Electronics Business for $145.0 million in cash. The Company completed this transaction on December 4, 2018. 



The operating results of the Electronics Business are classified, together with certain costs related to the transaction, as discontinued operations, net of tax, in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. 



The Company’s net earnings from discontinued operations were higher in the 13 weeks ended November 25, 2018 compared to the 13 weeks ended November 26, 2017 primarily as a result of lower restructuring charges and a gain of $2,945 realized on the sale of its New England Laminates Co., Inc. facility located in Newburgh, New York. The Company’s net earnings from discontinued operations were higher in the 39-week period ended November 25, 2018 than in last fiscal year’s comparable period, primarily as a result of lower restructuring charges and higher sales, compared to last year’s comparable period, and a one-time litigation expense of $375,000 in the 39-week period ended November 26, 2017. 



During the 2018 fiscal year, the Company consolidated its Nelco Products, Inc. Electronics Business Unit located in Fullerton, California and its Neltec, Inc. Electronics Business Unit located in Tempe, Arizona. The restructuring expenses were $61,000 and $231,000 during the 13-week and 39-week periods ended November 25, 2018, respectively, and $360,000 and $4.4 million during the 13-week and 39-week periods ended November 26, 2017, respectively. 



Basic and Diluted Earnings Per Share 



In the 13 weeks and 39 weeks ended November 25, 2018, basic and diluted earnings per share from continuing operations were $0.10 and $0.23, respectively, including, in both such periods, the tax benefit described above. This compared to basic and diluted earnings per share from continuing operations of $0.02 and $0.06 in the 13 weeks and 39 weeks ended November 26, 2017, respectively. The net impact of the tax benefit described above increased basic and diluted earnings per share by $0.04 the 39 weeks ended November 25, 2018. 











Cash and Marketable Securities 



Of the $112.4 million of cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities at November 25, 2018, $3.7 million was owned by certain of the Company’s wholly owned foreign subsidiaries. 





●   



accounts receivable decreased by 16% at November 25, 2018 compared to February 25, 2018 primarily due to a decrease in days outstanding in the quarter ended November 25, 2018 compared to the fourth quarter of the 2018 fiscal year;    



●  inventories increased by 16% at November 25, 2018 compared to February 25, 2018 primarily due to higher sales compared to the fourth quarter of the 2018 fiscal year and higher projected sales in the fourth quarter of the 2019 fiscal year;    



●   



accounts payable decreased by 6% at November 25, 2018 compared to February 25, 2018 primarily due to the timing of vendor payments and raw material purchases from suppliers;    



●   



accrued liabilities increased by 43% at November 25, 2018 compared to February 25, 2018 primarily due to increases in travel and entertainment and shutdown accruals offset by lower professional fee accruals; and    



●   



income taxes payable decreased by 8% at November 25, 2018 compared to February 25, 2018 primarily due to income tax payments made during the 39 weeks ended November 25, 2018.    



In addition, the Company paid $6.1 million in cash dividends in each of the 39-week periods ended November 25, 2018 and November 26, 2017. 





Working Capital 



The decrease in working capital at November 25, 2018 compared to February 25, 2018 was due principally to the decrease in accounts receivable, partially offset by the increase in inventories and the decrease in accounts payable. 



The Company's current ratio (the ratio of current assets to current liabilities) was 26.4 to 1.0 at November 25, 2018 compared to 28.0 to 1.0 at February 25, 2018. 



Cash Flows 



During the 39 weeks ended November 25, 2018, the Company's net earnings, before depreciation and amortization, stock-based compensation, amortization of bond premium and changes in operating assets and liabilities, were $5.2 million. During the same 39-week period, the Company expended $399,000 for the purchase of property, plant and equipment, compared with $428,000 during the 39 weeks ended November 26, 2017. The Company paid $6.1 million in cash dividends in each of the 39-week periods ended November 25, 2018 and November 26, 2017. 



Other Liquidity Factors 



The Company believes its financial resources will be sufficient, through the 12 months following the filing of this Form 10-Q Quarterly Report and for the foreseeable future thereafter, to provide for continued investment in working capital and property, plant and equipment and for general corporate purposes. The Company’s financial resources are also available for purchases of the Company's common stock, appropriate acquisitions and other expansions of the Company's business including the recently announced expansion in Kansas. 



The Company is not aware of any circumstances or events that are reasonably likely to occur that could materially affect its liquidity. 









Working Capital 



The increase in working capital at November 25, 2018 compared to February 25, 2018 was due principally to the increase in inventory levels. 





The Company's current ratio (the ratio of current assets to current liabilities) was 2.4 to 1.0 at November 25, 2018 compared to 2.6 to 1.0 at February 25, 2018. 



Cash Flows 



During the 39 weeks ended November 25, 2018, the Company's net earnings, before depreciation and amortization, stock-based compensation, amortization of bond premium and changes in operating assets and liabilities, were $5.7 million. During the same 39-week period, the Company expended $158,000 for the purchase of property, plant and equipment, compared with $275,000 during the 39 weeks ended November 26, 2017. 





The Company's contractual obligations and other commercial commitments to make future payments under contracts, such as lease agreements, consist only of (i) operating lease commitments and (ii) commitments to purchase raw materials. The Company has no other long-term debt, capital lease obligations, unconditional purchase obligations or other long-term obligations, standby letters of credit, guarantees, standby repurchase obligations or other commercial commitments or contingent commitments, other than two standby letters of credit in the total amount of $980,000 to secure the Company's obligations under its workers' compensation insurance program. 





The Company's liquidity is not dependent on the use of, and the Company is not engaged in, any off-balance sheet financing arrangements, such as securitization of receivables or obtaining access to assets through special purpose entities. 





The foregoing Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations is based upon the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. The preparation of these Consolidated Financial Statements requires the Company to make estimates, assumptions and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses and the related disclosure of contingent liabilities as well as the reporting requirements of continuing and discontinued operations. On an ongoing basis, the Company evaluates its estimates, including those related to sales allowances, allowances for doubtful accounts, inventories, valuation of long-lived assets, income taxes, contingencies and litigation, and employee benefit programs. The Company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. 



The Company’s critical accounting policies that are important to the Consolidated Financial Statements and that entail, to a significant extent, the use of estimates and assumptions and the application of management’s judgment are described in Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations”, in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended February 25, 2018. There have been no significant changes to such accounting policies during the 2019 fiscal year third quarter. 





In May 2014, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, which supersedes the revenue recognition requirements in ASC Topic 605, Revenue Recognition, including most industry-specific revenue recognition guidance throughout the Industry Topics of the Codification. This guidance requires that an entity recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services, and expands the related disclosure requirements. The new standard was originally scheduled to be effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim reporting periods within those fiscal years. In August 2015, the FASB delayed the effective date of this guidance for one year. With the delay, the new standard is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018 and the interim periods within those fiscal years, with an option to adopt the standard on the originally scheduled effective date. The Company has adopted the guidance effective February 26, 2018, the first day of the 2019 fiscal year, and the adoption of this guidance did not impact its consolidated results of operations, cash flows, financial position or disclosures. 





The Company is subject to a number of proceedings, lawsuits and other claims related to environmental, employment, product and other matters. The Company is required to assess the likelihood of any adverse judgments or outcomes in these matters as well as potential ranges of probable losses. A determination of the amount of reserves required, if any, for these contingencies is made after careful analysis of each individual issue. The required reserves may change in the future due to new developments in each matter or changes in approach, such as a change in settlement strategy in dealing with these matters. 



Factors That May Affect Future Results. 



Certain portions of this Report which do not relate to historical financial information may be deemed to constitute forward-looking statements that are subject to various factors which could cause actual results to differ materially from the Company’s expectations or from results which might be projected, forecasted, estimated or budgeted by the Company in forward-looking statements. Such factors include, but are not limited to, general conditions in the electronics and aerospace industries, the Company’s competitive position, the status of the Company’s relationships with its customers, economic conditions in international markets, the cost and availability of raw materials, transportation and utilities, and the various factors set forth under the caption “Factors That May Affect Future Results” in Item 1 and in Item 1A “Risk Factors” of the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended February 25, 2018.
