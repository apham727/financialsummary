The Company’s gross profit margins from continuing operations, measured as percentages of sales, were 28.1% and 27.8%, respectively, in the 13 weeks and 26 weeks ended August 26, 2018 compared to 28.3% and 27.4%, respectively, in the 13 weeks and 26 weeks ended August 27, 2017.
The Company’s earnings from continuing operations and net earnings from continuing operations were 6% and 112% higher, respectively, in the 13 weeks ended August 26, 2018 compared to the 13 weeks ended August 27, 2017 primarily as a result of higher net interest income due to the elimination of interest expense as a result of the voluntary prepayment of long-term debt and a lower tax provision compared to last year’s comparable period.
The Company’s earnings from continuing operations and net earnings from continuing operations were 116% and 184% higher, respectively, in the 26 weeks ended August 26, 2018 than in last fiscal year’s comparable period primarily as a result of higher sales, higher net interest income due to the elimination of interest expense as a result of the voluntary prepayment of long-term debt and a lower tax provision compared to last year’s comparable period.
The Company has a limited number of long-term contracts.
Long-term contracts are primarily requirements based and do not guarantee quantities.
Orders are typically received one to three months in advance of delivery.
Net Sales 

The Company’s total net sales from continuing operations worldwide in the 13 weeks ended August 26, 2018 decreased to $11.2 million from $11.4 million in the 13 weeks ended August 27, 2017.
The Company’s total net sales from continuing operations worldwide in the 26 weeks ended August 26, 2018 increased to $21.6 million from $20.1 million in the 26 weeks ended August 27, 2017.
Gross Profit 

The Company’s gross profit from continuing operations in the 13 weeks ended August 26, 2018 was lower than its gross profit from continuing operations in the prior year’s comparable period, and the gross profit from continuing operations as a percentage of sales for the Company’s worldwide operations in the 13 weeks ended August 26, 2018 decreased to 28.1% from 28.3% in the 13 weeks ended August 27, 2017.
The Company’s gross profit from continuing operations in the 26 weeks ended August 26, 2018 was higher than its gross profit from continuing operations in the prior year’s comparable period, and the gross profit from continuing operations as a percentage of sales for the Company’s worldwide operations in the 26 weeks ended August 26, 2018 increased to 27.8% from 27.4% in the 26 weeks ended August 27, 2017.
The lower gross profit margin from continuing operations for the 13 weeks ended August 26, 2018 compared to the 13 weeks ended August 27, 2017 was principally due to the lower sales in the 13 weeks ended August 26, 2018 compared to the 13 weeks ended August 27, 2017.
The higher gross profit margin from continuing operations for the 26 weeks ended August 26, 2018 compared to the 26 weeks ended August 27, 2017 was principally a result of higher sales in the 26 weeks ended August 26, 2018 compared to the 26 weeks ended August 27, 2017.
Selling, General and Administrative Expenses 

Selling, general and administrative expenses from continuing operations decreased by $124,000 during the 13 weeks ended August 26, 2018, or by 6%, and decreased by $463,000 during the 26 weeks ended August 26, 2018, or by 10%, compared to last fiscal year's comparable periods, and these expenses, measured as percentages of sales from continuing operations, were 18.9% and 19.5%, respectively, in the 13 weeks and 26 weeks ended August 26, 2018 compared to 19.7% and 23.3%, respectively, in the 13 weeks and 26 weeks ended August 27, 2017.
The decreases in such expenses during the 13 weeks and 26 weeks ended August 26, 2018 were primarily the result of lower payroll, tradeshow and stock option expenses.
Selling, general and administrative expenses from continuing operations included stock option expenses of $199,000 and $400,000, respectively, for the 13 weeks and 26 weeks ended August 26, 2018, compared to stock option expenses of $235,000 and $475,000, respectively, for the 13 weeks and 26 weeks ended August 27, 2017.
Earnings from Operations 

For the reasons set forth above, the Company’s earnings from continuing operations were $1.0 million and $1.8 million, respectively, for the 13 weeks and 26 weeks ended August 26, 2018 compared to $1.0 million and $0.8 million, respectively, for the 13 weeks and 26 weeks ended August 27, 2017.
Interest Expense 

Interest expense in the 13 weeks and 26 weeks ended August 27, 2017 related to the Company’s borrowings under the three-year revolving credit facility agreement that the Company entered into with HSBC Bank in the fourth quarter of the 2017 fiscal year.
The agreement provided for an interest rate on the outstanding loan balance of LIBOR plus 1.15% to 2.65%.
Other interest rate options were available to the Company under the agreement.
On January 3, 2018, the Company voluntarily prepaid the remaining loan balance of $68.5 million.
See “Liquidity and Capital Resources” elsewhere in this Item 2 and Note 5 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements elsewhere in this Report for additional information.
Interest and Other Income 

Interest and other income from continuing operations was $357,000 and $697,000, respectively, for the 13 weeks and 26 weeks ended August 26, 2018, compared to $751,000 and $1.5 million, respectively, for last fiscal year's comparable periods.
Interest income decreased 52% and 54%, respectively, for the 13 weeks and 26 weeks ended August 26, 2018 primarily as a result of lower average balances of marketable securities held by the Company in the 13 weeks and 26 weeks ended August 26, 2018, compared to last fiscal year's comparable periods, partially offset by higher weighted average interest rates.
During the 26 weeks ended August 26, 2018, the Company earned interest income principally from its investments, which consisted primarily of short-term instruments and money market funds.
Income Tax Provision 

The Company's effective income tax rates from continuing operations for the 13 weeks and 26 weeks ended August 26, 2018 were negative 31.6% and negative 6.6%, respectively, compared to 23.0% and 23.2%, respectively, for the 13 weeks and 26 weeks ended August 27, 2017.
The negative effective income tax rates in the 2019 fiscal year periods were due to a tax benefit of $788,000 related to clarifying regulations pertaining to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act enacted in December 2017.
Discontinued Operations 

On July 25, 2018, the Company entered into a definitive agreement to sell its Electronics Business for $145.0 million in cash.
The Company expects this transaction to be completed in the fourth quarter of the 2019 fiscal year.
The operating results of the Electronics Business are classified, together with certain costs related to the transaction, as discontinued operations, net of tax, in the Consolidated Statement of Operations.
The Company’s net earnings from discontinued operations were higher in the 13 weeks ended August 26, 2018 compared to the 13 weeks ended August 27, 2017 primarily as a result of lower restructuring charges, partially offset by lower sales, compared to last year’s comparable period.
The Company’s net earnings from discontinued operations were higher in the 26-week period ended August 26, 2018 than in last fiscal year’s comparable period, primarily as a result of lower restructuring charges and higher sales, compared to last year’s comparable period, and a one-time litigation expense of $375,000 in the 26-week period ended August 27, 2017.
During the 2018 fiscal year, the Company consolidated its Nelco Products, Inc. Electronics Business Unit located in Fullerton, California and its Neltec, Inc. Electronics Business Unit located in Tempe, Arizona.
The restructuring expenses were $117,000 and $169,000 during the 13-week and 26-week periods ended August 26, 2018, respectively, and $2.8 million and $4.1 million during the 13-week and 26-week periods ended August 27, 2017, respectively.
Net Earnings 

For the reasons set forth above, the Company's net earnings from continuing operations for the 13 weeks and 26 weeks ended August 26, 2018 were $1.8 million and $2.6 million, respectively, compared to net earnings of $859,000 and $931,000, respectively, for the 13 weeks and 26 weeks ended August 27, 2017.
Basic and Diluted Earnings Per Share 

In the 13 weeks and 26 weeks ended August 26, 2018, basic and diluted earnings per share were $0.09 and $0.13, respectively, including, in both such periods, the tax benefit described above.
This compared to basic and diluted earnings per share of $0.04 and $0.05 in the 13 weeks and 26 weeks ended August 27, 2017, respectively.
The net impact of the tax benefit described above increased basic and diluted earnings per share by $0.04 in each of the 13 weeks and 26 weeks ended August 26, 2018.
Cash and Marketable Securities 

Of the $108.3 million of cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities at August 26, 2018, $107.0 million was owned by certain of the Company’s wholly owned foreign subsidiaries.
●   

accounts receivable decreased by 16% at August 26, 2018 compared to February 25, 2018 primarily due to lower sales in the quarter ended August 26, 2018 than in the fourth quarter of the 2018 fiscal year;    

●   

prepaid expenses increased by 7% at August 26, 2018 compared to February 25, 2018 primarily due to an increase in accrued interest on our marketable securities;    

●   

accounts payable decreased by 40% at August 26, 2018 compared to February 25, 2018 primarily due to the timing of vendor payments and raw material purchases from suppliers;    

●   

accrued liabilities increased by 8% at August 26, 2018 compared to February 25, 2018 primarily due to increases in payroll and shutdown accruals offset by lower professional fee accruals; and     

●   

income taxes payable decreased by 8% at August 26, 2018 compared to February 25, 2018 primarily due to income tax payments made during the 26 weeks ended August 26, 2018.
In addition, the Company paid $4.0 million in cash dividends in each of the 26-week periods ended August 26, 2018 and August 27, 2017.
Working Capital 

The decrease in working capital at August 26, 2018 compared to February 25, 2018 was due principally to the decrease in accounts receivable, partially offset by the decrease in accounts payable.
The Company's current ratio (the ratio of current assets to current liabilities) was 32.7 to 1.0 at August 26, 2018 compared to 28.0 to 1.0 at February 25, 2018.
Cash Flows 

During the 26 weeks ended August 26, 2018, the Company's net earnings, before depreciation and amortization, stock-based compensation, amortization of bond premium and changes in operating assets and liabilities, were $1.6 million.
During the same 26 week period, the Company expended $170,000 for the purchase of property, plant and equipment, compared with $365,000 during the 26 weeks ended August 27, 2017.
The Company paid $4.0 million in cash dividends in each of the 26-week periods ended August 26, 2018 and August 27, 2017.
Other Liquidity Factors 

The Company believes its financial resources will be sufficient, through the 12 months following the filing of this Form 10-Q Quarterly Report and for the foreseeable future thereafter, to provide for continued investment in working capital and property, plant and equipment and for general corporate purposes.
The Company’s financial resources are also available for purchases of the Company's common stock, appropriate acquisitions and other expansions of the Company's business.
The Company is not aware of any circumstances or events that are reasonably likely to occur that could materially affect its liquidity.
Working Capital  

The increase in working capital at August 26, 2018 compared to February 25, 2018 was due principally to the increase in inventory levels.
The Company's current ratio (the ratio of current assets to current liabilities) was 2.8 to 1.0 at August 26, 2018 compared to 2.6 to 1.0 at February 25, 2018.
Cash Flows 

During the 26 weeks ended August 26, 2018, the Company's net earnings, before depreciation and amortization, stock-based compensation, amortization of bond premium and changes in operating assets and liabilities, were $1.8 million.
During the same 26 week period, the Company expended $23,000 for the purchase of property, plant and equipment, compared with $135,000 during the 26 weeks ended August 27, 2017.
The Company's contractual obligations and other commercial commitments to make future payments under contracts, such as lease agreements, consist only of (i) operating lease commitments and (ii) commitments to purchase raw materials.
The Company has no other long-term debt, capital lease obligations, unconditional purchase obligations or other long-term obligations, standby letters of credit, guarantees, standby repurchase obligations or other commercial commitments or contingent commitments, other than two standby letters of credit in the total amount of $980,000 to secure the Company's obligations under its workers' compensation insurance program.
The Company's liquidity is not dependent on the use of, and the Company is not engaged in, any off-balance sheet financing arrangements, such as securitization of receivables or obtaining access to assets through special purpose entities.
The foregoing Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations is based upon the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.
The preparation of these Consolidated Financial Statements requires the Company to make estimates, assumptions and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses and the related disclosure of contingent liabilities as well as the reporting requirements of continuing and discontinued operations.
On an ongoing basis, the Company evaluates its estimates, including those related to sales allowances, allowances for doubtful accounts, inventories, valuation of long-lived assets, income taxes, contingencies and litigation, and employee benefit programs.
The Company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources.
Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.
The Company’s critical accounting policies that are important to the Consolidated Financial Statements and that entail, to a significant extent, the use of estimates and assumptions and the application of management’s judgment are described in Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations”, in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended February 25, 2018.
There have been no significant changes to such accounting policies during the 2019 fiscal year second quarter.
In May 2014, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, which supersedes the revenue recognition requirements in ASC Topic 605, Revenue Recognition, including most industry-specific revenue recognition guidance throughout the Industry Topics of the Codification.
This guidance requires that an entity recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services, and expands the related disclosure requirements.
The new standard was originally scheduled to be effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim reporting periods within those fiscal years.
In August 2015, the FASB delayed the effective date of this guidance for one year.
With the delay, the new standard is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018 and the interim periods within those fiscal years, with an option to adopt the standard on the originally scheduled effective date.
The Company has adopted the guidance effective February 26, 2018, the first day of the 2019 fiscal year, and the adoption of this guidance did not impact its consolidated results of operations, cash flows, financial position or disclosures.
The Company is subject to a number of proceedings, lawsuits and other claims related to environmental, employment, product and other matters.
The Company is required to assess the likelihood of any adverse judgments or outcomes in these matters as well as potential ranges of probable losses.
A determination of the amount of reserves required, if any, for these contingencies is made after careful analysis of each individual issue.
The required reserves may change in the future due to new developments in each matter or changes in approach, such as a change in settlement strategy in dealing with these matters.
Factors That May Affect Future Results.
Certain portions of this Report which do not relate to historical financial information may be deemed to constitute forward-looking statements that are subject to various factors which could cause actual results to differ materially from the Company’s expectations or from results which might be projected, forecasted, estimated or budgeted by the Company in forward-looking statements.
Such factors include, but are not limited to, general conditions in the electronics and aerospace industries, the Company’s competitive position, the status of the Company’s relationships with its customers, economic conditions in international markets, the cost and availability of raw materials, transportation and utilities, and the various factors set forth under the caption “Factors That May Affect Future Results” in Item 1 and in Item 1A “Risk Factors” of the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended February 25, 2018.
