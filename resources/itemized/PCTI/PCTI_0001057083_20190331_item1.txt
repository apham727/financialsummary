Item 1A: Risk Factors 


Conducting business in foreign countries involves additional financial, operating, and regulatory risks.
All of our employees in Tianjin, China are represented by a labor union, and our employees in Beijing, China are represented by a separate labor union pursuant to the requirements of Chinaâ€™s National Labor Law.
These two labor unions do not have collective bargaining rights.
We are in the process of transitioning several product lines from our Tianjin facility to additional contract manufacturers in China and elsewhere throughout 2019 and 2020.
The transition of manufacturing will result in a reduction of a significant portion of our workforce in Tianjin, China.
We are currently negotiating severance arrangements for these workers.
In the third quarter 2018, the Office of the United States Trade Representative imposed duties on certain Chinese imports containing industrially significant technologies, including certain PCTEL antenna and antenna components, and there are additional tariffs under review.
Tariffs impact the gross margin that we earn on sales of its products and have necessitated price increases.
Furthermore, political uncertainty surrounding international trade disputes and protectionist measures may have a negative effect on customer confidence and spending.
We will continue to monitor and adjust prices as necessary and as market conditions permit.
The impact of the tariffs on our future revenue and profitability is uncertain.
