Item 1A: Risk Factors 


Conducting business in foreign countries involves additional financial, operating, and regulatory risks.
Effective July 6, 2018, the Office of the United States Trade Representative (“USTR”) imposed duties of 25% on certain Chinese imports containing industrially significant technologies, including certain PCTEL antenna and antenna components, and there are additional tariffs under review.
Tariffs impact the gross margin that the Company earns on sales of its products and have necessitated price increases.
Furthermore, political uncertainty surrounding international trade disputes and protectionist measures may have a negative effect on customer confidence and spending.
The Company will continue to monitor and adjust prices as necessary and as market conditions permit.
The impact of the tariffs on the Company’s future revenue and profitability is uncertain.
