Accordingly, they do not include all of the information and footnotes required by U.S. GAAP for complete financial statements.
In the opinion of management, all adjustments (consisting of normal recurring accruals) considered necessary for a fair presentation have been included.
For further information, refer to the audited consolidated financial statements and footnotes thereto included in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2017 (the “2017 Form 10-K”).
Nature of Operations
PCTEL, Inc. (“PCTEL”, the “Company”, “we”, “ours”, and “us”) delivers Performance Critical TELecom technology solutions to the wireless industry.
PCTEL is a leading global supplier of wireless network antenna and testing solutions.
PCTEL’s Connected Solutions segment designs and manufactures precision antennas.
PCTEL antennas are deployed in small cells, enterprise Wi-Fi access points, fleet management and transit systems, and in network equipment and devices for the Industrial Internet of Things (“IIoT”).
PCTEL’s RF Solutions segment provides test tools that improve the performance of wireless networks globally.
Mobile operators, neutral hosts, and equipment manufacturers rely on PCTEL to analyze, design, and optimize next generation wireless networks.
Segment Reporting
PCTEL operates in two segments for reporting purposes, Connected Solutions and RF Solutions.
The Company’s chief operating decision maker uses operating profits and identified assets for the Connected Solutions and RF Solutions segments for resource allocations.
Each segment has its own segment manager as well as its own engineering, business development, sales and marketing, and operational general and administrative functions.
All of the Company’s accounting and finance, human resources, information technology (“IT”) and legal functions are provided on a centralized basis through the corporate function.
The Company manages its balance sheet and cash flows centrally at the corporate level, with the exception of trade accounts receivable and inventory which is managed at the segment level.
Each of the segment managers reports to and maintains regular contact with the chief operating decision maker to discuss operating activities, financial results, forecasts, and plans for the segment.
Connected Solutions Segment
PCTEL Connected Solutions designs and manufactures precision antennas.
PCTEL antennas are deployed primarily in small cells, enterprise Wi-Fi access points, fleet management and transit systems, and in equipment and devices for the IIoT.
Revenue growth in these markets is driven by the increased use of wireless communications and increased complexity occurring in these markets.
PCTEL antennas are primarily sold to original equipment manufacturer (“OEM”) providers where they are designed into the customer’s solution.
Competition in the antenna markets addressed by the Connected Solutions segment is fragmented.
Competitors include Airgain, Amphenol, Laird, Pulse, and Taoglas.
The Company seeks out product applications that command a premium for product performance and customer service, and it avoids commodity markets.
PCTEL maintains expertise in several technology areas in order to be competitive in the antenna market.
These include radio frequency engineering, mobile antenna design and manufacturing, mechanical engineering, product quality and testing, and wireless network engineering.
RF Solutions Segment
PCTEL RF Solutions provides test tools that improve the performance of wireless networks globally, with a focus on LTE, public safety, and emerging 5G technologies.
Network operators, neutral hosts, and equipment manufacturers rely on PCTEL’s scanning receivers and testing solutions to analyze, design, and optimize their networks.
Revenue growth is driven by the implementation and roll out of new wireless technology standards (i.e.
3G to 4G, 4G to 5G).
PCTEL test equipment is sold directly to wireless carriers or to OEMs who integrate the Company’s products into their solutions which are then sold to wireless carriers.
Competitors for PCTEL’s test tool products include OEMs such as Anritsu, Berkley Varitronics, Digital Receiver Technology, and Rohde and Schwarz.
PCTEL maintains expertise in several technology areas in order to be competitive in the test tool market.
These include radio frequency engineering, digital signal process engineering, manufacturing, mechanical engineering, product quality and testing, and wireless network engineering.
During the quarter ended June 30, 2017, the Company approved a plan to sell its Network Engineering Services business (“Engineering Services”) and shift its focus to research and development driven radio frequency (“RF”) products.
On July 31, 2017, the Company sold substantially all of the assets of the Company’s Engineering Services business to Gabe’s Construction Co., Inc. (“Gabe’s”) for a purchase price of $1.45 million.
The Engineering Services business provided design, testing, commissioning, optimization, and consulting services for cellular, Wi-Fi and public safety networks and was a reporting unit within the RF Solutions segment.
The disposition of Engineering Services qualified as a discontinued operation for reporting purposes due to the material significance of its historical results and because this disposition represented a strategic shift by the Company to focus on products.
As such, the Company reported the results of its Engineering Services business as discontinued operations beginning with the quarter ended June 30, 2017.
The Company restated the results of Engineering Services as discontinued operations for the three and six months ended June 30, 2017.
See Note 5 for more information on discontinued operations.

The results of operations for the period ended June 30, 2018 may not be indicative of the results for the period ending December 31, 2018.
Foreign Operations
The Company is exposed to foreign currency fluctuations due to its foreign operations and because products are sold internationally.
The functional currency for the Company’s foreign operations is predominantly the applicable local currency.
Accounts of foreign operations are translated into U.S. dollars using the exchange rate in effect at the applicable balance sheet date for assets and liabilities and average monthly rates prevailing during the period for revenue and expense accounts.
Adjustments resulting from translation are included in accumulated other comprehensive loss, a separate component of stockholders’ equity.
Gains and losses resulting from other transactions originally in foreign currencies and then translated into U.S. dollars are included in the condensed consolidated statement of operations.
Net foreign exchange gains (losses) resulting from foreign currency transactions included in other income, net were $60 and $(41) for the three months ended June 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively.
Net foreign exchange (losses) resulting from foreign currency transactions included in other income, net were $(9) and $(53) for the six months ended June 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively.
Recent Accounting Pronouncements
In June 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued Accounting Standards Update No.
2016-13 (“ASU 2016-13”) regarding ASC Topic 326, “Financial Instruments - Credit Losses,” which modifies the measurement of expected credit losses of certain financial instruments.
The amendments will be effective for the Company on January 1, 2020.
The Company is currently evaluating this guidance and the impact it will have on its consolidated financial statements.

Topic 842 also provides clarifications surrounding the presentation of the effects of leases in the income statement and statement of cash flows.
This guidance will be effective for the Company on January 1, 2019.
The Company is currently evaluating key policy elections and considerations prompted by the standard and will draft an internal policy to address the new standard requirements.
The Company has developed a project plan to implement Topic 842.
The Company is in the process of preparing the complete portfolio of active leases, including embedded leases.
The Company is in process of evaluating the impact of the new lease accounting guidance on its consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.

Cash, Cash Equivalents and Investments
Cash and Cash Equivalents
At June 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017, cash and cash equivalents included bank balances and investments with original maturities less than 90 days.

Such funds utilize the amortized cost method of accounting, seek to maintain a constant $1.00 per share price, and are redeemable upon demand.
The Company restricts its investments in AAA money market funds to those invested 100% in either short-term U.S. government agency securities or bank repurchase agreements collateralized by these same securities.
The fair values of these money market funds are established through quoted prices in active markets for identical assets (Level 1 inputs).
The Company’s cash in U.S. banks is insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation up to the insurable limit of $250.
The Company had $1.5 million and $1.2 million of cash and cash equivalents in foreign bank accounts at June 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017, respectively.
Included in such amounts are cash of $1.3 million and $1.0 million in China bank accounts at June 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017, respectively.
As of June 30, 2018, the Company has no intentions of repatriating the cash in its foreign bank accounts in China.
If the Company decides to repatriate the cash in the foreign bank accounts, it may experience difficulty in doing so in a timely manner.

The Company’s cash in its foreign bank accounts is not insured.
Investments
At June 30, 2018, the Company’s short-term investments consisted of U.S. government agency bonds, AA or higher rated corporate bonds, and certificates of deposit.
At December 31, 2017, the Company’s short-term investments consisted of pre-funded municipal bonds, U.S. government agency bonds, AA or higher rated corporate bonds, and certificates of deposit.

The Company categorizes its financial instruments within a fair value hierarchy according to accounting guidance for fair value.
The fair value hierarchy is described under the Fair Value of Financial Instruments in Note 2.
For the Level 2 investments, the Company uses quoted prices of similar assets in active markets.
The fair values in the table above reflect net unrealized losses of $28 and $34 at June 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017, respectively.
During the quarter ended June 30, 2017, the Company approved a plan to sell its Engineering Services business and shift its focus to research and development driven RF products.
On July 31, 2017, the Company sold its Engineering Services business to Gabe’s.
The Company filed a Form 8-K related to the disposition on August 4, 2017.
The disposition met the requirements for classification as held for sale during the quarter ended June 30, 2017 because the disposition met all the criteria outlined in the accounting guidance.
Due to the significance of the results during the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015, and 2014, and because this disposition represented a strategic shift by the Company to focus on products, the disposition of Engineering Services also qualified as a discontinued operation for reporting purposes.
As such, the Company reported the results of its Engineering Services business as discontinued operations for the three and six months ended June 30, 2017.
There were no activities related to discontinued operations during the three and six months ended June 30, 2018 other than transition services for billing one customer.

The income tax gain was $0.3 million, which included the tax value of the fixed assets and the remaining tax value for intangible assets no longer being used by the Company as of the sale to Gabe’s.
The Company retained working capital of approximately $0.5 million, including accounts receivable, accounts payable, and accrued liabilities.
There was no impairment loss recorded on the disposal of the long-lived assets because the fair value of the assets less cost to sell was higher than the carrying value of the assets.
All the revenues and cost of revenues in discontinued operations related to services provided by the Company.

The Company had consigned inventory with customers of $0.8 million and $0.5 million at June 30, 2018 and
December 31, 2017, respectively.
The Company records allowances to reduce the value of inventory to the lower of cost or market, including allowances for excess and obsolete inventory.
Reserves for excess inventory are calculated based on our estimate of inventory in excess of normal and planned usage.

The condensed consolidated statements of operations include $1.8 million of stock compensation expense for the six months ended June 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively.
The Company accounts for forfeitures as they occur.
Restricted Stock – Service Based
The Company grants restricted shares as employee and director incentives.
When service-based restricted stock is granted, the Company records deferred stock compensation within additional paid in capital, representing the fair value of the common stock on the date the restricted shares are granted.
The Company records stock compensation expense on a straight-line basis over the vesting period of the applicable service-based restricted shares.
These grants vest over various periods.
During the first quarter 2018, the Company issued 420,977 service-based restricted stock awards to employees that vest in equal annual increments over three years.
During the second quarter 2018, the Company issued 60,998 restricted stock awards to the board of directors that vested upon issuance.
The intrinsic value of service-based restricted shares that vested during the three months ended June 30, 2017 was $0.2 million.
No service-based restricted shares vested during the three months ended June 30, 2018.
The intrinsic value of service-based restricted shares that vested during the six months ended June 30, 2018, and 2017 was $0.8 million and $1.2 million, respectively.
At June 30, 2018, total unrecognized compensation expense related to restricted stock was approximately $4.4 million to be recognized through 2021 over a weighted average period of 1.5 years.
Restricted Stock Units – Service Based
The Company grants restricted stock units as employee incentives.
Restricted stock units are primarily granted to foreign employees for long-term incentive purposes.
Employee restricted stock units are service-based awards and are amortized over the vesting period.
At the vesting date, these units are converted to shares of common stock.
The Company records expense on a straight-line basis for restricted stock units.
The intrinsic value of service-based restricted stock units that vested and were issued as shares during the three months ended June 30, 2017 was $17.
No service-based restricted stock units vested during the three months ended June 30, 2018.
The intrinsic value of service-based restricted stock units that vested and were issued as shares during the six months ended June 30, 2018 and 2017 was $29 and $23, respectively.
As of June 30, 2018, the unrecognized compensation expense related to the unvested portion of the Company’s restricted stock units was approximately $0.1 million, to be recognized through 2021 over a weighted average period of 1.2 years.
Stock Options
The Company grants stock options to purchase common stock as long-term incentives.
The exercise price of the stock options is no less than the fair value of the Company’s stock on the grant date.
The stock options have a seven-year life and generally vest over a period of four years, 25% after one year, and ratably on a monthly basis thereafter.
Stock options may be exercised at any time prior to their expiration date or within ninety days of termination of employment, or such shorter time as may be provided in the related stock option agreement.
The intrinsic value is based on the share price of $6.24 at June 30, 2018.
The fair value of each stock option outstanding was estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model.
The Black-Scholes option-pricing model was developed for use in estimating the fair value of traded options, which have no vesting restrictions and are fully transferable.
Because the Company’s employee stock options have characteristics significantly different from those of traded options, and because changes in the subjective input assumptions can materially affect the fair value estimate, the existing models may not necessarily provide a reliable single measure of the fair value of the employee stock options.
In addition, option valuation models require the input of highly subjective assumptions including the expected stock price volatility and expected option life.
The dividend yield rate was calculated by dividing the Company’s annual dividend by the closing price on the grant date.
The risk-free interest rate was based on the U.S. Treasury yields with a remaining term that approximates the expected life of the options granted.
The expected volatility was based on a five-year historical period of the Company’s stock price.
The expected life for options granted was based on historical data of employee exercise performance.
The Company records expense based on the graded vesting method.
As of June 30, 2018, the unrecognized compensation expense related to the unvested portion of the Company’s stock options was approximately $9, to be recognized through 2021 over a weighted average period of 1.3 years.
Performance-based Equity Awards
The Company had 110,500 unvested performance awards at June 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017, respectively.
There was no activity related to performance awards during the six months ended June 30, 2018.
As of June 30, 2018, the Company does not expect any of the outstanding performance awards to vest.
Short-term incentive plan
Incentive awards earned by certain executives and key managers under the Company’s 2018 short-term incentive plan (“STIP”) will be settled 50% in cash and 50% in shares of the Company’s stock for certain executives.
The incentive awards for all other participants under the 2018 STIP will be 100% in cash.
All incentive awards earned under the 2017 STIP were paid in cash.
Employee Stock Purchase Plan (“ESPP”)
The ESPP enables eligible employees to purchase common stock at the lower of 85% of the fair market value of the common stock on the first or last day of each offering period.
Each offering period is approximately six months.
The Company received proceeds of $0.4 million from the issuance of 68,212 shares under the ESPP in February 2018 and received proceeds of $0.3 million from the issuance of 72,218 shares under the ESPP in February 2017.
Based on the 15% discount and the fair value of the option feature of the ESPP, it is considered compensatory.
Compensation expense is calculated using the fair value of the employees’ purchase rights under the Black-Scholes model.
The dividend yield rate was calculated by dividing the Company’s annual dividend by the closing price on the grant date.
The risk-free interest rate was based on the U.S. Treasury yields with a remaining term that approximates the expected life of the options granted.
The volatility was based on a five-year historical period of the Company’s stock price.
The expected life was based on the offering period.
Board of Director Equity Awards
The Company grants equity awards under the PCTEL, Inc. Stock Plan (the “Stock Plan”) to members of its Board of Directors an annual retainer for committee service in shares of the Company’s stock.
These awards vest upon issuance.
New directors receive a one-time grant that vests over three years.
During the quarter ended June 30, 2018, the Company issued 60,988 shares of the Company’s stock with a fair value of $0.4 million.
During the quarter ended June 30, 2017, the Company issued 52,786 shares of the Company’s stock with a fair value of $0.4 million.
Employee Withholding Taxes on Stock Awards
For ease in administering the issuance of stock awards, the Company holds back shares of vested restricted stock awards and short-term incentive plan stock awards for the value of the statutory withholding taxes.
For each individual receiving a share award, the Company redeems the shares it computes as the value for the withholding tax and remits this amount to the appropriate tax authority.
For withholding taxes related to stock awards, the Company paid $0.3 million and $0.6 million during the six months ended June 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively.
Employee Benefit Plans
The Company’s 401(k) plan covers all of the U.S. employees beginning the first day of the month following the first month of their employment.
Under this plan, employees may elect to contribute up to 15% of their current compensation to the 401(k) plan up to the statutorily prescribed annual limit.
The Company matches employee contributions up to 4%, and may also make discretionary contributions to the 401(k) plan.
The Company also contributes to various retirement plans for foreign employees.

On December 22, 2017, the United States federal government enacted the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (“Tax Act”), marking a change from a worldwide tax system to a modified territorial tax system in the United States.
As part of this change, the Tax Act, provides for a transition tax on the accumulated unremitted foreign earnings and profits of foreign subsidiaries (“Transition Tax”), a reduction of the U.S. federal corporate income tax rate from 34% to 21%, and an indefinite carryforward of net operating losses (“NOLs”) incurred in 2018 and future periods.
In response to the enactment of the Tax Act in late 2017, the SEC issued Staff Accounting Bulletin No.
118 (“SAB 118”) to address situations where the accounting is incomplete for certain income tax effects of the Tax Act at the time of issuance of an entity’s financial statements for the reporting period in which the Tax Act was enacted.
Under SAB 118, a company may record provisional amounts during a measurement period for specific income tax effects of the Tax Act for which the accounting is incomplete, but a reasonable estimate can be determined, and when unable to determine a reasonable estimate for any income tax effects, report provisional amounts in the first reporting period in which a reasonable estimate can be determined.
The measurement period should not extend beyond one year.
To determine the amount of the Transition Tax, the Company must determine, in addition to other factors, the amount of post-1986 earnings and profits of relevant subsidiaries, as well as the amount of non-U.S. income taxes paid on such earnings.
During the year ended December 31, 2017, the Company recorded provisional income tax expense of $0.6 million related to the deemed repatriation of the accumulated unremitted earnings and profits of the Company’s foreign subsidiaries.
This provisional amount was based on information that was currently available, including estimated tax earnings and profits from foreign subsidiaries.
While we were able to make a reasonable estimate of the impact of the reduction in the corporate rate, it may be affected by state treatment of the deemed repatriation of foreign profits and the Company’s Transition Tax.
In order to complete the accounting for the effects of the Transition Tax in 2018, the Company is continuing to gather additional information including refining the calculation of earnings and profits of foreign subsidiaries and is continuing to monitor the guidance from the I.R.S., states, and other government agencies to more precisely compute the amount of the Transition Tax and the state income tax impact of the deemed distributions of the foreign earnings and profits.
No adjustments were recorded related to the Transition Tax during the three and six months ended June 30, 2018.
The analyses will continue throughout 2018 and is expected to be completed when the Company files its income tax returns in late 2018.
The Tax Act also includes a provision designed to tax global intangible low taxed income (“GILTI”).
Under the provision, a U.S. shareholder is required to include in gross income the amount of its GILTI, which is generally the net income of its controlled foreign corporations in excess of a 10% return on depreciable tangible assets after identification of other income subject to non-deferral rules.
Under U.S. GAAP, the Company is allowed to make an accounting policy choice of either (1) treating taxes due on future U.S. inclusions in taxable income related to GILTI as a current-period expense when incurred (the "period cost method") or (2) factoring such amounts into the Company's measurement of its deferred taxes (the "deferred method").
Due to the complexity of the new GILTI tax rules and uncertainty of the application of the foreign tax credit rules in relation to GILTI, the Company is continuing to evaluate this provision of the Tax Act.
However, the Company has included an estimate of the 2018 current GILTI impact in the annual
effective tax rate for 2018.
The amount included for GILTI does not have a significant impact on the Company’s tax provision for the three and six months ended June 30, 2018.
The Company recorded an income tax benefit of $0.2 million and $0.5 million for the three and six months ended June 30, 2018, respectively.
The benefit recorded for the three and six months ended June 30, 2018 differed from the statutory rate of 21% because the Company did not record income tax benefits for losses with finite lives and due to permanent differences.
The Company recorded an income tax benefit of $0.1 and $0.3 million for the three and six months ended June 30, 2017, respectively.
The net tax benefit for the three and six months ended June 30, 2017 differed from the statutory rate of 34% due to the combination of U.S. pretax losses and foreign pretax profits taxed at lower rates.
The net tax benefit for the three and six months ended June 30, 2017 included income tax expense of $0.1 million related to tax deficiencies with restricted stock and stock options and $0.1 million income tax benefit related to previously unrecognized tax benefits for research credits.
The Company had deferred tax assets net of deferred tax liabilities of $8.2 million and $7.7  million at June 30, 2018 and at December 31, 2017, respectively, virtually all of which are related to the United States tax jurisdiction.
The Company’s net deferred tax assets consist of NOLs and credits as well as timing differences.
The Company’s NOLs and credits generated as of December 31, 2017 have a finite life primarily based on the 20-year carry forward of federal net operating losses.
The timing differences have a ratable reversal pattern over 13 years.
On a regular basis, the Company evaluates the recoverability of deferred tax assets and the need for a valuation allowance.
Such evaluations involve the application of significant judgment.
The Company considers multiple factors in its evaluation of the need for a valuation allowance.
The Company’s valuation allowance against its deferred tax assets was $5.4 million and $5.2 million at June 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017, respectively.
For the deferred tax assets related to NOLs and credits, the Company believes that it is more likely than not that these deferred tax assets will not be realized based on the negative evidence of a cumulative three-year loss through June 30, 2018 and expiration of the NOLs.
The analysis that the Company prepared to determine the valuation allowance required significant judgment and assumptions regarding future market conditions as well as forecasts for profits, taxable income, and taxable income by jurisdiction.
Due to the sensitivity of the analysis, changes to the assumptions in subsequent periods could have a material effect on the valuation allowance.
The Company’s gross unrecognized tax benefit was $0.7 million at June 30, 2018 and at December 31, 2017.
The Company files a consolidated federal income tax return, income tax returns with various states, and foreign income tax returns in various foreign jurisdictions.
The Company’s U.S. federal tax returns remain subject to examination for 2015 and subsequent periods.
The Company’s U.S. state tax returns remain subject to examination for 2012 and subsequent periods.
The Company’s foreign tax returns remain subject to examination for 2010 and subsequent periods.

Revenue from Contracts with Customers
Under Topic 606, a contract with a customer is an agreement which both parties have approved, that creates enforceable rights and obligations, has commercial substance, and has identified payment terms, and for which collectability is probable.
Once the Company has entered into a contract, it is evaluated to identify performance obligations.
For each performance obligation, revenue is recognized as control of promised goods or services transfers to the customer in an amount that reflects the consideration the Company expects to receive in exchange for those goods or services.
The amount of revenue recognized takes into account variable consideration, such as returns and volume rebates.
A majority of the Company’s revenue is short cycle in nature with shipments within one year from order.
The Company's payment terms generally range between 30 to 90 days.
All of the Company’s revenue relates to contracts with customers.
The Company’s accounting contracts are from purchase orders or purchase orders combined with purchase agreements.
The majority of the Company’s revenue is recognized on a “point-in-time” basis and a nominal amount of revenue is recognized “over time”.
For the sale of antenna products and test tool products, the Company satisfies its performance obligations generally at the time of shipment, or upon delivery based on the contractual terms with its customers.
For products shipped on consignment, the Company recognizes revenue upon delivery from the consignment location.
For its software test tools, the Company has a performance obligation to provide software maintenance and support for one year.

U.S. Tariffs
Effective July 6, 2018, the Office of the United States Trade Representative (“USTR”) imposed duties of 25% on certain Chinese imports containing industrially significant technologies, including certain PCTEL antenna and antenna components.
Tariffs have increased the cost of the Company’s products, adversely impacting the gross margin that the Company earns on sales of its products and making our products more expensive for customers.
During the trailing twelve months ended June 30, 2018, $7.5 million of our customer revenues were based on products subject to the new tariffs.
In July, we initiated a 20% upcharge to end customers of these products to recover the impact of the additional costs for these U.S. tariffs.
The Company will continue to monitor and adjust prices as necessary and as market conditions permit.
However, the Company does not know the price elasticity of the unit volume based on the price increase.
Additional tariffs affecting other antennas and antenna components become effective on August 23, 2018.
The Company is currently evaluating the impact of these additional tariffs.
There were no other subsequent events or transactions that required recognition or disclosure in the unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial statements.
Item 1: Legal Proceedings
We are the subject of various pending or threatened legal actions in the ordinary course of our business.
All such matters are subject to many uncertainties and outcomes that are not predictable with assurance.
In our opinion, as of June 30, 2018, there were no claims or litigation pending that would be reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or liquidity.
Item 1A: Risk Factors
Conducting business in foreign countries involves additional financial, operating, and regulatory risks.
Effective July 6, 2018, the Office of the United States Trade Representative (“USTR”) imposed duties of 25% on certain Chinese imports containing industrially significant technologies, including certain PCTEL antenna and antenna components, and there are additional tariffs under review.
Tariffs impact the gross margin that the Company earns on sales of its products and have necessitated price increases.
Furthermore, political uncertainty surrounding international trade disputes and protectionist measures may have a negative effect on customer confidence and spending.
The Company will continue to monitor and adjust prices as necessary and as market conditions permit.
The impact of the tariffs on the Company’s future revenue and profitability is uncertain.
