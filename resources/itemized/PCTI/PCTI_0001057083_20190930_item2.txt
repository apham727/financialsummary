Overview
Our third quarter 2019 revenues were $23.6 million and increased by $5.2 million or 28.2% compared to revenues of $18.4 million for the same period in 2018.
Third quarter 2019 revenues increased by $3.7 million or 103.6% to $7.2 million for the test and measurement products compared to the third quarter 2018 and increased by $1.6 million or 10.7% to $16.5 million for the antenna products.
Revenues increased for the test and measurement product line primarily due to sales of 5G products for early deployment.
Revenues increased for the antenna products due to higher revenues with intelligent transportation products.
The gross profit of $10.6 million, increased by $3.9 million compared to the same period in 2018 due to both a higher product mix of test and measurement product line revenues and an increase in the gross margin percentage for antenna products.
Primarily based on higher gross profit margins, we recorded an operating income of $0.9 million for the three months ended September 30, 2019 compared to an operating loss of $2.4 million during the third quarter 2018.
Revenues for the nine months ended September 30, 2019 were $67.7 million, an increase of $6.0 million, or 9.7% compared to the same period in 2018.
Test and measurement revenues increased by $8.6 million to $20.3 million compared to the same period in 2018.
Antenna product revenues decreased by $2.6 million or 5.1% to $47.6 million primarily due to lower revenues with enterprise Wi-Fi applications and small cell antennas.
Revenues increased for the test and measurement products due to sales of 5G products for early deployment.
The gross profit of $30.0 million increased by $7.6 million compared to gross profit for the same period in 2018, due to a higher product mix of test and measurement product revenues and due to an increase in the gross margin percentage for antenna products.
Because of higher gross profit margins, we recorded an operating income of $1.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2019 as compared to an operating loss of $5.2 million for the same period in 2018.
Description of Business
PCTEL antenna are primarily sold to original equipment manufacturer (“OEM”) providers where the antennas are designed into the customer’s solution.
Competition in the antenna markets is fragmented.
Competitors include Airgain, Amphenol, Laird, Panorama, and Taoglas.
Our test and measurement products are sold directly to wireless carriers or to OEM providers who integrate our products into their solutions which are then sold to wireless carriers.
Competitors for PCTEL’s test tool products include OEMs such as Anritsu, Berkley Varitronics, Digital Receiver Technology, and Rohde and Schwarz.
Recent Developments
Effective August 2018, we consolidated our organizational structure to drive growth and address the convergence in the Industrial IoT, public safety, and 4G infrastructure markets and the emergence of new technologies such as 5G (the “Reorganization”).
Our operations, engineering, business development, sales and marketing, and operational general and administrative functions were consolidated into a single enterprise-wide organization.
As a result of the Reorganization, our Chief Executive Officer, as the CODM, began assessing operating profits and identified assets at the enterprise level for resource allocations.
In connection with the Reorganization, the Board of Directors appointed a Chief Operating Officer who maintains regular contact with the CODM to discuss operating activities, financial results, forecasts, and plans for our businesses.
All operating profit and cash flows are measured and managed at the enterprise level.
Until the Reorganization, PCTEL operated in two segments for reporting purposes, Connected Solutions and RF Solutions.
Our CODM assessed operating profits and identified assets for the Connected Solutions and RF Solutions segments for resource allocations.
Each segment had its own general manager as well as its own engineering, business development, sales and marketing, and operational general and administrative functions.
This Form 10-Q does not include segment reporting information; however, we have included revenues and gross profit for the two major product lines (antenna products and test and measurement products) because each product line has a significantly different gross profit profile.
In order to understand our financial results, it is necessary to understand the impact on gross profit of the revenue mix between them.
China Transition Plan
On August 7, 2019 the Board of Directors approved a transition plan for our China manufacturing operations.
In order to optimize the cost structure of the antenna product line and increase our competitiveness, we will transition high-volume manufacturing from our Tianjin facility to contract manufacturers in China and elsewhere.
We expect the transition to be substantially completed by the end of our 2020 fiscal year (the “Transition Period”) and we expect to recognize cumulative pre-tax charges of approximately $1.0 million consisting of severance and other transition costs.
It is expected that a total of approximately 140 positions, or approximately 35% of the Company’s full-time global workforce, will be eliminated over the course of the Transition Period.
Approximately $0.9 million of severance costs will be paid in cash.
Other non-cash costs associated with the transition to contract manufacturers include fixed asset dispositions estimated to be $0.1 million.
During the three months ended September 30, 2019, the Company eliminated 49 positions and recorded restructuring expense of $0.3 million.
U.S. Tariffs
Results of Operations
Three and Nine Months Ended September 30, 2019 and 2018
Revenues by Product Line
Revenues increased 28.2% and 9.7% for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2019 compared to the same periods primarily due to higher revenues for test and measurement products.
Revenues for the test and measurement product line increased 103.6% and 73.6% for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2019 compared to the three and nine months ended September 30, 2018 primarily due to sales in connection with early deployments of 5G infrastructure in the U.S., Europe and Asia.
For the three months ended September 30, 2019, revenues increased for the antenna product line by 10.7%, compared to the same period in 2018, based on increased revenues for intelligent transportation systems offset lower revenues for small cell antennas and for enterprise Wi-Fi applications.
Antenna revenues declined by 5.1% for the nine months ended September 30, 2019 compared to the same period in 2018, primarily due to decreased demand for small cell antennas and for enterprise Wi-Fi applications.
The decline in revenues for small cell antennas is primarily due to lower demand from one customer, Huawei Technologies Co., Ltd. As a result of the unexpected U.S. restrictions on trading with Huawei, Huawei’s demand for our products declined because Huawei was not able to purchase other U.S. sourced components for their networks.
Gross Profit by Product Line
The gross profit percentage increased by 8.6% and 8.0% for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2019 compared to the same periods in 2018 because of a higher ratio of revenues from test and measurement products and because of higher gross profits for antenna products.
Higher margin test and measurement products comprised 30.6% of the revenues in the third quarter 2019 compared to 19.3% of the revenues in the same period in 2018 and comprised 30.0% of the revenues in the nine months ended September 30, 2019 compared to 18.9% for the same period in 2018.
The gross profit percentage for the antenna product line increased by 4.4% and 4.5% for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2019 compared to the same periods in 2018 due to more favorable product mix and due to cost reductions.
Consolidated Operating Expenses
Research and Development
Research and development expenses increased $0.2 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2019 compared to the same periods in 2018.
The increase is primarily due to the Company’s expenditures related to development of 5G test and measurement equipment.
Sales and Marketing
Sales and marketing expenses include costs associated with the sales and marketing employees, sales agents, product line management, and trade show expenses.
Sales and marketing expenses were approximately the same for the three months ended September 30, 2019 compared to the same period in 2018 and decreased $0.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2019 compared to the same period in 2018.
For the nine months ended September 30, 2019, lower expenses for sales headcount in North America offset higher corporate marketing expenses.
General and Administrative
General and administrative expenses include costs associated with the general management, finance, human resources, IT, legal, public company costs, and other operating expenses to the extent not otherwise allocated to business segments.
General and administrative expenses decreased by $0.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2019 compared to the same period in 2018.
General and administrative expenses increased by $1.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2019 compared to the same period in 2018 as cash-based incentive compensation expense increased by $0.8 million, equity-based compensation expense increased by $0.4 million and corporate expenses increased by $0.5 million, offsetting $0.5 million in reductions in executive management related to the reorganization in 2018.
Amortization of Intangible Assets
Amortization expense within operating expenses was lower for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2019 compared to the same periods in 2018 because certain intangible assets became fully amortized during 2018 and the first quarter 2019.
Restructuring expenses
During the three months ended September 30, 2019, we incurred restructuring expenses of $0.3 million.
These restructuring expenses consisted of employee severance and payroll related costs associated with the termination of 49 employees in connection with our
transition of certain manufacturing activities to contract manufacturers.
(See China Transition Plan on page 30 for additional details.)
Upon completion of our China transition plan, we anticipate total severance costs to be approximately $0.9 million incurred by the end of the first half of 2020.
Stock-based compensation expense
Stock compensation expense was higher by $0.1 million and $0.7 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2019, respectively, compared to the same periods in 2018 primarily due to expense accrued for our short-term incentive plan (“2019 STIP”).
Under the 2019 STIP, certain executive and managers will be paid 50% in cash and 50% in shares of the Company’s stock.
The incentive awards for all other participants under the 2019 STIP will be 100% in cash.
Other Income, Net
Other income, net consists of interest income, foreign exchange gains, and interest expense.
Interest income from short-term investment securities increased during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2019 compared to the prior year periods, primarily due to higher average interest rates.
Foreign exchange gains during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2019 were related to the fluctuations in the Chinese Yuan compared with the U.S. Dollar.
Expense (Benefit) for Income Taxes
We recorded income tax expense of $23 for the nine months ended September 30, 2019, and an income tax benefit of $1.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2018.
The tax expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2019 was lower than the statutory rate of 21% by approximately 20% because we maintain a full valuation allowance on our deferred tax assets.
The tax benefit recorded for the nine months ended September 30, 2018 was higher than the statutory rate by approximately 1% due to permanent differences and estimated research credits.
In the fourth quarter of 2018, we recorded a full valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets.
We maintain a full valuation allowance on our deferred tax assets due to uncertainties regarding realization of the benefits of this asset.
Virtually all of our deferred tax assets relate to the United States tax jurisdiction.
On a regular basis, we evaluate the recoverability of deferred tax assets and the need for a valuation allowance.
Such evaluations involve the application of significant judgment.
We considered multiple factors in
our evaluation of the need for a valuation allowance.
The full valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets was $14.5 million at September 30, 2019 and December 31, 2018.
At December 31, 2018, our cumulative loss position for the past three years and our 2018 performance versus our 2018 projections were considered significant negative evidence which was difficult to overcome on a “more likely than not” standard through objectively verifiable data.
We recorded positive pre-tax income for the nine months ended September 30, 2019, but nevertheless recorded cumulative three-year pre-tax losses as of September 30, 2019.
While we believe our financial outlook remains positive, under the accounting standards, objective verifiable evidence will have greater weight than subjective evidence such as our projections for future growth.
The analysis that we prepared to determine the valuation allowance required significant judgment and assumptions regarding future market conditions as well as forecasts for profits, taxable income, and taxable income by jurisdiction.
Due to the sensitivity of the analysis, changes to the assumptions in subsequent periods could have a material effect on the valuation allowance.
See Note 11 to the consolidated financial statements for more information related to income taxes.
Net Income (Loss)
For the three months ended September 30, 2019, we recorded net income of $1.3 million compared to a net loss of $1.7 million for the same period in 2018, and for the nine months ended September 30, 2019 we recorded net income of $2.0 million compared to a net loss of $3.8 million for the same period in 2018.
For both the three and nine months ended September 30, 2019, higher gross margins as well as other income offset higher operating expenses Gross margins increased during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2019 compared to same periods in 2018 due to a higher mix of test and measurement product revenues and an improvement in the gross margin percentage for antenna products.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
Overview
Our primary source of liquidity is cash provided by operations, with short-term swings in liquidity supported by a significant balance of cash and short-term investments.
The balance has fluctuated with cash from operations, acquisitions and divestitures, payment of dividends and the repurchase of our common shares.
Within operating activities, we are historically a net generator of operating funds from our income statement activities.
During the nine months ended September 30, 2019, our balance sheet provided operating funds.
In periods of expansion, we expect to use cash from our balance sheet.
Within investing activities, capital spending historically ranges between 2.0% and 4.0% of our revenues and the primary use of capital is for manufacturing, engineering, and product development.
Our capital expenditures during the nine months ended September 30, 2019 were approximately 2.0% of revenues.
We historically have significant transfers between investments and cash as we rotate our large cash balances and short-term investment balances between money market funds, which are accounted for as cash equivalents, and other investment vehicles.
We have a history of supplementing our organic revenue with acquisitions of product lines or companies, resulting in significant uses of our cash and short-term investment balances from time to time.
We expect the historical trend for capital spending and the variability caused by moving money between cash and investments and periodic merger and acquisition activity to continue in the future.
Within financing activities, we have historically generated funds from the exercise of stock options and proceeds from the issuance of common stock through the Employee Stock Purchase Plan.
We have historically used funds to repurchase shares of our common stock through our share repurchase programs and to issue quarterly dividends.
On November 6, 2019 the Board of Directors approved a share repurchase program pursuant to which we may repurchase up to $7.0 million of our common stock, effective immediately through the end of 2020.
Such purchases may be made from time to time at prevailing prices in the open market, by block purchases, in private transactions or otherwise.
The repurchases will be funded with cash on hand.
Whether this activity results in our being a net user of funds versus a net generator of funds is largely dependent on our stock price during any given year.
At September 30, 2019, our cash, cash equivalents, and investments were approximately $38.1 million, and we had working capital of $56.4 million.
Management believes that our cash and investments provide adequate liquidity and working capital to support our operations given our historic ability to generate free cash flow (cash flow from operations less capital spending) and our lack of debt.
Operating activities generated $7.6 million of cash during the nine months ended September 30, 2019.
We generated $8.4 million of cash from our statement of operations activities and used $0.8 million from the balance sheet.
The balance sheet used net cash as accounts receivable increased and we lowered our accounts payable balance.
Accounts receivable increased by $1.3 million due to an increase in revenue for the nine months ended September 30, 2019 compared to the same period in 2018.
Accrued liabilities increased by $1.5 million primarily due to bonus accruals for our short-term incentive plan.
Inventories increased by $0.8 million primarily driven by test and measurement equipment for 5G technologies.
Operating activities generated $4.1 million of cash during the nine months ended September 30, 2018.
We generated $1.1 million of cash from our statement of operations activities and generated $3.0 million of cash from the balance sheet.
Within the balance sheet, we generated cash primarily due to net collections of accounts receivable of $5.0 million, offsetting use of cash for net payments of accrued liabilities of $2.5 million.
The reduction in accounts receivable during the nine months ended September 30, 2018 is because revenues for the third quarter of 2018 were $4.8 million lower compared to the fourth quarter of 2017.
Accrued liabilities were lower at September 30, 2018 compared to December 31, 2017, primarily due to the payout of $1.7 million for the 2017 short-term incentive plan.
Our investing activities used $2.9 million of cash during the nine months ended September 30, 2019.
During the nine months ended September 30, 2019, redemptions and maturities of our short-term investments provided $36.8 million in funds and we rotated $38.4 million of cash into new short-term investments.
We used $1.4 million for capital expenditures during the nine months ended September 30, 2019.
Our investing activities used $1.5 million of cash during the nine months ended September 30, 2018.
During the nine months ended September 30, 2018, redemptions and maturities of our short-term investments provided $34.7 million in funds and we rotated $34.0 million of cash into new short-term investments.
We used $2.2 million for capital expenditures during the nine months ended September 30, 2018.
Capital expenditures included engineering equipment for our new development office in Akron, Ohio.
We used $3.2 million in cash for financing activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2019.
We used $3.0 million for quarterly cash dividends paid in February, May and August 2019.
We received $0.7 million in proceeds from the purchase of shares through our ESPP and we used $0.8 million for payroll taxes related to stock-based compensation.
The tax payments related to restricted stock awards.
We used $2.7 million in cash for financing activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2018.
We used $3.0 million for cash dividends paid in February, May and August 2018.
We received $0.7 million in proceeds from the purchase of shares through our ESPP and we used $0.3 million for payroll taxes related to stock-based compensation and $0.1 million on payments for capital leases.
The tax payments related to our stock issued for restricted stock awards.
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
None
Contractual Obligations and Commercial Commitments
We had purchase obligations of $8.6 million and $10.8 million at September 30, 2019 and December 31, 2018, respectively, for the purchase of inventory as well as for other goods and services in the ordinary course of business.
Balances for purchases currently recognized as liabilities on the balance sheet are excluded.
We had a liability of $0.7 million related to income tax uncertainties at September 30, 2019 and December 31, 2018.
We do not know the timing of the settlement of this liability.
Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates
We use certain critical accounting policies as described in “Item 7.
Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates” of the 2018 Form 10-K.
There have been no material changes in any of our critical accounting policies since December 31, 2018.
See Note 1 to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for discussion of recent accounting pronouncements and see Note 10 to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for information related to implementation of the new lease accounting standard.
