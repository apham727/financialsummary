Item 2: Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 

The following information should be read in conjunction with the unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto included in Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2017 contained in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2017 (the “2017 Form 10-+K”).
Except for historical information, the following discussion contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties, including statements regarding our anticipated revenues, profits, costs and expenses and revenue mix.
These forward-looking statements include, among others, those statements including the words “may,” “will,” “plans,” “seeks,” “expects,” “anticipates,” “intends,” “believes” and words of similar meaning.
Such statements constitute “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.
No undue reliance should be placed on these forward-looking statements.
Our actual results could differ materially from those projected in these forward-looking statements.
Our first quarter 2018 revenues decreased by $1.2 million, or 5.4% compared to the same period in 2017, primarily due to lower revenues for the RF Solutions segment.
We recorded an operating loss of $1.2 million compared to operating income of $22 during the same period in 2017.
The operating loss was primarily the result of the negative gross margin impact of lower revenues with the RF Solutions segment and a lower gross margin percentage for the Connected Solutions segment.
Operating expenses were lower for the three months ended March 31, 2018 compared to the same period in 2017 as lower sales and marketing and general and administrative expenses offset higher research and development expenses.

Results of Operations 

Three months Ended March 31, 2018 and 2017 


Revenues by Segment 


Revenues decreased 5.4% for the three months ended March 31, 2018 compared to the same period in 2017.
Revenues for the Connected Solutions segment increased 2.9% for the three months ended March 31, 2018 compared to the same period in 2017 due to increased sales in the enterprise Wi-Fi vertical market.
Revenues for the RF Solutions segment decreased 30.5% for the three months ended March 31, 2017 compared to the same period in 2017 due to lower capital spending by U.S. carriers and lower revenues in the Asia Pacific region.
Gross Profit by Segment 


The gross profit percentage of 36.2% for the three months ended March 31, 2018 was 5.0% lower than the same period in 2017.
The gross profit percentage for the Connected Solutions segment decreased 2.0% during the three months ended March 31, 2018 compared to the same period in 2017 due to price pressure in the small cell vertical market and due to product mix.
The gross profit percentage for RF Solutions segment decreased 3.5% compared to the same period in 2017 primarily due to the impact of fixed costs over lower revenues.
Consolidated Operating Expenses 


Research and Development 

Research and development expenses increased approximately $0.2 million for the three months ended March 31, 2018 compared to the same period in 2017.
The increase during the three months ended March 31, 2018 primarily consists of higher expenses for the Connected Solutions segment compared to the same period in the prior year, partially offset by lower expenses for the RF Solutions segment.
Expenses for the Connected Solutions segment were $0.3 million higher for the first quarter 2018 compared to the prior year period due to additional headcount and equipment required to support investments in growth areas.
Sales and Marketing 

Sales and marketing expenses include costs associated with the sales and marketing employees, sales agents, product line management, and trade show expenses.
Sales and marketing expenses decreased approximately $0.2 million for the three months ended March 31, 2018 compared to the same period in 2017 primarily due to lower expenses in the Connected Solutions segment, partially offset by higher expenses for the RF Solutions segment.
Sales and marketing expenses for the Connected Solutions segment declined $0.3 million during the three months ended March 31, 2018 compared to the same period in 2017 due to headcount reductions in sales and marketing at the end of the first quarter 2017.
General and Administrative 

General and administrative expenses include costs associated with the general management, finance, human resources, information technology (“IT”), legal, public company costs, and other operating expenses to the extent not otherwise allocated to business segments.
General and administrative expenses decreased $0.3 million for the three months ended March 31, 2018 compared to the same period in 2017.
The decrease is due to a decline in incentive compensation expense of $0.2 million and because the first quarter of 2017 included $0.1 million in corporate expenses related to the CEO transition.
Amortization of Intangible Assets 

Amortization expense within operating expenses was $0.1 million during the three months ended March 31, 2018 and 2017.
Between the first quarter 2017 and the first quarter 2018, there were no changes to intangible assets that impacted amortization expense  

Stock-based compensation expense 



Stock compensation expense was $0.7 million for the three months ended March 31, 2018 and 2017.
The three months ended March 31, 2018 included lower stock compensation expense for service-based restricted stock and stock options, but included expense related to the estimated equity that will be awarded for the 2018 short-term incentive plan (“STIP”).
Operating (Loss) Income by Segment 


We reported a total operating loss of $1.2 million during the three months ended March 31, 2018 compared to operating income of $22 for the same period in 2017.
The operating loss was primarily a result of lower profits for the RF Solutions segment.
We recorded an operating loss of $0.3 million for RF Solutions segment during the three months ended March 31, 2018 compared to income of $1.0 million for the same period in 2017 due to lower revenues.
Operating profit for the Connected Solutions segment was lower by approximately $0.1 million during the three months ended March 31, 2018 compared to the prior year primarily due to a lower gross margin percentage.
Within the corporate function, expenses were $0.3 million lower in the three months ended March 31, 2018 due to lower expenses related to the STIP and because the first quarter 2017 included expenses related to the CEO transition.
Other Income, Net 


Other income, net consists of interest income, foreign exchange losses, and interest expense.
Interest income increased during the three months ended March 31, 2018 compared to the prior year due to higher average interest rates and due to higher investment and cash equivalent balances.
Our investment and cash equivalent balances declined during the first quarter 2018 but were higher compared to the first quarter 2017.
Benefit for Income Taxes 


We recorded an income tax benefit of $0.3 million and $0.1 million for the three months ended March 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively.
The tax benefit recorded for the three months ended March 31, 2018 differed from the statutory rate of 21% by 6% primarily due to permanent differences.
The tax benefit recorded for the three months ended March 31, 2017 differed from the statutory rate of 34% by 302% due to the combination of U.S. pretax losses and foreign pretax profits taxed at lower rates.
The net tax benefit for the three months ended March 31, 2017 included income tax expense of $0.1 million related to tax deficiencies with restricted stock and stock options and $0.1 million income tax benefit related to previously unrecognized tax benefits for research credits.
We maintain valuation allowances due to uncertainties regarding realizability.
At March 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017, we had a valuation allowance of $5.2 million, all of which are related to the United States tax jurisdiction.
On a regular basis, we evaluate the recoverability of deferred tax assets and the need for a valuation allowance.
Such evaluations involve the application of significant judgment.
The valuation allowance at March 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017 relates to net operating losses (“NOLs”) and credits.
We believe that it is more likely than not that these deferred tax assets will not be realized based on the negative evidence of a cumulative three-year loss through March 31, 2018 and expiration of the NOLs.
See Note 11 to the consolidated financial statements for more information related to income taxes.
Net Loss from Discontinued Operations, Net of Income Tax Benefit 



During the quarter ended June 30, 2017, we approved a plan to sell our Network Engineering Services business (“Engineering Services”) and shift our focus toward research and development driven radio frequency (“RF”) products.
We sold the business to Gabe’s Construction on July 31, 2017.
See Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements for information related to discontinued operations.
The results for Engineering Services is reported as discontinued operations for the three months ended March 31, 2017.
The net loss for the three months ended March 31, 2017 includes operating losses, net of income tax benefits.
The loss for the three months ended March 31, 2017 reflects negative gross margin of $0.1 million due to the impact of high fixed costs over low revenues.
Liquidity and Capital Resources 



Liquidity and Capital Resources Overview 

At March 31, 2018, our cash, cash equivalents and investments were approximately $34.7 million, and we had working capital of $57.2 million.
Our primary source of liquidity is cash provided by operations, with short-term swings in liquidity supported by a significant balance of cash and short-term investments.
The balance has fluctuated with cash from operations, acquisitions and divestitures, payment of dividends and the repurchase of our common shares.
Within operating activities, we are historically a net generator of operating funds from our income statement activities.
During the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016, and 2015, our balance sheet provided operating funds.
In periods of expansion, we expect to use cash from our balance sheet.
Within investing activities, capital spending historically ranges between 2.0% and 4.0% of our revenues and the primary use of capital is for manufacturing and development of engineering requirements.
Our capital expenditures during the three months ended March 31, 2018 were approximately 4.0% of revenues.
We historically have significant transfers between investments and cash as we rotate our large cash balances and short-term investment balances between money market funds, which are accounted for as cash equivalents, and other investment vehicles.
We have a history of supplementing our organic revenue with acquisitions of product lines or companies, resulting in significant uses of our cash and short-term investment balances from time to time.
We expect the historical trend for capital spending and the variability caused by moving money between cash and investments and periodic merger and acquisition activity to continue in the future.
Within financing activities, we have historically generated funds from the exercise of stock options and proceeds from the issuance of common stock through the Employee Stock Purchase Plan (“ESPP”) and have historically used funds to repurchase shares of our common stock through our share repurchase programs and through quarterly dividends.
Whether this activity results in our being a net user of funds versus a net generator of funds is largely dependent on our stock price during any given year.
Management believes that our current financial position, which includes $34.7 million in cash and investments and no debt, combined with our historic ability to generate free cash flow (cash flow from operations less capital spending) provide adequate liquidity and working capital to support our operations.
Operating activities used $1.6 million of cash during the three months ended March 31, 2018.
We generated $0.5 million of cash from our income statement activities and used $2.1 million of cash from our balance sheet activities.
Within the balance sheet activities, we used cash due to lower accrued liabilities of $1.8 million and an increase in accounts receivable of $0.4 million, offsetting cash generated from a decline of $0.3 million in inventories.
Accrued liabilities were lower at March 31, 2018 due to the payout of $1.7 million for the 2017 short-term incentive plan.
Accounts receivable were higher despite lower revenues due to longer payment terms granted during the three months ended March 31, 2018 compared to the same period in 2017.
Additionally, a higher percentage of the revenues were generated in the third month of the quarter ended March 31, 2018 compared to the same period in 2017.
U.S. inventories declined during the three months ended March 31, 2018 for the Connected Solutions segment.
Operating activities provided $2.0 million of cash during the three months ended March 31, 2017.
We generated $1.5 million of cash from our income statement activities and $0.5 million of cash from our balance sheet activities.
From the balance sheet activities, we generated cash of $1.8 million from reductions in inventories and $0.8 million from decreases in accounts receivable and used cash of $1.5 million from reductions in accrued liabilities and $0.8 million from reductions in accounts payable.
Inventories declined during the three months ended March 31, 2017 for both the Connected Solutions and RF Solutions segments due to process improvements related to purchasing and forecasting as well as a sequential decrease in revenues.
Accounts receivable declined during the three months ended March 31, 2017 due to the sequential decrease in revenues.
Revenues declined by $0.7 million during for the three months ended March 31, 2017 compared to three months ended December 31, 2016.
