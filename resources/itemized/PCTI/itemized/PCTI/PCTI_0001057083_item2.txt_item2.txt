Overview 

Our second quarter 2019 revenues were $23.5 million and increased by $1.9 million or 8.9% compared to revenues of $21.6 million for the same period in 2018.
Second quarter 2019 revenues increased by $3.4 million or 82.0% to $7.5 million for the test and measurement product line compared to the second quarter 2018 and decreased by $1.5 million or 8.4% to $16.0 million for the antenna product line.
Revenues decreased for the antenna product line due to lower revenues with enterprise Wi-Fi applications and small cell antennas.
Revenues increased for the test and measurement product line due to increased sales of 5G products.
The gross profit of $10.7 million, increased by $2.9 million compared to the same period in 2018 due to both a higher product mix of test and measurement product line revenues and an increase in the gross margin percentage for antenna products.
Primarily based on higher gross profit margins, we recorded an operating income of $0.6 million for the three months ended June 30, 2019 compared to an operating loss of $1.6 million during the second quarter 2018.
Revenues for the six months ended June 30, 2019 were $44.1 million, an increase of $0.8 million, or 1.8% compared to the same period in 2018.
Revenues increased for the test and measurement product line by $4.9 million or 60.6% compared to the same period in 2018 and decreased for the antenna product line during the six months ended June 30, 2019 by $4.1 million or 11.7% due to lower revenues with enterprise Wi-Fi applications and small cell antennas.
Revenues increased for the test and measurement product line due to sales of 5G products.
The gross profit of $19.4 million increased by $3.7 million compared to gross profit for the same period in 2018, due to a higher product mix of test and measurement product revenues and due to an increase in the gross margin percentage for antenna products.
Because of higher gross profit margins, we recorded an operating income of $0.2 million for the six months ended June 30, 2019 as compared to an operating loss of $2.8 million for the same period in 2018.
Description of Business 



PCTEL antenna are primarily sold to original equipment manufacturer (“OEM”) providers where the antennas are designed into the customer’s solution.
Competition in the antenna markets is fragmented.
Competitors include Airgain, Amphenol, Laird, Panorama, and Taoglas.
Our test and measurement products are sold directly to wireless carriers or to OEM providers who integrate our products into their solutions which are then sold to wireless carriers.
Competitors for PCTEL’s test tool products include OEMs such as Anritsu, Berkley Varitronics, Digital Receiver Technology, and Rohde and Schwarz.
Recent Developments 

Effective August 2018, we consolidated our organizational structure to drive growth and address the convergence in the Industrial IoT, public safety, and 4G infrastructure markets and the emergence of new technologies such as 5G (the “Reorganization”).
Our operations, engineering, business development, sales and marketing, and operational general and administrative functions were consolidated into a single enterprise-wide organization.
As a result of the Reorganization, our Chief Executive Officer, as the CODM, began assessing operating profits and identified assets at the enterprise level for resource allocations.
In connection with the Reorganization, the Board of Directors appointed a Chief Operating Officer who maintains regular contact with the CODM to discuss operating activities, financial results, forecasts, and plans for our businesses.
All operating profit and cash flows are measured and managed at the enterprise level.
Until the Reorganization, PCTEL operated in two segments for reporting purposes, Connected Solutions and RF Solutions.
Our CODM assessed operating profits and identified assets for the Connected Solutions and RF Solutions segments for resource allocations.
Each segment had its own general manager as well as its own engineering, business development, sales and marketing, and operational general and administrative functions.
This Form 10-Q does not include segment reporting information; however, we have included revenues and gross profit for the two major product lines (antenna products and test and measurement products) because each product line has a significantly different gross profit profile.
In order to understand our financial results, it is necessary to understand the impact on gross profit of the revenue mix between them.
Tianjin Transition Plan 

On August 7, 2019 the Board of Directors approved a transition plan for our China manufacturing operations.
In order to optimize the cost structure of the antenna product line and increase our competitiveness, we will transition high-volume manufacturing from our Tianjin facility to contract manufacturers in China and elsewhere.
We expect the transition to be substantially completed by the end of our 2020 fiscal year (the “Transition Period”) and we expect to recognize cumulative pre-tax charges of approximately $1.0 million consisting of severance and other transition costs.
It is expected that a total of approximately 140 positions, or approximately 35% of the Company’s full-time global workforce, will be eliminated over the course of the Transition Period.
Approximately $0.9 million of severance costs will be paid in cash.
Other non-cash costs associated with the transition to contract manufacturers include fixed asset dispositions estimated to be $0.1 million.
We anticipate that these charges will be recognized as restructuring expenses during the third and fourth quarters of 2019.
We expect the cash payments for employee separation costs to be made during the second half of 2019 and the first half of 2020.
Results of Operations 

Three and Six Months Ended June 30, 2019 and 2018 


Revenues by Product Line 


Revenues increased 8.9% for the three months ended June 30, 2019 compared to the same period in 2018 and 1.8% for the six months ended June 30, 2019.
For the three months and six months ended June 30, 2019, the decrease in revenues for the antenna product line of 8.4% and 11.7%, compared to the same periods in 2018, was due to lower sales for small cell antennas and for enterprise Wi-Fi applications.
Revenues for the test and measurement product line increased 82.0% and 60.6% for the three and six months ended June 30, 2019 compared to the same periods in 2018 due to sales of test equipment in connection with early deployments of 5G infrastructure in the U.S., Europe and Asia.
Gross Profit by Product Line 


The gross profit percentage increased by 9.4% and 7.7% for the three and six months ended June 30, 2019 compared to the same periods in 2018 because of a higher ratio of revenues from test and measurement products and because of higher gross profits for antenna products.
Higher margin test and measurement products comprised 32.0% of the revenues in the second quarter 2019 compared to 19.2% of the revenues in the same period in 2018 and comprised 29.6% of the revenues in the six months ended June 30, 2019 compared to 18.8% for the same period in 2018.
The gross profit percentage for the antenna product line increased by 6.0% and 4.5% for the three and six months ended June 30, 2019 compared to the same periods in 2018 due to more favorable product mix and due to cost reductions.
Consolidated Operating Expenses 


Research and Development 

Research and development expenses were approximately the same for the three and six months ended June 30, 2019 compared to the same periods in 2018.
Spending on investments for 5G test and measurement equipment and for wireless products development for Industrial IoT offset the impact of cost reductions from 2018.
Sales and Marketing 

Sales and marketing expenses include costs associated with the sales and marketing employees, sales agents, product line management, and trade show expenses.
Sales and marketing expenses were approximately the same for the three months ended June 30, 2019 compared to the same period in 2018 and decreased $0.2 million for the six months ended June 30, 2019 compared to the same period in 2018.
For the six months ended June 30, 2019, higher corporate marketing expenses offset lower expenses for sales headcount in North America.
General and Administrative 

General and administrative expenses include costs associated with the general management, finance, human resources, IT, legal, public company costs, and other operating expenses to the extent not otherwise allocated to business segments.
General and administrative expenses increased by $0.8 million for the three months ended June 30, 2019 compared to the same period in 2018 as cash-based incentive compensation expense increased $0.4 million, equity-based compensation expense increased $0.3 million and other corporate expenses increased by $0.1 million.
General and administrative expenses increased by $1.1 million for the six months ended June 30, 2019 compared to the same period in 2018 as cash-based incentive compensation expense increased by $0.6 million, equity-based compensation expense increased by $0.4 million and corporate expenses increased by $0.3 million, offsetting $0.2 million in reductions in executive management related to the Reorganization in 2018.
Amortization of Intangible Assets 

Amortization expense within operating expenses was lower by approximately $0.1 million for the three and six months ended June 30, 2019 compared to the same periods in 2018 because certain intangible assets became fully amortized during 2018 and the first quarter 2019.
Stock-based compensation expense 



Stock compensation expense was higher by $0.3 million and $0.5 million for the three and six months ended June 30, 2019, respectively, compared to the same periods in 2018 primarily due to expense accrued for our short-term incentive plan (“2019 STIP”).
Under the 2019 STIP, certain executive and managers will be paid 50% in cash and 50% in shares of the Company’s stock.
The incentive awards for all other participants under the 2019 STIP will be 100% in cash.
Other Income, Net 


Other income, net consists of interest income, foreign exchange losses, and interest expense.
Interest income from short-term investment securities increased during the three and six months ended June 30, 2019 compared to the prior year periods, primarily due to higher average interest rates.
Expense (Benefit) for Income Taxes 


We recorded income tax expense of $17 for the six months ended June 30, 2019, and an income tax benefit of $0.5 million for the six months ended June 30, 2018.
The tax expense for the six months ended June 30, 2019 was lower than the statutory rate of 21% by approximately 20%, because we maintain a full valuation allowance on our deferred tax assets.
The tax benefit recorded for the six months ended June 30, 2018 was higher than the statutory rate by approximately 5% due to permanent differences and estimated research credits.
We maintain a full valuation allowance on our deferred tax assets due to uncertainties regarding realization.
Virtually all of our deferred tax assets relate to the United States tax jurisdiction.
On a regular basis, we evaluate the recoverability of deferred tax assets and the need for a valuation allowance.
Such evaluations involve the application of significant judgment.
We considered multiple factors in our evaluation of the need for a valuation allowance.
The full valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets was $14.5 million at June 30, 2019 and December 31, 2018.
At December 31, 2018, our cumulative loss position for the past three years and our 2018 performance versus our 2018 projections were considered significant negative evidence which was difficult to overcome on a “more likely than not” standard through objectively verifiable data.
We recorded positive pre-tax income for the six months ended June 30, 2019, but nevertherless recorded cumulative three-year pre-tax losses as of June 30, 2019.
While we believe our financial outlook remains positive, under the accounting standards, objective verifiable evidence will have greater weight than subjective evidence such as our projections for future growth.
The analysis that we prepared to determine the valuation allowance required  


significant judgment and assumptions regarding future market conditions as well as forecasts for profits, taxable income, and taxable income by jurisdiction.
Due to the sensitivity of the analysis, changes to the assumptions in subsequent periods could have a material effect on the valuation allowance.
See Note 11 to the consolidated financial statements for more information related to income taxes.
Net Income (Loss) 

For the three months ended June 30, 2019 we recorded net income of $0.9 million compared to a net loss of $1.2 million for the same period in 2018, and for the six months ended June 30, 2019 we recorded net income of $0.6 million compared to a net loss of $2.1 million for the same period in 2018.
For both the three and six months ended June 30, 2019 higher gross margins as well as other income offset higher operating expenses Gross margins increased during the three and six months ended June 30, 2019 compared to same periods in 2018 because of a higher mix of test and measurement product revenues and due to an improvement in the gross margin percentage for antenna products.
Liquidity and Capital Resources 



Overview 

Our primary source of liquidity is cash provided by operations, with short-term swings in liquidity supported by a significant balance of cash and short-term investments.
The balance has fluctuated with cash from operations, acquisitions and divestitures, payment of dividends and the repurchase of our common shares.
Within operating activities, we are historically a net generator of operating funds from our income statement activities.
During the six months ended June 30, 2019, our balance sheet provided operating funds.
In periods of expansion, we expect to use cash from our balance sheet.
Within investing activities, capital spending historically ranges between 2.0% and 4.0% of our revenues and the primary use of capital is for manufacturing, engineering, and product development.
Our capital expenditures during the six months ended June 30, 2019 were approximately 2.2% of revenues.
We historically have significant transfers between investments and cash as we rotate our large cash balances and short-term investment balances between money market funds, which are accounted for as cash equivalents, and other investment vehicles.
We have a history of supplementing our organic revenue with acquisitions of product lines or companies, resulting in significant uses of our cash and short-term investment balances from time to time.
We expect the historical trend for capital spending and the variability caused by moving money between cash and investments and periodic merger and acquisition activity to continue in the future.
Within financing activities, we have historically generated funds from the exercise of stock options and proceeds from the issuance of common stock through the Employee Stock Purchase Plan and have historically used funds to repurchase shares of our common stock through our share repurchase programs and through quarterly dividends.
Whether this activity results in our being a net user of funds versus a net generator of funds is largely dependent on our stock price during any given year.
At June 30, 2019, our cash, cash equivalents, and investments were approximately $36.8 million, and we had working capital of $54.2 million.
Management believes that our cash and investments provide adequate liquidity and working capital to support our operations given our historic ability to generate free cash flow (cash flow from operations less capital spending) and our lack of debt.
Operating activities generated $5.1 million of cash during the six months ended June 30, 2019.
We generated $4.9 million of cash from our income statement activities and generated $0.2 million from the balance sheet.
The balance sheet generated net cash primarily because an increase in accrued liabilities offset other net uses of cash.
Accrued liabilities increased by $0.7 million primarily due to higher bonus accruals.
A reduction in prepaid expenses provided $0.4 million in cash flow primarily with amortization of annual software license agreements.
Inventories increased by $0.3 million driven by test and measurement products for 5G technologies.
Accounts receivable increased by $0.2 million due to an increase in revenue for the six months ended June 30, 2019 compared to the same period in 2018.
Operating activities generated $2.0 million of cash during the six months ended June 30, 2018.
We generated $1.4 million of cash from our income statement activities and generated $0.6 million of cash from our balance sheet activities.
Within the balance sheet activities, we generated cash due to an increase in accounts payable of $2.7 million and net collections of accounts receivable of $0.5 million, offsetting use of cash for net payments of accrued liabilities of $2.1 million and higher inventories of $0.8 million.
Accrued liabilities were lower at June 30, 2018, primarily due to the payout of $1.7 million for the 2017 short-term incentive plan.
Accounts payable was higher at June 30, 2018 because we extended the payment cycle for certain vendors to match accounts receivable collections and due to the timing of purchases during the second quarter of 2018.
Inventories were higher for the antenna product line in both the U.S. and China.
Our investing activities used $2.8 million of cash during the six months ended June 30, 2019.
During the six months ended June 30, 2019, redemptions and maturities of our short-term investments provided $25.0 million in funds and we rotated $26.8 million of cash into new short-term investments.
We used $1.0 million for capital expenditures during the six months ended June 30, 2019.
Our investing activities provided $2.1 million of cash during the six months ended June 30, 2018.
During the six months ended June 30, 2018, redemptions and maturities of our short-term investments provided $26.3 million in funds and we rotated $22.7 million of cash into new short-term investments.
We used $1.5 million for capital expenditures during the six months ended June 30, 2018.
Capital expenditures included equipment for our new development office in Akron, Ohio.
We used $2.5 million in cash for financing activities during the six months ended June 30, 2019.
We used $2.0 million for quarterly cash dividends paid in February 2019 and May 2019.
We received $0.3 million in proceeds from the purchase of shares through our ESPP and we used $0.7 million for payroll taxes related to stock-based compensation.
The tax payments related to restricted stock awards.
We used $2.0 million in cash for financing activities during the six months ended June 30, 2018.
We used $2.0 million for cash dividends paid in February 2018 and May 2018.
We received $0.4 million in proceeds from the purchase of shares through our ESPP and we used $0.3 million for payroll taxes related to stock-based compensation and $0.1 million on payments for capital leases.
The tax payments related to our stock issued for restricted stock awards

Contractual Obligations and Commercial Commitments 

We had purchase obligations of $10.0 million and $10.8 million at June 30, 2019 and December 31, 2018, respectively, for the purchase of inventory, as well as for other goods and services in the ordinary course of business.
Balances for purchases currently recognized as liabilities on the balance sheet are excluded.
We had a liability of $0.7 million related to income tax uncertainties at June 30, 2019 and December 31, 2018.
We do not know the timing of the settlement of this liability.
