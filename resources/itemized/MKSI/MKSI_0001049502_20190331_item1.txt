Basis of Presentation
The terms MKS and the Company refer to MKS Instruments, Inc. and its subsidiaries.
All intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.
The interim financial data as of March 31, 2019, and for the three months ended March 31, 2019 are unaudited; however, in the opinion of MKS, the interim data includes all adjustments, consisting of normal recurring adjustments, necessary for a fair statement of the results for the interim periods.
The condensed consolidated balance sheet presented as of December 31, 2018 has been derived from the consolidated audited financial statements as of that date.
The unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements presented herein have been prepared in accordance with the instructions to Form 10-Q and do not include all of the information and note disclosures required by United States generally accepted accounting principles (U.S.
GAAP).
The unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in the MKS Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018 filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on February 26, 2019.
The preparation of these unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent liabilities at the date of the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.
On an on-going basis, management evaluates its estimates and judgments, including those related to revenue recognition, stock-based compensation, inventory, intangible assets, goodwill and other long-lived assets, warranty liabilities, pension liabilities, acquisition expenses, income taxes and investments.
Management bases its estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources.
Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.
Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements
In October 2018, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2018-16, Derivatives and Hedging (Topic 815). This standard permits the use of the Overnight Index Swap Rate (OIS) based on the Secured Overnight Financing Rate as a U.S. benchmark interest rate for hedge accounting purposes under Topic 815 in addition to the interest rates on direct treasury obligations of the U.S. government, the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) swap rate, the OIS rate based on the Federal Funds Effective Rate and the Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association Municipal Swap Rate.
This standard is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within those fiscal years.
The Company adopted this ASU during the first quarter of 2019 and the adoption of this ASU did not have a material impact on the Companys consolidated financial statements.
In August 2017, the FASB issued ASU 2017-12, Derivatives and Hedging (Topic 815). This standard better aligns an entitys risk management activities and financial reporting for hedging relationships through changes to both the designation and measurement guidance for qualifying hedging relationships and the presentation of hedge results.
The provisions of this ASU are effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within those fiscal years.
The Company adopted this ASU during the first quarter of 2019 and the adoption of this ASU did not have a material impact on the Companys consolidated financial statements.
In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02, Leases.
This standard requires the recognition of lease assets and liabilities for all leases, with certain exceptions, on the balance sheet.
This ASU is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within those fiscal years.
The Company adopted ASU 2016-02 on January 1, 2019, and used the effective date as its date of initial application.
As such, the Company did not adjust prior period amounts.
The Company also elected to adopt the package of practical expedients upon transition, which permits companies to not reassess lease identification, classification, and initial direct costs under ASU 2016-02 for leases that commenced prior to the effective date.
The Company implemented internal controls and a lease accounting information system to enable

 preparation on adoption.
Upon adoption, the Company recorded a cumulative effect of initially applying this new standard, resulting in the addition of $71,042 of right-of-use assets and $20,192 and $54,147 of short-term and long-term lease liabilities, respectively.
The right-of-use asset is net of the deferred rent liability, prepaid rent and a net favorable lease asset which were re-classified to the right-of-use asset upon adoption of the standard.
For additional information on the required disclosures related to the impact of adopting this standard, see Note 3 to the Consolidated Condensed Financial Statements.
Leases
The Company has operating leases for real estate and non-real estate, which are comprised of automobiles, in North America, Europe, and Asia.
The Company does not have any finance leases.
The Company has lease arrangements with lease and non-lease components, has elected to account for the lease and non-lease components as a single lease component, and has allocated all of the contract consideration to the lease component only.
The Company has existing net leases in which the non-lease components (e.g.
common area maintenance, maintenance, consumables, etc.)
are paid separately from rent based on actual costs incurred.
Therefore, non-lease components are not included in the right-of-use asset and lease liability and are reflected as expenses in the periods incurred.
The Company has existing leases that include variable lease and non-lease components that are not included in the right-of-use asset and lease liability, and are reflected as expenses in the periods incurred.
Such payments primarily include common area maintenance charges and increases in rent payments that are driven by factors such as future changes in an index (e.g., the Consumer Price Index).
A right-of-use asset of $65,628, short-term lease liability of $19,459 and long-term lease liability of $49,392 were reflected on the balance sheet as of March 31, 2019.

MKS INSTRUMENTS, INC.
NOTES TO UNAUDITED CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
The tables above, which show the gross unrealized gains and (losses) aggregated by investment category for available-for-sale investments as of March 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018, reflect the inclusion within short-term investments of investments with contractual maturities greater than one year from the date of purchase.
Management has the ability, if necessary, to liquidate any of its investments in order to meet the Companys liquidity needs in the next 12 months.
Accordingly, those investments with contractual maturities greater than one year from the date of purchase are classified as short-term on the accompanying balance sheets.
The Company reviews and evaluates its investments for any indication of possible impairment.
Based on this review, the Company has determined that the unrealized losses related to these investments at March 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018 were temporary.
Interest income is accrued as earned.
Dividend income is recognized as income on the date the stock trades ex-dividend. The cost of marketable securities sold is determined by the specific identification method.
Realized gains or losses are reflected in income and were not material for the three months ended March 31, 2019 and 2018.
Fair Value Measurements
In accordance with the provisions of fair value accounting, a fair value measurement assumes that the transaction to sell an asset or transfer a liability occurs in the principal market for the asset or liability or, in the absence of a principal market, the most advantageous market for the asset or liability and defines fair value based upon an exit price model.
 Level 1   Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities assessed as of the reporting date.
Active markets are those in which transactions for the asset or liability occur in sufficient frequency and volume to provide pricing information on an ongoing basis.
 Level 2   Observable inputs other than Level 1 prices, such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities; quoted prices in markets that are not active; or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities.
Level 2 assets and liabilities include debt securities with quoted prices that are traded less frequently than exchange-traded instruments or securities or derivative contracts that are valued using a pricing model with inputs that are observable in the market or can be derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data.
Table of Contents
MKS INSTRUMENTS, INC.
NOTES TO UNAUDITED CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
 Level 3   Unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the fair value of the assets or liabilities.
Level 3 assets and liabilities include financial instruments whose value is determined using pricing models, discounted cash flow methodologies, or similar techniques, as well as instruments for which the determination of fair value requires significant management judgment or estimation.
In certain cases, the inputs used to measure fair value may fall into different levels of the fair value hierarchy.
In such cases, the Company categorizes such assets and liabilities based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety.
The Companys assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement in its entirety requires judgment and considers factors specific to the asset or liability.

Money Market Funds
Money market funds are cash and cash equivalents and are classified within Level 1 of the fair value hierarchy.
Available-For-Sale Investments
Available-for-sale investments consisted of time deposits, certificates of deposit, bankers acceptance drafts, asset-backed securities (which include auto loans, credit card receivables and equipment trust receivables), commercial paper, corporate obligations, U.S. treasury obligations, U.S. agency obligations and group insurance contracts.
The Company measures its debt and equity investments at fair value.
The Companys available-for-sale investments are classified within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy.
Israeli Pension Assets
Israeli pension assets represent investments in mutual funds, government securities and other time deposits.
These investments are set aside for the retirement benefit of the employees at the Companys Israeli subsidiaries.
These funds are classified within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy.
Derivatives
As a result of the Companys global operating activities, the Company is exposed to market risks from changes in foreign currency exchange rates and variable interest rates, which may adversely affect its operating results and financial position.
When deemed appropriate, the Company minimizes its risks from foreign currency exchange rate and interest rate fluctuations through the use of derivative financial instruments.
The principal market in which the Company executes its foreign currency contracts and interest rate swaps is the institutional market in an over-the-counter environment with a relatively high level of price transparency.
The market participants usually are large commercial banks.
The forward foreign currency exchange contracts and interest rate hedge are valued using broker quotations or market transactions and are classified within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy.
Derivatives
The Company enters into derivative instruments for risk management purposes only, including derivatives designated as hedging instruments and those utilized as economic hedges.
The Company operates internationally and, in the normal course of business, is exposed to fluctuations in interest rates and foreign exchange rates.
These fluctuations can increase the costs of financing, investing and operating the business.
The Company has used derivative instruments, such as forward foreign currency exchange contracts, to manage certain foreign currency exposure, and interest rate swaps to manage interest rate exposure.
By nature, all financial instruments involve market and credit risks.
The Company enters into derivative instruments with major investment grade financial institutions, for which no collateral is required.
The Company has policies to monitor the credit risk of these counterparties.
While there can be no assurance, the Company does not anticipate any material non-performance by any of these counterparties.
Interest Rate Swap Agreement
On September 30, 2016, the Company entered into an interest rate swap agreement to fix the rate on approximately 50% of its then-outstanding balance under the Credit Agreement, as described further in Note 11.
This hedge fixes the interest rate paid on the hedged debt at 1.198% per annum plus the applicable credit spread, which was 2.0% as of March 31, 2019, through September 30, 2020.
The interest rate swap is recorded at fair value on the balance sheet and changes in the fair value are recognized in other comprehensive income (loss) (OCI).
To the extent that this arrangement is no longer an effective hedge, any ineffectiveness measured in the hedging relationship is recorded currently in earnings in the period it occurs.
At March 31, 2019, the notional amount of this transaction was $290,000 and had a fair value of $4,459.
At December 31, 2018, the notional amount of this transaction was $290,000 and had a fair value of $6,083.
Foreign Exchange Contracts
The Company hedges a portion of its forecasted foreign currency-denominated intercompany sales of inventory, over a maximum period of eighteen months, using forward foreign exchange contracts accounted for as cash-flow hedges related to Japanese, South Korean, British, Euro

 and Taiwanese currencies.
To the extent these derivatives are effective in off-setting the variability of the hedged cash flows, and otherwise meet the hedge accounting criteria, changes in the derivatives fair value are not included in current earnings but are included in OCI in stockholders equity.
These changes in fair value will subsequently be reclassified into earnings, as applicable, when the forecasted transaction occurs.
To the extent that a previously designated hedging transaction is no longer an effective hedge, any ineffectiveness measured in the hedging relationship is recorded currently in earnings in the period it occurs.
The cash flows resulting from forward exchange contracts are classified in the consolidated statements of cash flows as part of cash flows from operating activities.
The Company does not enter into derivative instruments for trading or speculative purposes.
Represents the receivable (payable) amount included in the consolidated balance sheet.
The derivative assets of $3,492 and $2,485 as of March 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018, respectively, related to foreign exchange contracts and are classified in other current assets in the consolidated balance sheet.
The derivative liabilities of $322 and $1,168 as of March 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018, respectively, are classified in other current liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet.
These foreign exchange contracts are subject to a master netting agreement with one financial institution.
However, the Company has elected to record these contracts on a gross basis in the balance sheet.
The foreign currency interest rate hedge assets of $4,459 and $6,083 as of March 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018, respectively, are classified in other assets in the consolidated balance sheet.
The net amount of existing gains as of March 31, 2019 that the Company expects to reclassify from OCI into earnings within the next twelve months is immaterial.

Effective portion classified in cost of products for the three March 31, 2019 and 2018.
The tax effect of the gains or losses reclassified from accumulated OCI into income is immaterial.
The Company enters into foreign exchange contracts to hedge against changes in the balance sheet for certain subsidiaries to mitigate the risk associated with certain foreign currency transactions in the ordinary course of business.
These derivatives are not designated as hedging instruments and gains or losses from these derivatives are recorded immediately in other (expense) income.
Inventories
Acquisitions
Electro Scientific Industries, Inc.
On February 1, 2019, the Company completed its acquisition of Electro Scientific Industries, Inc. (ESI) pursuant to an Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of October 29, 2018 (the Merger Agreement), by and among the Company, EAS Equipment, Inc., formerly a Delaware corporation and a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, and ESI (the ESI Merger).
At the effective time of the ESI Merger and pursuant to the terms and conditions of the Merger Agreement, each share of ESIs common stock that was issued and outstanding immediately prior to the effective time of the ESI Merger was converted into the right to receive $30.00 in cash, without interest and subject to deduction of any required withholding tax.
The aggregate consideration of approximately $1,032,671, excluding related transaction fees and expenses, and non-cash consideration related to the exchange of share-based awards of approximately $30,630 for a total purchase consideration of approximately $1,063,301.
The Company funded the payment of the aggregate consideration with a combination of the Companys available cash on hand and the proceeds from the Companys senior secured term loan facility described in Note 11.

NOTES TO UNAUDITED CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Represents cash paid of $30.00 per share for approximately 34,422,361 shares of ESI common stock, without interest and subject to a deduction for any required withholding tax.
Represents the vested but not issued portion of ESI share-based compensation awards as of the acquisition date of February 1, 2019.
Under the acquisition method of accounting, the total estimated acquisition consideration is allocated to the acquired tangible and intangible assets and assumed liabilities of ESI based on their fair values as of the acquisition date.
Any excess of the acquisition consideration over the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed is allocated to goodwill.
The Company expects that none of such goodwill and intangible assets will be deductible for tax purposes.
The fair value write-up of acquired finished goods inventory and demonstration inventory was $8,383, the amount of which will be expensed over the period during which the acquired inventory is sold.
Accordingly, for the three months ended March 31, 2019, the Company recorded a $5,140 incremental cost of sales charge associated with the fair value write-up of inventory acquired in the ESI Merger.
The fair value write-up of acquired property, plant and equipment of $26,667 will be amortized over the estimated useful life of the applicable assets.
Property, plant and equipment is valued at its value-in-use, unless there was a known plan to dispose of the asset.
The acquired intangible assets are being amortized on a straight-line basis, which approximates the economic use of the asset.
Table of Contents
MKS INSTRUMENTS, INC.
NOTES TO UNAUDITED CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
The net fair value of the acquired intangibles was determined using the income approach.
In performing these valuations, the key underlying probability-adjusted assumptions of the discounted cash flows were projected revenues, gross margin expectations and operating cost estimates.
The valuations were based on the information that was available as of the acquisition date and the expectations and assumptions that have been deemed reasonable by the Companys management.
There are inherent uncertainties and management judgment required in these determinations.
This acquisition resulted in a purchase price that exceeded the estimated fair value of tangible and intangible assets, the excess amount of which was allocated to goodwill.
While the Company uses its best estimates and assumptions as part of the purchase price allocation process to value the assets acquired and liabilities assumed on the acquisition date, its estimates and assumptions are subject to refinement.
Fair value estimates are based on a complex series of judgments about future events and uncertainties and rely heavily on estimates and assumptions.
The judgments used to determine the estimated fair value assigned to each class of assets acquired and liabilities assumed, as well as asset lives, can materially impact the Companys results of operations.
The finalization of the purchase accounting assessment will result in a change in the valuation of assets acquired and liabilities assumed and may have a material impact on the Companys results of operations and financial position.
As a result, during the measurement period, which may be up to one year from the acquisition date, the Company records adjustments to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed with a corresponding offset to goodwill to reflect additional information received about facts and circumstances which existed at the date of acquisition.
The Company records adjustments to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed subsequent to the purchase price allocation period in the Companys operating results in the period in which the adjustments are determined.
The size and breadth of the ESI Merger will necessitate the use of this measurement period to adequately analyze and assess a number of the factors used in establishing the fair value of certain tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed as of the acquisition date and the related tax impacts of any changes made.
Any potential adjustments made could be material in relation to the preliminary values presented above.
Certain executives from ESI had severance provisions in their respective ESI employment agreements.
The agreements included terms that were accounted for as dual-trigger arrangements.
Through the Companys acquisition accounting, the expense relating to these benefits was recognized in the combined entitys financial statements.
The Company recorded costs of $2,701 and $14,023 in acquisition and integration costs as compensation expense and stock-based compensation expense, respectively, for the three months ended March 31, 2019 associated with these severance provisions.
The restricted stock units and stock appreciation rights that were eligible for accelerated vesting if the executive exercised his or her rights but were not issued as of each reporting period-end, will be excluded from the computation of basic earnings per share and included in the computation of diluted earnings per share for such reporting period.
In addition, the Company recorded $6,764 in acquisition and integration costs, which were primarily advisory services costs.

The estimated tax impact of the above adjustments.
Goodwill and Intangible Assets
Goodwill
The Companys methodology for allocating the purchase price relating to purchase acquisitions is determined through established and generally accepted valuation techniques.
Goodwill is measured as the excess of the cost of the acquisition over the sum of the amounts assigned to tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired less liabilities assumed.
The Company assigns assets acquired (including goodwill) and liabilities assumed to one or more reporting units as of the date of acquisition.
Typically acquisitions relate to a single reporting unit and thus do not require the allocation of goodwill to multiple reporting units.
If the products obtained in an acquisition are assigned to multiple reporting units, the goodwill is distributed to the respective reporting units as part of the purchase price allocation process.
Goodwill and purchased intangible assets with indefinite useful lives are not amortized, but are reviewed for impairment annually during the fourth quarter of each fiscal year and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be

 recoverable.
The process of evaluating the potential impairment of goodwill and intangible assets requires significant judgment.
The Company regularly monitors current business conditions and other factors including, but not limited to, adverse industry or economic trends, restructuring actions and lower projections of profitability that may impact future operating results.
During the three months ended March 31, 2019, the Company recorded $471,403 of goodwill related to the ESI Merger.
Intangible Assets
During the three months ended March 31, 2019, the Company recorded $318,600 of separately identified intangible assets related to the ESI Merger, of which $276,400 was completed technology, $25,400 was customer relationships and $16,800 was trademarks, trade names and backlog.
Separately, on January 1, 2019, the Company reclassified $6,428 of gross favorable lease assets and $3,445 of related accumulated amortization from patents, trademarks, trade names and other to the right-of-use asset line in the balance sheet.

Term Loan Credit Agreement
The Company subsequently entered into four separate repricing amendments to the 2016 Term Loan Facility, which decreased the applicable margin for LIBOR borrowings from 4.0% to 1.75%, with a LIBOR rate floor of 0.75%.
As a consequence of the pricing of the 2019 Incremental Term Loan Facility (defined below), the applicable margin for the 2016 Term Loan Facility was increased to 2.00% (from 1.75%) with respect to LIBOR borrowings and 1.00% (from 0.75%) with respect to base rate borrowings.
The interest rate on the 2016 Term Loan Facility as of March 31, 2019 was 4.5%.
On September 30, 2016, the Company entered into an interest rate swap agreement, which has a maturity date of September 30, 2020, to fix the rate on $335,000 of the then-outstanding balance of the 2016 Term Loan Facility.
The rate is fixed at 1.198% per annum plus the applicable credit spread, which was 2.0% at March 31, 2019.
At March 31, 2019, the notional amount of this transaction was $290,000 and had a fair value of $4,459.

As of March 31, 2019, after total principal prepayments of $425,000 and regularly scheduled principal payments of $6,536, the total outstanding principal balance of the 2016 Term Loan Facility was $348,464.
As a result of making these prepayments, the Company is no longer required to make any regularly scheduled principal payments on the 2016 Term Loan Facility until the maturity date of the loan.
The Company incurred $28,747 of deferred finance fees, original issue discount and repricing fees related to the term loans under the 2016 Term Loan Facility, which are included in long-term debt in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets and are being amortized to interest expense over the estimated life of the term loans using the effective interest method.
A portion of these fees have been accelerated in connection with the various debt prepayments during 2016, 2017 and 2018.
As of March 31, 2019, the remaining balance of the deferred finance fees, original issue discount and repricing fees related to the 2016 Term Loan Facility was $3,980.
On February 1, 2019, in connection with the completion of the ESI Merger, the Company entered into an amendment (Amendment No.
5) to the Credit Agreement.
Amendment No.
5 provided an additional tranche B-5 term loan commitment in the principal amount of $650,000 (the 2019 Incremental Term Loan Facility), all of which was drawn down in connection with the closing of the ESI Merger.
Pursuant to Amendment No.
5, the Company also effectuated certain amendments to the Credit Agreement which make certain of the negative covenants and other provisions less restrictive.
The 2019 Incremental Term Loan Facility matures on February 1, 2026 and bears interest at a rate per annum equal to, at the Companys option, a base rate or LIBOR rate (as described above) plus, in each case, an applicable margin equal to 1.25% with respect to base rate borrowings and 2.25% with respect to LIBOR borrowings.
The 2019 Incremental Term Loan Facility was issued with original issue discount of 1.00% of the principal amount thereof.
The Company incurred $11,362 of deferred finance fees and original issue discount fees related to the term loans under the 2019 Incremental Term Loan Facility, which are included in long-term debt in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets and are being amortized to interest expense over the estimated life of the term loans using the effective interest method.
As of March 31, 2019, the remaining balance of the deferred finance fees and original issue discount related to the 2019 Incremental Term Loan Facility was $11,244.
The Company is required to make scheduled quarterly payments each equal to 0.25% of the original principal amount of the 2019 Incremental Term Loan Facility, with the balance due on February 1, 2026.
If on or prior to the date that is six months after the closing date of Amendment No.
5, the Company prepays any loans under the 2019 Incremental Term Loan Facility in connection with a repricing transaction, the Company must pay a prepayment premium of 1.00% of the aggregate principal amount of the loans so prepaid.
At March 31, 2019, the total balance outstanding of the 2019 Incremental Term Loan Facility was $650,000 and the interest rate was 4.7%.

Income Taxes
The Companys effective tax rates for the three months ended March 31, 2019 and 2018 were 18.8% and 17.1%, respectively.
The effective tax rate for the three months ended March 31, 2019 and the related income tax expense were lower than the U.S. statutory tax rate due to the U.S. deduction for foreign derived intangible income, the federal tax credit for research activities and the geographic mix of income earned by the Companys international subsidiaries being taxed at rates lower than the U.S. statutory tax rate, offset by the global intangible low-taxed income inclusion, the limitation on the deduction of executive compensation and state income taxes.
The Companys effective tax rate for the three months ended March 31, 2018 and the related income tax expense were lower than the U.S. statutory tax rate mainly due to the geographic mix of income earned by the Companys international subsidiaries being taxed at rates lower than the U.S. statutory tax rate, windfall benefits of stock compensation and the deduction for foreign derived intangible income offset by the tax effects from global intangible low-taxed income and state income taxes.
As of March 31, 2019, the total amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits, which excludes interest and penalties, was approximately $40,725.
At December 31, 2018, the total amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits, which excludes interest and penalties, was approximately $32,684.
The net increase was primarily attributable to the addition of historical gross unrecognized tax benefits for ESI as a result of the ESI Merger during the quarter ended March 31, 2019.
As of March 31, 2019, excluding interest and penalties, there were approximately $33,085 of net unrecognized tax benefits that, if recognized, would impact the Companys effective tax rate.
The Company accrues interest expense, and if applicable, penalties, for any uncertain tax positions.
Interest and penalties are classified as a component of income tax expense.
As of March 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018, the Company had accrued interest on unrecognized tax benefits of approximately $543 and $568, respectively.
Over the next 12 months it is reasonably possible that the Company may recognize approximately $1,452 of previously net unrecognized tax benefits, excluding interest and penalties, related to various U.S. federal, state and foreign tax positions primarily as a result of the expiration of certain statutes of limitations.
The Company and its subsidiaries are subject to examination by U.S. federal, state and foreign tax authorities.
The U.S. Internal Revenue Service commenced an examination of the Companys U.S. federal income tax filings for tax years 2015 and 2016 during the quarter ended September 30, 2017.
This audit was effectively settled during the quarter ended March 31, 2018, and the impact was not material.
Also during the quarter ended March 31, 2018, the Company received notification from the U.S. Internal Revenue Service of their intent to audit its U.S. subsidiary, Newport Corporation, for tax year 2015.
This audit commenced during the quarter ended June 30, 2018 and there have been no proposed adjustments through March 31, 2019.
The U.S. statute of limitations remains open for tax years 2015 through present.
The statute of limitations for the Companys tax filings in other jurisdictions varies between fiscal years 2013 through present.
The Company also has certain federal credit carry-forwards and state tax loss and credit carry-forwards that are open to examination for tax years 2000 through the present.

Net Income Per Share
Basic earnings per share (EPS) is computed by dividing income available to common stockholders by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during the period.
The computation of diluted EPS is similar to the computation of basic EPS except that the denominator is increased to include the number of additional common shares that would have been outstanding (using the treasury stock method) if securities containing potentially dilutive common shares (restricted stock units and stock appreciation rights) had been converted to such common shares, and if such assumed conversion is dilutive.
For the three months ended March 31, 2019 and 2018 there were approximately 128,200 and 380 weighted-average restricted stock units, respectively, that would have had an anti-dilutive effect on EPS, and would thus need to be excluded from the computation of diluted weighted-average shares.
Stock-Based Compensation
The Company grants restricted stock units (RSUs) to employees and directors under the 2014 Stock Incentive Plan (the 2014 Plan).
The 2014 Plan is administered by the Compensation Committee of the Companys Board of Directors.
The 2014 Plan is intended to attract and retain employees and directors, and to provide an incentive for these individuals to assist the Company to achieve long-range performance goals and to enable these individuals to participate in the long-term growth of the Company.
   
all RSUs that vest based solely on the satisfaction of service conditions, granted under any ESI equity plan, arrangement or agreement (ESI Plan) that were outstanding immediately prior to the effective time of the ESI Merger, and as to which shares of ESI common stock were not fully distributed in connection with the closing of the ESI Merger,
   
all RSUs that were granted subject to vesting based on both the achievement of performance goals and the satisfaction of service conditions granted under any ESI Plan that were outstanding immediately prior to the effective time of the ESI Merger, and
   
all stock appreciation rights (SARs) granted under any ESI Plan, whether vested or unvested, that were outstanding immediately prior to the effective time of the ESI Merger and held by an individual who was a service provider of ESI as of the date on which the effective time of the ESI Merger occurred.
As of the effective time of the ESI Merger, based on a formula in the Merger Agreement, (a) such RSUs were converted automatically into RSUs with respect to 736,133 shares of the Companys common stock (the Assumed RSUs), and (b) all SARs were converted automatically into SARs with respect to 12,787 shares of the Companys common stock (the Assumed SARs).
Included in the total number of assumed RSUs are 326,283 shares of the Companys common stock for employees and outside directors that are part of the ESI Deferred Compensation plan.
These shares will not become issued shares until their respective release dates.
The shares of the Companys common stock that are subject to the Assumed SARs and the Assumed RSUs are issuable pursuant to the Companys 2014 Plan.

The 748,920 shares of the Companys common stock that are issuable pursuant to the Assumed RSUs and the Assumed SARs under the Companys 2014 Plan were registered under the Securities Act of 1933 on the Registration Statement on Form S-8.
These shares are in addition to the 18,000,000 shares of the Companys common stock reserved for issuance under the Companys 2014 Plan and previously registered under the Securities Act of 1933 on the Registration Statement on Form S-8.
During the three months ended March 31, 2019, the Company granted 182,212 RSUs with a weighted average grant date fair value of $82.58.
During the three months ended March 31, 2018, the Company granted 122,831 RSUs with a weighted average grant date fair value of $109.62.
There were no SARs granted during the three months ended March 31, 2019 or 2018.
At March 31, 2019, the total compensation expense related to unvested stock-based awards granted to employees and directors under the 2014 Plan that had not been recognized was $31,356, net of estimated forfeitures.
The future compensation expense for time-based awards is recognized on a straight-line basis and the future compensation expense for performance-based awards is recognized using the accelerated graded vesting method, both of which expense over the requisite service period, net of estimated forfeitures, except for retirement eligible employees, in which case the Company expenses the fair value of the grant in the period the grant is issued.
The Company considers many factors when estimating expected forfeitures, including types of awards and historical experience.
Actual results and future changes in estimates may differ substantially from the Companys current estimates.

The lawsuits named as defendants the Company, Newport, Merger Sub, and certain then current and former members of Newports board of directors.
Both complaints alleged that Newport directors breached their fiduciary duties to Newports stockholders by agreeing to sell Newport through an inadequate and unfair process, which led to inadequate and unfair consideration, by agreeing to unfair deal protection devices and by omitting material information from the proxy statement.
The complaints also alleged that the Company, Newport, and Merger Sub aided and abetted the directors alleged breaches of their fiduciary duties.
The complaints sought injunctive relief, including to enjoin or rescind the Newport Merger Agreement, and an award of attorneys and other fees and costs, among other relief.
