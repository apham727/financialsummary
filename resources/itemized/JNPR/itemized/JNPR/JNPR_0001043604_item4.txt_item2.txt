Item 2.
Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds

Purchases of Equity Securities by the Issuer and Affiliated Purchasers





As part of the 2018 Stock Repurchase Program, on April 29, 2019, we entered into the 2019 ASR to repurchase an aggregate of approximately $300.0 million of our outstanding common stock.
Under the ASR, we made an up-front payment of $300.0 million pursuant to the ASR and received and retired an initial 8.6 million shares of our common stock for an aggregate price of $240.0 million, based on the market price of $27.94 per share of our common stock on the date of the transaction.
The initial shares received by us were retired, accounted for as a reduction to stockholderâ€™s equity in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets, and treated as a repurchase of common stock for purposes of calculating earnings per share.
The forward contract for the remaining $60.0 million is considered indexed to the Company's common stock and met all of the applicable criteria for equity classification.
For further explanation of our ASR, see Note 10, Equity, in Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 1 of Part I of this Report.
