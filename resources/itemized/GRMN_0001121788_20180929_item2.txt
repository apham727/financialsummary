Item 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 



Overview 



The discussion set forth below, as well as other portions of this Quarterly Report, contains statements concerning potential future events. Such forward-looking statements are based upon assumptions by management, as of the date of this Quarterly Report, including assumptions about risks and uncertainties faced by the Company. Readers can identify these forward-looking statements by their use of such verbs as expects, anticipates, believes or similar verbs or conjugations of such verbs. If any of the Company’s assumptions prove incorrect or should unanticipated circumstances arise, actual results could materially differ from those anticipated by such forward-looking statements. The differences could be caused by a number of factors or combination of factors including, but not limited to, those factors identified in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 30, 2017. This report has been filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC” or the “Commission”) in Washington, D.C. and can be obtained by contacting the SEC’s public reference operations or obtaining it through the SEC’s website at http://www.sec.gov. Readers are strongly encouraged to consider those factors when evaluating any forward-looking statement concerning the Company. The Company will not update any forward-looking statements in this Quarterly Report to reflect future events or developments. 



The information contained in this Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations should be read in conjunction with the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes thereto included in this Form 10-Q and the audited financial statements and notes thereto in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 30, 2017. 



The Company is a leading worldwide provider of navigation, communications and information devices, most of which are enabled by Global Positioning System, or GPS, technology. We operate in five reportable segments, the outdoor, fitness, marine, auto and aviation markets. The Company’s segments offer products through its network of independent dealers and distributors. However, the nature of products and types of customers for the five segments may vary significantly. As such, the segments are managed separately. 



The Company adopted the new accounting standard for revenue recognition, as discussed in Note 1 – Accounting Policies of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements, effective beginning with the Company’s first quarter of 2018. Adoption of the new revenue recognition standard was applied using the full retrospective method, and information for prior periods within Results of Operations have been restated accordingly.

Comparison of 13-Weeks ended September 29, 2018 and September 30, 2017  



(Amounts included in the following discussion are stated in thousands unless otherwise indicated) 



Net Sales 



 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 



Net sales increased 8% for the 13-week period ended September 29, 2018 when compared to the year-ago quarter. The outdoor, aviation, marine, and fitness segments collectively increased by 16%, contributing 80% of total revenue. Outdoor was the largest portion of our revenue mix at 26% in the third quarter of 2018 compared to 25% in the third quarter of 2017. Auto revenue represented the largest portion of our revenue mix in the third quarter of 2017 at 26% and declined to 20% in the third quarter of 2018. 



Total unit sales in the third quarter of 2018 increased to 3,527 when compared to total unit sales of 3,492 in the third quarter of 2017. 



Auto segment revenue decreased 16% from the year-ago quarter, primarily due to the ongoing PND market contraction. Outdoor, fitness, marine, and aviation segment revenue increased 13%, 14%, 28%, and 17%, respectively, when compared to the year-ago quarter. The current quarter marine segment increase was primarily driven by sales from recent acquisitions, in addition to sales growth across most product lines. The outdoor and fitness segment revenue increases were primarily driven by strong sales in wearables. The aviation segment revenue increase was driven by increased sales across most product lines within the segment. 



Cost of Goods Sold  



 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 



Cost of goods sold increased 5% in absolute dollars compared to the prior year quarter. The increase in revenue outpaced the increase in cost of goods sold, which resulted in a 110 basis point decrease in cost of goods sold as a percent of revenue compared to the year-ago quarter. 



In the auto segment, cost of goods sold continued to decline with revenue declines and the slight increase of cost of goods sold as a percent of revenue was primarily due to product mix and promotional activity during the third quarter of 2018. In the marine segment, the decrease in cost of goods sold as a percent of revenue primarily resulted from the favorable impact of higher margin Navionics sales on product mix. The outdoor segment decrease in cost of goods sold as a percent of revenue was primarily due to product mix. The fitness segment increase in cost of goods sold as a percent of revenue was primarily driven by product mix. The aviation segment decrease in cost of goods as a percent of revenue was primarily driven by a reduction in warranty costs compared to the year-ago quarter. 



24 



Gross Profit 



 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 



Gross profit dollars in the third quarter of 2018 increased 10% while gross margin increased 110 basis points compared to the year-ago quarter. Gross margin in the fitness and auto segments decreased compared to the year-ago quarter, while gross margin in the outdoor, marine, and aviation segments increased compared to the year-ago quarter, as a result of the reasons discussed above. 



Advertising Expense 



 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 



Advertising expense decreased 4% in absolute dollars and was relatively flat as a percent of revenue compared to the year-ago quarter. The total absolute dollar decrease was driven primarily by decreased media advertising in the auto and fitness segments, partially offset by increased media advertising in the outdoor and marine segments. 



Selling, General and Administrative Expense 



 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 



Selling, general and administrative expense increased 13% in absolute dollars and was relatively flat as a percent of revenue compared to the year-ago quarter. The absolute dollar increase in the third quarter of 2018 was primarily attributable to personnel costs and expenses from recent acquisitions. The increase in absolute dollars and as a percent of revenue in the marine segment was primarily attributable to expenses associated with recent acquisitions and the reduced legal related costs in the year-ago quarter. The decrease in absolute dollars and as a percent of revenue in the auto segment was primarily attributable to a current quarter reduction in legal related costs compared to the year-ago quarter. 



25 



Research and Development Expense 



 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 



Research and development expense increased $9.3 million in absolute dollars and was relatively flat as a percent of revenue compared to the year-ago quarter. This increase in absolute dollars was primarily due to higher engineering personnel costs related to wearable and aviation product offerings and expenses resulting from recent acquisitions within the marine segment. Our research and development spending is focused on product development, improving existing software capabilities, and exploring new categories. 



Operating Income 



 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 



Operating income increased 13% in absolute dollars and increased 110 basis points as a percent of revenue when compared to the year-ago quarter. The growth in operating income in absolute dollars and as a percent of revenue was primarily attributable to revenue growth and increased gross margins, as discussed above. 



Other Income (Expense)  



 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 



The average return on cash and investments, including interest and capital gains/losses, during the third quarter of 2018 was 1.8% compared to 1.6% during the same quarter of 2017. Interest income increased primarily due to slightly higher yields on fixed-income securities.  



Foreign currency gains and losses for the Company are typically driven by movements in the Taiwan Dollar, Euro, and British Pound Sterling in relation to the U.S. Dollar. The Taiwan Dollar is the functional currency of Garmin Corporation, the U.S. Dollar is the functional currency of Garmin (Europe) Ltd., and the Euro is the functional currency of most of our other European subsidiaries, although some transactions and balances are denominated in British Pounds. The majority of the Company’s consolidated foreign currency gain or loss is typically driven by the significant cash and marketable securities, receivables and payables held in a currency other than the functional currency at a given legal entity. Due to the relative size of the entities using a functional currency other than the Taiwan Dollar, Euro, and British Pound Sterling, currency fluctuations related to these entities are not expected to have a material impact on the Company’s financial statements. 



26 



The $6.9 million currency loss recognized in the third quarter of 2018 was primarily due to the strengthening of the U.S. Dollar against the Euro and British Pound Sterling within the 13-weeks ended September 29, 2018. During this period, the U.S. Dollar strengthened 0.7% against the Euro and 1.3% against the British Pound Sterling, resulting in losses of $2.7 million and $0.6 million, respectively, while the U.S. Dollar remained relatively flat against the Taiwan Dollar. The remaining net currency loss of $3.6 million was related to other currencies and timing of transactions. 



The $8.6 million currency gain recognized in the third quarter of 2017 was primarily due to the weakening of the U.S. Dollar against the Euro and the British Pound Sterling, partially offset by the U.S. Dollar weakening against the Taiwan Dollar within the 13-weeks ended September 30, 2017. During this period, the U.S. Dollar weakened 3.4% against the Euro and 2.8% against the British Pound Sterling, resulting in gains of $8.0 million and $0.7 million, respectively, while the U.S. Dollar weakened 0.3% against the Taiwan Dollar, resulting in a loss of $1.6 million. The remaining net currency gain of $1.5 million was related to other currencies and timing of transactions. 



Income Tax Provision  



The Company recorded income tax expense of $17.1 million in the 13-week period ended September 29, 2018, compared to income tax expense of $38.8 million in the 13-week period ended September 30, 2017. The effective tax rate was 8.5% in the third quarter of 2018, compared to 20.5% in the third quarter of 2017. The 1,200 basis points decrease to the third quarter of 2018 effective tax rate compared to the prior year quarter is primarily due to the reduction of the U.S. corporate tax rate and increased benefit from U.S. research and development tax credits. 



Net Income  



As a result of the above, net income for the 13-weeks ended September 29, 2018 was $184.2 million compared to $151.1 million for the 13-week period ended September 30, 2017, an increase of $33.1 million. 



Comparison of 39-Weeks Ended September 29, 2018 and 39-Weeks Ended September 30, 2017 



Net Sales 



 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 



Net sales increased 9% for the 39-week period ended September 29, 2018 when compared to the year-ago period. The outdoor, aviation, marine, and fitness segments collectively increased by 17%, contributing 80% of total revenue. Fitness was the largest portion of our revenue mix at 24% in the first three quarters of 2018 compared to 22% in the first three quarters of 2017. Auto revenue represented the largest portion of our revenue mix in the first three quarters of 2017 at 26% and declined to 20% in the first three quarters of 2018. 



Total unit sales in the first three quarters of 2018 decreased to 10,266 when compared to the total unit sales of 10,495 in the first three quarters of 2017. The decrease in units sold despite the increase in revenue was primarily attributable to segment mix. 



Auto segment revenue decreased 16% from the year-ago period, primarily due to the ongoing PND market contraction. Outdoor, fitness, marine, and aviation segment revenue increased 12%, 20%, 19%, and 20%, respectively, from the year-ago period. The marine segment revenue increase was primarily driven by sales from recent acquisitions. The aviation segment revenue increase was primarily driven by strong growth across all product lines. The outdoor and fitness segment revenue increases were primarily driven by growth in wearables. 



27 



Cost of Goods Sold  



 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 



Cost of goods sold increased 6% in absolute dollars for the 39-week period ended September 29, 2018 when compared to the year-ago period. The increase in revenue outpaced the increase in cost of goods sold, which resulted in a 100 basis point decrease in cost of goods sold as a percent of revenue compared to the year-ago period. 



In the auto segment, cost of goods sold continued to decline with revenue declines, and the slight increase of cost of goods sold as a percent of revenue was primarily due to the write-down of certain product inventories in the first three quarters of 2018. In the marine segment, the decrease in cost of goods sold as a percent of revenue primarily resulted from the favorable impact of higher margin Navionics sales on product mix. The fitness segment increase in cost of goods sold as a percent of revenue was primarily driven by product mix. In the outdoor segment, cost of goods sold as a percent of revenue was relatively flat compared to the year-ago period. In the aviation segment, the decrease in cost of goods sold as a percent of revenue was primarily driven by a reduction in warranty costs compared to the year-ago period. 



Gross Profit 



 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 



Gross profit dollars in the 39-week period ended September 29, 2018 increased 11% while gross margin increased 100 basis points when compared to the year-ago period. Gross margin declined in the auto and fitness segments, while gross margins increased in the aviation and marine segments, as a result of the reasons discussed above. Gross margin remained relatively flat within the outdoor segment. 



Advertising Expense 



 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 



Advertising expense decreased 6% in absolute dollars when compared to the year-ago period. The overall decrease in absolute dollars was driven primarily by decreased media advertising spend in the outdoor, fitness, and auto segments, partially offset by increased cooperative advertising within the aviation segment and expenses resulting from prior year acquisitions within the marine segment. 



28 



Selling, General and Administrative Expense 



 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 



Selling, general and administrative expense increased 14% in absolute dollars and increased 70 basis points as a percent of revenue when compared to the year-ago period. The absolute dollar increase was primarily attributable to expenses from recent acquisitions within the marine segment and personnel costs. All other segments were relatively flat as a percent of revenue. 



Research and Development Expense 



 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 



In absolute dollars, research and development expense increased $43.6 million when compared with the year-ago period and was relatively flat as a percent of revenue. The absolute dollar increase in research and development expenses when compared with the year-ago period was primarily due to engineering personnel costs related to our wearable and aviation product offerings and expenses resulting from prior year acquisitions within the marine segment. Our research and development spending is focused on product development, improving existing software capabilities, and exploring new categories. 



Operating Income 



 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 



Operating income increased 11% in absolute dollars and increased 50 basis points as a percent of revenue when compared to the year-ago period. The growth in operating income on an absolute dollar basis and as a percent of revenue was the result of strong revenue growth and increased gross margins, partially offset by slightly increased operating expenses as a percent of revenue, as discussed above. 



29 



Other Income (Expense)  



 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 



The average return on cash and investments, including interest and capital gains/losses, during the 39-week period ended September 29, 2018 was 1.8% compared to 1.5% during the same 39-week period ended September 30, 2017. Interest income increased primarily due to slightly higher yields on fixed-income securities.  



The $3.4 million currency loss recognized in the first three quarters of 2018 was primarily due to the strengthening of the U.S. Dollar against most other currencies, partially offset by the U.S. Dollar strengthening against the Taiwan Dollar within the 39-weeks ended September 29, 2018. During this period, the U.S. Dollar strengthened 2.7% against the Taiwan Dollar, resulting in a gain of $13.6 million. This was more than offset by the U.S. Dollar strengthening 3.2% against the Euro and 3.6% against the British Pound Sterling, resulting in losses of $7.7 million and $0.6 million, respectively, and additional net currency losses of $8.7 million related to other currencies and timing of transactions. 



The $13.8 million currency loss recognized in the first three quarters of 2017 was primarily due to the weakening of the U.S. Dollar against the Taiwan Dollar, partially offset by the U.S. Dollar weakening against the Euro and the British Pound Sterling within the 39-weeks ended September 30, 2017. During this period, the U.S. Dollar weakened 7.1% against the Taiwan Dollar, resulting in a loss of $43.1 million, while the U.S. Dollar weakened 12.3% against the Euro and 8.6% against the British Pound Sterling, resulting in gains of $22.2 million and $4.2 million, respectively. The remaining net currency gain of $2.9 million was related to other currencies and timing of transactions. 



Income Tax Provision  



The Company recorded income tax expense of $87.4 million in the first three quarters of 2018, compared to an income tax benefit of $53.8 million in the first three quarters of 2017, which included income tax expense of $7.3 million associated with the expiration of share-based awards and an income tax benefit of $168.8 million primarily related to the revaluation of certain Switzerland deferred tax assets resulting from the Company’s election in the first quarter of 2017 to align certain Switzerland corporate tax positions with international tax initiatives. The effective tax rate was 14.8% in the first three quarters of 2018, compared to (10.5%) in the first three quarters of 2017. Excluding the income tax benefit of $168.8 million primarily related to the revaluation of Switzerland deferred tax assets, and the $7.3 million tax expense due to the expiration of share-based awards, the effective tax rate for the first three quarters of 2018 decreased 620 basis points compared to the effective tax rate in the first three quarters of 2017 primarily due to the reduction of the U.S. corporate tax rate and increased benefit from U.S. research and development tax credits. 



Net Income  



As a result of the above, net income for the 39-week period ended September 29, 2018 was $503.9 million compared to $566.5 million for the 39-week period ended September 30, 2017, a decrease of $62.5 million. 



Liquidity and Capital Resources 



As of September 29, 2018, we had $2.5 billion of cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities. We primarily use cash flow from operations, and expect that future cash requirements may be used, to fund our capital expenditures, support our working capital requirements, pay dividends, fund strategic acquisitions, and fund share repurchases. We believe that our existing cash balances and cash flow from operations will be sufficient to meet our long-term projected capital expenditures, working capital and other cash requirements.

It is management’s goal to invest the on-hand cash in accordance with the investment policy, which has been approved by the Board of Directors of each applicable Garmin entity holding the cash. The investment policy’s primary purpose is to preserve capital, maintain an acceptable degree of liquidity, and maximize yield within the constraint of low credit risk. Garmin’s average interest rate returns on cash and investments during the first three quarters of 2018 and 2017 were approximately 1.8% and 1.5%, respectively. The fair value of our securities varies from period to period due to changes in interest rates, in the performance of the underlying collateral and in the credit performance of the underlying issuer, among other factors. See Note 8 for additional information regarding marketable securities. 



Operating Activities 



 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 



The $239.2 million increase in cash provided by operating activities in the first three quarters of 2018 compared to the first three quarters of 2017 was primarily due to the increase in cash provided by working capital of $107.1 million (which included an increase of $27.7 million in net receipts of accounts receivable, a decrease of $18.7 million in cash paid for inventory, and an increase of $57.1 million in accounts payable) and income taxes payable of $27.8 million. Additionally, the year over year decrease in net income of $62.5 million was offset by other non-cash adjustments to net income of $166.9 million, including an income tax benefit of $168.8 million recognized in the first quarter of 2017 related to the revaluation of certain Switzerland deferred tax assets. 



Investing Activities 



 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 



The $149.7 million increase in cash used in investing activities in the first three quarters of 2018 compared to the first three quarters of 2017 was primarily due to increased net purchases of marketable securities of $102.4 million and higher cash expenditures for purchases of property and equipment of $36.6 million. 



Financing Activities 



 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 



The $66.6 million decrease in cash used in financing activities during the first three quarters of 2018 compared to the first three quarters of 2017 was primarily due to prior year treasury stock purchases of $74.5 million under our share repurchase authorization, which expired on December 31, 2017.

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 



We do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements. 



Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 



General 



Garmin’s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations are based upon Garmin’s consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The presentation of these financial statements requires Garmin to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. On an on-going basis, Garmin evaluates its estimates, including those related to bad debts, inventories, investments, intangible assets, income taxes, warranty obligations, contingencies, customer sales programs and incentives, product returns, relative standalone selling prices, and progress toward completion of performance obligations in certain contracts with customers. Garmin bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. 



For a description of the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of the Company’s condensed consolidated financial statements, refer to Note 2, “Summary of Significant Accounting Policies” in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 and “Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates” in Part II, Item 7 of the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 30, 2017. There were no material changes to the Company’s critical accounting policies and estimates in the 13-week and 39-week periods ended September 29, 2018, other than those discussed in Note 1, “Accounting Policies”. 



 Item 2.Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds  



Items (a) and (b) are not applicable. 



(c) Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities 



The Board of Directors approved a share repurchase program on February 13, 2015, authorizing the Company to purchase up to $300 million of its common shares as market and business conditions warrant. In December 2016, the Board of Directors authorized an extension through December 31, 2017 to purchase remaining common shares. The share repurchase authorization expired on December 31, 2017 with no additional shares having been repurchased during the 39-weeks ended September 29, 2018.
