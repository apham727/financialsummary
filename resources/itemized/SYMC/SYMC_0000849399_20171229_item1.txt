Item 1A.
Risk Factors

A description of the risks associated with our business, financial condition, and results of operations is set forth in Part I, Item 1A, of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2017.
There have been no material changes from the risk factors previously disclosed in our Annual Report, except for the following risk factor.
The risk factor below should be read in conjunction with the risk factors and other information disclosed in our Form 10-K.

Changes to our effective tax rate could increase our income tax expense and reduce (increase) our net income (loss).
•Changes to the U.S. federal income tax laws, including impacts of the recently enacted Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, the consequences of which have not yet been fully determined;

•Changes to other tax laws, regulations, and interpretations in multiple jurisdictions in which we operate, including actions resulting from the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development’s base erosion and profit shifting project, proposed actions by international bodies, as well as the requirements of certain tax rulings;

•Changes in the relative proportions of revenues and income before taxes in the various jurisdictions in which we operate that have differing statutory tax rates;

•The tax effects of purchase accounting for acquisitions and restructuring charges that may cause fluctuations between reporting periods; and

•Tax assessments, or any related tax interest or penalties that could significantly affect our income tax expense for the period in which the settlements take place.
We report our results of operations based on our determination of the aggregate amount of taxes owed in the tax jurisdictions in which we operate.
From time to time, we receive notices that a tax authority in a particular jurisdiction believes that we owe a greater amount of tax than we have reported to such authority.
We are regularly engaged in discussions and sometimes disputes with these tax authorities.
We are engaged in disputes of this nature at this time.
If the ultimate determination of our taxes owed in any of these jurisdictions is for an amount in excess of the tax provision we have recorded or reserved for, our operating results, cash flows, and financial condition could be adversely affected.
