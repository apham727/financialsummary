Overview
We are a leading semiconductor company that designs, develops and markets high-performance power solutions.
Founded in 1997, MPS’s core strengths include deep system-level and applications knowledge, strong analog design expertise and an innovative proprietary process technology.
These combined strengths enable MPS to deliver highly integrated monolithic products that offer energy efficient, cost-effective, easy-to-use solutions for systems found in consumer, computing and storage, industrial, automotive and communications applications.
Our mission is to reduce total energy consumption in our customers' systems with green, practical and compact solutions.
We believe that we differentiate ourselves by offering solutions that are more highly integrated, smaller in size, more energy efficient, more accurate with respect to performance specifications and, consequently, more cost-effective than many competing solutions.
We plan to continue to introduce new products within our existing product families, as well as in new innovative product categories.
We operate in the cyclical semiconductor industry where there is seasonal demand for certain products.
We are not immune from current and future industry downturns, but we have targeted product and market areas that we believe have the ability to offer above average industry performance over the long term.
We work with third parties to manufacture and assemble our integrated circuits (“ICs”).
This has enabled us to limit our capital expenditures and fixed costs, while focusing our engineering and design resources on our core strengths.
Following the introduction of a product, our sales cycle generally takes a number of quarters after we receive an initial customer order for a new product to ramp up.
Typical lead time for orders is fewer than 90 days.
These factors, combined with the fact that orders in the semiconductor industry can typically be cancelled or rescheduled without significant penalty to the customer, make the forecasting of our orders and revenue difficult.
We derive most of our revenue from sales through distribution arrangements and direct sales to customers in Asia, where our products are incorporated into end-user products.
For the three months ended March 31, 2018 and 2017, our revenue from sales to customers in Asia was 88% and 90%, respectively.
We derive a majority of our revenue from the sales of our DC to DC converter products which serve the consumer, computing and storage, industrial, automotive and communications markets.
We believe our ability to achieve revenue growth will depend, in part, on our ability to develop new products, enter new market segments, gain market share, manage litigation risk, diversify our customer base and continue to secure manufacturing capacity.
Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates
Except for the changes related to revenue recognition discussed in Note 1 and Note 2 to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements, there have been no other significant changes in our critical accounting policies and estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements during the three months ended March 31, 2018, as compared to those disclosed in the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2017.

Results of Operations
Revenue
Revenue for the three months ended March 31, 2018 was $129.2 million, an increase of $28.8 million, or 28.7%, from $100.4 million for the three months ended March 31, 2017.
This increase was driven by higher sales in all of our end markets except for communications.
Overall unit shipments increased by 18% due to higher market demand, and average sales prices increased by 8%.
Revenue from the consumer market for the three months ended March 31, 2018 increased $11.5 million, or 32.4%, from the same period in 2017.
This increase was primarily driven by higher demand in home appliances, set-top boxes, chargers and gaming products.
Revenue from the computing and storage market increased $10.4 million, or 50.2%, from the same period in 2017.
This increase was primarily driven by strength in the solid-state drive storage, cloud computing and high-performance notebook markets.
Revenue from the industrial market increased $2.2 million, or 14.3%, from the same period in 2017.
This increase was primarily driven by higher sales in security and meter products.
Revenue from the automotive market increased $5.4 million, or 43.8%, from the same period in 2017.
This increase was primarily driven by higher sales of products for infotainment, safety and connectivity applications.
Revenue from the communications market decreased $0.7 million, or 4.2%, from the same period in 2017.
This decrease was primarily driven by lower demand in wireless applications.

Cost of Revenue and Gross Margin
 Cost of revenue primarily consists of costs incurred to manufacture, assemble and test our products, as well as warranty costs, inventory-related and other overhead costs, and stock-based compensation expenses.
In addition, cost of revenue includes amortization for acquisition-related intangible assets.
Cost of revenue was $57.7 million, or 44.6% of revenue, for the three months ended March 31, 2018, and $45.5 million, or 45.4% of revenue, for the three months ended March 31, 2017.
The $12.2 million increase in cost of revenue was primarily due to an 18% increase in overall unit shipments, coupled with a 5% increase in the average direct cost of units shipped.
The increase in cost of revenue was also driven by a $1.7 million increase in labor and manufacturing overhead costs and a $1.4 million increase in inventory write-downs and warranty expenses.
Gross margin was 55.4% for the three months ended March 31, 2018, compared with 54.6% for the three months ended March 31, 2017.
The increase in gross margin was primarily due to increased sales of higher margin products and lower amortization expense due to certain intangible assets being fully amortized, partially offset by higher inventory write-downs and warranty expenses as a percentage of revenue.

Litigation Expense
Litigation expense was $0.5 million for the three months ended March 31, 2018, compared with $0.3 million for the three months ended March 31, 2017.
The increase in litigation expense was primarily due to ongoing litigation.
Interest and Other Income, Net
Interest and other income, net, was $0.4 million for the three months ended March 31, 2018, compared with $1.4 million for the three months ended March 31, 2017.
The decrease was primarily due to an expense of $0.2 million related to changes in the value of the deferred compensation plan investments for the three months ended March 31, 2018 compared to an income of $0.7 million for the three months ended March 31, 2017, and an increase of $0.3 million in foreign currency exchange loss.
The decrease was partially offset by an increase of $0.2 million in interest income as a result of higher investment balances and yields.
Income Tax Provision
We have not adjusted our provisional tax estimates related to the 2017 Tax Act that were recorded in the fourth quarter of 2017.
These amounts remained as estimates as of March 31, 2018 and, as permitted by Staff Accounting Bulletin No.
118, they will be refined through December 2018 based on our ongoing analysis of data and tax positions along with new guidance from regulators and interpretation of the law.
The income tax provision for the three months ended March 31, 2018 was $0.6 million, or 2.8% of pre-tax income.
The effective tax rate differed from the federal statutory rate primarily because foreign income generated by our subsidiaries in Bermuda and China was taxed at lower rates, and because of certain stock-based compensation deductions.
In addition, the effective tax rate was impacted by the effects of the inclusion of the global intangible low-taxed income ("GILTI") under the 2017 Tax Act.
For the three months ended March 31, 2018, our effective tax rate included the estimated impact of $12.4 million related to the GILTI provisions that was recorded as additional subpart F income, which was accounted for as a period cost.
In addition, for the three months ended March 31, 2018, we paid the 2018 installment of $1.9 million related to the deemed repatriation transition tax liability.
As of March 31, 2018, the remaining $22.0 million transition tax liability was recorded in long-term income tax liabilities on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet.
The income tax provision for the three months ended March 31, 2017 was $0.5 million, or 3.2% of pre-tax income.
The effective tax rate differed from the federal statutory rate primarily because foreign income generated by our subsidiaries in Bermuda and China was taxed at lower rates.
In addition, the effective tax rate was impacted by changes in the valuation allowance primarily related to stock-based compensation.
On July 27, 2015, in Altera Corp. v. Commissioner, the U.S. Tax Court issued an opinion related to the treatment of stock-based compensation expense in an intercompany cost-sharing arrangement.
A final decision was issued in December 2015, and the IRS appealed the decision in February 2016.
At this time, the U.S. Department of the Treasury has not withdrawn the requirement from its regulations to include stock-based compensation in the cost pool to be shared under a cost-sharing arrangement.
Due to the uncertainty surrounding the status of the current regulations, questions related to the scope of potential benefits, and the risk of the Tax Court’s decision being overturned upon appeal, we have not recorded any adjustments as of March 31, 2018.
We will continue to monitor developments related to this opinion and the potential impact on our financial statements.

Liquidity and Capital Resources
As of March 31, 2018, we had cash and cash equivalents of $76.0 million and short-term investments of $231.2 million, compared with cash and cash equivalents of $82.8 million and short-term investments of $216.3 million as of December 31, 2017.
As of March 31, 2018, $54.3 million of cash and cash equivalents and $132.5 million of short-term investments were held by our international subsidiaries.
After the enactment of the 2017 Tax Act, we currently plan to repatriate cash from our Bermuda subsidiary on an ongoing basis to fund our future expenditures in the U.S. and continue to indefinitely reinvest our earnings from other foreign subsidiaries.
The significant components of our working capital are cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments, accounts receivable, inventories and other current assets, reduced by accounts payable, accrued compensation and related benefits, and other accrued liabilities.
As of March 31, 2018, we had working capital of $410.8 million, compared with working capital of $383.3 million as of December 31, 2017.
The $27.5 million increase in working capital was due to a $34.9 million increase in current assets, partially offset by a $7.4 million increase in current liabilities.
The increase in current assets was primarily due to an increase in short-term investments, accounts receivable and inventories, partially offset by a decrease in cash and cash equivalents.
The increase in current liabilities was primarily due to an increase in accounts payable and other accrued liabilities.
Summary of Cash Flows
For the three month ended March 31, 2018, net cash provided by operating activities was $16.3 million, primarily due to our net income adjusted for certain non-cash items, including depreciation and amortization and stock-based compensation, and a net decrease of $23.8 million from the changes in our operating assets and liabilities.
The increase in accounts receivable was primarily driven by timing of shipments in the last month of the quarter.
The increase in inventories was primarily driven by an increase in strategic wafer and die inventories as well as an increase in finished goods to meet current demand and future growth.
For the three months ended March 31, 2017, net cash provided by operating activities was $21.9 million, primarily due to our net income adjusted for certain non-cash items, including depreciation and amortization and stock-based compensation, and a net decrease of $8.1 million from the changes in our operating assets and liabilities.
The increase in accounts receivable was primarily driven by the timing of shipments in the last month of the quarter.
The increase in inventories was primarily driven by increased purchases to meet current demand and future growth.
The increase in accounts payable was primarily driven by increased inventory and capital asset purchases to meet expected future demand.
For the three months ended March 31, 2018, net cash used in investing activities was $25.2 million, primarily due to purchases of property and equipment of $7.4 million, net purchases of short-term investments of $16.5 million, and net contributions to the deferred compensation plan of $1.3 million.
For the three months ended March 31, 2017, net cash used in investing activities was $51.2 million, primarily due to purchases of property and equipment of $3.4 million, net purchases of investments of $46.6 million, and net contributions to the employee deferred compensation plan of $1.2 million.
Table of Contents
For the three months ended March 31, 2018, net cash provided by financing activities was $1.0 million, primarily reflecting $9.4 million of cash proceeds from releases of RSUs and issuance of shares through our employee stock purchase plan, partially offset by $8.3 million used to pay dividends to our stockholders and dividend equivalents to our employees who hold RSUs.
For the three months ended March 31, 2017, net cash used in financing activities was $7.0 million, primarily reflecting $8.2 million used to pay dividends to our stockholders and dividend equivalents to our employees who hold RSUs, partially offset by $1.4 million of cash proceeds from stock option exercises and issuance of shares through our employee stock purchase plan.
In June 2014, our Board of Directors approved a dividend program pursuant to which we intend to pay quarterly cash dividends on our common stock.
In addition, outstanding RSU awards contain rights to receive dividend equivalents, which entitle employees who hold RSUs to the same dividend value per share as holders of common stock.
The dividend equivalents are accumulated and paid to the employees when the underlying RSUs vest.
Dividend equivalents accumulated on the underlying RSUs are forfeited if the employees do not fulfill their service requirement and the awards do not vest.
For the three months ended March 31, 2018, we paid dividends and dividend equivalents totaling $8.3 million.
For the three months ended March 31, 2017, we paid dividends and dividend equivalents totaling $8.2 million.
In February 2018, our Board of Directors approved an increase in our quarterly cash dividends from $0.20 per share to $0.30 per share, effective for the dividends declared in first quarter of 2018.
We anticipate that cash used for future dividends and dividend equivalent payments, as well as payments for the one-time deemed repatriation transition tax and other expenditures, will come from our current domestic cash and cash generated from ongoing U.S. operations.
As a result of the 2017 Tax Act, we also plan to repatriate cash from our Bermuda subsidiary on an ongoing basis to fund these and other future expenditures in the U.S. and continue to indefinitely reinvest our earnings from other foreign subsidiaries.
Although cash requirements will fluctuate based on the timing and extent of many factors such as those discussed above, we believe that cash generated from operations, together with the liquidity provided by existing cash balances and short-term investments, will be sufficient to satisfy our liquidity requirements for the next 12 months.
Contractual Obligations
Our outstanding purchase commitments primarily consist of wafer purchases from our foundries, assembly services and license arrangements.
As of March 31, 2018, the outstanding balance under our purchase commitments was $67.0 million, compared with $52.6 million as of December 31, 2017.
Under the 2017 Tax Act, we have a transition tax liability which represents a one-time, mandatory deemed repatriation tax imposed on previously deferred foreign earnings.
As permitted by the 2017 Tax Act, we elected to pay the tax liability in installment over eight years through 2025.
During the first quarter of 2018, we paid the 2018 installment of $1.9 million.
As of March 31, 2018, the outstanding liability was $22.0 million.
Other long-term obligations include long-term liabilities reflected in our Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets, which primarily consist of the deferred compensation plan liabilities and accrued dividend equivalents.
As of March 31, 2018, the outstanding obligations were $34.3 million, compared with $33.0 million as of December 31, 2017.
