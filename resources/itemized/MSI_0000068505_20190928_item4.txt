Item 4. Controls and Procedures



(a) Evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures. Under the supervision and with the participation of our senior management, including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”), as of the end of the period covered by this quarterly report (the “Evaluation Date”). Based on this evaluation, our chief executive officer and chief financial officer concluded as of the Evaluation Date that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective such that the information relating to Motorola Solutions, including our consolidated subsidiaries, required to be disclosed in our Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) reports (i) is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in SEC rules and forms and (ii) is accumulated and communicated to Motorola Solutions’ management, including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.



(b) Changes in internal control over financial reporting. Effective January 1, 2019, we adopted the new lease accounting standard ASU No. 2016-02. We have implemented new accounting processes related to lease accounting and related disclosures, including related control activities. There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the quarter ended September 28, 2019 that have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect our internal control over financial reporting.
