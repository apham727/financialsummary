ITEM 1.  



LEGAL PROCEEDINGS 



On October 15, 2018, Varex Imaging Corporation (“Varex”) filed its original Complaint (Case No. 1:18-cv-06911) against Richardson Electronics Ltd. (“Richardson”) in the Northern District of Illinois, which was subsequently amended on November 27, 2018. Varex alleged counts of infringement of U.S. Patent Nos. 6,456,692 and 6,519,317. Subsequently, on October 24, 2018, Varex filed a motion for preliminary injunction to stop the sale of Richardson’s ALTA750 TM product. Richardson filed an opposition to the preliminary injunction. In January 2019, the Court took evidence on the preliminary injunction issue. On September 30, 2019, the Court soundly denied Varex’s Motion for Preliminary Injunction. Richardson believes the lawsuit to be without merit and a loss is not probable or estimable based on the information at the time the financial statements were issued.
