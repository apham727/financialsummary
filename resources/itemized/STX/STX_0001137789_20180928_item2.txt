Our Company
We are a leading provider of data storage technology and solutions.
Our principal products are hard disk drives, commonly referred to as disk drives, hard drives or HDDs.
In addition to HDDs, we produce a broad range of data storage products including solid state drives (SSD) and storage subsystems.
Hard disk drives are devices that store digitally encoded data on rapidly rotating disks with magnetic surfaces.
Disk drives continue to be the primary medium of mass data storage due to their performance attributes, high quality and cost effectiveness.
Complementing existing data center storage architecture, solid-state storage devices use integrated circuit assemblies as memory to store data, and most SSDs use NAND flash memory.
Our HDD products are designed for mission critical and nearline applications in enterprise servers and storage systems; edge compute applications, where our products are designed primarily for desktop and mobile computing; and edge non-compute applications, where our products are designed for a wide variety of end user devices such as portable external storage systems, surveillance systems, digital video recorders (DVRs), network-attached storage (NAS) and gaming consoles.
Our SSD products mainly include serial attached SCSI (SAS) and Non-Volatile Memory Express (NVMe) SSDs.
Our enterprise data solutions (formerly referred to as the cloud systems and solutions) portfolio includes modular original equipment manufacturer (OEM) storage systems and scale-out storage servers.
Overview of the September 2018 Quarter
During the September 2018 quarter, we shipped 99 exabytes of HDD storage capacity.
We generated revenue of approximately $3.0 billion, gross margin of 31% and our operating cash flow was $587 million.
We paid $181 million in dividends and repurchased 3 million of our ordinary shares for $150 million.

Revenue
Revenue in the September 2018 quarter increased by $156 million from the June 2018 quarter as a result of an increase in exabytes shipped driven primarily by higher seasonal demand for our client and consumer markets, partially offset by price erosion.
Revenue in the September 2018 quarter increased by $359 million from the September 2017 quarter as a result of an increase in exabytes shipped driven primarily by higher demand for our enterprise and client markets, partially offset by price erosion.
We maintain various sales programs such as channel rebates and price masking.
Sales programs were approximately 11%, 12% and 11% of gross drive revenue for the September 2018 quarter, June 2018 quarter and September 2017 quarter, respectively.
Adjustments to revenues due to under or over accruals for sales programs related to revenues reported in prior quarterly periods were less than 1% of quarterly gross revenue in all periods presented.
Cost of Revenue and Gross Margin
Gross margin as a percentage of revenue for the September 2018 quarter decreased by approximately 100 basis points from the June 2018 quarter primarily due to a decline in prices for NAND flash memory and general price erosion.
Compared to the September 2017 quarter, gross margin as a percentage of revenue increased by 300 basis points primarily driven by favorable product mix and improved factory utilization as a result of higher demand for our enterprise and client markets, partially offset by a decline in prices for NAND flash memory and general price erosion.
In the September 2018 quarter, total warranty cost was 0.7% of revenue and included a favorable change in estimates of prior warranty accruals of 0.5% of revenue due to improvements in return rates on newer generation products.
Warranty cost related to new shipments was 1.2%, 1.3% and 1.3% of revenue for the September 2018, June 2018 and September 2017 quarters, respectively.

Operating Expenses
Product development expense.
Product development expense for the September 2018 quarter remained relatively flat compared to the June 2018 quarter and the September 2017 quarter.
Marketing and administrative expense.
Marketing and administrative expense for the September 2018 quarter decreased by $25 million from the June 2018 quarter primarily due to a $13 million decrease in variable compensation and share-based compensation expenses, a $5 million decrease in salaries and employee benefits as a result of the restructuring of our workforce in prior periods and a $7 million decrease in other general expenses due to related operational efficiencies.
Compared to the September 2017 quarter, Marketing and administrative expense decreased by $30 million primarily due to a $13 million decrease in salaries and employee benefits as a result of the restructuring of our workforce in prior periods, a $9 million decrease in other general expenses due to related operational efficiencies and an $8 million decrease in variable compensation and share-based compensation expenses.
Amortization of intangibles.
Amortization of intangibles for the September 2018 quarter remained flat compared to the June 2018 quarter.
Amortization of intangibles for the September 2018 quarter decreased by $16 million from the September 2017 quarter due to certain intangible assets reaching the end of their useful life.
Restructuring and other, net.
Restructuring and other, net for the September 2018 quarter was comprised of charges primarily related to a voluntary early exit program.
Restructuring and other, net for the June 2018 quarter included a gain of $24 million from the sale of certain properties previously classified as held for sale, offset by restructuring charges announced in prior periods.
Restructuring and other, net for the September 2017 quarter was comprised of restructuring charges to reduce our global workforce by 600 employees.
Other Expense, Net
Other expense, net decreased by $4 million from the June 2018 quarter primarily due to an $11 million increase in interest income on investment in a debt security, offset by a $5 million net increase in losses due to unfavorable changes in foreign currency exchange rates.
Compared to the September 2017 quarter, Other expense, net decreased by $32 million primarily due to a $16 million net increase in gains due to favorable changes in foreign currency exchange rates and a $16 million increase in interest income on investment in a debt security.
Income Taxes
Our income tax provision of $18 million for the September 2018 quarter included approximately $1 million of net discrete tax expense.
Table of Contents
Our income tax provision recorded for the September 2018 quarter differed from the provision from income taxes that would be derived by applying the Irish statutory rate of 25% to income before income taxes, primarily due to the net effect of (i) tax benefits related to non-U.S. earnings generated in jurisdictions that are subject to tax holidays or tax incentive programs and are considered indefinitely reinvested outside of Ireland and (ii) a decrease in valuation allowance for certain deferred tax assets.
During the three months ended September 28, 2018 our unrecognized tax benefits excluding interest and penalties increased by approximately $2 million to $62 million.
The unrecognized tax benefits that, if recognized, would impact the effective tax rate were $62 million at September 28, 2018, subject to certain future valuation allowance reversals.
During the 12 months beginning September 29, 2018, we expect that our unrecognized tax benefits could be reduced by approximately $19 million, primarily as a result of the expiration of certain statutes of limitation.
Our income tax provision of $7 million recorded for the September 2017 quarter included approximately $1 million of net discrete tax expense.
Our income tax provision recorded for the September 2017 quarter differed from the provision from income taxes that would be derived by applying the Irish statutory rate of 25% to income before income taxes, primarily due to the net effect of (i) tax benefits related to non-U.S. earnings generated in jurisdictions that are subject to tax holidays or tax incentive programs and are considered indefinitely reinvested outside of Ireland and (ii) a decrease in valuation allowance for certain deferred tax assets.
On December 22, 2017, the Tax Act was enacted into law in the United States.
The Tax Act significantly revises U.S. corporate income tax law by, among other things, lowering U.S. corporate income tax rates from 35% to 21%, implementing a territorial tax system, and imposing a one-time transition tax on deemed repatriated earnings of non-U.S. subsidiaries.
The U.S. tax law changes, including limitations on various business deductions such as executive compensation under Internal Revenue Code §162(m), will not impact our tax expense in the short-term due to our large net operating loss and tax credit carryovers and associated valuation allowance.
The Tax Acts new international rules, including Global Intangible Low-Taxed Income (GILTI), Foreign Derived Intangible Income (FDII), and Base Erosion Anti-Avoidance Tax (BEAT) are effective beginning in fiscal year 2019.
For fiscal year 2019, we have included these effects of the Tax Act in our financial statements and have concluded the impact will not be material.
Pursuant to SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin (SAB) 118 (regarding the application of ASC 740 associated with the enactment of the Tax Act), we believe our accounting under ASC 740 for the provisions of the Tax Act is now complete.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
Cash and Cash Equivalents
Our cash and cash equivalents increased from June 29, 2018 as a result of an increase in the net cash provided by operating activities, partially offset by net cash outflows for dividends paid to our shareholders of $181 million, capital expenditures of $177 million and repurchases of our ordinary shares of $150 million.
Cash Provided by Operating Activities
   
an increase of $119 million in accounts payable, primarily due to higher material purchases;
Table of Contents
   
partially offset by a decrease of $79 million in accrued employee compensation primarily due to cash paid to our employees as part of our variable compensation plans; and
   
an increase of $66 million in inventory, primarily due to an increase in units built.
Cash Used in Investing Activities
Cash used in investing activities for the three months ended September 28, 2018 was $176 million, which was primarily attributable to the payments for the purchase of property, equipment and leasehold improvements of $177 million.
Cash Used in Financing Activities
   
$181 million in dividend payments;
   
$150 million paid to repurchase ordinary shares; and
   
$27 million paid for taxes related to net share settlement of equity awards;
   
partially offset by $32 million in proceeds from the issuance of ordinary shares under employee stock plans.
Liquidity Sources, Cash Requirements and Commitments
As of September 28, 2018, no borrowings had been drawn under the revolving credit facility or had been utilized for letters of credit issued under this credit facility.
The line of credit is available for borrowings, subject to compliance with financial covenants and other customary conditions to borrowing.
Our liquidity requirements are primarily to meet our working capital, product development and capital expenditure needs, to fund scheduled payments of principal and interest on our indebtedness, and to fund our quarterly dividend and any future strategic investments.
Our ability to fund these requirements will depend on our future cash flows, which are determined by future operating performance, and therefore, subject to prevailing global macroeconomic conditions and financial, business and other factors, some of which are beyond our control.
For fiscal year 2019, we expect capital expenditures to remain below our long-term targeted range of 6% to 8% of revenue.
From time to time we may repurchase any of our outstanding notes in open market or privately negotiated purchases or otherwise, or we may repurchase outstanding notes pursuant to the terms of the applicable indenture.
Dividends declared in the September 2018 quarter of $180 million were subsequently paid on October 3, 2018.
The Companys Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.63 per share on November 2, 2018, which is payable on January 2, 2019 to shareholders of record at the close of business on December 19, 2018.
From time to time we may repurchase any of our outstanding ordinary shares through private, open market, tender offers broker-assisted purchases or other means.
As of September 28, 2018, $0.7 billion remained available for repurchase under our existing repurchase authorization limit.
All repurchases are effected as redemptions in accordance with the Companys Articles of Association.
On October 29, 2018, the Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of an additional $2.3 billion of our outstanding ordinary shares.
