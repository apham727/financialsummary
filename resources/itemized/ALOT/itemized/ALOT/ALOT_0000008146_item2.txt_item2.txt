Results of Operations  

Three Months Ended August 3, 2019 vs. Three Months Ended July 28, 2018  



Revenue for the second quarter of the current year was $33.5 million, representing a slight decrease compared to the previous year second quarter revenue of $33.8 million.
Revenue through domestic channels for the second quarter of the current year was $20.6 million, an increase of 3.4% over the prior years second quarter.
International revenue for the second quarter of the current year was $12.9 million, a 7.3% decrease over the previous year second quarter, and represents 38.3% of AstroNovas second quarter revenue.
Current year second quarter international revenue includes an unfavorable foreign exchange rate impact of $0.3 million.
Supplies revenue in the current quarter was $18.1 million, a 1.1% increase over prior years second quarter supplies revenue of $17.9 million.
The increase in the current quarter supplies revenue as compared to the second quarter of the prior year is primarily attributable to the double-digit percentage increase in revenue of ink jet supplies, slightly offset by a decline in sales of transfer ribbon products within the Product Identification segment.
Current year second quarter gross profit was $12.0 million, a 10.6% decrease compared to prior year second quarter gross profit of $13.4 million.
The Companys current quarter gross profit margin of 35.8% reflects a 3.8 percentage point decline from the prior years second quarter gross profit margin of 39.6%.
The lower gross profit and related profit margin for the current quarter compared to the prior years second quarter is primarily attributable to decreased revenue and product mix.
Other expense in the second quarter of fiscal 2020 was $0.2 million compared to $0.5 million in the second quarter of the prior year.
Current quarter other expense primarily includes interest expense on debt and the revolving line of credit of $0.2 million and foreign exchange loss of $0.1 million, which were partially offset by $0.1 million of other income.
Other expense for the second quarter of fiscal 2019 consists primarily of interest expense on debt of $0.2 million and foreign exchange loss of $0.3 million.

The provision for federal, state and foreign income taxes for the second quarter of the current year is $29 thousand, resulting in an effective tax rate of 3.0%.
This rate was impacted by a significant reduction in forecasted operating results for our fiscal 2020 as compared to operating results at the end of the first quarter 2020 and also reflects a benefit of $135 thousand related to windfall tax benefits related to the Companys stock.
This compares to the prior years second quarter tax provision of $0.5 million, which reflects a benefit of $82 thousand related to windfall tax benefits related to the Companys stock and an effective tax rate of 13.9%.
The Company reported net income of $1.0 million or $0.13 per diluted share for the second quarter of the current year.
On a comparable basis, net income for the prior years second quarter was $1.2 million or $0.17 per diluted share.
Return on revenue was 2.8% for the second quarter of fiscal 2020 compared to 3.5% for the second quarter of fiscal 2019.
Six Months Ended August 3, 2019 vs. Six Months Ended July 28, 2018  



Revenue for the first six months of the current year was $69.6 million, representing a 6.7% increase compared to the previous years first six months of revenue of $65.3 million.
Revenue through domestic channels for the first half of the current year was $42.6 million, an increase of 8.7% from prior year domestic revenue of $39.2 million.
International revenue for the first six months of the current year was $27.0 million, a 3.5% increase from the previous year international revenue of $26.1 million.
The current years first six months international revenue reflected an unfavorable foreign exchange rate impact of $0.9 million.
Supplies revenue in the first half of the current year was $37.8 million, representing a 9.3% increase over the prior years first six months revenue of $34.6 million.
The current year increase in supplies revenue is due primarily to the increase in inkjet printer supplies and labels sales, tempered by lower thermal film and electrophotographic supplies revenue in the Product Identification segment.
Current year first six months gross profit was $26.2 million, a 2.8% increase from prior years first six months gross profit of $25.5 million.
The Companys gross profit margin of 37.6% in the current year reflects a decrease from the prior years first six months gross profit margin of 39.1%.
The lower gross profit margin for the current year compared to the prior year is primarily due to higher period costs and product mix.

Other expense during the first six months of the current year was $0.6 million compared to $0.8 million in the first six months of the previous year.
Current year other expense includes interest expense of $0.4 million on the Companys debt and revolving credit line and $0.3 million of foreign exchange loss, partially offset by investment and other income of $0.1 million.
Other expense during the first six months of fiscal 2019 includes interest expense on debt of $0.4 million and foreign exchange loss of $0.5 million, partially offset by investment and other income of $0.1 million  

The Company recognized $0.4 million of income tax expense for the first six months of the current fiscal year, which reflects a $232,000 tax benefit arising from windfall tax benefits related to the Companys stock and a $53,000 tax benefit related to the expiration of the statute of limitations on a previously uncertain tax position resulting in a 13.9% effective tax rate.
The Company recognized $0.6 million of income tax expense for the first six months of the prior fiscal year.
The 24.1% effective tax rate in that period was directly impacted by a $112,000 tax benefit arising from windfall tax benefits related to the Companys stock and a $78,000 tax benefit related to the expiration of the statute of limitations on a previously uncertain tax position.
The Company reported net income of $2.7 million, or $0.36 per diluted share, for the first six months of the current year.
On a comparable basis, net income for the first six months of the prior year was $2.0 million, or $0.29 per diluted share, which included $0.8 million of after-tax income, or $0.12 per diluted share, as a result of a change in accounting estimates in the prior years first quarter for product cost and operating expenses related to a transition services agreement entered into with Honeywell in connection with the Honeywell Agreement.
In addition, during the first quarter of fiscal 2019, a change in accounting estimate for revenue subject to customer rebates under the Honeywell Agreement increased net income by $0.3 million or $0.05 per diluted share.
Return on revenue was 3.8% for the first six months of fiscal 2020 compared to 3.1% for the first six months of fiscal 2019.
Segment Analysis  



Product Identification  

Revenue from the Product Identification segment increased 1.7% in the second quarter of the current year, with revenue of $22.1 million compared to $21.8 million in the same period of the prior year.
The current quarter increase in revenue is primarily attributable to the increase in supplies revenue, as the Companys installed base of printers continues to grow.
Specifically, this includes inkjet supply revenue, which experienced double digit growth as compared to the same period in the prior year.
Also contributing to the increase in revenue for the current quarter was a 10.6% increase in service and other revenue.
Although the overall revenue increase was slightly tempered by lower sales in Product Identifications hardware product line, the segment experienced a significant revenue contribution from the introduction of the new QL -300 printer, and both QuickLabels monochromatic printers and TrojanLabels T2-C printers experienced continued growth during the current quarter.
Product Identifications current quarter segment operating profit was $2.2 million, reflecting a profit margin of 10.0%.
This compares to the prior years second quarter segment profit of $2.2 million and related profit margin of 9.9%.
The slight increase in Product Identification current year second quarter segment operating margin is primarily due to higher sales and product mix.
Table of Contents 

Revenues from the Product Identification segment increased 9.6% to $45.7 million in the first six months of the current year from $41.7 million in the same period of the prior year.
The current year increase is primarily attributable to an increase in supplies revenue of 11.4% due to increased demand for ink jet supplies, as well as label and tag products.
Also contributing to the increase in revenue for the current year was a 14.8% increase in service and other revenue.
Although hardware revenue in the PI segment remained constant compared to the prior year, the segment experienced a significant revenue contribution from the introduction of Quick Labels new QL -300 printer, as well as double-digit growth in revenue from sales of both Quick Labels monochromatic printers and TrojanLabels T2-C printers.
This growth was slightly tempered by lower sales of the inkjet color printers within the product group.
Product Identification current year segment operating profit was $5.1 million with a profit margin of 11.2%, compared to the prior year segment operating profit of $3.8 million and related profit margin of 9.2 %.
The increase in current year segment operating profit and margin is primarily due to higher sales and product mix.
Financial Condition and Liquidity  

Overview  

Generally, our primary sources of liquidity are cash generated from operating activities and borrowings.
From time to time, we may also utilize amounts available under our revolving credit facility, as described below, to supplement cash generated from operating activities and to fund a portion of our capital expenditures, contractual contingent consideration obligations, and future acquisitions.
We believe that our current level of cash and short-term financing capabilities along with future cash flows from operations will be sufficient to meet our operating and capital needs for at least the next 12 months.
Our cash and cash equivalents at the end of the second quarter were $4.5 million.
During the second quarter of the current year, the Company borrowed an additional $2.0 million on its revolving credit facility.
As of August 3, 2019, under its existing revolving credit facility, the Company has an outstanding balance of $3.5 million and $6.5 million remaining available for borrowing.
The Companys backlog increased 12.9% from year-end to $22.3 million at the end of the second quarter of fiscal 2020.
Indebtedness  

In fiscal 2018, the Company and the Companys wholly owned Danish subsidiaries, ANI ApS and TrojanLabel ApS, entered into a credit agreement with Bank of America, N.A.
The Credit Agreement also provides for a $10.0 million revolving credit facility for the Company.
Both term loans bear interest at a rate per annum equal to the LIBOR rate plus a margin that varies within a range of 1.0% to 1.5% based on the Companys consolidated leverage ratio.
Table of Contents 

In connection with our entry into the Credit Agreement, ANI ApS entered into a hedging agreement to manage the variable interest rate risk and currency risk associated with its payments in respect to the term loan.
Under this combined arrangement, payments of principal and interest with respect to approximately $8.9 million of the principal of the term loan will be made in Danish Kroner, and interest on such principal amount will be payable at a fixed rate of 0.67% per annum for the entire term, subject only to potential changes based on the Companys consolidated leverage ratio.
Additionally, the Company entered into a hedging agreement to manage the variable interest rate risk associated with its payments with respect to the $15.0 million term loan.
Under this combined arrangement, interest will be payable at a fixed rate of 2.04% per annum for the entire term, plus an incremental margin of 1.0% to 1.5%, based on the Companys consolidated leverage ratio.
Revolving credit loans may be borrowed, at the Companys option, in U.S.
Dollars or, subject to certain conditions, Euros, British Pounds, Canadian Dollars or Danish Kroner.
Amounts borrowed under the revolving credit facility bear interest at a rate per annum equal to, at the Companys option, either (a) the LIBOR rate (or, in the case of revolving credit loans denominated in a currency other than U.S.
Dollars, the applicable quoted rate), plus a margin that varies within a range of 1.0% to 1.5% based on the Companys consolidated leverage ratio, or (b) a fluctuating reference rate equal to the highest of (i) the federal funds rate plus 0.50%, (ii) Bank of Americas publicly announced prime rate or (iii) the LIBOR rate plus 1.00%, plus a margin that varies within a range of 0.0% to 0.5% based on the Companys consolidated leverage ratio.
The Company is required to pay a commitment fee on the undrawn portion of the revolving credit facility at the rate of 0.25% per annum.
Outstanding borrowings under the revolving credit line during fiscal 2020 bear interest at an average annual rate of 5.71% and the Company has paid $43,000 of interest expense for revolving credit line borrowings for the six months ended August 3, 2019.
The obligations of ANI ApS in respect of the $9.2 million term loan are guaranteed by the Company and TrojanLabel ApS.
The Companys obligations in respect of the $15.0 million term loan, revolving credit facility and its guarantee in respect of the ANI ApS term loan are secured by substantially all of the assets of the Company (including a pledge of a portion of the equity interests held by the Company in ANI ApS and the Companys wholly owned German subsidiary, AstroNova GmbH), subject to certain exceptions.
The Lender is entitled to accelerate repayment of the loans and to terminate its revolving credit commitment under the Credit Agreement upon the occurrence of any of various customary events of default.
The Parties must comply with various customary financial and non-financial covenants under the Credit Agreement.
As of August 3, 2019, the Company believes it is in compliance with all of the covenants in the Credit Agreement.
Cash Flow  

The Companys statements of cash flows for the six months ended August 3, 2019 and July 28, 2018 are included on page 7 of this report.
Net cash provided by operating activities was $1.0 million for the first six months of fiscal 2020 compared to cash used by operating activities of $1.7 million for the same period of the previous year.
The increase in net cash provided by operations for the first six months of the current year is primarily due to the increase in net income, and a decrease in cash used for working capital.
The combination of changes in accounts receivable, inventory, income taxes payable accounts payable and accrued expenses decreased cash by $5.6 million for the first six months of fiscal 2020, compared to a decrease of $7.4 million for the same period in fiscal 2019.
The accounts receivable balance decreased to $20.6 million at the end of the second quarter compared to $23.5 million at year end.
The $2.9 million decrease in the accounts receivable balance from year end is directly related to the decrease in sales for the second quarter of the current year as compared to fourth quarter sales in fiscal 2019.
The net decreased cash position at August 3, 2019 primarily resulted from principal payments of long-term debt and the guaranteed royalty obligation of $2.8 million and $0.9 million, respectively; cash used to acquire property, plant and equipment of $1.5 million and dividends paid of $1.0 million, offset by increased cash provided by operations as discussed above and the current period borrowing on the Companys existing revolving credit facility of $2.0 million.
Contractual Obligations, Commitments and Contingencies  

There have been no material changes to our contractual obligations as disclosed in the Companys Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2019, other than those which occur in the ordinary course of business.
Critical Accounting Policies, Commitments and Certain Other Matters  

The preparation of our condensed consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, and disclosure of commitments and contingencies at the date of the condensed consolidated financial statements and reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period.
We base these estimates and judgments on factors we believe to be relevant, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources.
Table of Contents 

 The process of determining significant estimates is fact-specific and takes into account factors such as historical experience, current and expected economic conditions, product mix, and in some cases, actuarial and appraisal techniques.
We constantly re-evaluate these significant factors and make adjustments where facts and circumstances dictate.
While we believe that the factors considered provide a meaningful basis for the accounting policies applied in the preparation of the condensed consolidated financial statements, we cannot guarantee that our estimates and assumptions will be accurate.
As the determination of these estimates requires the exercise of judgment, actual results may differ from those estimates, and such differences may be material to our condensed consolidated financial statements.
Except for the changes resulting from the adoption of the new lease accounting standard during the period, there have been no material changes to the application of critical accounting policies as disclosed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2019.
See Note 11, Leases, in Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part I, Item 1 of this Form 10-Q, for an update on our lease accounting policy.
