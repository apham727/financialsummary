Headquartered in West Warwick, Rhode Island, AstroNova, Inc. leverages its expertise in data visualization technologies to design, develop, manufacture and distribute a broad range of specialty printers and data acquisition and analysis systems.
Our products are employed around the world in a wide range of applications in the aerospace, apparel, automotive, avionics, chemical, computer peripherals, communications, distribution, food and beverage, general manufacturing, packaging and transportation industries.
In the United States, the Company has factory-trained direct field salespeople located in major cities from coast to coast.
We also have direct field sales or service centers in Canada, China, Denmark, France, Germany, India, Malaysia, Mexico, Singapore, Spain and the United Kingdom staffed by our own employees and dedicated third-party contractors.
Additionally, we utilize over 150 independent dealers and representatives selling and marketing our products in over 50 countries.
Unless otherwise indicated, references to AstroNova, the Company, we, our, and us in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q refer to AstroNova, Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries.
Basis of Presentation
The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles and reflect all adjustments consisting of normal recurring adjustments which, in the opinion of management, are necessary for a fair presentation of the results of the interim periods included herein.
These financial statements do not include all disclosures associated with annual financial statements and, accordingly, should be read in conjunction with the Companys Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2019.
The presentation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported and disclosed in the condensed consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes.
Some of the more significant estimates relate to revenue recognition, the allowances for doubtful accounts, inventory valuation, income taxes, impairment of long-lived assets and goodwill, share-based compensation, accrued expenses, lease accounting and warranty reserves.
Managements estimates are based on the facts and circumstances available at the time estimates are made, historical experience, risk of loss, general economic conditions and trends, and managements assessments of the probable future outcome of these matters.
Consequently, actual results could differ from those estimates.
Results of operations for the interim periods presented herein are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for the full year.
Certain amounts in the prior year financial statements have been reclassified to conform to the current years presentation.
Principles of Consolidation
The accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its wholly-owned subsidiaries.
All significant intercompany accounts and transactions are eliminated in consolidation.

Note 2  Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Update
The accounting polices used in preparing the condensed consolidated financial statements in this Form 10-Q are the same as those used in preparing the Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended January 31, 2019, except for the change resulting from the adoption of Accounting Standard Codification Topic 842 (ASC 842), Leases.
See Note 11 for further details related to the new lease accounting policy as a result of this adoption.
Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements
Leases
In February 2019, the Company adopted the guidance issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) related to leases.
See Note 11 for further details related to this adoption, including policy and expanded disclosure requirements.
Recent Accounting Standards Not Yet Adopted
Internal-Use Software
Fair Value Measurement
In August 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-13, Fair Value Measurement (Topic 820), Disclosure Framework-Changes to the Disclosure Requirements for Fair Value Measurement. ASU 2018-13 modifies the disclosure requirements for fair value measurements by removing, modifying or adding certain disclosures.
This ASU is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2019 including interim periods within those fiscal years (Q1 fiscal 2021 for AstroNova), with early adoption permitted.
The provisions of ASU 2018-13 relating to changes in unrealized gains and losses, the range and weighted average of significant unobservable inputs used to develop Level 3 fair value measurements, and the narrative description of measurement uncertainty should be applied prospectively for only the most recent interim or annual period presented in the initial fiscal year of adoption.
The remaining provisions should be applied retrospectively to all periods presented upon their effective date.
The Company is currently evaluating the impact this new guidance will have on its consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.
No other new accounting pronouncements, issued or effective during the six months of the current year, have had or are expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.
Note 3  Revenue Recognition
We derive revenue from the sale of (i) hardware, including digital color label printers and specialty OEM printing systems, portable data acquisition systems and airborne printers used in the flight deck and cabin of military, commercial and business aircraft, (ii) related supplies required in the operation of the hardware, (iii) repairs and maintenance of hardware and (iv) service agreements.
Table of Contents
Contract Assets and Liabilities
We normally do not have contract assets, which are primarily unbilled accounts receivable that are conditional on something other than the passage of time.
Our contract liabilities, which represent billings in excess of revenue recognized, are related to advanced billings for purchased service agreements and extended warranties and were $321,000 and $373,000 at August 3, 2019 and January 31, 2019, respectively, and are recorded as deferred revenue in the condensed consolidated balance sheet.
The decrease in the deferred revenue balance during the six months ended August 3, 2019 is primarily due to approximately $412,000 of revenue recognized during the period that was included in the deferred revenue balance at January 31, 2019, offset by cash payments received in advance of satisfying performance obligations.
Contract Costs
We recognize an asset for the incremental costs of obtaining a contract with a customer if we expect the benefit of those costs to be longer than one year.
We have determined that certain costs related to obtaining sales contracts for our aerospace printer products meet the requirement to be capitalized.
These costs are deferred and amortized based on the forecasted number of units sold over the estimated benefit term, which was estimated to be approximately 10 years.
The balance of these contract assets at January 31, 2019 was $903,000.
During the six month ended August 3, 2019, amortization of these incremental direct costs were $54,000 and the balance of deferred incremental direct costs net of accumulated amortization at August 3, 2019 was $848,000, of which $109,000 is reported in other current assets and $739,000 is reported in other assets in the accompanying condensed consolidated balance sheet.
The remaining contract costs are expected to be amortized over the estimated remaining period of benefit, which we currently estimate to be approximately 7 years.
Table of Contents
Note 4  Net Income Per Common Share
For the three and six months ended August 3, 2019, the diluted per share amounts do not reflect common equivalent shares outstanding of 11,560 and 218,466, respectively.
For the three and six months ended July 28, 2018, the diluted per share amounts do not reflect common equivalent shares outstanding of 273,275 and 340,575, respectively.
These outstanding common equivalent shares were not included due to their anti-dilutive effect.
Note 5  Intangible Assets
There were no impairments to intangible assets during the periods ended August 3, 2019 and July 28, 2018.
With respect to the acquired intangibles included in the table above, amortization expense of $1.1 million and $1.0 million has been included in the condensed consolidated statements of income for the three months ended August 3, 2019 and July 28, 2018, respectively.
Amortization expense of $2.1 million and $2.0 million related to the above acquired intangibles has been included in the condensed consolidated statement of income for the six months ended August 3, 2019 and July 28, 2018, respectively.

Note 6  Inventories
Note 7  Revolving Line of Credit
The Company has a $10.0 million revolving line of credit under its existing Credit Agreement with Bank of America.
Revolving credit loans may be borrowed, at the Companys option, in U.S.
Dollars or, subject to certain conditions, Euros, British Pounds, Canadian Dollars or Danish Kroner.
Amounts borrowed under the revolving credit facility bear interest at a rate per annum equal to, at the Companys option, either (a) the LIBOR rate (or, in the case of revolving credit loans denominated in a currency other than U.S.
Dollars, the applicable quoted rate), plus a margin that varies within a range of 1.0% to 1.5% based on the Companys consolidated leverage ratio, or (b) a fluctuating reference rate equal to the highest of (i) the federal funds rate plus 0.50%, (ii) Bank of Americas publicly announced prime rate or (iii) the LIBOR rate plus 1.00%, plus a margin that varies within a range of 0.0% to 0.5% based on the Companys consolidated leverage ratio.
During the second quarter of fiscal 2020, $2.0 million was drawn on the revolving credit facility.
During fiscal 2019, $3.0 million was drawn on the revolving credit facility, of which $1.5 million was repaid.
At August 3, 2019, $3.5 million remains outstanding on the revolving line of credit.
The outstanding balance bears interest at a weighted average annual rate of 5.71% and $24,000 and $43,000 of interest has been incurred on this obligation and included in other expense in the accompanying condensed consolidated income statement for the three and six month periods ended August 3, 2019, respectively.
As of August 3, 2019, there is $6.5 million available for borrowing under the revolving credit facility.
The Company is required to pay a commitment fee on the undrawn portion of the revolving credit facility at the rate of 0.25% per annum.
Note 8  Debt
Table of Contents
Note 9  Derivative Financial Instruments and Risk Management
The Company has entered into a cross-currency interest rate swap to manage the interest rate risk and foreign currency exchange risk associated with the floating-rate foreign currency-denominated term loan borrowing by our Danish Subsidiary and an interest rate swap to manage the interest rate risk associated with the variable rate term loan borrowing by the Company.
Both swaps have been designated as cash flow hedges of floating-rate borrowings.
The cross-currency interest rate swap agreement utilized by the Company effectively modifies the Companys exposure to interest rate risk and foreign currency exchange rate risk by converting the Companys floating-rate debt denominated in U.S.
Dollars on our Danish subsidiarys books to a fixed-rate debt denominated in Danish Kroner for the term of the loan, thus reducing the impact of interest-rate and foreign currency exchange rate changes on future interest expense and principal repayments.
This swap involves the receipt of floating rate amounts in U.S.
Dollars in exchange for fixed-rate interest payments in Danish Kroner, as well as exchanges of principal at the inception spot rate, over the life of the term loan.
The interest rate swap agreement utilized by the Company on its term loan effectively modifies the Companys exposure to interest rate risk by converting the Companys floating-rate debt to fixed-rate debt for the next five years, thus reducing the impact of interest-rate changes on future interest expense.
This swap involves the receipt of floating rate amounts in U.S.
Dollars in exchange for fixed rate payments in U.S. dollars over the life of the term loan.
Table of Contents
At August 3, 2019, the Company expects to reclassify approximately $0.2 million of net gains on the swap contracts from accumulated other comprehensive loss to earnings during the next 12 months due to changes in foreign exchange rates and the payment of variable interest associated with the floating-rate debt.
Note 10  Royalty Obligation
In fiscal 2018, AstroNova, Inc. entered into an Asset Purchase and License Agreement with Honeywell International, Inc. (Honeywell) to acquire an exclusive, perpetual, world-wide license to manufacture Honeywells narrow-format flight deck printers for two aircraft families along with certain inventory used in the manufacturing of the licensed printers.
The purchase price included a guaranteed minimum royalty payment of $15.0 million, to be paid over ten years, based on gross revenues from the sales of the printers, paper and repair services of the licensed products.
The royalty rates vary based on the year in which they are paid or earned and product sold or service provided, and range from single-digit to mid double-digit percentages of gross revenue.
The guaranteed minimum royalty payment obligation was recorded at the present value of the minimum annual royalty payments using a present value factor of 2.8%, which is based on the estimated after-tax cost of debt for similar companies.
As of August 3, 2019, the Company had paid an aggregate of $2.5 million of the guaranteed minimum royalty obligation.
At August 3, 2019, the current portion of the outstanding guaranteed minimum royalty obligation of $2.0 million is to be paid over the next twelve months and is reported as a current liability and the remainder of $9.0 million is reported as a long-term liability on the Companys condensed consolidated balance sheet.
In addition to the guaranteed minimum royalty payments, the Company also incurred excess royalty expense of $0.1 million and $0.7 million, respectively, for the three and six month periods ended August 3, 2019 and $0.9 and $1.3 million, respectively, for the three and six month periods ended July 28, 2018 which is included in cost of revenue in the Companys consolidated statements of income.
A total of $0.6 million of excess royalty is payable and reported as a current liability on the Companys condensed consolidated balance sheet at August 3, 2019.
Note 11  Leases
Policy
On February 1, 2019 the Company adopted ASC 842, Leases.
This new guidance requires a lessee to recognize assets and liabilities on the balance sheet for all leases, with the result being the recognition of a right of use (ROU) asset and a lease liability.
The lease liability is equal to the present value of the minimum lease payments for the term of the lease, including any optional renewal periods determined to be reasonably certain to be exercised, using a discount rate determined at lease commencement.
This discount rate is the rate implicit in the lease, if known; otherwise, the incremental borrowing rate for the expected lease term is used.
The Companys incremental borrowing rate approximates the rate the Company would have to pay to borrow on a collateralized basis over a similar term at lease inception.
The value of the ROU asset is equal to the initial measurement of the lease liability plus any lease payments made to the lessor at or before the commencement date and any unamortized initial direct costs incurred by the lessee, less any unamortized lease incentives received.
There are two types of leases, operating leases and finance leases.
Lease classification is determined at lease commencement.
All of the Companys leases are classified as operating leases.
Operating lease expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term and included in general and administrative expense on the condensed consolidated statement of income.
For operating leases, ROU assets are classified in other long-term assets, short-term lease liabilities are classified in other current liabilities, and long-term lease liabilities are classified in other long-term liabilities on the condensed consolidated balance sheet.
On the cash flow statement, payments for operating leases are classified as operating activities.
The Company enters into lease contracts for certain of its facilities at various locations worldwide.
At inception of a contract, the Company determines whether the contract is or contains a lease.
If the Company has a right to obtain substantially all of the economic benefits from the use of the identified asset and the right to direct the use of the asset, then the contract contains a lease.
Several of the Companys lease contracts include options to extend the lease term and Company includes the renewal options for these leases in the determination of the ROU asset and lease liability when the likelihood of renewal is determined to be reasonably certain.
Table of Contents
In addition, several of our lease agreements include non-lease components for items such as common area maintenance and utilities which are accounted for separately from the lease component.
Adoption Method and Impact
The Company applied ASC 842 to all leases in effect at February 1, 2019 and adopted the accounting standard using the non-comparative transition option, which does not require the restatement of prior years.
Comparative information has not been adjusted and continues to be reported under the previous accounting guidance.
The Company has elected the package of practical expedients, which allows entities to not reassess (1) whether contracts are or contain leases, (2) lease classification and (3) initial direct costs.
The Company has made an accounting policy election to apply the short-term exception, which does not require the capitalization of leases with terms of 12 months or less.
On February 1, 2019, the Company recognized $2.0 million of ROU assets and lease liabilities on its consolidated balance sheet.
The adoption did not have a material impact on the Companys results of operations or cash flows.
Disclosure
Our leases have remaining lease terms of 1 to 12 years, some of which include options to extend the lease term for periods up to 5 years when it is reasonably certain the Company will exercise such options.
The company leases office space from an affiliate.
This lease is classified as an operating lease with annual rental payments of approximately $64,000 and $66,000 in fiscal 2020 and 2021, respectively.
Table of Contents
As of August 3, 2019, the weighted-average remaining lease term and weighted-average discount rate for our operating leases are 6.1 years and 4.02%, respectively.
We calculated the weighted-average discount rate using incremental borrowing rates, which equal the rates of interest that we would pay to borrow funds on a fully collateralized basis over a similar term.
Note 12  Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss
Table of Contents
The amounts presented above in other comprehensive loss are net of taxes except for translation adjustments associated with our German and Danish subsidiaries.
Note 13  Share-Based Compensation
We have one equity incentive plan from which we are authorized to grant equity awards, the AstroNova, Inc. 2018 Equity Incentive Plan (the 2018 Plan).
The 2018 Plan provides for, among other things, the issuance of awards, including incentive stock options, non-qualified stock options, stock appreciation rights, time or performance-based restricted stock unit (PSUs), restricted stock units (RSUs) and restricted stock awards (RSAs).
At the annual meeting of shareholders, on June 4, 2019, the 2018 Plan was amended to increase the number of shares of the Companys common stock available for issuance by 300,000, bringing the total number of shares available for issuance under the 2018 Plan from 650,000 to 950,000, plus an additional number of shares equal to the number of shares subject to awards granted under previous equity incentive plans that are forfeited, cancelled, satisfied without the issuance of stock, otherwise terminated (other than by exercise), or, for shares of stock issued pursuant to any unvested award, reacquired by the Company at not more than the grantees purchase price (other than by exercise).
Under the 2018 Plan, all awards to employees generally have a minimum vesting period of one year.
Options granted under the 2018 Plan must be issued at an exercise price of not less than the fair market value of the Companys common stock on the date of grant and expire after ten years.
As of August 3, 2019, 163,475 unvested shares of restricted stock and options to purchase an aggregate of 146,000 shares were outstanding under the 2018 Plan.
In addition to the 2018 Plan, we previously granted equity awards under our 2015 Equity Incentive Plan (the 2015 Plan) and our 2007 Equity Incentive Plan (the 2007 Plan).
Both the 2007 Plan and the 2015 Plan have expired and no new awards may be issued under either, but outstanding awards will continue to be governed by those plans.
As of August 3, 2019, 1,007 unvested shares of restricted stock and options to purchase an aggregate of 382,845 shares were outstanding under the 2007 Plan and 27,527 unvested shares of restricted stock and options to purchase an aggregate of 194,650 shares were outstanding under the 2015 Plan.
On January 31, 2019, the compensation committee of the Companys board of directors adopted an Amended and Restated Non-Employee Director Annual Compensation Program (the New Program), which became effective as of February 1, 2019 and supersedes the prior program.
Pursuant to the New Program, beginning with fiscal 2020, each non-employee director will automatically receive a grant of restricted stock on the date of their re-election to the Companys board of directors.
The number of whole shares to be granted will be equal to the number calculated by dividing the stock component of the director compensation amount determined by the compensation committee for that year by the fair market value of our stock on that day.
The value of the restricted stock award for fiscal 2020 is $60,000.
To account for the partial year beginning on February 1, 2019 and continuing through the 2019 annual meeting, and thereby provide for the alignment of the timing of annual grants of restricted stock under the New Program with the election of directors at the annual meeting, a total of 4,340 shares of restricted stock were granted to the non-employee directors on February 1, 2019.
A total of 11,560 shares were awarded to the non-employee directors as compensation under the New Program in the second quarter of fiscal 2020.
Other than the shares granted on February 1, 2019, which vested on June 1, 2019, shares of restricted stock granted under the New Program will become vested on the first anniversary of the date of grant, conditioned upon the recipients continued service on the Board through that date.
In March 2019, the Company granted 45,374 RSUs and 52,248 PSUs to certain key employees.
Table of Contents
Stock Options
The weighted average fair value per share for options granted was $7.42 and $7.41 during the three and six month periods ended July 28, 2018, respectively.
As of August 3, 2019, there was approximately $1.1 million of unrecognized compensation expense related to stock options which is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of approximately 2.0 years.
Restricted Stock Units (RSUs) and Restricted Stock Awards (RSAs)
Table of Contents
As of August 3, 2019, there was approximately $2.9 million of unrecognized compensation expense related to RSUs and RSAs which is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of 1.9 years.
Employee Stock Purchase Plan
AstroNova has an Employee Stock Purchase Plan allowing eligible employees to purchase shares of common stock at a 15% discount from fair value on the first or last day of an offering period, whichever is less.
A total of 247,500 shares were reserved for issuance under this plan.
During the six months ended August 3, 2019 and July 28, 2018, there were 2,796 and 2,342 shares, respectively, purchased under this plan.
As of August 3, 2019, 31,057 shares remain available.
Note 14  Income Taxes
The Company determines its estimated annual effective tax rate at the end of each interim period based on full-year forecasted pre-tax income and facts known at that time.
The estimated annual effective tax rate is applied to the year-to-date pre-tax income at the end of each interim period with the cumulative effect of any changes in the estimated annual effective tax rate being recorded in the fiscal quarter in which the change is determined.
The tax effect of significant unusual items is reflected in the period in which they occur.
During the three months ended August 3, 2019, the Company recognized an income tax expense of approximately $29,000.
The effective tax rate in this period was directly impacted by 1) a significant reduction in forecasted operating results for our fiscal 2020 as compared to operating results forecasted at the end of our first quarter of fiscal 2020 and 2) a $135,000 tax benefit arising from windfall tax benefits related to the Companys stock.
During the three months ended July 28, 2018, the Company recognized an income tax expense of approximately $459,000.
The effective tax rate in this period was directly impacted by an $82,000 benefit arising from windfall tax benefits related to the Companys stock.
During the six months ended August 3, 2019, the Company recognized an income tax expense of approximately $429,000.
The effective tax rate in this period was directly impacted by 1) a $53,000 tax benefit related to the expiration of the statute of limitations on a previously uncertain tax position and 2) a $232,000 tax benefit arising from windfall tax benefits related to the Companys stock.
During the six months ended July 28, 2018, the Company recognized an income tax expense of approximately $639,000.
The effective tax rate in this period was directly impacted by a $112,000 tax benefit arising from windfall tax benefits related to the Companys stock and a $78,000 tax benefit related to the expiration of the statute of limitations on a previously uncertain tax position.
The Company maintains a valuation allowance on some of its deferred tax assets in certain jurisdictions.
A valuation allowance is required when, based upon an assessment of various factors, including recent operating loss history, anticipated future earnings, and prudent and reasonable tax planning strategies, it is more likely than not that some portion of the deferred tax assets will not be realized.
Unrecognized tax benefits represent the difference between tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return and the benefits recognized for financial reporting purposes.
As of August 3, 2019, the Companys cumulative unrecognized tax benefits totaled $592,000 compared to $618,000 as of January 31, 2019.
Besides the expiration of the statute of limitations on a previously uncertain tax position, there were no other developments affecting unrecognized tax benefits during the quarter ended August 3, 2019.

Note 16  Fair Value
Assets and Liabilities Recorded at Fair Value on a Recurring Basis
We use the market approach to measure fair value of our derivative instruments.
Derivative instruments were measured at fair value using readily observable market inputs, such as quotations on interest rates and foreign exchange rates, and are classified as Level 2 because they are over-the-counter contracts with a bank counterparty that are not traded in an active market.
Table of Contents
The fair value of the earnout liability incurred in connection with the Companys acquisition of TrojanLabel was determined using the option approach methodology, which includes using significant inputs that are not observable in the market and therefore classified as Level 3.
Key assumptions in estimating the fair value of the contingent consideration liability included (1) the estimated earnout targets over the next seven years of $0.5 million-$1.4 million, (2) the probability of success (achievement of the various contingent events) from 0.0%-0.9% and (3) a risk-adjusted discount rate of approximately 2.68%-4.9% used to adjust the probability-weighted earnout payments to their present value.
At each reporting period, the contingent consideration liability is recorded at its fair value with changes reflected in general and administrative expense in the condensed consolidated statements of operations.
There was no change in the fair value of the earnout liability for the six months ended August 3, 2019.
Assets and Liabilities Not Recorded at Fair Value
The fair value of the Companys long-term debt, including the current portion, is estimated by discounting the future cash flows using current interest rates at which similar loans with the same maturities would be made to borrowers with similar credit ratings and is classified as Level 3.
