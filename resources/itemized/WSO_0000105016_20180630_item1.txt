NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED UNAUDITED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  



June 30, 2018  



(In thousands, except share and per share data)  



 1. BASIS OF PRESENTATION  



Basis of Consolidation  



Watsco, Inc. (collectively with its subsidiaries, Watsco, we, us or our) was incorporated in Florida in 1956 and is the largest distributor of air conditioning, heating and refrigeration equipment and related parts and supplies (HVAC/R) in the HVAC/R distribution industry in North America. The accompanying June 30, 2018 interim condensed consolidated unaudited financial statements have been prepared pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission. Certain information and note disclosures normally included in the annual financial statements prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) have been condensed or omitted pursuant to those rules and regulations, but we believe the disclosures made are adequate to make the information presented not misleading. In the opinion of management, all adjustments, consisting of normal and recurring adjustments, necessary for a fair presentation have been included in the condensed consolidated unaudited financial statements included herein. These statements should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in our 2017 Annual Report on Form 10-K.  



The condensed consolidated unaudited financial statements contained in this report include the accounts of Watsco, all of its wholly owned subsidiaries and the accounts of three joint ventures with Carrier Corporation (Carrier), in each of which Watsco maintains a controlling interest. All significant intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.  



The results of operations for the quarter and six months ended June 30, 2018 are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for the year ending December 31, 2018. Sales of residential central air conditioners, heating equipment, and parts and supplies are seasonal. Furthermore, results of operations can be impacted favorably or unfavorably based on weather patterns, primarily during the Summer and Winter selling seasons. Demand related to the residential central air conditioning replacement market is typically highest in the second and third quarters, and demand for heating equipment is usually highest in the fourth quarter. Demand related to the new construction market is generally evenly distributed throughout the year, subject to weather and economic conditions, including their effect on the number of housing completions.  



Equity Method Investments  



Investments in which we have the ability to exercise significant influence, but do not control, are accounted for under the equity method of accounting and are included in other assets in our consolidated balance sheets. Under this method of accounting, our proportionate share of the net income or loss of the investee is included in other income in our consolidated statements of income. The excess, if any, of the carrying amount of our investment over our ownership percentage in the underlying net assets of the investee is attributed to certain fair value adjustments with the remaining portion recognized as goodwill.  



Reclassifications  



Certain reclassifications of prior year amounts have been made to conform to the 2018 presentation. These reclassifications had no effect on net income or earnings per share as previously reported.  



Use of Estimates  



The preparation of condensed consolidated unaudited financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the condensed consolidated unaudited financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses for the reporting period. Significant estimates include valuation reserves for accounts receivable, inventories and income taxes, reserves related to self-insurance programs and the valuation of goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets. While we believe that these estimates are reasonable, actual results could differ from such estimates.  



Recently Adopted Accounting Standards  



Revenue Recognition  



In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (the FASB) issued a standard on revenue recognition that provides a single, comprehensive revenue recognition model for all contracts with customers. The standard is principle-based and provides a five-step model to determine the measurement of revenue and timing of when it is recognized. In 2015 and 2016, the FASB issued several updates to this standard. The adoption of this standard and its related amendments (collectively, the New Revenue Standard) on January 1, 2018 did not result in the recognition of a cumulative adjustment to opening retained earnings under the modified retrospective approach, nor did it have a significant impact on our consolidated net income, balance sheet or cash flow. See Note 2.

Table of Contents 



Financial Instruments  



In January 2016, the FASB issued guidance related to certain aspects of recognition, measurement, presentation and disclosure of financial instruments. Most prominent among the changes to the standard is the requirement that changes in the fair value of equity investments, with certain exceptions, be recognized through net income rather than other comprehensive income. This guidance must be applied using a modified retrospective approach through a cumulative-effect adjustment to retained earnings and became effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2017. The adoption of this guidance did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. A cumulative-effect adjustment captured the previously held unrealized losses of $301 related to our equity investment carried at fair value. See Note 4.  



Stock Compensation  



In May 2017, the FASB issued guidance to clarify when to account for a change to the terms or conditions of a share-based payment award as a modification. Under the new guidance, modification accounting is required only if the fair value, the vesting conditions or the classification of the award (as equity or liability) changes as a result of the change in terms or conditions. This guidance must be applied prospectively and became effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2017. The adoption of this guidance did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.  



Derivatives and Hedging  



In August 2017, the FASB issued guidance to simplify the accounting for hedging derivatives. This guidance is effective prospectively and is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2018 with early adoption permitted. We elected to adopt this guidance during the quarter ended June 30, 2018, which did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.  



Recently Issued Accounting Standards Not Yet Adopted  



Leases  



In February 2016, the FASB issued guidance on accounting for leases, which requires lessees to recognize most leases on their balance sheets for the rights and obligations created by those leases. We will apply this guidance using a modified retrospective approach, and it will be effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2018. Based on our preliminary assessment of our lease portfolio, we expect the adoption of this guidance to have a material impact on our consolidated balance sheets due to the recognition of right-of-use assets and lease liabilities. However, we do not expect a material impact on our consolidated statements of income. We are in the process of collecting data and designing processes and controls to account for our leases in accordance with the new guidance. Our current minimum lease commitments are disclosed in Note 16 to our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2017.  



IntangiblesGoodwill and Other  



In January 2017, the FASB issued guidance to simplify the subsequent measurement of goodwill by eliminating Step 2 from the goodwill impairment test. Under this updated standard, an entity should recognize an impairment charge for the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the reporting units fair value, but the loss recognized should not exceed the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit. An entity also should consider income tax effects from any tax-deductible goodwill on the carrying amount of the reporting unit when measuring the goodwill impairment loss, if any. This guidance is effective prospectively and is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2019 with early adoption permitted. We do not expect the adoption of this guidance to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.  



 2. REVENUES  



Adoption of New Revenue Standard  



We adopted the New Revenue Standard on January 1, 2018 using the modified retrospective approach. The New Revenue Standard did not have an impact on the amount and timing of our revenue recognition; however, certain payments to customers were reclassified from expense to a reduction from revenues, resulting in an immaterial impact to the individual financial statement line items of our condensed consolidated unaudited statements of income. Results for reporting periods beginning on and after January 1, 2018 are presented under the New Revenue Standard, while prior period results have not been adjusted and continue to be reported under the accounting standards in effect for those periods.  



Revenue Recognition  



Revenue primarily consists of sales of air conditioning, heating and refrigeration equipment and related parts and supplies. We generate our revenue primarily from the sale of finished products to customers; therefore, the significant majority of our contracts are short-term in nature and have only a single performance obligation to deliver products; therefore, we satisfy our performance  



8 of 24  



Table of Contents 



 obligation under such contracts when we transfer control of the product to the customer. Some contracts contain a combination of product sales and services, the latter of which is distinct and accounted for as a separate performance obligation. We satisfy our performance obligations for services when we render the services within the agreed-upon service period. Total service revenue is not material and accounted for less than 1% of our consolidated revenues for both the quarter and six months ended June 30, 2018.  



Revenue is recognized when control transfers to our customers when picked up or via shipment of products or delivery of services. We measure revenue as the amount of consideration we expect to be entitled to receive in exchange for those goods or services, net of any variable considerations (e.g., rights to return product, sales incentives, others) and any taxes collected from customers and subsequently remitted to governmental authorities. Revenue for shipping and handling charges is recognized when products are delivered to the customer.  



Product Returns  



We estimate product returns based on historical experience and record them on a gross basis. Substantially all customer returns relate to products that are returned under manufacturers warranty obligations. Accrued sales returns of $17,437 at June 30, 2018 were included in accrued expenses and other current liabilities in our condensed consolidated unaudited balance sheet.  



Sales Incentives  



We estimate sales incentives expected to be paid over the term of the program based on the most likely amount. Sales incentives are accounted for as a reduction in the transaction price and are generally paid on an annual basis. Accrued sales incentives of $11,600 and $13,001 as of June 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017, respectively, were included in accrued expenses and other current liabilities in our condensed consolidated unaudited balance sheets.  



Disaggregation of Revenues  



The following table presents our revenues disaggregated by primary geographical regions and major product lines within our single reporting segment:  



  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 



   (1) As noted above, prior period amounts have not been adjusted under the modified retrospective method and remain as originally reported for such periods.  



Practical Expedients  



We generally expense sales commissions when incurred because the amortization period is one year or less. These costs are recorded within selling, general and administrative expenses. We do not disclose the value of unsatisfied performance obligations for contracts with an original expected length of one year or less.

 3. EARNINGS PER SHARE  



The following table presents the calculation of basic and diluted earnings per share for our Common and Class B common stock:  



  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 



Diluted earnings per share for our Common stock assumes the conversion of all of our Class B common stock into Common stock as of the beginning of the fiscal year; therefore, no allocation of earnings to Class B common stock is required. At June 30, 2018 and 2017, our outstanding Class B common stock was convertible into 2,599,496 and 2,709,311 shares of our Common stock, respectively.

 4. OTHER COMPREHENSIVE (LOSS) INCOME  



Other comprehensive (loss) income consists of the foreign currency translation adjustment associated with our Canadian operations use of the Canadian dollar as its functional currency and changes in the unrealized gains (losses) on cash flow hedging instruments and equity securities. The tax effects allocated to each component of other comprehensive (loss) income were as follows:  



  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 



The changes in each component of accumulated other comprehensive loss, net of tax, were as follows:  



  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 



 5. DEBT  



We maintain an unsecured, syndicated revolving credit agreement, which we use to fund seasonal working capital needs and for other general corporate purposes, including acquisitions, dividends (if and as declared by our Board of Directors), capital expenditures, stock repurchases and issuances of letters of credit. Effective February 5, 2018, we decreased the borrowing capacity under this credit agreement from $600,000 to $300,000. Included in the credit facility are a $90,000 swingline subfacility, a $10,000 letter of credit subfacility and a $75,000 multicurrency borrowing sublimit. The credit agreement matures on July 1, 2019.  



11 of 24  



Table of Contents 



At June 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017, $141,600 and $21,800, respectively, were outstanding under the revolving credit agreement. The revolving credit agreement contains customary affirmative and negative covenants, including financial covenants with respect to consolidated leverage and interest coverage ratios, and other customary restrictions. We believe we were in compliance with all covenants at June 30, 2018.  



At June 30, 2018, $1,510 of short-term borrowings were outstanding under a credit line established by our Mexican subsidiary. This line of credit has a one-year term, maturing on June 12, 2019, is non-committed and provides for borrowings of up to approximately $3,800 (MXN 75,000) for general corporate purposes. No short-term borrowings were outstanding under this credit line at December 31, 2017.  



 6. PURCHASE OF ADDITIONAL OWNERSHIP INTEREST IN JOINT VENTURE  



On February 13, 2017, we purchased an additional 10% ownership interest in Carrier Enterprise Northeast LLC, which we refer to as Carrier Enterprise II, for cash consideration of $42,688, which increased our controlling interest from 70% to 80%. Carrier Enterprise II was formed in 2011 as a joint venture with Carrier. Carrier Enterprise II had sales of approximately $545,000 in 2017 from 40 locations in the northeastern United States and 14 locations in Mexico.  



 7. INVESTMENT IN UNCONSOLIDATED ENTITY  



On June 21, 2017, our first joint venture with Carrier, Carrier Enterprise, LLC, which we refer to as Carrier Enterprise I, acquired an approximately 35% ownership interest in Russell Sigler, Inc. (RSI), an HVAC distributor with 2017 sales of approximately $680,000, operating from 30 locations in the Western U.S. We have an 80% controlling interest in Carrier Enterprise I, and Carrier has a 20% non-controlling interest. Carrier Enterprise I acquired its ownership interest in RSI for cash consideration of $63,600, of which we contributed $50,880 and Carrier contributed $12,720. Effective June 29, 2018, Carrier Enterprise I acquired an additional 1.4% voting equity interest in RSI, which increased Carrier Enterprise Is ownership interest in RSI from approximately 35% to 36.3%. Total cash consideration of $3,760 was paid on July 5, 2018, of which we contributed $3,008 and Carrier contributed $752. Carrier Enterprise I entered into a shareholders agreement (the Shareholders Agreement) with RSI and its shareholders. Pursuant to the Shareholders Agreement, RSIs shareholders have the right to sell, and Carrier Enterprise I has the obligation to purchase, their respective shares of RSI for a purchase price determined based on either book value or a multiple of EBIT, the latter of which Carrier Enterprise I used to calculate the price paid for its investment in RSI. RSIs shareholders may transfer their respective shares of RSI common stock only to members of the Sigler family or to Carrier Enterprise I, and, at any time from and after the date on which Carrier Enterprise I owns 85% or more of RSIs outstanding common stock, it has the right, but not the obligation, to purchase from RSIs shareholders the remaining outstanding shares of RSI common stock. Additionally, Carrier Enterprise I has the right to appoint two of RSIs six board members. Given Carrier Enterprise Is 36.3% voting equity interest in RSI and its right to appoint two out of RSIs six board members, this investment in RSI is accounted for under the equity method.  



 8. DERIVATIVES  



We enter into foreign currency forward and option contracts to offset the earnings impact that foreign exchange rate fluctuations would otherwise have on certain monetary liabilities that are denominated in nonfunctional currencies.  



Cash Flow Hedging Instruments  



We enter into foreign currency forward contracts that are designated as cash flow hedges. The settlement of these derivatives results in reclassifications from accumulated other comprehensive loss to earnings for the period in which the settlement of these instruments occurs. The maximum period for which we hedge our cash flow using these instruments is 12 months. Accordingly, at June 30, 2018, all of our open foreign currency forward contracts had maturities of one year or less. The total notional value of our foreign currency exchange contracts designated as cash flow hedges at June 30, 2018 was $31,700, and such contracts have varying terms expiring through March 2019.  



The impact from foreign exchange derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges was as follows:  



  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 



At June 30, 2018, we expected an estimated $941 pre-tax gain to be reclassified into earnings to reflect the fixed prices obtained from foreign exchange hedging within the next 12 months.  



12 of 24  



Table of Contents 



Derivatives Not Designated as Hedging Instruments  



We have also entered into foreign currency forward and option contracts that are either not designated as hedges or did not qualify for hedge accounting. These derivative instruments were effective economic hedges for all of the periods presented. The fair value gains and losses on these contracts are recognized in earnings as a component of selling, general and administrative expenses. The total notional value of our foreign currency exchange contracts not designated as hedging instruments at June 30, 2018 was $11,750, and such contracts have varying terms expiring through August 2018.  



We recognized gains of $180 and $173 from foreign currency forward and option contracts not designated as hedging instruments in our condensed consolidated unaudited statements of income for the quarters ended June 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively. We recognized losses of $191 and $410 from foreign currency forward and option contracts not designated as hedging instruments in our condensed consolidated unaudited statements of income for the six months ended June 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively.  



The following table summarizes the fair value of derivative instruments, which consist solely of foreign exchange contracts, included in other current assets and accrued expenses and other current liabilities in our condensed consolidated unaudited balance sheets. See Note 9.  



  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 



 9. FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS  



The following tables present our assets and liabilities carried at fair value that are measured on a recurring basis:  



  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 



The following is a description of the valuation techniques used for these assets and liabilities, as well as the level of input used to measure fair value:  



Equity securities  the investments are exchange-traded equity securities. Fair values for these investments are based on closing stock prices from active markets and are therefore classified within Level 1 of the fair value hierarchy.  



Derivative financial instruments  these derivatives are foreign currency forward and option contracts. See Note 8. Fair value is based on observable market inputs, such as forward rates in active markets; therefore, we classify these derivatives within Level 2 of the valuation hierarchy.  



13 of 24  



Table of Contents 



There were no transfers in or out of Level 1 and Level 2 during the six months ended June 30, 2018.  



 10. SHAREHOLDERS EQUITY  



Common Stock Dividends  



We paid cash dividends of $1.45, $1.05, $2.70 and $2.10 per share of both Common stock and Class B common stock during the quarters and six months ended June 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively.  



Non-Vested Restricted Stock  



During the quarters ended June 30, 2018 and 2017, we granted 8,500 and 55,500 shares of non-vested restricted stock, respectively. During the six months ended June 30, 2018 and 2017, we granted 100,109 and 155,899 shares of non-vested restricted stock, respectively.  



During the quarter and six months ended June 30, 2018, 12,924 shares of Common stock with an aggregate fair market value of $2,213 were withheld as payment in lieu of cash to satisfy tax withholding obligations in connection with the vesting of non-vested restricted stock. These shares were retired upon delivery. During the quarter and six months ended June 30, 2017, 20,100 shares of Common stock with an aggregate fair market value of $2,771 were withheld as payment in lieu of cash to satisfy tax withholding obligations in connection with the vesting of non-vested restricted stock. These shares were retired upon delivery.  



Exercise of Stock Options  



During the quarters ended June 30, 2018 and 2017, 9,501 and 2,250 stock options, respectively, were exercised for Common stock. During the six months ended June 30, 2018 and 2017, 44,584 and 16,000 stock options, respectively, were exercised for Common stock. Cash received from common stock issued as a result of stock options exercised during the quarters and six months ended June 30, 2018 and 2017, was $1,369, $208, $3,981 and $1,310, respectively.  



During the quarter ended June 30, 2018, 1,610 shares of Common stock with an aggregate fair market value of $286 were withheld as payment in lieu of cash for stock option exercises. These shares were retired upon delivery. During the six months ended June 30, 2018, 6,651 shares of Common stock with an aggregate fair market value of $1,200 were withheld as payment in lieu of cash for stock option exercises. These shares were retired upon delivery.  



Employee Stock Purchase Plan  



During the quarters ended June 30, 2018 and 2017, 2,434 and 2,306 shares of Common stock were issued under our employee stock purchase plan for which we received net proceeds of $414 and $317, respectively. During the six months ended June 30, 2018 and 2017, 4,481 and 4,259 shares of Common stock were issued under our employee stock purchase plan for which we received net proceeds of $760 and $602, respectively.  



401(k) Plan  



During the six months ended June 30, 2018 and 2017, we issued 17,318 and 16,389 shares of Common stock, respectively, to our profit sharing retirement plan, representing the Common stock discretionary matching contribution of $2,945 and $2,428, respectively.  



Non-controlling Interest  



As described under the heading Joint Ventures with Carrier Corporation in Item 2. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operation contained in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, we maintain three joint ventures with Carrier that we describe as Carrier Enterprise I, Carrier Enterprise II and Carrier Enterprise III. We have an 80% controlling interest in Carrier Enterprise I and Carrier Enterprise II and a 60% controlling interest in Carrier Enterprise III. Carrier owns the remaining non-controlling interest in such joint ventures. The following table reconciles shareholders equity attributable to Carriers non-controlling interest:

 11. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES  



Litigation, Claims and Assessments  



We are involved in litigation incidental to the operation of our business. We vigorously defend all matters in which we or our subsidiaries are named defendants and, for insurable losses, maintain significant levels of insurance to protect against adverse judgments, claims or assessments that may affect us. Although the adequacy of existing insurance coverage and the outcome of any legal proceedings cannot be predicted with certainty, based on the current information available, we do not believe the ultimate liability associated with any known claims or litigation will have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations.  



Self-Insurance  



Self-insurance reserves are maintained relative to company-wide casualty insurance and health benefit programs. The level of exposure from catastrophic events is limited by the purchase of stop-loss and aggregate liability reinsurance coverage. When estimating the self-insurance liabilities and related reserves, management considers a number of factors, which include historical claims experience, demographic factors, severity factors and valuations provided by independent third-party actuaries. Management reviews its assumptions with its independent third-party actuaries to evaluate whether the self-insurance reserves are adequate. If actual claims or adverse development of loss reserves occur and exceed these estimates, additional reserves may be required. Reserves in the amounts of $2,245 and $2,344 at June 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017, respectively, were established related to such programs and are included in accrued expenses and other current liabilities in our condensed consolidated unaudited balance sheets.  



 12. RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS  



Purchases from Carrier and its affiliates comprised 64% and 62% of all inventory purchases made during the quarters ended June 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively. Purchases from Carrier and its affiliates comprised 63% and 62% of all inventory purchases made during the six months ended June 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively. At June 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017, approximately $152,000 and $75,000, respectively, was payable to Carrier and its affiliates, net of receivables. Our joint ventures with Carrier also sell HVAC products to Carrier and its affiliates. Revenues in our condensed consolidated unaudited statements of income for the quarters and six months ended June 30, 2018 and 2017 included approximately $21,000, $21,000, $37,000 and $32,000, respectively, of sales to Carrier and its affiliates. We believe these transactions are conducted on terms equivalent to an arms-length basis in the ordinary course of business.  



A member of our Board of Directors is the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Moss & Associates LLC, who served as general contractor for the remodeling of our Miami headquarters, which was completed in 2018. We paid Moss & Associates LLC $71, $226, $124 and $644 for construction services performed during the quarters and six months ended June 30, 2018 and June 30, 2017, respectively, and no amount was payable at June 30, 2018.  



A member of our Board of Directors is the Senior Chairman of Greenberg Traurig, P.A., which serves as our principal outside counsel for compliance and acquisition-related legal services. During the quarters and six months ended June 30, 2018 and June 30, 2017, we paid this firm $14, $200, $18 and $220 for services performed, respectively, and $28 was payable at June 30, 2018.
