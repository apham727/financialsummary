ITEM 2.Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds

Repurchases of Company Shares

In March 2018, the Board of Directors authorized the Company to repurchase up to an additional $2.0 billion of Common Stock.
The new authorization increased the share repurchase authorization granted in November 2017 to an aggregate of $4.0 billion of Common Stock, and supplements the remaining balances from any prior authorizations.
These repurchases can be conducted on the open market or as private purchases and may include the use of derivative contracts with large financial institutions, in all cases subject to compliance with applicable law.
Repurchases will be funded using our cash, cash generation, and available credit facilities.
This repurchase program has no termination date and may be suspended or discontinued at any time.
Accelerated Share Repurchase Agreements Executed in September Quarter

On August 15, 2018, we entered into four separate accelerated share repurchase agreements (collectively, the "August 2018 ASR") with two financial institutions to repurchase a total of $1.4 billion of Common Stock.
We took an initial delivery of approximately 5.8 million shares, which represented 75% of the prepayment amount divided by our closing stock price on August 14, 2018.
The total number of shares to be received under the August 2018 ASR will be based upon the average daily volume weighted average price of our Common Stock during the repurchase period, less an agreed upon discount.
Final settlement of the August 2018 ASR is expected to be completed no later than February 15, 2019.
