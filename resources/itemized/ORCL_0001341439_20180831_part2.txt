Item 2.  



Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds 



Our Board of Directors has approved a program for us to repurchase shares of our common stock. On September 17, 2018, we announced that our Board of Directors approved an expansion of our stock repurchase program by an additional $12.0 billion. As of August 31, 2018, approximately $7.8 billion remained available for stock repurchases pursuant to our stock repurchase program. 



Our stock repurchase authorization does not have an expiration date and the pace of our repurchase activity will depend on factors such as our working capital needs, our cash requirements for acquisitions and dividend payments, our debt repayment obligations or repurchases of our debt, our stock price, and economic and market conditions. Our stock repurchases may be effected from time to time through open market purchases or pursuant to a Rule 10b5-1 plan. Our stock repurchase program may be accelerated, suspended, delayed or discontinued at any time. 



The following table summarizes the stock repurchase activity for the three months ended August 31, 2018 and the approximate dollar value of shares that may yet be purchased pursuant to our stock repurchase program:
