Information about risk factors for the quarter ended March 31, 2018 does not differ materially from that set forth in Part I, Item 1A, of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2017.  



ITEM 2. UNREGISTERED SALES OF EQUITY SECURITIES AND USE OF PROCEEDS  



Recent Sales of Unregistered Securities  



On March 9, 2018, we issued 17,318 shares of our Common stock to our Profit Sharing Retirement Plan & Trusts (the Plans) representing the employer match under the Plans for the plan year ended December 31, 2017, without registration. This issuance was exempt from registration under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, pursuant to Section 3(a)(2) thereof. The Plans are profit sharing retirement plans that are qualified under Section 401 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. The assets of the Plans are held in a single trust fund for the benefit of our employees, and no Plan holds assets for the benefit of the employees of any other employer. All of the contributions to the Plans from our employees have been invested in assets other than our Common stock. We have contributed all of the Common stock held by the Plans as a discretionary matching contribution, which, at the time of contribution, was lower in value than the employee contributions that the contribution matched.
