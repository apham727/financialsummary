Item 4. Controls and Procedures



Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures



The Company, under the direction of the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer, has established disclosure controls and procedures as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”). Based upon their evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that as of March 31, 2018, the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures are effective.



Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting



There have not been any changes in the Company’s internal control over financial reporting (as such term is defined in Rule 13a -15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) that occurred during the fiscal quarter ended March 31, 2018 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company’s internal control over financial reporting. We implemented internal controls to ensure we adequately evaluated our contracts and properly assessed the impact of the new accounting standard related to revenue recognition. There were no significant changes to our internal control over financial reporting due to the adoption of the new standard.
