B. ACCOUNTING POLICIES   



Basis of Presentation  



The consolidated interim financial statements include the accounts of Teradyne and its wholly-owned subsidiaries. All significant intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated. These interim financial statements are unaudited and reflect all normal recurring adjustments that are, in the opinion of management, necessary for the fair statement of such interim financial statements. Certain prior year amounts were reclassified to conform to the current year presentation. The December 31, 2018 condensed consolidated balance sheet data was derived from audited financial statements, but does not include all disclosures required by accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.  



The accompanying financial information should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto contained in Teradyne’s Annual Report on Form 



10-K, filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) on March 1, 2019, for the year ended December 31, 2018.  



Preparation of Financial Statements and Use of Estimates  



The preparation of consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements. Actual results may differ significantly from these estimates.   



Investment in Other Company 



Teradyne holds an investment in a private company 



that develops and sells advanced wearable technology



. Teradyne does not have the ability to exert significant influence over the company. The investment was recorded at cost and is evaluated for impairment or an indication of changes in fair value resulting from observable price changes in orderly transactions for the identical or a similar investment of the same issuer on a quarterly basis. See Note D: “Acquisitions and Investment in Other Company.”

Table of Contents  



Leases  



In February 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) 



2016-02, 



“Leases (Topic 842)” (“Topic 842”), which requires a lessee to record a 



right-of-use (“ROU”) asset and a lease liability on the balance sheet for operating leases with terms longer than twelve months. Teradyne adopted this standard and the related amendments (collectively “ASC 842”) on January 1, 2019 and utilized the modified retrospective approach provided by ASU 



2018-11, 



“Leases (Topic 842): Targeted 



Improvements,” that allowed for a cumulative effect adjustment in the period of adoption. Under this method of adoption, the comparative information in the consolidated financial statements has not been revised and continues to be reported under the previously applicable lease accounting guidance (ASC 840). Teradyne also utilized the package of practical expedients permitted 



under the transition guidance which included the carry-forward of historical lease classification. Adoption of ASC 842



 resulted in recording ROU assets and lease liabilities of approximately $50.1



 million and $54.3



 million, respectively. Operating lease liabilities were calculated using the discount rate on January 1



, 2019



. The adoption of ASC 842



 did not have a material impact on beginning retained earnings, the consolidated statement of operations, cash flows, or earnings per share.   



Under ASC 842, a contract is or contains a lease when Teradyne has the right to control the use of an identified asset. Teradyne determines if an arrangement is a lease at inception of the contract, which is the date on which the terms of the contract are agreed to and the agreement creates enforceable rights and obligations. The commencement date of the lease is the date that the lessor makes an underlying asset available for use by Teradyne. As of June 30, 2019, Teradyne does not have material leases that have not yet commenced.   



Teradyne determines if the lease is operating or finance at the lease commencement date based upon the terms of the lease and the nature of the asset. The lease term used to calculate the lease liability includes options to extend or terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain that the option will be exercised.  



For leases commencing after January 1, 2019, the lease liability is measured at the present value of future lease payments, discounted using the discount rate for the lease at the commencement date. As Teradyne is typically unable to determine the implicit rate, Teradyne uses an incremental borrowing rate based on the lease term and economic environment at commencement date. Teradyne initially measures payments based on an index by using the applicable rate at lease commencement. Variable payments that do not depend on an index are not included in the lease liability and are recognized as they are incurred. The ROU asset is initially measured as the amount of lease liability, adjusted for any initial lease costs, prepaid lease payments, and reduced by any lease incentives.  



Teradyne’s contracts often include 



non-lease components such as common area maintenance. Teradyne elected the practical expedient to account for the lease and 



non-lease components as a single lease component. For leases with a term of one year or less Teradyne has elected not to record the lease asset or liability. The lease payments are recognized in the consolidated statement of earnings on a straight-line basis over the lease term. Teradyne includes lease costs within cost of revenues and operating expenses. See Note H: “Leases.”  



C. RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS  



On January 26, 2017, the FASB issued ASU 



2017-04, 



“Intangibles—Goodwill and Other (Topic



 350): Simplifying the Accounting for Goodwill Impairment.” The new guidance removes Step 2 of the goodwill impairment test, which requires a hypothetical purchase price allocation. Goodwill impairment will be the amount by which a reporting unit’s carrying value exceeds its fair value, not to exceed the carrying amount of goodwill. All other goodwill impairment guidance will remain largely unchanged. Entities will continue to have the option to perform a qualitative assessment to determine if a quantitative impairment test is necessary. The same 



one-step impairment test will be applied to goodwill at all reporting units, even those with zero or negative carrying amounts. Entities will be required to disclose the amount of goodwill at reporting units with zero or negative carrying amounts. The revised guidance will be applied prospectively, and is effective in 2020. Early adoption is permitted for any impairment tests performed after January 1, 2017. Teradyne is currently evaluating the impact of this ASU on its financial position, results of operations and statements of cash flows.

D. ACQUISITIONS AND INVESTMENT IN OTHER COMPANY



Acquisitions 



Lemsys SA  



On January 30, 2019, Teradyne acquired all of the issued and outstanding shares of Lemsys SA (“Lemsys”) for a total purchase price of approximately $9.1 million. Lemsys strengthens Teradyne’s position in the electrification trends of vehicles, solar, wind, and industrial applications. The Lemsys acquisition was accounted for as a business combination and, accordingly, the results have been included in Teradyne’s Semiconductor Test segment from the date of acquisition. Teradyne’s final allocation of the purchase price was goodwill of $1.4 million, which is not deductible for tax purposes, acquired intangible assets of $4.6 million with an average estimated useful life of 5.2 years, and $3.1 million of net tangible assets. The acquisition was not material to Teradyne’s condensed consolidated financial statements.  



Mobile Industrial Robots  



On April 25, 2018, Teradyne acquired all of the issued and outstanding shares of Mobile Industrial Robots Aps (“MiR”), a Danish limited liability company located in Odense, Denmark. MiR is the leading maker of collaborative autonomous mobile robots for industrial applications. MiR is part of Teradyne’s Industrial Automation segment.  



The total purchase price of $197.8 million included $145.2 million of cash paid and $52.6 million of contingent consideration measured at fair value. The contingent consideration is payable in Euros upon the achievement of certain thresholds and targets for revenue and earnings before interest and taxes for periods from January 1, 2018 to December 31, 2018; January 1, 2018 to December 31, 2019; and January 1, 2018 to December 31, 2020. The contingent consideration related to revenue for the period from January 1, 2018 to December 31, 2018 in the amount of $30.8 million was paid in March 2019. The remaining maximum contingent consideration that could be paid is $84.1 million.   



The valuation of the contingent consideration is dependent on the following assumptions: forecasted revenues, revenue volatility, earnings before interest and taxes, and discount rate. These assumptions were estimated based on a review of the historical and projected results.  



The MiR acquisition was accounted for as a business combination and, accordingly, the results have been included in Teradyne’s consolidated results of operations from the date of acquisition. MiR’s products will help expand the Industrial Automation segment, which is a key component of Teradyne’s growth strategy. The allocation of the total purchase price to MiR’s net tangible liabilities and identifiable intangible assets was based on their estimated fair values as of the acquisition date. The excess of the purchase price over the identifiable intangible assets and net tangible liabilities in the amount of $136.0 million was allocated to goodwill, which is not deductible for tax purposes. MiR’s results have been included in Teradyne’s Industrial Automation segment from the date of acquisition.

Components of these intangible assets and their estimated useful lives at the acquisition date are as follows:   [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 



The following unaudited pro forma information gives effect to the acquisition of MiR as if the acquisition occurred on January 1, 2018. The unaudited pro forma results are not necessarily indicative of what actually would have occurred had the acquisition been in effect for the periods presented:   [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 



Pro forma results for the three and six months ended July 1, 2018 were adjusted to exclude $2.3 million and $2.9 million, respectively,



 of acquisition related costs, and $0.4 million of non-recurring expense related to fair value adjustment to acquisition-date inventory



.  



Energid Technologies Corporation  



On February 26, 2018, Teradyne acquired all of the issued and outstanding shares of Energid Technologies Corporation (“Energid”) for a total purchase price of approximately $27.6 million. Energid’s technology enables and simplifies the programming of complex robotic motions used in a wide variety of end markets, ranging from heavy industry to healthcare, utilizing both traditional robots and collaborative robots. The Energid acquisition

Table of Contents 



was accounted for as a business combination and, accordingly, Energid’s results have been included in Teradyne’s Industrial Automation segment from the date of acquisition. As of the acquisition date, Teradyne’s purchase price allocation was goodwill of $14.4 million which is deductible for tax purposes, acquired intangible assets of $12.3 million with an average estimated useful life of 7.7 years, and $1.0 million of net tangible assets. The acquisition was not material to Teradyne’s condensed consolidated financial statements.  



Investment in Other Company 



On June 3, 2019, Teradyne invested $15.0 million in RealWear, Inc. (“RealWear”). RealWear, a private company, develops and sells advanced wearable technology including industrial, hands-free, head-mounted augmented reality devices that make the workplace safer and more productive. Teradyne’s investment in RealWear aligns with its strategy of bringing the power of advanced automation to companies of all sizes to improve the productivity of their employees and the quality of their products and services. The investment was recorded at cost and is evaluated for impairment or an indication of changes in fair value resulting from observable price changes in orderly transactions for the identical or a similar investment of the same issuer on a quarterly basis. At June 30, 2019 the value of the investment was $15.0 million.  



E. REVENUE  



For the three and six months ended June 30, 2019, revenues recognized in accordance with ASC 606: “



Revenue from Contracts with Customers” were $562.5 million and $1,054.9 million, respectively. For the three and six months ended June 30, 2019, Teradyne also recognized $1.7 million and $3.4 million, respectively, of revenues from leases of Teradyne systems, which are accounted for outside of ASC 606. 



For the three and six months ended July 1, 2018, revenues recognized in accordance with ASC 606: “



Revenue from Contracts with Customers” were $523.3 million and $1,006.5 million, respectively. 



For the three and six months ended July 1, 2018, Teradyne also recognized $3.6 million and 



$7.9 million, respectively, of revenues from leases of Teradyne systems, which are accounted for outside of ASC 606.

Contract Balances  



During the three and six months ended June 30, 2019, Teradyne recognized $13.3 million and $33.4 million, respectively, that was previously included within the deferred revenue and customer advances balances. During the three and six months ended July 1, 2018, Teradyne recognized 



$24.7



 million and $46.5



 million, respectively, that was previously included within the deferred revenue and customer advances balances. This revenue primarily relates to extended warranties, training, application support, and post contract support. Each of these represents a distinct performance obligation. Teradyne expects to recognize 72



% of the remaining performance obligation in the next 12



 months, 22



% in 



1-3



 years, and the remainder thereafter. 



Accounts Receivable  



Teradyne sells certain trade accounts receivables on a 



non-recourse basis to third-party financial institutions pursuant to factoring agreements. Teradyne accounts for these transactions as sales of receivables and presents cash proceeds as a cash provided by operating activities in the consolidated statements of cash flows. Total trade accounts receivable sold under the factoring agreements were $82.1 million and $8.9 million for the six months ended June 30, 2019 and July 1, 2018, respectively. Factoring fees for the sales of receivables were recorded in interest expense and were not material.  



F. INVENTORIES   



Inventories, net consisted of the following at June 30, 2019 and December 31, 2018:  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

G. FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS  



Cash Equivalents  



Teradyne considers all highly liquid investments with maturities of three months or less at the date of acquisition to be cash equivalents.     



Marketable Securities  



Teradyne’s 



available-for-sale debt securities are classified as Level 2 and equity securities are classified as Level 1. Contingent consideration is classified as Level 3. The vast majority of Level 2 securities are fixed income securities priced by third party pricing vendors. These pricing vendors utilize the most recent observable market information in pricing these securities or, if specific prices are not available, use other observable inputs like market transactions involving identical or comparable securities. 



During the three and six months ended June 30, 2019 and July 1, 2018, there were no transfers in or out of Level 1, Level 2, or Level 3 financial instruments.  



Realized gains recorded in the three and six months ended June 30, 2019 were $0.1 million and $0.2 million, respectively. Realized losses recorded in the six months ended June 30, 2019 were $0.1 million.

Table of Contents   



Realized gains recorded in the three and six months ended July 1, 2018 were $0.1 million and $0.4 million, respectively. Realized losses recorded in the six months ended July 1, 2018 were $1.5 million. Realized gains are included in interest income and realized losses are included in interest expense.  



Unrealized gains on equity securities recorded in the three and six months ended June 30, 2019 were $0.9 million and $3.7 million, respectively. Unrealized gains on equity securities recorded in the three and six months ended July 1, 2018 were $0.4 million. Unrealized gains on equity securities are included in interest income and unrealized losses are included in interest expense. 



Unrealized gains and losses on 



available-for-sale debt securities are included in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) on the balance sheet.  



The cost of securities sold is based on the specific identification method.

Table of Contents  



As of June 30, 2019, the significant unobservable inputs used in the Monte Carlo simulation to fair value the MiR contingent consideration include forecasted revenues, revenue volatility, earnings before interest and taxes, and discount rate. Increases or decreases in the inputs would result in a higher or lower fair value measurement. As of June 30, 2019, the maximum amount of contingent consideration that could be paid in connection with the acquisition of MiR is $84.1 million. The remaining 



earn-out  periods end on December 31, 2019 and December 31, 2020.



The carrying amounts and fair values of Teradyne’s financial instruments at June 30, 2019 and December 31, 2018 were as follows: [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

The following table summarizes the composition of 



available-for-sale marketable securities at December 31, 2018: [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 



Reported as follows:  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 



As of June 30, 2019, the fair market value of investments in 



available-for-sale securities with unrealized losses totaled $38.3 million. Of this value, $22.7 million had unrealized losses of $0.4 million for greater than one year and $15.6 million had unrealized losses of $0.1 million for less than one year. 



As of December 31, 2018, the fair market value of investments with unrealized losses totaled $192.0 million. Of this value, $28.5 million had unrealized losses of $1.6 million greater than one year and $163.5 million had unrealized losses of $1.4 million for less than one year.  



Teradyne reviews its investments to identify and evaluate investments that have an indication of possible impairment. Based on this review, Teradyne determined that the unrealized losses related to these investments at June 30, 2019 and December 31, 2018 were temporary.

available-for-sale securities held at June 30, 2019 were as follows: [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 



Contractual maturities of investments in 



available-for-sale securities held at June 30, 2019 exclude $3.3 million of debt mutual funds as they do not have a contractual maturity date.  



Derivatives      



Teradyne conducts business in a number of foreign countries, with certain transactions denominated in local currencies. The purpose of Teradyne’s foreign currency management is to minimize the effect of exchange rate fluctuations on certain foreign currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities. Teradyne does not use derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes.  



To minimize the effect of exchange rate fluctuations associated with the remeasurement of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies, Teradyne enters into foreign currency forward contracts. The change in fair value of these derivatives is recorded directly in earnings, and is used to offset the change in value of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies.  



The notional amount of foreign currency forward contracts at June 30, 2019 and December 31, 2018 was $143.3 million and $163.1 million, respectively.  



Gains and losses on foreign currency forward contracts and foreign currency remeasurement gains and losses on monetary assets and liabilities are included in other (income) expense, net.

H. LEASES  



On January 1, 2019, Teradyne adopted ASC 842 using the modified retrospective approach. Under this method of adoption, the comparative information in the consolidated financial statements has not been revised and continues to be reported under the previously applicable lease accounting guidance (ASC 840). Adoption of ASC 842 resulted in recording ROU assets and lease liabilities of approximately $50.1 million and $54.3 million, respectively. The adoption of ASC 842 did not have a material impact on beginning retained earnings, the consolidated statement of operations, cash flows, or earnings per share.   



Teradyne has facility and auto leases, which are accounted for as operating leases. Teradyne’s facility leases are primarily used for administrative functions, research and development, manufacturing, and storage and distribution. Remaining lease terms range from less than one year to ten years.  



Total lease expense for the three months ended June 30, 2019 was $8.9 million and included $2.6 million of variable lease costs and $0.8 million of costs related to short-term leases which are not recorded on the consolidated balance sheets. Total lease expense for the six months ended June 30, 2019 was $17.1 million and included $5.0 million of variable lease costs and $1.5 million of costs related to short-term leases which are not recorded on the consolidated balance sheets.  



At June 30, 2019, the weighted average remaining lease term and weighted average discount rate for operating leases was 4.7 years and 5.2%, respectively.

I. DEBT 



Convertible Senior Notes 



On December 12



, 2016



, Teradyne completed a private offering of $460.0



 million aggregate principal amount of 1.25



% convertible senior unsecured notes (the “Notes”) due 



December 15, 2023



 and received net proceeds, after issuance costs, of approximately $450.8



 million, $33.0



 million of which was used to pay the net cost of the convertible note hedge transactions and $50.1



 million of which was used to repurchase 2.0



 million shares of Teradyne’s common stock under its existing stock repurchase program from purchasers of the Notes in privately negotiated transactions effected through one of the initial purchasers or its affiliates conducted concurrently with the pricing of the Note offering. The Notes will mature on December 15



, 2023



, unless earlier repurchased or converted. The Notes bear interest from December 12



, 2016



 at a rate of 1.25



% per year payable semiannually in arrears on June 15 and December 15 of each year



, beginning on 



June 15, 2017



. The Notes will be convertible at the option of the noteholders at any time 



prior to the close of business on the business day immediately preceding 



September 15, 2023



, only under the following circumstances: (1)



 during any calendar quarter beginning after March 31



, 2017



 (and only during such calendar quarter), if the closing sale price of Teradyne’s common stock, for at least 20



 trading days (whether or not consecutive) during a period of 30



 consecutive trading days ending on the last trading day of the immediately preceding calendar quarter is greater than 130



% of the conversion price on each applicable trading day; (2)



 during the five



 business day period after any five



 consecutive trading day period (the “measurement period”) in which the trading price (as defined in the Indenture) per $1,000



 principal amount of Notes for each trading day of the measurement period was less than 98



% of the product of the closing sale price of the Teradyne’s common stock and the conversion rate on each such trading day; and (3)



 upon the occurrence of specified corporate events. On or after September 15



, 2023



 until the close of business on the second scheduled trading day immediately preceding the maturity date, holders



20

may convert their Notes at any time, regardless of the foregoing circumstances. Teradyne may satisfy its conversion obligation by paying or delivering cash, shares of its common stock or a combination of cash and shares of its common stock, at Teradyne’s election. As of June 30



, 2019



, the conversion price was approximately $31.70



 per share of Teradyne’s common stock. The conversion rate is subject to adjustment under certain circumstances.



Concurrent with the offering of the Notes, Teradyne entered into convertible note hedge transactions (the “Note Hedge Transactions”) with the initial purchasers or their affiliates (the “Option Counterparties”). The Note Hedge Transactions cover, subject to customary anti-dilution adjustments, the number of shares of the common stock that underlie the Notes, with a strike price equal to the conversion price of the Notes of $31.70. The Note Hedge Transactions cover, subject to customary anti-dilution adjustments, approximately 14.5 million shares of Teradyne’s common stock.



Separately and concurrent with the pricing of the Notes, Teradyne entered into warrant transactions with the Option Counterparties (the “Warrant Transactions”) in which it sold 



net-share-settled (or, at its election subject to certain conditions, cash-settled) warrants to the Option Counterparties. The Warrant Transactions cover, subject to customary anti-dilution adjustments, approximately 14.5 million shares of common stock. As of June 30, 2019, the strike price of the warrants was approximately $39.78 per share. The strike price is subject to adjustment under certain circumstances. The Warrant Transactions could have a dilutive effect to Teradyne’s common stock to the extent that the market price per share of Teradyne’s common stock, as measured under the terms of the Warrant Transactions, exceeds the applicable strike price of the warrants.



The Note Hedge Transactions are expected to reduce the potential dilution to Teradyne’s common stock upon any conversion of the Notes. However, the Warrant Transactions could separately have a dilutive effect to the extent that the market value per share of Teradyne’s common stock exceeds the applicable strike price of the warrant. The net cost of the Note Hedge Transactions, after being partially offset by the proceeds from the sale of the warrants, was approximately $33.0



 million.



In connection with establishing their initial hedge of these convertible note hedge and warrant transactions, the Option Counterparties have entered into various derivative transactions with respect to Teradyne’s common stock and/or purchased shares of Teradyne’s common stock or other securities, including the Notes, concurrent with, or shortly after, the pricing of the Notes. In addition, the Option Counterparties may modify their hedge positions by entering into or unwinding various derivative transactions with respect to Teradyne’s common stock or by selling Teradyne’s common stock or other securities, including the Notes, in secondary market transactions (and may do so during any observation period related to the conversion of the Notes). These activities could adversely affect the value of Teradyne’s common stock and the Notes.



Teradyne considered the guidance of ASC 



815-40, 



“Derivatives and Hedging—Contracts in Entity’s Own Equity,”



 and concluded that the convertible note hedge is both indexed to Teradyne’s common stock and should be classified in stockholders’ equity in its statements of financial position. The convertible note hedge is considered indexed to Teradyne’s common stock as the terms of the Note Hedge Transactions do not contain an exercise contingency and the settlement amount equals the difference between the fair value of a fixed number of Teradyne’s shares and a fixed strike price. Because the only variable that can affect the settlement amount is Teradyne’s stock price, which is an input to the fair value of a 



fixed-for-fixed



 option contract, the convertible note hedge is considered indexed to Teradyne’s common stock.



Teradyne assessed whether the convertible note hedge should be classified as equity under ASC 



815-40.



 In the Note Hedge Transactions contract the settlement terms permit net cash settlement or net share settlement, at the option of Teradyne. Therefore, the criteria as set forth in ASC 



815-40



 were evaluated by Teradyne. In reviewing the criteria, Teradyne noted the following: (1)



 the convertible note hedge does not require Teradyne to issue shares; (2)



 there is no requirement to net cash settle the convertible note hedge for failure to make timely filings with the SEC; (3)



 in the case of termination, the convertible note hedge is settled in the same 



21



Table of Contents 



consideration as the holders of the underlying stock; (4) the counterparty does not have rights that rank higher than those of a shareholder of the stock underlying the convertible note hedge; and (5) there is no requirement to post collateral. Based on its analysis of those criteria, Teradyne concluded that the convertible note hedge should be recorded in equity and no further adjustment should be made in future periods to adjust the value of the convertible note hedge. 



Teradyne analyzed the Warrant Transactions under ASC 815-40, 



“Derivatives and Hedging—Contracts in Entity’s Own Equity,” and other relevant literature, and determined that it met the criteria for classification as an equity transaction and is considered indexed to Teradyne’s common stock. As a result, Teradyne recorded the proceeds from the warrants as an increase to additional paid-in capital. Teradyne does not recognize subsequent changes in fair value of the warrants in its financial statements. 



The provisions of ASC 470-20, “



Debt with Conversion and Other Options,



” are applicable to the Notes. ASC 470-20 requires Teradyne to separately account for the liability (debt) and equity (conversion feature) components of the Notes in a manner that reflects Teradyne’s nonconvertible debt borrowing rate at the date of issuance when interest cost is recognized in subsequent periods. Teradyne allocated $100.8 million of the $460.0 million principal amount of the Notes to the equity component, which represents a discount to the debt and will be amortized to interest expense using the effective interest method through December 2023. Accordingly, Teradyne’s effective annual interest rate on the Notes will be approximately 5.0%. The Notes are classified as long-term 



debt in the balance sheet based on their 



December 15, 2023



 maturity date. Debt issuance costs of approximately $7.2



 million are being amortized to interest expense using the effective interest method over the seven year



 term of the Notes. As of June 30, 2019, debt issuance costs were approximately $4.8



 million.  



The below tables represent the key components of Teradyne’s convertible senior notes: [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 



 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 



As of June 30, 2019, the remaining unamortized discount was $72.8 million, which will be amortized over 4.5 years using the effective interest rate method. The carrying amount of the equity component was $100.8 million. As of June 30, 2019, the 



if-converted  value of the Notes was $695.2 million.  



Revolving Credit Facility  



On June 27, 2019



, Teradyne terminated its credit agreement



, which Teradyne entered into with Barclays Bank PLC, on April 27, 2015. The terminated credit agreement



 provided for a five-year, senior secured revolving credit facility of up to

The balance below is included in short and long-term deferred revenue and customer advances on the balance sheet.  



  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 



M. STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION  



Under Teradyne’s stock compensation plans, Teradyne grants stock options, restricted stock units and performance-based restricted stock units, and employees are eligible to purchase Teradyne’s common stock through its Employee Stock Purchase Plan (“ESPP”). 



Time-based restricted stock unit awards granted to employees vest in equal annual installments over four years



. Restricted stock unit awards granted to 



non-employee



 directors vest after a one year



 period, with 100



% of the award vesting on the earlier of (a) the first anniversary of the grant date or (b) the date of the following year’s Annual Meeting of Shareholders. Teradyne expenses the cost of the restricted stock unit awards subject to time-based vesting, which is determined to be the fair market value of the shares at the date of grant, ratably over the period during which the restrictions lapse.



Performance-based restricted stock units (“PRSUs”) granted to Teradyne’s executive officers have a performance metric based on relative total shareholder return (“TSR”). Teradyne’s three-year



 TSR performance is measured against the New York Stock Exchange (“NYSE”) Composite Index. The final number of TSR PRSUs that vest will vary based upon the level of performance achieved from 200



% to 0



% of the target shares capped at four times the grant date value. The TSR PRSUs will vest upon the three-year anniversary of the grant date. The TSR PRSUs are valued using a Monte Carlo simulation model. The number of units expected to be earned, based upon the achievement of the TSR market condition, is factored into the grant date Monte Carlo valuation. Compensation expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the shorter of the three-year service period or the period from the grant to the date described in the retirement provisions below. Compensation expense for employees meeting the retirement provisions prior to the grant date will be recognized in full on the date of the grant. Compensation expense is recognized regardless of the eventual number of units that are earned based upon the market condition, provided the executive officer remains an employee at the end of the three-year period. Compensation expense is reversed if at any time during the three-year service period the executive officer is no longer an employee, subject to the retirement and termination eligibility provisions noted below. 



During the six months ended June 30, 2019 and July 1, 2018, Teradyne granted PRSUs to its executive officers with a performance metric based on three-year cumulative 



non-GAAP profit before interest and tax (“PBIT”) as a percent of Teradyne’s revenue. 



Non-GAAP PBIT is a financial measure equal to GAAP income from operations less restructuring and other, net; amortization of acquired intangible assets; acquisition and divestiture related charges or credits; pension actuarial gains and losses; 



non-cash convertible debt interest expense; and other 



non-recurring gains and charges. The final number of PBIT PRSUs that vest will vary based upon the level of performance achieved from 200% to 0% of the target shares. The PBIT PRSUs will vest upon the three-year anniversary of the grant date. Compensation expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the shorter of the three year service period or the period from the grant date to the date described in the retirement provisions below. Compensation expense for employees meeting the retirement provisions prior to the grant date  



24 



Table of Contents  



will be recognized in full on the date of grant. Compensation expense is recognized based on the number of units that are earned based upon the three-year Teradyne PBIT as a percent of Teradyne’s revenue, provided the executive officer remains an employee at the end of the three-year period subject to the retirement and termination eligibility provisions noted below. 



If a PRSU recipient’s employment ends prior to the determination of the performance percentage due to (1) permanent disability or death or (2) retirement or termination other than for cause, after attaining both at least age sixty and at least ten years of service, then all or a portion of the recipient’s PRSUs (based on the actual performance percentage achieved on the determination date) will vest on the date the performance percentage is determined. Except as set forth in the preceding sentence, no PRSUs will vest if the executive officer is no longer an employee at the end of the three-year period. 



During the six months ended June 30, 2019 and July 1, 2018, Teradyne granted 0.1 million and 0.1 million TSR PRSUs, respectively, with a grant date fair value of $51.51 and $54.85, respectively. The fair value was estimated using the Monte Carlo simulation model with the following assumptions:     



 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]  



Expected volatility was based on the historical volatility of Teradyne’s stock and the NYSE Composite Index for each of the 2019 and 2018 grants over the most recent three-year period. The risk-free interest rate was determined using the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of each of the grants. Dividend yield was based upon an estimated annual dividend amount of $0.36 per share for 2019 grants and 2018 grants, divided by Teradyne’s stock price on the grant date of $37.95 for 2019 grants and 



$47.70



 for the 2018 grant. 



During the six months ended June 30, 2019 and July 1, 2018, Teradyne granted 0.1 million and 0.1 million, respectively, of PBIT PRSUs with a grant date fair value of $36.88 and $46.62, respectively.

non-employee



 directors at a weighted average grant date fair value of $35.81, 



and 0.1



 million of service-based stock options to executive officers at a weighted average grant date fair value of $12.17

Table of Contents     



The fair value of stock options was estimated using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model with the following assumptions:  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 



Teradyne determined the stock options’ expected life based upon historical exercise data for executive officers, the age of the executive officers and the terms of the stock option grant. Volatility was determined using historical volatility for a period equal to the expected life. The risk-free interest rate was determined using the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant. Dividend yield was based upon an estimated annual dividend amount of $0.36 per share divided by Teradyne’s stock price on the grant date of $37.95 for 2019 grants 



and $47.70 for the 2018 grant.

Goodwill  



Teradyne performs its annual goodwill impairment test as required under the provisions of ASC 



350-10, 



“Intangibles—Goodwill and Other”



 on December 31 of each fiscal year unless interim indicators of impairment exist. Goodwill is considered impaired when the net book value of a reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value.  



The changes in the carrying amount of goodwill by reportable segments for the six months ended June 30, 2019, were as follows: [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 



Intangible Assets  



Teradyne reviews long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in business circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be fully recoverable or that the useful lives of these assets are no longer appropriate.  



Amortizable intangible assets consist of the following and are included in intangible assets, net on the balance sheet:  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

The computation of diluted net income per common share for the three and six months ended June 30, 2019 excludes the effect of the potential vesting of 0.2 million and 0.4 million of stock options, respectively because the effect would have been anti-dilutive.  



The computation of diluted net income per common share for the three and six months ended July 1, 2018 excludes the effect of the potential vesting of 0.6 million and 0.5 million shares, respectively of restricted stock units because the effect would have been anti-dilutive.   



Q. RESTRUCTURING AND OTHER  



During the three months ended June 30, 2019, Teradyne recorded an

R. RETIREMENT PLANS  



ASC 715, 



“Compensation—Retirement Benefits” requires an employer with a defined benefit plan or other postretirement benefit plan to recognize an asset or a liability on its balance sheet for the overfunded or underfunded status of the plan. The pension asset or liability represents a difference between the fair value of the pension plan’s assets and the projected benefit obligation. 



Defined Benefit Pension Plans  



Teradyne has defined benefit pension plans covering a portion of domestic employees and employees of certain 



non-U.S.  subsidiaries. Benefits under these plans are based on employees’ years of service and compensation. Teradyne’s funding policy is to make contributions to these plans in accordance with local laws and to the extent that such contributions are tax deductible. The assets of the U.S. qualified pension plan consist primarily of fixed income and equity securities. In addition, Teradyne has unfunded qualified foreign plans as well as an unfunded supplemental executive defined benefit plan in the United States to provide retirement benefits in excess of levels allowed by the Employment Retirement Income Security Act (“ERISA”) and the Internal Revenue Code (“IRC”). 



In the six months ended June 30, 2019, Teradyne contributed $1.3 million to the U.S. supplemental executive defined benefit pension plan and $0.4 million to certain qualified pension plans for 



non-U.S. subsidiaries.

For the three and six months ended June 30, 2019 and July 1, 2018, Teradyne’s net periodic pension cost was comprised of the following:  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 



Postretirement Benefit Plan  



In addition to receiving pension benefits, Teradyne employees in the United States who meet early retirement eligibility requirements as of their termination dates may participate in Teradyne’s Welfare Plan, which includes medical and dental benefits up to age 65



. Death benefits provide a fixed sum to retirees’ survivors and are available to all retirees. Substantially all of Teradyne’s current U.S. employees could become eligible for these benefits, and the existing benefit obligation relates primarily to those employees.  



For the three and six months ended June 30, 2019 and July 1, 2018, Teradyne’s net periodic postretirement benefit cost was comprised of the following:  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

S. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES  



Purchase Commitments  



As of June 30, 2019, Teradyne had entered into purchase commitments for certain components and materials. The purchase commitments covered by the agreements aggregate to approximately $306.9 million, of which $300.7 million is for less than one year.  



Legal Claims  



Teradyne is subject to various legal proceedings and claims which have arisen in the ordinary course of business. In the opinion of management, the ultimate disposition of these matters will not have a material adverse effect on Teradyne’s results of operations, financial condition or cash flows.   



T. INCOME TAXES   



A reconciliation of the United States federal statutory corporate tax rate to Teradyne’s effective tax rate was as follows: [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 



On a quarterly basis, Teradyne evaluates the realizability of the deferred tax assets by jurisdiction and assesses the need for a valuation allowance. As of June 30, 2019, Teradyne believes that it will ultimately realize the deferred tax assets recorded on the condensed consolidated balance sheet. However, should Teradyne believe that it is 



more-likely-than-not that the deferred tax assets would not be realized, the tax provision would increase in the period in which Teradyne determined that the realizability was not likely. Teradyne considers the probability of future taxable income and historical profitability, among other factors, in assessing the realizability of the deferred tax assets. 



As of June 30, 2019 and December 31, 2018, Teradyne had $13.4 million and $43.4 million, respectively, of reserves for uncertain tax positions. The $30.0 million net decrease in reserves for uncertain tax positions is primarily composed of reductions in uncertain tax positions amounting to $22.4 million related to transfer pricing and $7.3 million associated with U.S. research and development tax credits. These reductions resulted from the conclusion of the U.S. Federal income tax audit for the year ended December 31, 2015.  



As of June 30, 2019, Teradyne does not anticipate a material change in the balance of unrecognized tax benefits during the next twelve months. 



On July 27, 2015, in Altera Corp. v. Commissioner (“Altera”), the U.S. Tax Court issued an opinion invalidating the regulations relating to the treatment of stock-based compensation expense in an intercompany  



32  



Table of Contents   



cost-sharing arrangement. A final decision was issued by the Tax Court in December 2015. The IRS appealed the decision in June 2016. On July 24, 2018, the Ninth Circuit Federal Court issued a decision that was subsequently withdrawn and a reconstituted panel has conferred on the appeal. On June 7, 2019, the Ninth Circuit Federal Court upheld the cost-sharing regulations. Due to the uncertainty surrounding the status of the current regulations, questions related to the scope of potential benefits or obligations, the outcome of the appeals process, and questions regarding jurisdiction, Teradyne has not established any income tax reserves as of June 30, 2019 related to Altera. Teradyne estimates that including stock-based compensation in Teradyne’s intercompany cost-sharing arrangement could result in a potential tax reserve of $5 million to $11 million. Teradyne will continue to monitor ongoing developments and potential impacts to our consolidated financial statements. 



Teradyne recognizes interest and penalties related to income tax matters in income tax expense. As of June 30, 2019 and December 31, 2018, $0.4 million and $0.3 million, respectively, of interest and penalties were accrued for uncertain tax positions. For the six months ended June 30, 2019 and July 1, 2018, expense of $0.1 million and $0.1 million, respectively, was recorded for interest and penalties related to income tax items.  



Teradyne qualifies for a tax holiday in Singapore by fulfilling the requirements of an agreement with the Singapore Economic Development Board under which certain headcount and spending requirements must be met. The tax savings due to the tax holiday for the six months ended June 30, 2019 was $7.0 million, or $0.04 per diluted share. The tax savings due to the tax holiday for the six months ended July 1, 2018 was $4.8 million, or $0.02 per diluted share. The tax holiday is scheduled to expire on December 31, 2020.    



U. SEGMENT INFORMATION  



Teradyne has four reportable segments (Semiconductor Test, System Test, Industrial Automation and Wireless Test). Each of the Semiconductor Test, System Test, and Wireless Test segments is also an individual operating segment. The Industrial Automation reportable segment consists of operating segments with discrete financial information, which have been combined into one reportable segment as they share similar economic characteristics, types of products, production processes, distribution channels, and currency risks. The Semiconductor Test segment includes operations related to the design, manufacturing and marketing of semiconductor test products and services. The System Test segment includes operations related to the design, manufacturing and marketing of products and services for defense/aerospace instrumentation test, storage test and circuit-board test. The Industrial Automation segment includes operations related to the design, manufacturing and marketing of collaborative robotic arms, autonomous mobile robots and advanced robotic control software. The Wireless Test segment includes operations related to the design, manufacturing and marketing of wireless test products and services.  



Teradyne evaluates performance based on several factors, of which the primary financial measure is business segment income (loss) before income taxes. The accounting policies of the business segments in effect are described in Note B: “Accounting Policies” in Teradyne’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018, and Note B: “Accounting Policies” in this filing for any changes in the three and six months ended June 30, 2019.

V. SHAREHOLDERS’ EQUITY  



Stock Repurchase Program  



In January 2018, Teradyne’s Board of Directors cancelled the December 2016 stock repurchase program and authorized a new stock repurchase program for up to $1.5 billion of common stock. Teradyne intends to repurchase $500 million in 2019.  



During the six months ended June 30, 2019, Teradyne repurchased 6.5 million shares of common stock for $247.2 million at an average price of $38.20 per share. The cumulative repurchases under the $1.5 billion stock repurchase program as of June 30, 2019 totaled 28.1 million shares of common stock for $1.1 billion at an average price per share of $38.09.  



During the six months ended July 1, 2018, Teradyne repurchased 8.8 million shares of common stock for $360.8 million at an average price of $40.82 per share.  



The total price includes commissions and is recorded as a reduction to retained earnings.  



Dividend  



Holders of Teradyne’s common stock are entitled to receive dividends when they are declared by Teradyne’s Board of Directors.

Table of Contents 



In January 2019 and May 2019, Teradyne’s Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.09 per share. Dividend payments for the three and six months ended June 30, 2019 were $15.4 million and $31.0 million, respectively.

While Teradyne declared a quarterly cash dividend and authorized a share repurchase program, it may reduce or eliminate the cash dividend or share repurchase program in the future. Future cash dividends and stock repurchases are subject to the discretion of Teradyne’s Board of Directors, which will consider, among other things, Teradyne’s earnings, capital requirements and financial condition.  



W. SUBSEQUENT EVENTS  



Gregory Beecher retired as Vice President and Senior Advisor of Teradyne effective 



July 17, 2019 (the “Retirement Date”). As previously announced, Sanjay Mehta succeeded Mr. Beecher as Teradyne’s Chief Financial Officer effective April 25, 2019. 



In connection with the retirement, Teradyne entered into an agreement on 



July 17, 2019



 with Mr. Beecher (the “Retirement Agreement”). In the Retirement Agreement, Mr. Beecher agreed to be bound by non-competition and non-solicitation restrictions through January 31, 2023 (the “Non-Competition Period”).

Under the Retirement Agreement, Mr. Beecher’s unvested time-based restricted stock units and stock options granted prior to 2019 will continue to vest in accordance with their terms; unvested time-based restricted stock units and stock options granted in 2019 prior to the Retirement Date will continue to vest during the Non-Competition Period in a pro-rated amount based on the number of days that Mr. Beecher was employed during 2019; 



unvested, performance-based restricted stock units awarded prior to 2019 will continue to vest in accordance with their terms; unvested, performance-based restricted stock units awarded in 2019 will vest on the date the amount of shares underlying the performance-based restricted stock units are determined in a pro-rated amount of shares based on the number of days that Mr. Beecher was employed during the 365 calendar day period following the grant date; vested options or options that vest during the Non-Competition Period may be exercised for the remainder of the applicable option term.

 Item 1:  



Legal Proceedings   



We are subject to various legal proceedings and claims, which have arisen, in the ordinary course of business. In the opinion of management, the ultimate disposition of these matters will not have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition or cash flows.  



 Item 1A:  



Risk Factors   



In addition to other information set forth in this Form 



10-Q, you should carefully consider the factors discussed in Part I, “Item 1A: Risk Factors” in our Annual Report on Form 



10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018, which could materially affect our business, financial condition or future results. The risk factors described in our Annual Report on Form 



10-K remain applicable to our business. 



The risks described in our Annual Report on Form 



10-K are not the only risks that we face. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial also may materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and/or operating results. 



Trade regulations and restrictions could impact our ability to sell products to and support certain customers, which may materially adversely affect our sales and results of operations.  



We are subject to U.S. laws and regulations that limit and restrict the export of some of our products and services and may restrict our transactions with certain customers, business partners and other persons. In certain circumstances, export control and economic sanctions regulations may prohibit the export of certain products, services and technologies, and in other circumstances we may be required to obtain an export license before exporting the controlled item. We must also comply with export restrictions and laws imposed by other countries affecting trade and investments. We maintain an export compliance program but there are risks that the compliance controls could be circumvented, exposing us to legal liabilities. Compliance with these laws has not significantly limited our sales, but could significantly limit them in the future. Changes in, and responses to, U.S. trade policy could reduce the competitiveness of our products and cause our sales to drop, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.  



The U.S. government from time to time has issued export restrictions that prohibit U.S. companies from exporting U.S. manufactured products, foreign manufactured products with more than 25% controlled U.S. content, as well as U.S. origin technology. For example, the U.S. Department of Commerce has restricted the access of U.S. origin technologies to certain Chinese companies by adding those companies to the Entity List under U.S. Export Administration Regulations (“EAR”). On May 16, 2019, Huawei and 68 of its affiliates, including HiSilicon, were added to the U.S. Department of Commerce Entity List under the EAR. This action by the U.S. Department of Commerce imposes new export licensing requirements on exports, 



re-exports, and 



in-country transfers of all U.S. regulated products, software and technology to the designated Huawei entities. While most of our products are not subject to the EAR and therefore not affected by the Entity List restrictions, certain of our products are currently manufactured in the U.S. and thus subject to the Entity List restrictions. Compliance with the Entity List restrictions has not significantly impacted our sales, but could limit sales in the future. In addition, the prohibition on transfers of U.S. origin technology to Huawei could significantly limit our ability to service certain of our products sold to Huawei and our ability to engage in product development activities with Huawei and, therefore, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. Furthermore, Huawei’s inability to obtain products from other companies in its supply chain may adversely impact Huawei’s demand for our products. Huawei or other foreign customers affected by future U.S. government sanctions or threats of sanctions may respond by developing their own solutions to replace our products or by adopting our foreign competitors’ solutions. Also, our controls related to Entity List compliance could be circumvented, exposing us to legal liabilities. Even if such restrictions are lifted, any financial or other penalties or continuing export restrictions imposed on Huawei could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.
