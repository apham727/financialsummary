Critical Accounting Policies 



Our critical accounting policies, including the assumptions and judgments underlying them, are discussed in our 2017 Form 10-K in Note 1 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies included in our Consolidated Financial Statements. In May 2014, the FASB issued ASC Update No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606), which has been subsequently updated. The purpose of Update No. 2014-09 is to provide enhancements to the quality and consistency of how revenue is reported while also improving comparability in the financial statements of companies using U.S. GAAP and International Financial Reporting Standards. The core principle requires entities to recognize revenue in a manner that depicts the transfer of goods or services to customers in amounts that reflect the consideration an entity expects to be entitled to in exchange for those goods or services. The Company adopted ASU 2014-09 and its related amendments effective January 1, 2018 using the modified retrospective method. Please see Note 2 for the required disclosures related to the impact of adopting this standard and a discussion of the Company’s updated policies related to revenue recognition and accounting for costs to obtain and fulfill a customer contract. There were no other significant changes to our critical accounting policies during the nine months ended September 30, 2018. 



 35 



The Company’s accounting policies have been consistently applied in all material respects and disclose matters such as allowance for doubtful accounts, sales returns, inventory valuation, warranty expense, income taxes, revenue recognition, asset impairment recognition and foreign currency translation. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates based on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the result of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Results may differ from these estimates due to actual outcomes being different from those on which we based our assumptions. Management reviews these estimates and judgments on an ongoing basis. 



Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements 



Recently issued accounting standards and their estimated effect on the Company’s condensed consolidated financial statements are also described in Note 15, Recent Accounting Pronouncements, to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements.
