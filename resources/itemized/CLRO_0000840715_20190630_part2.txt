PART II - OTHER INFORMATION 



Item 1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS 



On February 15, 2019, the Company filed a petition for inter partes review of Shure’s U.S. Patent No. 9,565,493 (“’493 Patent”), arguing that all claims of the ’493 Patent should be cancelled in light of several prior art references, including ClearOne’s U.S. Patent No. 9,813,806 (the “’806 Patent”). Shure has opposed the petition, and a decision by the Patent Trial and Appeal Board whether to institute inter partes review is expected by August 20, 2019. 



On July 18, 2019, Shure, Inc. filed a lawsuit against the Company in the U.S. Court for the District of Delaware. The lawsuit alleges ClearOne’s BMA CT product, launched in February of 2019, infringes Shure’s '493 Patent. Furthermore, Shure alleged in the lawsuit that ClearOne engaged in unfair competition, tortious interference, deceptive trade practices and false advertising. Shure is seeking monetary damages and multiple injunctive reliefs. The Company believes that the lawsuit is a baseless retaliatory action by Shure and intends to vigorously defend it. 



On August 5, 2019, the Honorable Edmond E. Chang of the Northern District of Illinois issued a preliminary injunction order in the ongoing litigation in that district between the Company and Shure Incorporated, Case No. 11-cv-3087. In that litigation, ClearOne asserts that Shure’s MXA910 Ceiling Array Microphone, which competes with ClearOne’s beamforming microphone array products, infringes patents related to those products. The August 5 order held that ClearOne had "met its burden of demonstrating entitlement to the extraordinary relief of a preliminary injunction" on U.S. Patent No. 9,813,806. The Court held that "Shure is likely infringing the ’806 Patent and has not raised a substantial question of the patent’s validity.” The injunction order prohibits Shure from “manufacturing, marketing, and selling the MXA910 to be used in its drop-ceiling mounting configuration, including marketing and selling the MXA910 in a way that encourages or allows integrators to install it in a drop-ceiling mounting configuration."
