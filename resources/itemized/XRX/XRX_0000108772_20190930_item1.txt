The accompanying unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared for both registrants in accordance with the accounting policies described in Xerox's 2018 Annual Report on Form 10-K ("2018 Annual Report") except as noted herein, and the interim reporting requirements of Form 10-Q.
Accordingly, certain information and note disclosures normally included in our annual financial statements prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America have been condensed or omitted.
You should read these Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Xerox's 2018 Annual Report.
In our opinion, all adjustments, which are necessary for a fair statement of financial position, operating results and cash flows for the interim periods presented, have been made.
These adjustments consist of normal recurring items.
Interim results of operations are not necessarily indicative of the results of the full year.
For convenience and ease of reference, we refer to the financial statement caption “Income before Income Taxes and Equity Income” as “pre-tax income.”
Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements reflect the activity for both Xerox Holdings and Xerox for all periods presented, unless otherwise noted.
Corporate Reorganization
On March 6, 2019, the Xerox Board of Directors approved a reorganization (the “Reorganization”) of the Company's corporate structure into a holding company structure.
The Reorganization was subject to the approval of shareholders, which was obtained at the annual shareholders meeting held May 21, 2019.
On July 31, 2019, Xerox completed the Reorganization, pursuant to which Xerox became a direct, wholly-owned subsidiary of Xerox Holdings.
The business operations, directors and executive officers of the Company did not change as a result of the Reorganization.
In this Reorganization, shareholders of Xerox (the predecessor publicly held parent company) became shareholders of Xerox Holdings on a one-for-one basis; maintaining the same number of shares and ownership percentage as held in Xerox immediately prior to the Reorganization.
In addition, the individual holder of the shares of Xerox’s Series B Preferred Stock exchanged those shares for the same number of shares of Xerox Holdings Series A Preferred Stock.
Each share of Xerox Holdings Series A Preferred Stock has the same designations, rights, powers and preferences, and the same qualifications, limitations and restrictions as the shares of Xerox Series B Preferred Stock, with the addition of certain voting rights.
In connection with the Reorganization, Xerox Holdings assumed each of the Xerox stock plans, all unexercised and unexpired options to purchase Xerox common stock and each right to acquire or vest in a share of Xerox common stock, including restricted stock unit awards, performance share awards and deferred stock units that are outstanding under the Xerox stock plans.
In addition, Xerox Holdings became a guarantor of Xerox’s existing Credit Facility.
The Reorganization was accounted for as a transaction among entities under common control and is expected to be a tax-free transaction for U.S. federal income tax purposes.
Shares of Xerox Holdings common stock trade on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol “XRX”, formerly used by Xerox.
Subsequent to the Reorganization, Xerox Holdings contributed the Xerox Series B Preferred Stock it held to Xerox in exchange for additional capital and Xerox subsequently extinguished the Series B Preferred Stock.
The contribution and extinguishment were recorded at carrying value.
In addition, the capital structure of Xerox was modified such that
Xerox 2019 Form 10-Q
Table of Contents
its issued and outstanding common shares now held by Xerox Holdings were exchanged for 100 shares of Xerox $1 par value common stock.
Accordingly, we reclassified approximately $221 from Xerox’s Common stock to Additional paid-in capital.
Shared Services Arrangement with HCL Technologies
In March 2019, as part of Project Own It, we entered into a shared services arrangement with HCL Technologies (HCL) pursuant to which we are outsourcing certain global administrative and support functions, including, among others, selected information technology and finance functions (excluding accounting).
The transition of these functions to HCL is expected to take up to 18 months.
HCL is expected to make certain up-front and ongoing investments in software, tools and other technology to consolidate, optimize and automate the transferred functions with the goal of providing improved service levels and significant cost savings.
The shared services arrangement with HCL includes a total aggregate spending commitment by us of approximately $1.3 billion over the next 7 years.
However, we can terminate the arrangement at any time at our discretion, subject to payment of termination fees that decline over the term or for cause.
The spending commitment excludes restructuring and related costs we are expected to incur in connection with the transition of the contemplated functions - refer to Note 12 - Restructuring Programs for additional information.
The transfer of employees associated with the HCL arrangement in certain countries is subject to compliance with works council and other employment regulatory requirements in those countries, which may delay the transfer as well as the expected savings from the arrangement.
We incurred net charges of approximately $38 and $68 for three and nine months ended September 30, 2019, respectively, associated with this arrangement.
The cost has been allocated to the various functional expense lines in the Condensed Consolidated Income Statements based on an assessment of the nature and amount of the costs incurred for the various transferred functions prior to their transfer to HCL.
Change in Presentation
During first quarter 2019, we realigned portions of our business to support our new revenue strategy.
This realignment included the combination and consolidation of certain sales units to better service customers consistently across the company.
In connection with that realignment, we changed the classification of revenues and related costs from certain service arrangements to consistently conform the presentation of those amounts among our various business units.
Prior year amounts were also revised as follows to conform to the 2019 presentation.
The revised presentation does not impact Total Revenues, Total Costs and Expenses or Net Income.
Xerox 2019 Form 10-Q
Table of Contents
Note 2 – Recent Accounting Pronouncements
Xerox Holdings and Xerox consider the applicability and impact of all Accounting Standards Updates (ASUs) issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB).
The ASUs listed below apply to both registrants.
ASUs not listed below were assessed and determined to be not applicable to the Consolidated Financial Statements of either registrant.
Financial Instruments - Credit Losses
In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-13, Financial Instruments Credit Losses - Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments, with additional updates and amendments being issued in 2018 and 2019.
This update requires measurement and recognition of expected credit losses for financial assets on an expected loss model rather than an incurred loss model.
The update impacts financial assets including net investment in leases that are not accounted for at fair value through Net Income.
This update is effective for our fiscal year beginning January 1, 2020.
We continue to evaluate the impact of the adoption of ASU 2016-13, which is expected to primarily impact the estimation of our Allowance for doubtful accounts for Accounts Receivables and Finance Receivables.
We currently do not expect the new guidance to have a material impact on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows however, the impact will be dependent on future economic conditions.
Intangibles - Internal-Use Software
In August 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-15, Intangibles - Goodwill and Other - Internal Use Software (Subtopic 350-40), Customer's Accounting for Implementation Costs Incurred in a Cloud Computing Arrangement That is a Service Contract.
This update aligns the requirements for capitalizing implementation costs incurred in a hosting arrangement that is a service contract with the requirements for capitalizing implementation costs incurred to develop or obtain internal-use software (and hosting arrangements that include an internal-use software license).
The update provides criteria for determining which implementation costs to capitalize as an asset related to the service contract and which costs to expense.
The capitalized implementation costs are required to be expensed over the term of the hosting arrangement.
The update also clarifies the presentation requirements for reporting such costs in the entity’s financial statements.
This update is effective for our fiscal year beginning January 1, 2020.
We continue to evaluate the impact of the adoption of ASU 2018-15 on our Consolidated Financial Statements.
Since we currently capitalize these implementation costs, we do not currently expect the new guidance to have a material impact on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.
Leases
On January 1, 2019, we adopted ASU 2016-02, Leases (ASC Topic 842).
This update, as well as additional amendments and targeted improvements issued in 2018 and early 2019, supersedes existing lease accounting guidance found under ASC 840, Leases (“ASC 840”) and requires the recognition of right-to-use assets and lease obligations by lessees for those leases originally classified as operating leases under prior lease guidance.
Effective with the adoption, leases are classified as either finance or operating, with classification affecting the pattern of expense recognition.
Short-term leases with a term of 12 months or less are not required to be recognized.
The update also requires qualitative and quantitative disclosure of key information regarding the amount, timing and uncertainty of cash flows arising from leasing arrangements to increase transparency and comparability among companies.
The accounting for lessors does not fundamentally change with this update except for changes to conform and align guidance to the lessee guidance, as well as to the revenue recognition guidance in ASU 2014-09.
Some of these conforming changes, such as those related to the definition of lease term and minimum lease payments, resulted in certain lease arrangements, that would have been previously accounted for as operating leases, to be classified and accounted for as sales-type leases with a corresponding up-front recognition of equipment sales revenue.
Upon adoption, we applied the transition option, whereby prior comparative periods are not retrospectively presented in the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements.
We also elected the package of practical expedients not to reassess prior conclusions related to contracts containing leases, lease classification and initial direct costs and the lessee practical expedient to combine lease and non-lease components for certain asset classes (real estate lease arrangements for offices and warehouses).
Additionally, we made a policy election to not recognize right-of-use assets and lease liabilities for short-term leases for all asset classes.
We elected the package of practical expedients from both the Lessee and Lessor prospective, to the extent applicable.
Lessee accounting - the adoption of this update resulted in an increase to assets and related liabilities of approximately $385 (approximately $440 undiscounted) primarily related to leases of facilities.
Lessor accounting - the adoption of
Xerox 2019 Form 10-Q

this update resulted in an increase to equipment sales for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2019 of approximately $9 and $20, respectively, in 2019 as compared to the prior year periods.

Refer to Note 2 - Recent Accounting Pronouncements - Leases, for additional information related to the adoption of ASU 2016-02, Leases (ASC Topic 842).
Operating leases are included in Other long-term assets, Accrued expenses and other current liabilities, and Other long-term liabilities in our Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets.
Finance leases are included in Land, buildings
Xerox 2019 Form 10-Q
Table of Contents
and equipment, net, Accrued expenses and other current liabilities, and Other long-term liabilities in our Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets.
Operating lease ROU assets and liabilities are recognized at the commencement date based on the present value of lease payments over the lease term.
Since the implicit rate for most of our leases is not readily determinable, we use our incremental borrowing rate based on the information available at the commencement date in determining the present value of lease payments.
The incremental borrowing rate is the rate of interest that we would have to pay to borrow, on a collateralized basis, an amount equal to the lease payments, in a similar economic environment and over a similar term.
The rate is dependent on several factors, including the lease term and currency of the lease payments.
Lease terms used to calculate the present value of lease payments generally do not include any options to extend, renew, or terminate the lease, as we do not have reasonable certainty at lease inception that these options will be exercised.
We generally consider the economic life of our operating lease ROU assets to be comparable to the useful life of similar owned assets.
We have elected the short-term lease exception, therefore operating lease ROU assets and liabilities do not include leases with a lease term of twelve months or less.
Our leases generally do not provide a residual guarantee.
The operating lease ROU asset also excludes lease incentives.
Lease expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
We have lease agreements with lease and non-lease components.
These components are accounted for separately for vehicle and equipment leases.
We account for the lease and non-lease components as a single lease component for real estate leases of offices and warehouses.
We review the impairment of our ROU assets consistent with the approach applied for our other long-lived assets.
We review the recoverability of our long-lived assets when events or changes in circumstances occur that indicate that the carrying value of the asset may not be recoverable.
The assessment of possible impairment is based on our ability to recover the carrying value of the asset from the expected undiscounted future pre-tax cash flows of the related operations.
We have elected to include the carrying amount of operating lease liabilities in any tested asset group and include the associated operating lease payments in the undiscounted future pre-tax cash flows.
Operating Leases
Variable lease expense is related to our leased real estate for offices and warehouses and primarily includes labor and operational costs as well as taxes and insurance.
As of September 30, 2019, we have an additional real estate operating lease that has not yet commenced.
This operating lease has an obligation and corresponding ROU asset of $23 and will commence in December 2019 with a lease term of approximately 10 years.

Includes the impact of new leases as well as remeasurements and modifications to existing leases.
Represents the future minimum operating lease payments expected to be made over the remaining balance of the year.
Finance Leases
Xerox has one finance lease for equipment and related infrastructure within an outsourced warehouse supply arrangement in the U.S.
The lease expires in December 2023 and has a remaining lease obligation of $7 as of September 30, 2019 based on a discount rate of 4.07%.
The Right-of-use asset balance associated with this finance lease of $7 is included in Land, buildings and equipment, net in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet.
Prior Period Disclosures under ASC 840
For the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, operating lease expense, net of sublease income, were $147 and $161, respectively.

Refer to Note 2 - Recent Accounting Pronouncements - Leases, for additional information related to the adoption of ASU 2016-02, Leases (ASC Topic 842).
The remainder of any fixed payments, as well as the variable payments, are allocated to non-lease elements because the variable consideration for incremental page volume or usage is considered attributable to the delivery of those elements.
The consideration for the non-lease elements is not dependent on the consideration for equipment and vice versa and the consideration for the equipment and services is priced at the appropriate standalone values; therefore, the relative standalone selling price allocation method is not necessary.
The revenue associated with the non-lease elements are normally accounted for as a single performance obligation being delivered in a series with delivery being measured as the usage billed to the customer.
Accordingly, revenue from these agreements is recognized in a manner consistent with the guidance for Maintenance and Services agreements.
We consider the economic life of most of our products to be five years, since this represents the most frequent contractual lease term for our principal products and only a small percentage of our leases are for original terms longer than five years.
There is no significant after-market for our used equipment.
We believe five years is representative of the period during which the equipment is expected to be economically usable, with normal service, for the purpose for which it is intended.
We perform an analysis of the stand-alone selling price of equipment based on cash selling prices during the applicable period.
The cash selling prices are compared to the range of values determined for our leases.
The range of cash selling prices must be reasonably consistent with the lease selling prices in order for us to determine that such lease prices reflects stand-alone value.
Our lease pricing interest rates, which are used in determining customer payments in a bundled lease arrangement, are developed based upon a variety of factors including local prevailing rates in the marketplace and the customer’s credit history, industry and credit class.
We reassess our pricing interest rates quarterly based on changes in the local prevailing rates in the marketplace.
The pricing interest rates generally equal the implicit rates within the leases, as corroborated by our comparisons of cash to lease selling prices noted above.

The balance of deferred incremental direct costs net of accumulated amortization at September 30, 2019 and December 31, 2018 was $162 and $172, respectively.
This amount is expected to be amortized over its estimated period of benefit, which we currently estimate to be approximately four years.
We may also incur costs associated with our services arrangements to generate or enhance resources and assets that will be used to satisfy our future performance obligations included in these arrangements.
These costs are considered contract fulfillment costs and are amortized over the contractual service period of the arrangement to cost of services.
In addition, we also provide inducements to certain customers in various forms, including contractual credits, which are capitalized and amortized as a reduction of revenue over the term of the contract.
As of September 30, 2019 and December 31, 2018 amounts deferred associated with contract fulfillment costs and inducements were $13 and $12, respectively.
The related amortization for the three months ended September 30, 2019 and 2018 was $1 and $0, respectively and $4 and $3 for the nine months ended September 30, 2019 and 2018, respectively.
Note 6 – Acquisitions
Xerox is focused on increasing its Small and Mid-sized (SMB) coverage through resellers and partners (including multi-brand dealers) and continued distribution acquisitions.
During the second quarter of 2019, acquisitions totaled $38 and included Rabbit Copiers, Inc. (Rabbit Office Automation (ROA)), a San Francisco Bay area dealer, and Heritage Business Systems, Inc. (HBS), a Delaware Valley dealer.
Both dealers expand our distribution and increase the number of resources in these geographies and provide office technology sales, services and supplies in those markets.
The operating results of these acquisitions are not material to our financial statements and are included within our results from the acquisition date.
The purchase prices were all cash for 100% ownership of the acquired companies and were primarily allocated to Intangible assets, net and Goodwill.
The allocations are based on preliminary management estimates, which continue to be reviewed, and are expected to be finalized in the fourth quarter 2019 and may include input and support from third-party valuations.
Any adjustments to the allocations are not expected to be material.

Note 8 – Accounts Receivable, Net
Amounts to be invoiced in the subsequent quarter for current services provided are included in amounts accrued.
We perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers and adjust credit limits based upon customer payment history and current creditworthiness.
The allowance for uncollectible accounts receivable is determined principally on the basis of past collection experience as well as consideration of current economic conditions and changes in our customer collection trends.
Accounts Receivable Sales Arrangements
Accounts receivable sales arrangements are utilized in the normal course of business as part of our cash and liquidity management.
The accounts receivable sold are generally short-term trade receivables with payment due dates of less than 60 days.
We have one facility in Europe that enables us to sell accounts receivable associated with our distributor network on an ongoing basis, without recourse.
Under this arrangement, we sell our entire interest in the related accounts receivable for cash and no portion of the payment is held back or deferred by the purchaser.
Of the accounts receivable sold and derecognized from our balance sheet, $94 and $131 remained uncollected as of September 30, 2019 and December 31, 2018, respectively.
Customers may also enter into structured-payable arrangements that require us to sell our receivables from that customer to a third-party financial institution, which then makes payments to us to settle the customer's receivable.
In these instances, we ensure the sale of the receivables are bankruptcy-remote and the payment made to us is without recourse.
The activity associated with these arrangements is not reflected in this disclosure, as payments under these arrangements have not been material and these are customer directed arrangements.

Interest Rate Risk Management
We use interest rate swap agreements to manage our interest rate exposure and to achieve a desired proportion of variable and fixed rate debt.
These derivatives may be designated as fair value hedges or cash flow hedges depending on the nature of the risk being hedged.
Fair Value Hedges
Foreign Exchange Risk Management
•Foreign currency-denominated assets and liabilities
•Forecasted purchases and sales in foreign currency
At September 30, 2019 and December 31, 2018, we had outstanding forward exchange and purchased option contracts with gross notional values of $982 and $1,103 respectively, with terms of less than 12 months.
Approximately 80% of the contracts at September 30, 2019 mature within three months, 10% mature in three to six months and 10% in six to twelve months.
The associated currency exposures being hedged at September 30, 2019 were materially consistent with our year-end currency exposures.
There has not been any material change in our hedging strategy.
Foreign Currency Cash Flow Hedges
We designate a portion of our foreign currency derivative contracts as cash flow hedges of our foreign currency-denominated inventory purchases, sales and expenses.
The net asset fair value of these contracts were $4 and $8 as of September 30, 2019 and December 31, 2018, respectively.

Summary of Derivative Instruments Fair Value
Summary of Derivative Instruments Gains (Losses)
Derivative gains and (losses) affect the income statement based on whether such derivatives are designated as hedges of underlying exposures.
The following is a summary of derivative gains (losses).
Designated Derivative Instruments Gains (Losses)
During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2019 and 2018, no amount of ineffectiveness was recorded in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income for these designated cash flow hedges and all components of each derivative’s gain or (loss) were included in the assessment of hedge effectiveness.
In addition, no amount was recorded for an underlying exposure that did not occur or was not expected to occur.
As of September 30, 2019, a net after-tax gain of $7 was recorded in Accumulated other comprehensive loss associated with our cash flow hedging activity.
The entire balance is expected to be reclassified into Net income within the next 12 months, providing an offsetting economic impact against the underlying anticipated transactions.
Non-Designated Derivative Instruments Gains (Losses)
Non-designated derivative instruments are primarily instruments used to hedge foreign currency-denominated assets and liabilities.
They are not designated as hedges since there is a natural offset for the remeasurement of the underlying foreign currency-denominated asset or liability.

For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2019 currency losses, net were $4 and $6, respectively, and for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2018 were $3 and $2, respectively.
Net currency gains and losses include the mark-to-market adjustments of the derivatives not designated as hedging instruments and the related cost of those derivatives as well as the remeasurement of foreign currency-denominated assets and liabilities and are included in Other expenses, net.
Note 15 – Fair Value of Financial Assets and Liabilities
The following table represents assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis.
The basis for the measurement at fair value in all cases is Level 2 – Significant Other Observable Inputs.
We utilize the income approach to measure the fair value for our derivative assets and liabilities.
The income approach uses pricing models that rely on market observable inputs such as yield curves, currency exchange rates and forward prices, and therefore are classified as Level 2.
Fair value for our deferred compensation plan investments in mutual funds is based on quoted market prices for those funds.
Fair value for deferred compensation plan liabilities is based on the fair value of investments corresponding to employees’ investment selections.
Summary of Other Financial Assets and Liabilities
The fair value amounts for Cash and cash equivalents and Accounts receivable, net, approximate carrying amounts due to the short maturities of these instruments.
The fair value of Short-term debt, including the current portion of long-term debt, and Long-term debt was estimated based on the current rates offered to us for debt of similar maturities (Level 2).
The difference between the fair value and the carrying value represents the theoretical net premium or discount we would pay or receive to retire all debt at such date.

Note 19 – Stock-Based Compensation
We have a long-term incentive plan whereby eligible employees may be granted restricted stock units (RSUs), performance shares (PSs) and stock options (SOs).
We grant stock-based compensation awards in order to continue to attract and retain qualified employees and to better align employees' interests with those of our shareholders.
Each of these awards is subject to settlement with newly issued shares of our common stock.
The board of directors (the "Board") recently approved a change in the timing of our annual grant of awards from April to January to more closely align the grant date with the underlying performance period related to PSs.
The following is a summary of the program design and performance metrics effective for our January 2019 grant and grants thereafter, as approved by the Board.
Stock options were not awarded under the 2019 grant.
Restricted Stock Units
Performance Shares
Performance-Based Component
PSs vest contingent upon meeting pre-determined cumulative performance metrics.
The fair value of our PSs is based upon the grant-date market price.
Compensation expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the vesting period, based on management's estimate of the number of shares expected to vest.
If the cumulative three-year actual results exceed the stated targets, all plan participants have the potential to earn additional shares of common stock up to a maximum overachievement of 100% of the original grant.
If the stated targets are not met, any recognized compensation cost would be reversed.
Shares granted through September 30, 2019 under this program were 714, with a corresponding weighted-average grant-date fair value of $22.62 per share.
Market-Based Component
The Absolute Share Price metric is based on Xerox's average closing price for the last 20 trading days of the performance period, inclusive of dividends during the three-year performance period.
Payout for this portion of the PS will be determined based on total return targets approved by the compensation committee of the Board.
Since this portion of the PS award represents a market condition, a Monte Carlo simulation was used to determine the grant-date fair value.
Xerox 2019 Form 10-Q
Table of Contents
The risk-free interest rate was based on the zero-coupon U.S. Treasury yield curve on the valuation date, with a maturity matched to the performance period.
The weighted-average of fair values used to record compensation expense as determined by the Monte Carlo simulation.
For performance between the levels described above, the degree of vesting is interpolated on a linear basis.
Compensation expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the vesting period based on the fair value determined by the Monte Carlo simulation and, except in cases of employee forfeiture, cannot be reversed regardless of performance.
Shares granted through September 30, 2019 under this program were 714.

Legal Matters
Brazil Contingencies
The decrease in the unreserved portion of the tax contingency, inclusive of any related interest, was primarily related to currency.
With respect to the unreserved tax contingency, the majority has been assessed by management as being remote as to the likelihood of ultimately resulting in a loss to the Company.
In connection with the above proceedings, customary local regulations may require us to make escrow cash deposits or post other security of up to half of the total amount in dispute, as well as, additional surety bonds and letters of credit, which include associated indexation.
Generally, any escrowed amounts would be refundable and any liens on assets would be removed to the extent the matters are resolved in our favor.
We are also involved in certain disputes with contract and former employees.
Exposures related to labor matters are not material to the financial statements as of September 30, 2019 and December 31, 2018.
We routinely assess all these matters as to the probability of ultimately incurring a liability against our Brazilian operations and record our best estimate of the ultimate loss in situations where we assess the likelihood of an ultimate loss as probable.
Litigation Against the Company
In February 2018, five complaints (the "Fuji Transaction Shareholder Lawsuits"), including four putative class actions (which have been consolidated), were filed by Xerox shareholders in the Supreme Court of the State of New York, County of New York (the "Court") in connection with the proposed transaction to combine Xerox and Fuji Xerox (the “Fuji Transaction”).
All of the complaints name as defendants Xerox, its directors, and FUJIFILM Holdings Corporation (“Fujifilm”).
The complaint in one of the actions also names as a defendant Ursula M. Burns, the former Chief Executive Officer of Xerox.
The plaintiffs allege, among other things, that Xerox's directors breached their fiduciary duties in negotiating, approving, and purportedly making false and misleading disclosures about the Fuji Transaction, and that Fujifilm aided and abetted those breaches.
The complaint in one of the actions further alleges that Xerox and the director defendants engaged in common law fraud by purportedly failing to disclose information about the joint venture agreements between Xerox and Fujifilm.
The Fuji Transaction Shareholder Lawsuits seek injunctive relief preventing
Xerox 2019 Form 10-Q
Table of Contents
One of the Fuji Transaction Shareholder Lawsuits was brought by Darwin Deason, a Xerox shareholder ("Deason I").
Another complaint was filed by Mr. Deason against Xerox and its directors in the same Court on March 2, 2018 ("Deason II") alleging that defendants breached their fiduciary duties by refusing Mr. Deason’s request for a waiver of the deadline for nomination of a new slate of Xerox directors.
In Deason II, Mr. Deason sought to enjoin Xerox and its directors from enforcing Xerox’s advance notice by-laws, thereby allowing Mr. Deason to proceed with the nominations, as well as costs, fees, and other relief.
On April 27, 2018, the Court issued decisions and orders granting plaintiffs’ preliminary injunction motions, which (i) enjoined Xerox from “taking any further action to consummate the change of control transaction between Xerox and Fuji that was announced on January 31, 2018 pending a final determination of the claims asserted in the underlying action;” (ii) enjoined Xerox from enforcing its advance notice bylaw provision requiring shareholders to nominate directors for election at the 2018 annual shareholder meeting by December 11, 2017; and (iii) required Xerox to waive such advance notice bylaw provision to permit the noticing of a slate of director nominees for election at the 2018 annual shareholder meeting, and denying defendants’ motions to dismiss.
On May 1, 2018, Xerox entered into a Director Appointment, Nomination and Settlement Agreement (the “Initial Settlement Agreement”) with Mr. Deason and Carl C. Icahn and certain of his affiliates who were also Xerox shareholders (the "Icahn Group"), among others, that would have resolved Deason I, Deason II and the pending proxy contest in connection with Xerox’s 2018 Annual Meeting of Shareholders.
The Initial Settlement Agreement expired by its terms on May 3, 2018 without becoming effective.
On May 7, 2018, defendants filed with the Supreme Court of the State of New York, Appellate Division, First Judicial Department, notices of appeal of, and motions to stay pending appeal, the lower Court’s decision and order.
Defendants also moved the appellate court for interim relief ordering that the appeal be heard on an expedited basis.
At a hearing before the appellate court on May 7, 2018, the appellate court ruled that the appeals would be heard on an expedited basis and granted a partial interim stay allowing Xerox and Fujifilm to take steps to seek regulatory approvals related to the Fuji Transaction pending a ruling from the appellate court on defendants’ motions to stay pending appeal.
On May 13, 2018, a second Director Appointment, Nomination and Settlement Agreement (the "Final Settlement Agreement") with respect to Deason I, Deason II and the pending proxy contest in connection with Xerox's 2018 Annual Meeting of Shareholders that was initiated by the Icahn Group was signed on behalf of Mr. Deason, the Icahn Group and all defendants except Fujifilm, and a memorandum of understanding regarding settlement of the putative class case was signed by all defendants except Fujifilm.
Pursuant to the settlements, the settling defendants withdrew their appeal and motion to stay in Deason I and Deason II.
The settling defendants also withdrew their motion to stay in the putative class case.
The Court entered a stipulation of discontinuance as to the settling parties in Deason II on May 14, 2018, and agreed on June 22, 2018 to do the same in Deason I.
On June 14, 2018, Fujifilm filed answers in Deason I and the putative class case, along with cross-claims against the members of the Xerox Board (as constituted before May 13, 2018) and a third-party complaint against Xerox director Jonathan Christodoro, seeking contribution for any potential award against Fujifilm for aiding and abetting purported breaches of fiduciary duties.
On June 19, 2018, the putative class plaintiffs filed a motion for preliminary approval of a stipulation of settlement that would resolve the claims asserted by the plaintiffs in the putative class case against all defendants, other than Fujifilm.
Carmen Ribbe, the plaintiff in the below derivative action, and Fujifilm filed oppositions to the motion on July 10, 2018.
On June 22, 2018, the Court entered an order denying a joint motion by the putative class plaintiffs and the settling defendants to dissolve the injunction in the putative class case as against the settling defendants, and entered an order denying Fujifilm’s motion to dissolve the injunctions in the putative class case and Deason I in their entirety.
On July 16, 2018, the Court held a hearing concerning the putative class plaintiffs’ motion for preliminary approval of the settlement in the putative class case.
The Court indicated that it was not inclined to consider motions for approval of the settlement prior to considering whether the putative class should be certified.
On August 2, 2018, the Appellate Division entered orders recognizing the Xerox defendants’ withdrawal of their appeal in the Deason cases and denying all appellants’ motions to stay pending determination of appeals in the Deason and putative class cases.
On August 2, 2018, the Appellate Division entered orders (i) at their request, deeming withdrawn the Xerox defendants’ appeal and motion to stay in the Deason cases; (ii) upon their request, deeming withdrawn the Xerox defendants’

motion to stay, pending determination of appeal, the putative class case; and (iii) denying Fujifilm’s motion to stay pending determination of its appeals in the Deason and putative case cases.
On September 21, 2018, putative class plaintiffs filed a motion for certification of a settlement class and a motion to transmit notice of the proposed settlement to the proposed class.
On October 17, 2018, derivative plaintiff Carmen Ribbe and Fujifilm filed oppositions to the putative class plaintiffs’ motion to transmit notice to the proposed class.
The class has not yet been certified, and preliminary approval has not been granted.
The Appellate Division heard oral argument on September 25, 2018 on Fujifilm’s appeal of the Court’s decision.
On October 16, 2018, the Appellate Division entered a decision and order reversing the Court’s rulings, ordering that the claims brought against Fujifilm in the cases by Mr. Deason and the purported class be dismissed, and further ordering that the preliminary injunction of the proposed Fuji Transaction be dissolved (the “Appellate Decision and Order”).
On November 15, 2018, the putative class plaintiffs filed with the Appellate Division a motion seeking the opportunity to reargue Fujifilm’s appeal or, in the alternative, for leave to appeal the Appellate Decision and Order to the New York State Court of Appeals.
On December 6, 2018, pursuant to the Appellate Decision and Order, the Court entered a judgment dismissing the complaints against Fujifilm in Deason I and the putative class case.
The Court further issued orders denying the putative class plaintiffs’ motion for class certification, without prejudice to renewing the motion after the outcome of any appeals of the Appellate Decision and Order.
On January 8, 2019, the Court entered an order staying all further proceedings in Deason I and the putative class case until thirty days after exhaustion of appeals, including any appeals to the New York State Court of Appeals, of the Appellate Decision and Order.
On January 9, 2019, the Court entered an order denying the putative class plaintiffs’ motion to transmit notice to the proposed class, without prejudice to renewal of their motion at a later time.
On October 31, 2018 and January 3, 2019, respectively, Xerox and the Xerox director defendants in the putative class case filed with the Appellate Division a request and motion seeking an extension, until after any decision regarding approval of settlement of the putative class action, of the deadline by which to perfect their appeal of the Court’s April 27, 2018 decision and order.
On May 16, 2019, the Appellate Division entered an order granting the motion and extended the deadline until the October 2019 Term.
On February 21, 2019, the Appellate Division issued an order denying the putative class plaintiffs’ motion seeking to reargue Fujifilm’s appeal or, in the alternative, for leave to appeal the Appellate Decision and Order to the New York State Court of Appeals.
No further notice of appeal was filed, and the Appellate Decision and Order became final and unappealable on March 26, 2019.
On May 3, 2019, putative class plaintiffs filed a renewed motion for approval of the form of a notice to putative class members.
On May 6, 2019, putative class plaintiffs filed a renewed motion for class certification and notice of motion to approve class settlement and proposed final approval order.
On May 24, 2019, the Court entered an order approving the form notice and proposed manner of its dissemination.
On June 6, 2019, the Court entered an order pursuant to which plaintiffs submitted their motion to approve attorneys’ fees and expenses on July 19, 2019; requiring filing of any objections to or opt-outs from the proposed putative class settlement by August 9, 2019; and setting September 6, 2019 for its hearing on putative class plaintiffs’ motion for class certification and settlement approval.
The hearing took place, and on September 12, 2019, the Court entered a decision and order denying both motions.
Xerox will vigorously defend these lawsuits to the extent that the proceedings continue as to Xerox.
At this time, however, it is premature to make any conclusion regarding the probability of incurring material losses in these lawsuits.
Should developments cause a change in our determination as to an unfavorable outcome, or result in a final adverse judgment or settlement, there could be a material adverse effect on our results of operations, cash flows and financial position in the period in which such change in determination, judgment, or settlement occurs.
On April 11, 2019, Carmen Ribbe filed a putative derivative and class action stockholder complaint in the Supreme Court of the State of New York for New York County, naming as defendants Xerox, current Board members Gregory Q.
Brown, Joseph J. Echevarria, Cheryl Gordon Krongard, Sara Martinez Tucker, Keith Cozza, Giovanni G. Visentin, Jonathan Christodoro, Nicholas Graziano, and A. Scott Letier, and former Board members Jeffrey Jacobson, William Curt Hunter, Robert J. Keegan, Charles Prince, Ann N. Reese, and Stephen H. Rusckowski.
Plaintiff previously filed a putative shareholder derivative lawsuit on May 24, 2018 against certain of these defendants, as well as others, in the same court; that lawsuit was dismissed without prejudice on December 6, 2018.
The new complaint includes
Xerox 2019 Form 10-Q
Table of Contents
putative derivative claims on behalf of Xerox for breach of fiduciary duty against the members of the Xerox Board who approved Xerox’s entry into agreements to settle the Deason and In re Xerox Corporation Consolidated Shareholder Litigation (“XCCSL”) actions (described above).
Plaintiff alleges that the settlements ceded control of the Board and the Company to Darwin Deason and Carl C. Icahn without a vote by, or compensation to, other Xerox stockholders; improperly provided certain benefits and releases to the resigning and continuing directors; and subjected Xerox to potential breach of contract damages in an action by Fuji relating to Xerox’s termination of the proposed Fuji Transaction.
Plaintiff also alleges that the current Board members breached their fiduciary duties by allegedly rejecting plaintiff’s January 14, 2019 shareholder demand on the Board to remedy harms arising from entry into the Deason and XCCSL settlements.
The new complaint further includes direct claims for breach of fiduciary duty on behalf of a putative class of current Xerox stockholders other than Mr. Deason, Mr. Icahn, and their affiliated entities (the “Ribbe Class”) against the defendants for causing Xerox to enter into the Deason and XCCSL settlements, which plaintiff alleges perpetuated control of Xerox by Mr. Icahn and Mr. Deason and denied the voting franchise of Xerox shareholders.
Among other things, plaintiff seeks damages in an unspecified amount for the alleged fiduciary breaches in favor of Xerox against defendants jointly and severally; rescission or reformation of the Deason and XCCSL settlements; restitution of funds paid to the resigning directors under the Deason settlement; an injunction against defendants’ engaging in the alleged wrongful practices and equitable relief affording the putative Ribbe Class the ability to determine the composition of the Board; costs and attorneys’ fees; and other further relief as the Court may deem proper.
Defendants accepted service of the complaint as of May 16, 2019.
On June 4, 2019, the Court entered an order setting a briefing schedule for defendants’ motions to dismiss the complaint.
On July 12, 2019, plaintiff filed a motion to preclude defendants from referencing in their motions to dismiss the formation of, or work by, the committee of the Board established to investigate plaintiff’s shareholder demand.
On July 18, 2019, the Court denied plaintiff’s motion and adjourned sine die the deadline by which defendants must file any motions to dismiss the complaint.
Xerox will vigorously defend against this matter.
At this time, it is premature to make any conclusion regarding the probability of incurring material losses in this litigation.
Should developments cause a change in our determination as to an unfavorable outcome, or result in a final adverse judgment or settlement, there could be a material adverse effect on our results of operations, cash flows and financial position in the period in which such change in determination, judgment, or settlement occurs.
At a conference on September 24, 2018, the Court stayed all discovery pending resolution of Xerox’s motion to dismiss.
Xerox filed its motion to dismiss on October 1, 2018.
On February 22, 2019, following oral argument, the Court denied the motion to dismiss.
On March 12, 2019, the Court entered a scheduling order setting various case deadlines.
Xerox filed its answer denying the claims on March 15, 2019.
Discovery has commenced and is ongoing.
On June 24, 2019 and August 12, 2019, the Court entered stipulated revised scheduling orders extending certain case deadlines.
Xerox believes the lawsuit is meritless and will vigorously defend it.
At this time, however, it is premature to make any conclusion regarding the probability of incurring material losses in this litigation.
Should developments cause a change in our determination as to an unfavorable outcome, or result in a final adverse judgment or settlement, there could be a material adverse effect on our results of operations, cash flows and financial position in the period in which such change in determination, judgment, or settlement occurs.

The complaint alleged that defendants made false and misleading statements, in violation of Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act and SEC Rule 10b-5, relating to the operations and prospects of Xerox’s Health Enterprise business.
Plaintiff sought, among other things, unspecified monetary damages and attorneys’ fees.
Other, similar lawsuits may follow.
On December 28, 2016, the Court entered a stipulated order setting out a schedule for amendment of the complaint and for defendants’ response to that complaint following the Court’s appointment of lead plaintiff under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act.
On February 28, 2017, the Court issued an opinion and order appointing the Arkansas Public Employees Retirement System ("APERS") as lead plaintiff.
On May 1, 2017, APERS filed an amended complaint, alleging substantially similar claims and seeking substantially similar relief, but adding David Bywater and Mary Scanlon as defendants.

Guarantees
We have issued or provided approximately $297 of guarantees as of September 30, 2019 in the form of letters of credit or surety bonds issued to i) support certain insurance programs; ii) support our obligations related to the Brazil contingencies; and iii) support certain contracts, primarily with public sector customers, which require us to provide a surety bond as a guarantee of our performance of contractual obligations.
In general, we would only be liable for the amount of these guarantees in the event we defaulted in performing our obligations under each contract; the probability of which we believe is remote.
We believe that our capacity in the surety markets as well as under various credit arrangements (including our Credit Facility) is sufficient to allow us to respond to future requests for proposals that require such credit support.

implementing another transaction structure that allows XL to sell all of its remaining equity interest in FX and receive the FFAP Purchase Price.
The closing of the FX Sale Transaction is conditioned upon the absence of any legal requirement or order preventing or making unlawful the transactions contemplated thereby, other than the FEFTA Approval.
Moreover, each party’s obligation to consummate such closing is conditioned upon the accuracy of the other party’s representations and warranties (generally subject to a Material Adverse Effect (as defined in the Stock Purchase Agreement) qualifier).
