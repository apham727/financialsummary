ITEM 2 — MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS


Throughout this document, references to “we,” “our,” the “company,” and “Xerox” refer to Xerox Corporation and its subsidiaries.
References to “Xerox Corporation” refer to the stand-alone parent company and do not include its subsidiaries.
Currency Impact

To better understand the trends in our business, we believe that it is helpful to analyze the impact of changes in the translation of foreign currencies into U.S.
Dollars on revenue and expenses.
We refer to this analysis as "constant currency", “currency impact” or “the impact from currency.” This impact is calculated by translating current period activity in local currency using the comparable prior year period's currency translation rate.
This impact is calculated for all countries where the functional currency is the local country currency.
We do not hedge the translation effect of revenues or expenses denominated in currencies where the local currency is the functional currency.
Management believes the constant currency measure provides investors an additional perspective on revenue trends.
Currency impact can be determined as the difference between actual growth rates and constant currency growth rates.
The constant currency impact for signings growth is calculated on the basis of plan currency rates.

Overview

Fuji Xerox Transaction and Recent Developments

Refer to Note 18 - Contingencies and Litigation and Note 19 - Fuji Xerox Transaction and Recent Developments in the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information related to this terminated transaction and related matters.
Fuji Xerox Adjustments


In 2018, in connection with the completion of the audits of Fuji Xerox’s fiscal year-end financial statements as of and for the years ended March 31, 2016 and 2017, as well as the review of Fuji Xerox’s unaudited interim financial statements as of and for the nine months ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, additional adjustments and misstatements were identified.
These additional adjustments and misstatements were to the previously reported Net income of Fuji Xerox for the period from 2010 through 2017 and are incremental to the items identified by the IIC noted above.
These incremental adjustments primarily relate to Fuji Xerox’s Asia Pacific subsidiaries and involve improper revenue recognition, including revenue associated with leasing transactions, additional provisions for bad debt allowances and other asset impairments.
In certain instances, some of the adjustments related to inappropriate accounting and reporting practices in the Fuji Xerox Asia Pacific subsidiaries and are further evidence of inadequate management oversight and an insufficient entity level monitoring system for financial statements of subsidiaries beyond what was previously identified by the IIC.
Fuji Xerox is committed to implementing additional measures to remediate these newly identified issues.
Refer to Note 9 - Investments in Affiliates, at Equity in the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.
Second Quarter 2018 Review

Total revenue of $2.51 billion for second quarter 2018 declined 2.2% from second quarter 2017 and included a 1.8-percentage point favorable impact from currency.
Total revenue in 2018 has not fully benefited from the new product launch in 2017 and further increase in our share of the market is needed to improve the revenue trend.
Post sale revenue, which primarily reflects contracted services, equipment maintenance, supplies and financing, was $1.95 billion and represented 78% of total revenue.
Post sale revenue declined 3.1% from second quarter 2017 and included a 1.9-percentage point favorable impact from currency.
Excluding the impact from currency, the decline in post sale revenues primarily reflected the continuing trends of lower page volumes (including a higher mix of lower usage products), an ongoing competitive price environment and a lower population of devices.
These declines were partially offset by higher revenues from our Managed Document Services (MDS) and Global Imaging business as well as higher paper sales revenue and supplies revenue, excluding original equipment manufacturer (OEM) supplies.
Total equipment revenue of $561 million increased 0.9%, including a 1.5-percentage point favorable impact from currency.
Excluding the impact from currency, the decline of total equipment revenue primarily reflected the impact of lower OEM equipment

sales and price declines of approximately 5%, which were partially offset by a favorable comparison to second quarter 2017 due to the timing of our ConnectKey product introduction.
Total revenue of $4.95 billion for the six months ended June 30, 2018 declined 1.5% from the prior year period and included a 2.8-percentage point favorable impact from currency.
Post sale revenue of $3.89 billion, which represented 79% of total revenue, declined 1.7% and included a 2.9-percentage point favorable impact from currency.
The decline in post sale revenue primarily reflected continuing lower page volume trends, an ongoing competitive price environment, a lower population of devices, as well as the higher mix of installs of lower usage devices.
These declines were partially offset by higher revenues from our Managed Document Services and Global Imaging business as well as higher paper sales revenue.
Total equipment revenue of $1.06 billion declined 0.8% including a 2.5-percentage point favorable impact from currency.
Excluding the impact from currency, the decline of total equipment revenue reflected the impact of lower OEM equipment sales and reflected price declines of approximately 5%.
The decline in Equipment sales also reflected the overall market decline trends and unfavorable mix.
The decrease in Net income from continuing operations attributable to Xerox for the three and six months ended June 30, 2018 as compared to the prior year periods was primarily due to Transaction and related costs, net and lower revenues.
These impacts were partially offset by lower Non-service retirement-related costs and gains on the sale of non-core assets.
The decrease in Net income from continuing operations attributable to Xerox for the six months ended June 30, 2018 was also negatively impacted by lower Equity in net income from unconsolidated affiliates, which included our share of a significant restructuring charge recorded by Fuji Xerox and Income tax expense.
The decrease in adjusted1 Net income from continuing operations attributable to Xerox for the three and six months ended June 30, 2018 as compared to the prior year periods was primarily related to lower revenues, partially offset by the continued benefits of cost savings and productivity improvements, as well as gains from the sale of non-core assets.
The decrease in adjusted1 Net income from continuing operations attributable to Xerox for the six months ended June 30, 2018 was also impacted by lower Equity in net income from unconsolidated affiliates, which included an out of period adjustment recorded during the first quarter 2018, as well as higher income taxes.
Operating cash flow from continuing operations attributable to Xerox for the six months ended June 30, 2018 was $451 million, as compared to $413 million for the prior year period.
The increase was primarily due to the prior year reclassification of $110 million of collections of deferred proceeds and beneficial interests from the sale of receivables to investing cash flows as a result of an accounting change (refer to Note 3 - Recent Accounting Pronouncements in the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information) and improved working capital2.
Cash used in investing activities for the six months ended June 30, 2018 was $17 million and included capital expenditures of $50 million, which were partially offset by proceeds of $32 million from the sale of non-core business assets.
Cash used in financing activities of $456 million for the six months ended June 30, 2018 primarily reflects payments of $265 million on Senior Notes, $25 million related to the termination of a capital lease obligation, $19 million of bridge facility costs and dividend payments of $135 million.

Equipment sales revenue



CC - See "Currency Impact" section for a description of Constant Currency.
Equipment sales revenue increased 0.9% for the three months ended June 30, 2018 as compared to second quarter 2017, with a 1.5-percentage point favorable impact from currency and was impacted by price declines of approximately 5% (which were in-line with our historic declines).
The modest decline at constant currency1 included an approximate 4.0-percentage point unfavorable impact from lower OEM equipment sales while it also benefited from a favorable comparison as second quarter 2017 was measurably impacted by the timing of our ConnectKey product introductions.
The increase in entry reflected higher sales of our ConnectKey devices in developing markets and U.S. indirect channels.
The increase in mid-range reflected higher installs of new products across North America including higher large account sales as well as higher revenues from developing markets.
The decrease in high-end sales primarily reflected lower revenues from iGen, at the top-end of the portfolio, along with lower revenues from black-and-white systems consistent with market decline trends; these declines were partially mitigated by higher activity from the recently launched Iridesse production press.

Summary of Key Financial Ratios





Pre-tax Income Margin

Second quarter 2018 pre-tax income margin of 5.3% decreased 2.2-percentage points as compared to second quarter 2017.
The decrease was primarily driven by Transaction and related costs, net as well as lower adjusted1 operating profit, partially offset by lower Other expenses, net.
Pre-tax income margin for the six months ended June 30, 2018 of 5.4% increased 1.9-percentage points as compared to the prior year period.

Other Expenses, Net


Non-Financing Interest Expense

Non-financing interest expense for the three months ended June 30, 2018 was $27 million and increased $3 million as compared to the second quarter of 2017.
When combined with financing interest expense (Cost of financing), total interest expense increased by $3 million as compared to the second quarter of 2017 due to a higher debt balance reflecting $1.0 billion of new debt issued in the third quarter 2017 to fund, among other things, a $500 million voluntary contribution to our U.S. defined benefit pension plans partially offset by lower average interest rates.
Non-financing interest expense for the six months ended June 30, 2018 was $56 million and decreased $4 million as compared to the prior year period.
When combined with financing interest expense (Cost of financing), total interest expense decreased by $3 million from the prior year comparable period primarily due to a lower debt balance reflecting debt repayments of approximately $1.3 billion in the first quarter 2017 partially offset by $1.0 billion of new debt issued in the third quarter 2017 to fund, among other things, a $500 million voluntary contribution to our U.S. defined benefit pension plans; the decline also reflected lower average interest rates.
Non-Service Retirement-Related Costs

Non-service retirement-related costs decreased $9 million and $44 million, respectively, for the three and six months ended June 30, 2018 compared to the prior year periods.
Both period decreases were primarily driven by the favorable impact of higher pension contributions and asset returns in the prior year.
The decrease for the six months ended June 30, 2018 was also driven by lower losses from pension settlements as compared to the prior year period.
Gains on Sales of Businesses and Assets

Gains on sales of businesses and assets for the three and six months ended June 30, 2018 of $16 million and $32 million, respectively, reflected the sale of non-core business assets.
Loss on Early Extinguishment of Debt

During the first quarter of 2017, we recorded a $13 million loss associated with the repayment of $300 million in Senior Notes.
Income Taxes



Xerox 2018 Form 10-Q


Table of Contents   



Our effective tax rate is based on nonrecurring events as well as recurring factors, including the taxation of foreign income.
In addition, our effective tax rate will change based on discrete or other nonrecurring events that may not be predictable.
Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the “Tax Act”)

On December 22, 2017, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the “Tax Act”) was enacted.
The Tax Act significantly revises the U.S. corporate income tax system by, among other things, lowering the U.S. statutory corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21% and implementing a territorial tax system that includes a one-time transition tax on deemed repatriated earnings of foreign subsidiaries.
During the fourth quarter 2017, we recorded an estimated non-cash charge of $400 million reflecting the impact associated with the provisions of the Tax Act based on currently available information.
Our estimated charge incorporates assumptions made based on our current interpretation of the Tax Act as well as currently available information and may change, possibly materially, as we complete our analysis and receive additional clarification and implementation guidance.
Changes in interpretations and assumptions as well as actions we may take as a result of the Tax Act may also impact this estimated charge.
The $400 million estimated provisional charge continues to be our best estimate of the impacts from the Tax Act and no further adjustment of that charge was made in the six months ended June 30, 2018.
However, we continue to evaluate the impacts from the Tax Act and likely will do so through the filing of our 2017 U.S. Tax Return in the third quarter 2018.
Any adjustments to these provisional amounts will be reported as a component of Income tax expense in the reporting period in which any such adjustments are determined.
Effective January 1, 2018, we became subject to several provisions of the Tax Act including computations related to Global Intangible Low Taxed Income ("GILTI"), Foreign Derived Intangible Income ("FDII"), Base Erosion and Anti-Abuse Tax ("BEAT"), and IRC Section 163(j) interest limitation (Interest Limitation).
Our current estimate for the GILTI, FDII and Interest Limitation rules was determined to be immaterial, however we currently estimate that we are subject to BEAT.
Accordingly, our effective tax rate for the three and six months ended June 30, 2018 includes the estimated impact for BEAT, which has also been incorporated into our estimated annual effective tax for 2018.
Similar to the provisional charge recorded in the fourth quarter 2017 associated with the enactment of the Tax Act, the estimates for these additional provisions of the Tax Act were made based on our current interpretation of the Tax Act as well as currently available information and may change, as we complete our analysis and receive additional clarification and implementation guidance.
Changes in interpretations and assumptions as well as actions we may take as a result of the Tax Act may also impact these estimates.
Equity in Net Income (Loss) of Unconsolidated Affiliates


Equity in net income (loss) of unconsolidated affiliates primarily reflects our 25% share of Fuji Xerox Net income (loss).
For the three and six months ended June 30, 2018, equity income decreased $1 million and $109 million, respectively, as compared to the prior year periods.
The six months ended June 30, 2018 equity loss included an approximate $28 million charge related to the out-of-period adjustments described in Note 9 - Investments in Affiliates, at Equity, in the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements and in the "Fuji Xerox Adjustments" section above.

Financial Risk Management


We are required to recognize all derivative instruments as either assets or liabilities at fair value in the balance sheet.
As permitted, certain of these derivative contracts have been designated for hedge accounting treatment.
Certain of our derivatives that do not qualify for hedge accounting are effective as economic hedges.
These derivative contracts are likewise required to be recognized each period at fair value and therefore do result in some level of volatility.
The level of volatility will vary with the type and amount of derivative hedges outstanding, as well as fluctuations in the currency and interest rate markets during the period.
The related cash flow impacts of all of our derivative activities are reflected as cash flows from operating activities.
By their nature, all derivative instruments involve, to varying degrees, elements of market and credit risk.
The market risk associated with these instruments resulting from currency exchange and interest rate movements is expected to offset the market risk of the underlying transactions, assets and liabilities being hedged.
We do not believe there is significant risk of loss in the event of non-performance by the counterparties associated with these instruments because these transactions are executed with a diversified group of major financial institutions.
Further, our policy is to deal with counterparties having a minimum investment grade or better credit rating.
Credit risk is managed through the continuous monitoring of exposures to such counterparties.
The current market events have not required us to materially modify or change our financial risk management strategies with respect to our exposures to interest rate and foreign currency risk.
Refer to Note 12 – Financial Instruments in the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion and information on our financial risk management strategies.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures

We have reported our financial results in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP).
In addition, we have discussed our financial results using the non-GAAP measures described below.
We believe these non-GAAP measures allow investors to better understand the trends in our business and to better understand and compare our results.
Accordingly, we believe it is necessary to adjust several reported amounts, determined in accordance with GAAP, to exclude the effects of certain items as well as their related income tax effects.
These non-GAAP financial measures should be viewed in addition to, and not as a substitute for, the Company’s reported results prepared in accordance with GAAP.
Adjusted Earnings Measures

•Net income and Earnings per share (EPS)

•Effective tax rate

•2017 - Loss on early extinguishment of debt in the first quarter of 2017.
•2017 - A benefit from the remeasurement of a tax matter in the first quarter of 2017 that related to a previously adjusted item.
We believe the exclusion of these items allows investors to better understand and analyze the results for the period as compared to prior periods and expected future trends in our business.
Adjusted Operating Income and Margin


Constant Currency (CC)

Refer to "Currency Impact" for a discussion of this measure and its use in our analysis of revenue growth.
Summary

Management believes that all of these non-GAAP financial measures provide an additional means of analyzing the current period’s results against the corresponding prior period’s results.
However, these non-GAAP financial measures should be viewed in addition to, and not as a substitute for, the Company’s reported results prepared in accordance with GAAP.
Our non-GAAP financial measures are not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for comparable GAAP measures and should be read only in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP.
Our management regularly uses our supplemental non-GAAP financial measures internally to understand, manage and evaluate our business and make operating decisions.
These non-GAAP measures are among the primary factors management uses in planning for and forecasting future periods.
Compensation of our executives is based in part on the performance of our business based on these non-GAAP measures.
