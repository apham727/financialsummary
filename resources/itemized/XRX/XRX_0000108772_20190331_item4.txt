ITEM 4 — CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES


The Company’s management evaluated, with the participation of our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, or persons performing similar functions, the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as of the end of the period covered by this report.
Based on this evaluation, our principal executive officer and principal financial officer have concluded that, as of the end of the period covered by this report, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective to ensure that information we are required to disclose in the reports that we file or submit under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission’s rules and forms relating to Xerox Corporation, including our consolidated subsidiaries, and was accumulated and communicated to the Company’s management, including the principal executive officer and principal financial officer, or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.
As required by paragraph (d) of Rule 13a-15 under the Exchange Act, we evaluated changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the last fiscal quarter.
During the quarter ended March 31, 2019, we implemented certain internal controls in connection with our adoption of ASC Topic 842, Leases.
There were no other changes identified in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the last fiscal quarter that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
In March 2019, the Company entered into a shared services arrangement with HCL Technologies (HCL) pursuant to which we are outsourcing certain global administrative and support functions, including, among others, selected information technology, order to collection and finance functions (excluding accounting).
The transition of these functions to HCL is expected to take up to 18 months.
HCL is expected to make certain up-front and ongoing investments in software, tools and other technology to consolidate, optimize and automate the transferred functions.
This arrangement is not in response to any identified deficiency or weakness in the Company’s internal control over financial reporting.
In response to this arrangement, the Company has and will continue to align and streamline the design and operation of its financial control environment.
