1. Business Description, Basis of Presentation and Significant Accounting Policies 



Business Description: 



ClearOne, Inc., together with its subsidiaries (collectively, “ClearOne” or the “Company”), is a global market leader enabling conferencing, collaboration, and network streaming solutions. The performance and simplicity of our advanced, comprehensive solutions offer unprecedented levels of functionality, reliability and scalability. 



Basis of Presentation: 



The fiscal year for ClearOne is the 12 months ending on December 31. The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of ClearOne and its subsidiaries. All significant inter-company accounts and transactions have been eliminated. 



These accompanying interim unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared by the Company pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) and are not audited. Certain information and footnote disclosures that are usually included in financial statements prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (“GAAP”) have been either condensed or omitted in accordance with SEC rules and regulations. The accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements contain all adjustments, consisting of normal recurring accruals, necessary for a fair presentation of our financial position as of June 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017, the results of operations for the three and six months ended June 30, 2018 and 2017, and the cash flows for the six months ended June 30, 2018 and 2017. The results of operations for the three and six months ended June 30, 2018 and 2017 are not necessarily indicative of the results for a full-year period. These interim unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the financial statements included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2017 filed with the SEC. 



Significant Accounting Policies: 



The significant accounting policies were described in Note 1 to the audited consolidated financial statements included in the Company’s annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2017. There have been no changes to these policies during the six months ended June 30, 2018 that are of significance or potential significance to the Company except for the change in revenue recognition policy described below. 



Adoption of New Revenue Standard: On January 1, 2018, as required, the Company adopted ASU No. 2014-09 - Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606) (“ASU 2014-09”), ASU No. 2015-14 - Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Deferral of the Effective Date (“ASU 2015-14”), ASU No. 2016-08 - Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Principal versus Agent Considerations (“ASU 2016-08”), ASU No. 2016-10 - Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Identifying Performance Obligations and Licensing (“ASU 2016-10”), ASU No. 2016-12 - Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Narrow-Scope Improvements and Practical Expedients (“ASU 2016-12”) and ASU No. 2016-20 - Technical Corrections and Improvements to Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers” (“ASU 2016-20”) (collectively “the New Revenue Standard”). To conform to the New Revenue Standard, the Company modified its revenue recognition policy as described further below. 



Change in Accounting Policy: On January 1, 2018, the Company adopted the New Revenue Standard using the modified retrospective method, applying the guidance to all open contracts and recognized an adjustment to increase retained earnings by $2,783, reduce deferred product revenue by $4,338 and reduce distributor channel inventories by $1,555 as of that date. The comparative financial information has not been restated and continues to be presented under the accounting standards in effect for the respective periods. The Company applied the practical expedient and has not disclosed the revenue allocated to future shipments of partially completed contracts.

(Unaudited - Dollars in thousands, except per share amounts) 



Prior to our change in accounting policy, revenue from product sales to distributors was not recognized until the return privilege had expired or until it can be determined with reasonable certainty that the return privilege had expired, which approximated when the product was sold-through to customers of our distributors (dealers, system integrators, value-added resellers, and end-users), rather than when the product was initially shipped to a distributor. At each quarter-end, we evaluated the inventory in the distribution channel through information provided by our distributors. The level of inventory in the channel fluctuated up or down each quarter based upon our distributors’ individual operations. Accordingly, each quarter-end deferral of revenue and associated cost of goods sold were calculated and recorded based upon the actual channel inventory reported at quarter-end. Further, with respect to distributors and other channel partners not reporting the channel inventory, the revenue and associated cost of goods sold were deferred until we received payment for the product sales made to such distributors or channel partners. 



After the change in the accounting policy, substantially all of the Company’s revenue is recognized following the transfer of control of the products to the customer, which typically occurs upon shipment or delivery depending on the terms of the underlying contracts. During the three months ended June 30, 2018, revenue increased by $271 and during the six months ended June 30, 2018 revenue decreased by $581 due to the impact of the adoption of the New Revenue Standard. 



Revenue Recognition Policy: The Company generates revenue from sales of its audio and video conferencing equipment to distributors, system integrators and value-added resellers. The Company also generates revenue, to a much lesser extent, from sale of software and licenses to distributors, system integrators, value-added resellers and end-users. The Company recognizes revenue when it satisfies a performance obligation in an amount reflecting the consideration to which it expects to be entitled. For sales agreements, the Company has identified the promise to transfer products, each of which are distinct, to be the performance obligation. The Company applies a five-step approach in determining the amount and timing of revenue to be recognized: (1) identifying the contract with a customer, (2) identifying the performance obligations in the contract, (3) determining the transaction price, (4) allocating the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract and (5) recognizing revenue when the performance obligation is satisfied. Substantially all of the Company’s revenue is recognized at the time control of the products transfers to the customer. 



Sales agreements with customers are renewable periodically and contain terms and conditions with respect to payment, delivery, warranty and supply, but typically do not require mandatory purchase commitments. In the absence of a sales agreement, the Company’s standard terms and conditions at the time of acceptance of purchase orders apply. The Company considers the customer purchase orders, governed by sales agreements or the Company’s standard terms and conditions, to be the contract with the customer. The Company evaluates certain factors including the customer’s ability to pay (or credit risk). 



In determining the transaction price, the Company evaluates whether the price is subject to refund or adjustment to determine the net consideration to which the Company expects to be entitled. Sales to distributors, are typically made pursuant to agreements that provide return rights with respect to discontinued or slow-moving products, referred to as stock rotation. Sales to distributors can also be subject to price adjustment on certain products, primarily for distributors with drop-shipping rights. Although payment terms vary, most distributor agreements require payment within 45 days of invoicing. 



The Company recognizes revenue when it satisfies a performance obligation. The Company recognizes revenue from sales agreements upon transferring control of a product to the customer. This typically occurs when products are shipped or delivered, depending on the delivery terms, or when products that are consigned at customer locations are sold to dealers or end users. Revenue recognized during the three and six months ended June 30, 2018 for equipment sales was $6,803 and $13,900, respectively, and for software, licenses, etc. was $168 and $360, respectively. Sales returns and allowances are estimated based on historical experience. Provisions for discounts and rebates to customers, estimated returns and allowances, ship and credit claims and other adjustments are provided for in the same period the related revenues are recognized, and are netted against revenues. For returns, the Company recognizes a related asset for the right to recover returned products with a corresponding reduction to cost of goods sold. The Company reviews warranty and related claims activity and records provisions, as necessary. 



Frequently, the Company receives orders with multiple delivery dates that may extend across reporting periods. Since each delivery constitutes a performance obligation, the Company allocates the transaction price of the contract to each performance obligation based on the stand-alone selling price of the products. The Company invoices the customer for each delivery upon shipment and recognizes revenues in accordance with delivery terms. Although payment terms vary, distributors typically pay within 45 days of invoicing and dealers pay within 30 days of invoicing. As scheduled delivery dates are within one year, revenue allocated to future shipments of partially completed contracts are not disclosed.

The Company has elected to record freight and handling costs associated with outbound freight after control over a product has transferred to a customer as a fulfillment cost and include it in cost of revenues. Taxes assessed by government authorities on revenue-producing transactions, including value-added and excise taxes, are presented on a net basis (excluded from revenues) in the Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income.  



Recent Accounting Pronouncements: 



In February 2016, the FASB released ASU No. 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842) to bring transparency to lessee balance sheets. The ASU will require organizations that lease assets (lessees) to recognize assets and liabilities on the balance sheet for the rights and obligations created by all leases with terms of more than 12 months. The standard will apply to both types of leases-capital (or finance) leases and operating leases. Previously, GAAP has required only capital leases to be recognized on lessee balance sheets. The standard is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018 and interim periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018. Early application will be permitted for all organizations. The Company has not yet selected a transition method and is currently evaluating the effect that the updated standard will have on the consolidated financial statements. 



In August 2016, the FASB released ASU No. 2016-15, Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments, which addresses eight specific cash flow issues with the objective of reducing the existing diversity in practice. ASU 2016-15 became effective for the Company on January 1, 2018. ASU 2016-15 had no material impact on our consolidated financial statements. 



In May 2017, the FASB issued ASU No. 2017-09, Compensation-Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Scope of Modification Accounting. The new guidance provides clarity and reduces both (1) diversity in practice and (2) cost and complexity when applying the guidance in Topic 718, Compensation-Stock Compensation, to a change to the terms or conditions of a share-based payment award. The accounting standard update became effective for the Company on January 1, 2018. ASU 2017-09 did not have any material impact on our consolidated financial statements.

3. Earnings (Loss) Per Share 



Earnings (loss) per common share is computed based on the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding and, when appropriate, dilutive potential common stock outstanding during the period. Stock options are considered to be potential common stock. The computation of diluted earnings (loss) per share does not assume exercise or conversion of securities that would have an anti-dilutive effect.

Basic earnings (loss) per common share is the amount of net earnings (loss) for the period available to each weighted-average share of common stock outstanding during the reporting period. Diluted earnings (loss) per common share is the amount of earnings (loss) for the period available to each weighted-average share of common stock outstanding during the reporting period and to each share of potential common stock outstanding during the period, unless inclusion of potential common stock would have an anti-dilutive effect. 



The following table sets forth the computation of basic and diluted earnings (loss) per common share:

4. Marketable Securities 



The Company has classified its marketable securities as available-for-sale securities. These securities are carried at estimated fair value with unrealized holding gains and losses included in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) in stockholders’ equity until realized. Gains and losses on marketable security transactions are reported on the specific-identification method. Dividend and interest income are recognized when earned. 



The amortized cost, gross unrealized holding gains, gross unrealized holding losses, and fair value for available-for-sale securities by major security type and class of securities at June 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017 were as follows:

 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]  



Debt securities in an unrealized loss position as of June 30, 2018 were not deemed impaired at acquisition and subsequent declines in fair value are not deemed attributed to declines in credit quality. Management believes that it is more likely than not that the securities will receive a full recovery of par value, although there can be no assurance that such recovery will occur. The available-for-sale marketable securities with continuous gross unrealized loss position for less than 12 months and 12 months or greater and their related fair values were as follows:

Long-term inventory represents inventory held in excess of our current (next 12 months) requirements based on our recent sales and forecasted level of sales. We expect to sell the above inventory, net of reserves, at or above the stated cost and believe that no loss will be incurred on its sale, although there can be no assurance of the timing or amount of any sales. 



Current finished goods did not include distributor channel inventories in the amounts of approximately $1,555 as of December 31, 2017. Distributor channel inventories represented inventories at distributors and other customers where revenue recognition criteria had not yet been achieved. 



Net loss incurred on valuation of inventory at lower of cost or net realizable value and write-off of obsolete inventory during the three and six months ended June 30, 2018 was $170 and $425, respectively. During the three months and six months ended June 30, 2017 net loss incurred on valuation of inventory at lower of cost or net realizable value and write-off of obsolete inventory was $55 and $21, respectively.

8. Shareholders’ Equity 



Stock Repurchase Program 



On March 9, 2016, the Board of Directors of the Company authorized the repurchase of up to $10,000 of the Company’s outstanding shares of common stock under a stock repurchase program. In connection with the repurchase authorization, the Company was authorized to complete the repurchase through open market transactions or through an accelerated share repurchase program, in each case to be executed at management’s discretion based on business and market conditions, stock price, trading restrictions, acquisition activity and other factors. The transactions effectuated to date occurred in open market purchases. 



On March 1, 2017, the Board of Directors of the Company renewed and extended the repurchase program for up to an additional $10,000 of common stock over the next twelve months. In connection with the repurchase extension authorization, the Company was authorized to complete the repurchase through open market transactions or through an accelerated share repurchase program, in each case to be executed at management’s discretion based on business and market conditions, stock price, trading restrictions, acquisition activity and other factors. The transactions effectuated to date occurred in open market purchases.

Upon expiry of this repurchase program in March 2018, the program was not renewed again. 



Cash Dividends 



On February 21, 2018, the Company declared a cash dividend of $0.07 per share of ClearOne common stock. The dividend was paid on March 21, 2018 to shareholders of record as of March 7, 2018. On June 13, 2018, the Company announced the suspension of its dividend program.  



9. Fair Value Measurements 



The fair value of the Company’s financial instruments reflects the amounts that the Company estimates it will receive in connection with the sale of an asset or pay in connection with the transfer of a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date (exit price). The fair value hierarchy prioritizes the use of inputs used in valuation techniques into the following three levels: 



Level 1 - Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities. 



Level 2 - Observable inputs other than quoted prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities; quoted prices in markets that are not active; or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities. This category generally includes U.S. Government and agency securities; municipal securities; mutual funds and securities sold and not yet settled. 



Level 3 - Unobservable inputs. 



The substantial majority of the Company’s financial instruments are valued using observable inputs. The following table sets forth the fair value of the financial instruments re-measured by the Company as of June 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017: 



 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]  



 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]   



10. Income Taxes 



The Company’s forecasted effective tax benefit rate at June 30, 2018 is 26.8%, a 16% increase from the 10.8% effective tax rate recorded at December 31, 2017. The 16% increase is primarily due to the enactment in 2017 of the Tax Cuts and Jobs act, which resulted in a lower corporate tax rate and a revaluation of the Company's net deferred tax assets. The forecasted effective tax benefit rate of 26.8% excludes jurisdictions for which no benefit from forecasted current year losses is anticipated. Including losses from such jurisdictions results in a forecasted effective tax benefit rate of 26.0%. Our forecasted effective tax rate could fluctuate significantly on a quarterly basis and could change, to the extent that earnings in countries with tax rates that differ from that of the U.S. differ from amounts anticipated at June 30, 2018. 



After a discrete tax expense of $64, the effective tax benefit rate for the quarter ended June 30, 2018 is 24.9%. The discrete tax expense of $64 is primarily attributable to changes in income tax reserves related to an income tax audit in Hong Kong.
