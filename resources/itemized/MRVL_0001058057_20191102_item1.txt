NOTES TO UNAUDITED CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS



Note 1. Basis of Presentation



The unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements of Marvell Technology Group Ltd., a Bermuda exempted company, and its wholly owned subsidiaries (the “Company”), as of and for the three and nine months ended November 2, 2019, have been prepared as required by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”). Certain information and footnote disclosures normally included in financial statements prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“U.S. GAAP”) have been condensed or omitted as permitted by the SEC. These unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements and related notes should be read in conjunction with the Company's fiscal year 2019 audited financial statements included in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended February 2, 2019. In the opinion of management, the financial statements include all adjustments, including normal recurring adjustments and other adjustments, that are considered necessary for fair presentation of the Company’s financial position and results of operations. All inter-company accounts and transactions have been eliminated. Operating results for the periods presented herein are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for the entire year. Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform to current year presentation. These amounts were not material to any of the periods presented. These financial statements should also be read in conjunction with the Company’s critical accounting policies included in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended February 2, 2019 and those included in this Form 10-Q below.



The Company’s fiscal year is the 52- or 53-week period ending on the Saturday closest to January 31. Accordingly, every fifth or sixth fiscal year will have a 53-week period. The additional week in a 53-week year is added to the fourth quarter, making such quarter consist of 14 weeks. Fiscal 2019 had a 52-week year. Fiscal 2020 is a 52-week year.



On May 29, 2019, the Company announced its intent to sell its Wi-Fi connectivity business to NXP for $1.76 billion in cash. The divestiture encompasses the Company's Wi-Fi and bluetooth technology portfolios and related assets. The business employs approximately 550 people worldwide and generated approximately $300 million in revenue in the Company's fiscal 2019. This transaction is expected to close in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020. As of November 2, 2019, the Company classified assets held for sale of $600.9 million, which consisted of $30.1 million of inventory, $7.3 million of property, plant and equipment, $557.8 million of goodwill and $5.6 million of right-of-use lease asset. In addition, the Company classified liabilities held for sale of $5.6 million associated with lease and other liabilities in the unaudited condensed consolidated balance sheet. The purchase price will be subject to working capital and other customary adjustments which will be determined at close. 



 On September 19, 2019, the Company completed its acquisition of Aquantia Corp. (“Aquantia”). Aquantia is a manufacturer of high speed transceivers which includes copper and optical physical layer products. The unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements include the operating results of Aquantia for the period from the date of acquisition to the Company’s third quarter ended November 2, 2019. See “Note 4 - Business Combinations” for more information.



Subsequent to quarter end, on November 5, 2019, the Company acquired Avera Semiconductor (“Avera”), the Application Specific Integrated Circuit (“ASIC”) business of GlobalFoundries (“GlobalFoundries”) for $597.5 million in cash at closing. An additional $90 million in cash will be paid if certain conditions are satisfied within the next 15 months. Avera is a leading provider of Application Specific Integrated Circuit (ASIC) semiconductor solutions. The Company acquired Avera to expand its ASIC Design capabilities. The merger consideration was funded with new debt financing. See Note 8, “Debt” for additional information. The Company is evaluating the acquisition accounting. 



Note 2. Recent Accounting Pronouncements



Accounting Pronouncements Recently Adopted



In February 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued a new standard on the accounting for leases, which amends the existing guidance to require lessees to recognize assets and liabilities on the balance sheet for the rights and obligation created by long-term leases and to disclose additional quantitative and qualitative information about leasing arrangements. The Company adopted the new lease accounting standard on February 3, 2019, using the modified retrospective approach by applying the new standard to leases existing at the date of initial application and not restating comparative periods. See “Note 3 - Leases” for additional information.

MARVELL TECHNOLOGY GROUP LTD.



NOTES TO UNAUDITED CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ‑ (Continued)



Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet Effective



In June 2016, the FASB issued a new standard requiring financial assets measured at amortized cost be presented at the net amount expected to be collected, through an allowance for credit losses that is deducted from the amortized cost basis. The standard eliminates the threshold for initial recognition in current GAAP and reflects an entity’s current estimate of all expected credit losses. The measurement of expected credit losses is based on historical experience, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts that affect the collectability of the financial assets. The standard is effective for the Company beginning in the first quarter of fiscal year 2021. The Company does not expect the adoption of this guidance will have a material effect on its consolidated financial statements.



In August 2018, the FASB issued an accounting standards update to align the requirements for capitalizing implementation costs incurred in a software hosting arrangement that is a service contract and costs to develop or obtain internal-use software. The guidance is effective for the Company beginning in the first quarter of fiscal year 2021, with early adoption permitted. The Company does not expect the adoption of this guidance will have a material effect on its consolidated financial statements.



In August 2018, the FASB issued an accounting standards update that modifies the disclosure requirements on fair value measurements. The new guidance adds, modifies and removes certain fair value measurement disclosure requirements. The guidance is effective for the company beginning in the first quarter of fiscal year 2021, with early adoption permitted. The Company does not expect the adoption of this guidance will have a material effect on its consolidated financial statements. 



In November 2018, the FASB issued an accounting standards update that clarifies when transactions between participants in a collaborative arrangement are within the scope of the new revenue recognition standard that the Company adopted at the beginning of fiscal 2019. The guidance is effective for the Company beginning in the first quarter of fiscal year 2021, with early adoption permitted. The guidance is applied retrospectively as of the date of initial application of the revenue recognition standard. In addition, entities may elect to apply the guidance to all collaborative arrangements or only to collaborative arrangements that are not completed as of the date of initial application of the aforementioned revenue recognition standard. The Company does not expect the adoption of this guidance will have a material effect on its consolidated financial statements. 



Note 3. Leases



Effective February 3, 2019, the Company adopted the new lease accounting standard using the modified retrospective approach. The Company elected the package of practical expedients permitted under the transition guidance within the new standard, which among other things, allows the Company to carry forward the historical lease classification. The Company elected to apply the short-term lease measurement and recognition exemption in which right-of use assets (“ROU”) and lease liabilities are not recognized for short-term leases. Adoption of this standard resulted in the recording of net operating lease ROU assets and corresponding operating lease liabilities of $125 million and $149 million, respectively. The net ROU asset includes the effect of reclassifying a portion of facilities-related restructuring reserves as an offset in accordance with the transition guidance. The standard did not materially affect the condensed consolidated statements of operations and had no impact on cash flows. 



The Company determines if an arrangement is a lease at inception. Operating lease ROU assets and liabilities are recognized at commencement date based on the present value of lease payments over the lease term. Operating lease ROU assets also include any initial direct costs and prepayments less lease incentives. Lease terms may include options to extend or terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain that the Company will exercise such options. As the Company's leases generally do not provide an implicit rate, the Company uses its collateralized incremental borrowing rate based on the information available at the lease commencement date, including lease term, in determining the present value of lease payments. Lease expense for these leases is recognized on a straight line basis over the lease term. 



The Company's leases include facility leases and data center leases, which are all classified as operating leases. For data center leases, the Company elected the practical expedient to account for the lease and non-lease component as a single lease component.

Note 4. Business Combinations



Aquantia Corp.



On September 19, 2019, the Company completed the acquisition of Aquantia. Aquantia is a manufacturer of high speed transceivers which includes copper and optical physical layer products. In accordance with the terms of the Agreement and Plan of Merger dated May 6, 2019, by and among the Company and Aquantia (the “Aquantia merger agreement”), the Company acquired all outstanding shares of common stock of Aquantia (the “Aquantia shares”) for $13.25 per share in cash. The merger consideration was funded with a combination of cash on hand and funds from the Company's revolving line of credit (“Revolving Credit Facility”). See “Note 8 - Debt” for additional information.



The following table summarizes the total merger consideration (in thousands):



[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]



 The merger consideration allocation set forth herein is preliminary and may be revised with adjustment to goodwill as additional information becomes available during the measurement period of up to 12 months from the closing date of the acquisition to finalize such preliminary estimates. Any such revisions or changes may be material.



In accordance with US GAAP requirements for business combinations, the Company allocated the fair value of the purchase consideration to the tangible assets, liabilities and intangible assets acquired, including in-process research and development, or IPR&D, generally based on their estimated fair values. The excess purchase price over those fair values is recorded as goodwill. IPR&D is initially capitalized at fair value as an intangible asset with an indefinite life and assessed for impairment thereafter. When an IPR&D project is completed, the IPR&D is reclassified as an amortizable purchased intangible asset and amortized over the asset’s estimated useful life. The Company’s valuation assumptions of acquired assets and assumed liabilities require significant estimates, especially with respect to intangible assets. Acquisition-related costs are expensed in the periods in which such costs are incurred. See “Note 7 - Goodwill and Acquired Intangible Assets, Net” for additional information. 



The purchase price allocation is as follows (in thousands):

Share Repurchase Program 



On November 17, 2016, the Company announced that its Board of Directors authorized a $1.0 billion share repurchase program. On October 16, 2018, the Company announced that its Board of Directors authorized a $700 million addition to the balance of its existing share repurchase program. As of November 2, 2019, there was $890 million remaining available for future share repurchases. The Company intends to effect share repurchases in accordance with the conditions of Rule 10b-18 under the Exchange Act, but may also make repurchases in the open market outside of Rule 10b-18 or in privately negotiated transactions. The share repurchase program will be subject to market conditions and other factors, and does not obligate the Company to repurchase any dollar amount or number of its common shares and the repurchase program may be extended, modified, suspended or discontinued at any time. 



The Company repurchased 3.0 million of its common shares for $64.3 million during the nine months ended November 2, 2019. The Company repurchased 2.9 million of its common shares for $54.0 million during the nine months ended November 3, 2018. The Company records all repurchases, as well as investment purchases and sales, based on their trade date. The repurchased shares are retired immediately after repurchases are completed. 



Note 6. Fair Value Measurements



Fair value is an exit price representing the amount that would be received in the sale of an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants. As such, fair value is a market-based measurement that should be determined based on assumptions that market participants would use in pricing an asset or a liability. As a basis for considering such assumptions, the accounting guidance establishes a three-tier value hierarchy, which prioritizes the inputs used in the valuation methodologies in measuring fair value:



Level 1—Observable inputs that reflect quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in active markets.



15

MARVELL TECHNOLOGY GROUP LTD.



NOTES TO UNAUDITED CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ‑ (Continued)



Level 2—Other inputs that are directly or indirectly observable in the marketplace.



Level 3—Unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity.



The fair value hierarchy also requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value.



The Company’s Level 1 assets include institutional money-market funds that are classified as cash equivalents and which are valued primarily using quoted market prices. The Company’s Level 2 assets include time deposits, as the market inputs used to value these instruments consist of market yields. In addition, forward contracts and the severance pay fund are classified as Level 2 assets as the valuation inputs are based on quoted prices and market observable data of similar instruments. 



The tables below set forth, by level, the Company’s assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis. The tables do not include assets and liabilities that are measured at historical cost or any basis other than fair value (in thousands):



[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]



[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]



Fair Value of Debt



The Company classified the Term Loan, Revolving Credit Facility, the 2023 Notes and 2028 Notes under Level 2 of the fair value measurement hierarchy. The carrying value of both the Term Loan and the Revolving Credit Facility approximate their fair value as both were carried at a market observable interest rate that resets periodically. The estimated aggregate fair value of the 2023 Notes and 2028 Notes was $1.1 billion at November 2, 2019 and February 2, 2019, and were classified as Level 2 as there are quoted prices from less active markets for the notes.

Note 7. Goodwill and Acquired Intangible Assets, Net



Goodwill



Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of net tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired in a business combination. In connection with the May 2019 announcement for the divestiture of the Wi-Fi business, the Company reclassified $557.8 million of goodwill to assets held for sale. See “Note 1 - Basis of Presentation” for discussion of the Wi-Fi divestiture. In connection with the Aquantia acquisition on September 19, 2019, the Company recorded goodwill of $226.6 million. See “Note 4 - Business Combinations” for discussion on the Aquantia acquisition.



Acquired Intangible Assets, Net



 During the third quarter ended November 2, 2019, the Company acquired $193.0 million of intangible assets associated with the Aquantia acquisition. The valuation of these identifiable intangible assets and their estimated useful lives are as follows (in thousands, except for useful life):

MARVELL TECHNOLOGY GROUP LTD.



NOTES TO UNAUDITED CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ‑ (Continued)



The intangible assets are amortized on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives, except for certain customer contracts and related relationships, which are amortized using an accelerated method of amortization over the expected customer lives, which more accurately reflects the pattern of realization of economic benefits expected to be obtained. The IPR&D will be accounted for as an indefinite-lived intangible asset and will not be amortized until the underlying projects reach technological feasibility and commercial production at which point the IPR&D will be amortized over the estimated useful life. Useful lives for these IPR&D projects are expected to range between 4 to 10 years. In the event the IPR&D is abandoned the related assets will be written off. 



Amortization expense for acquired intangible assets for the three and nine months ended November 2, 2019 was $92.8 million and $253.5 million, respectively. Amortization expense for acquired intangible assets for the three and nine months ended November 3, 2018 was $78.7 million and $104.6 million respectively.



The following table presents the estimated future amortization expense of acquired amortizable intangible assets as of November 2, 2019 (in thousands):



[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]



Note 8. Debt 



In connection with the acquisition of Cavium (see “Note 4 - Business Combinations”), the Company executed debt agreements in June 2018 to obtain a $900 million term loan, a $500 million revolving credit facility and $1.0 billion of senior unsecured notes. Upon completion of the offering of the senior unsecured notes in June 2018, the Company terminated an $850 million bridge loan commitment. This bridge loan commitment was provided by the underwriting bankers at the time the Merger Agreement was executed in November 2017 and was never drawn upon. 



Term Loan and Revolving Credit Facility



On June 13, 2018, the Company entered into a credit agreement (“Credit Agreement”) with certain lenders. The Credit Agreement provides for borrowings of: (i) up to $500.0 million in the form of a Revolving Credit Facility and (ii) $900.0 million in the form of a term loan (“Term Loan”). The proceeds of the Term Loan were used to fund a portion of the cash consideration for the Cavium acquisition, repay Cavium’s debt, and pay transaction expenses in connection with the Cavium acquisition. The proceeds of the Revolving Credit Facility are intended for general corporate purposes of the Company and its subsidiaries, which may include, among other things, the financing of acquisitions, the refinancing of other indebtedness and the payment of transaction expenses related to the foregoing. On September 17, 2019, the Company drew down $350.0 million on its Revolving Credit Facility to fund a portion of the cash consideration for the Aquantia acquisition. Following is further detail of the terms of the various debt agreements.



The Term Loan has a three year term which matures on July 6, 2021 and has a stated floating interest rate which equates to reserve-adjusted London Interbank Offered Rate (“LIBOR”) + 137.5 bps. The effective interest rate for the Term Loan was 4.042% as of November 2, 2019. The Term Loan does not require any scheduled principal payments prior to final maturity but does permit the Company to make early principal payments without premium or penalty. The Revolving Credit Facility has a five year term and has a stated floating interest rate which equates to reserve-adjusted LIBOR + 150.0 bps. The effective interest rate for the Revolving Credit Facility was 3.39% as of November 2, 2019. As of November 2, 2019, $150 million of the $500.0 million of the Revolving Credit Facility was undrawn and will be available for draw down through June 13, 2023. An unused commitment fee is payable quarterly based on unused balances at a rate that is based on the ratings of the Company's senior unsecured long-term indebtedness. This rate was 0.175% at November 2, 2019. 



18

MARVELL TECHNOLOGY GROUP LTD.



NOTES TO UNAUDITED CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ‑ (Continued)



The Company currently carries debt that rely on the LIBOR as the benchmark rate. LIBOR is expected to be phased out as a benchmark rate by the end of 2021. The Company expects its debt to continue to use LIBOR until the rate is no longer available or a relevant governmental authority makes a public statement that LIBOR will no longer be available after a certain date. To the extent LIBOR ceases to exist, the Company will need to amend its credit agreements that utilize LIBOR as a factor in determining the interest rate. Currently, there is not a firm timeframe for this change. This update currently has no foreseeable impact on the Company's unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements; however, it may have an effect in the future.



The Credit Agreement requires that the Company and its subsidiaries comply, subject to certain exceptions, with covenants relating to customary matters such as creating or permitting certain liens, entering into sale and leaseback transactions, consolidating, merging, liquidating or dissolving, and entering into restrictive agreements. It also prohibits subsidiaries of the Company from incurring additional indebtedness, and requires the Company to comply with a leverage ratio financial covenant as of the end of any fiscal quarter. As of November 2, 2019, the Company was in compliance with all of its debt covenants. 



Senior Unsecured Notes



On June 22, 2018, the Company completed a public offering of (i) $500.0 million aggregate principal amount of the Company's 4.200% Senior Notes due 2023 (the “2023 Notes”) and (ii) $500.0 million aggregate principal amount of the Company's 4.875% Senior Notes due 2028 (the “2028 Notes” and, together with the 2023 Notes, the “Senior Notes”). 



The 2023 Notes mature on June 22, 2023 and the 2028 Notes mature on June 22, 2028. The stated and effective interest rates for the 2023 Notes are 4.200% and 2.600%, respectively. The stated and effective interest rates for the 2028 Notes are 4.875% and 3.307%, respectively. The Company may redeem the Senior Notes, in whole or in part, at any time prior to their maturity at the redemption prices set forth in Senior Notes. In addition, upon the occurrence of a change of control repurchase event (which involves the occurrence of both a change of control and a ratings event involving the Senior Notes being rated below investment grade), the Company will be required to make an offer to repurchase the Senior Notes at a price equal to 101% of the principal amount of the notes, plus accrued and unpaid interest to, but excluding, the repurchase date. The indenture governing the Senior Notes also contains certain limited covenants restricting the Company’s ability to incur certain liens, enter into certain sale and leaseback transactions and merge or consolidate with any other entity or convey, transfer or lease all or substantially all of the Company’s properties or assets to another person, which, in each case, are subject to certain qualifications and exceptions.

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]



Subsequent Events



Subsequent to quarter end, on November 4, 2019, the Company entered into a term credit agreement (“Term Credit Agreement”) with certain lenders. The Term Credit Agreement provides for borrowings of $600 million in the form of a bridge loan (“Bridge Loan”). The proceeds of the Bridge Loan were used to fund the purchase consideration for the Avera acquisition that closed on November 5, 2019. The Bridge Loan has a 90 day term which matures on February 3, 2020 and has a stated floating interest rate which equates to reserve-adjusted LIBOR + 90.0 bps. The Bridge Loan does not require any scheduled principal payments prior to final maturity but does permit the Company to make early principal payments without premium or penalty. 



Note 9. Restructuring and Other Related Charges



The Company continuously evaluates its existing operations to increase operational efficiency, decrease costs and increase profitability. The Company recorded restructuring and other related charges of $14.8 million and $37.1 million for the three and nine months ended November 2, 2019, respectively. The Company expects to complete these restructuring actions by the end of fiscal 2020.

Note 10. Commitments and Contingencies



Purchase Commitments



Under the Company’s manufacturing relationships with its foundry partners, cancellation of outstanding purchase orders is allowed but requires payment of all costs and expenses incurred through the date of cancellation. As of November 2, 2019, these foundries had incurred approximately $104.4 million of manufacturing costs and expenses relating to the Company’s outstanding purchase orders.



Contingencies and Legal Proceedings 



The Company may from time to time be a party to claims, lawsuits, governmental inquiries, inspections or investigations and other legal proceedings (collectively, “Legal Matters”) arising in the course of its business. Such Legal Matters, even if not meritorious, could result in the expenditure of significant financial and managerial resources. 



In 2015 the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) and Department of Justice commenced an investigation regarding disclosures relating to certain revenue recognized in the first and second quarters of fiscal 2016 and the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015, including transactions that would have, in the normal course of events and but for action by certain Marvell employees, been completed and recognized in a subsequent quarter (referred to internally as “pull-ins”). In the third quarter of fiscal 2020, the Company settled with the SEC without admitting or denying the findings of the SEC, by consenting to the entry of an administrative order requiring the Company to cease and desist from committing or causing any violations and any future violations of Section 17(a)(2) and 17(a)(3) of the Securities Act and Section 13(a) of the Exchange Act and Rules 13a-1, 13a-13, and 12b-20 thereunder. As part of the terms of the SEC settlement, the Company paid a total civil monetary penalty of $5.5 million. 



The Company is currently unable to predict the final outcome of its pending Legal Matters and therefore cannot determine the likelihood of loss or estimate a range of possible loss, except with respect to amounts where it has determined a loss is both probable and estimable and has made an accrual. The Company evaluates, at least on a quarterly basis, developments in its Legal Matters that could affect the amount of any accrual, as well as any developments that would result in a loss contingency to become both probable and reasonably estimable. The ultimate outcome of any Legal Matter involves judgments, estimates and inherent uncertainties. An unfavorable outcome in a Legal Matter, particularly in a patent dispute, could require the Company to pay damages or could prevent the Company from selling some of its products in certain jurisdictions. While the Company cannot predict with certainty the results of the Legal Matters in which it is currently involved, the Company does not expect that the ultimate costs to resolve these Legal Matters will individually or in the aggregate have a material adverse effect on its financial condition, however, there can be no assurance that the current or any future Legal Matters will be resolved in a manner that is not adverse to the Company’s business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.



Indemnities, Commitments and Guarantees



During its normal course of business, the Company has made certain indemnities, commitments and guarantees under which it may be required to make payments in relation to certain transactions. These indemnities may include indemnities for general commercial obligations, indemnities to various lessors in connection with facility leases for certain claims arising from such facility or lease, and indemnities to directors and officers of the Company to the maximum extent permitted under the laws of Bermuda. In addition, the Company has contractual commitments to various customers, which could require the Company to incur costs to repair an epidemic defect with respect to its products outside of the normal warranty period if such defect were to occur. The duration of these indemnities, commitments and guarantees varies, and in certain cases, is indefinite. Some of these indemnities, commitments and guarantees do not provide for any limitation of the maximum potential future payments that the Company could be obligated to make. In general, the Company does not record any liability for these indemnities, commitments and guarantees in the accompanying condensed consolidated balance sheets as the amounts cannot be reasonably estimated and are not considered probable. The Company does, however, accrue for losses for any known contingent liability, including those that may arise from indemnification provisions, when future payment is probable.

Intellectual Property Indemnification



In addition to the above indemnities, the Company has agreed to indemnify certain customers for claims made against the Company’s products where such claims allege infringement of third-party intellectual property rights, including, but not limited to, patents, registered trademarks, and/or copyrights. Under the aforementioned indemnification clauses, the Company may be obligated to defend the customer and pay for the damages awarded against the customer as well as the attorneys’ fees and costs under an infringement claim. The Company’s indemnification obligations generally do not expire after termination or expiration of the agreement containing the indemnification obligation. Generally, there are limits on and exceptions to the Company’s potential liability for indemnification. Although historically the Company has not made significant payments under these indemnification obligations, the Company cannot estimate the amount of potential future payments, if any, that it might be required to make as a result of these agreements. The maximum potential amount of any future payments that the Company could be required to make under these indemnification obligations could be significant.



Note 11. Revenue



The majority of the Company's revenue is generated from sales of the Company’s products. The following table summarizes net revenue disaggregated by product group (in thousands, except percentages):

Contract Liabilities



Contract liabilities consist of the Company’s obligation to transfer goods or services to a customer for which the Company has received consideration or the amount is due from the customer. As of November 2, 2019, contract liability balances are comprised of variable consideration estimated based on a portfolio basis using the expected value methodology based on analysis of historical data, current economic conditions, and contractual terms. Variable consideration estimates consist of the estimated returns, price discounts, price protection, rebates, and stock rotation programs. As of the end of a reporting period, some of the performance obligations associated with contracts will have been unsatisfied or only partially satisfied. In accordance with the practical expedients under U.S. GAAP, the Company does not disclose the value of unsatisfied performance obligations for contracts with an original expected duration of one year or less. Contract liabilities are included in accrued liabilities in the condensed consolidated balance sheets. 



The opening balance of contract liabilities at the beginning of the first quarter of fiscal year 2020 was $142.4 million. During the nine months ended November 2, 2019, contract liabilities increased by $496.1 million associated with variable consideration estimates, offset by $521.5 million decrease in such reserves primarily due to credit memos issued to customers. The ending balance of contract liabilities as of the third quarter of fiscal year 2020 was $117.0 million. The amount of revenue recognized during the nine months ended November 2, 2019 that was included in the contract liabilities balance at February 2, 2019 was not material. 



Sales Commissions 



The Company has elected to apply the practical expedient under U.S. GAAP to expense commissions when incurred as the amortization period is typically one year or less. These costs are recorded in selling, general and administrative expenses in the condensed consolidated statements of operations.

Note 12. Income Tax



The Company’s tax provision for interim periods is determined using an estimate of its annual effective tax rate, adjusted for discrete items, if any, that arise during the period. Each quarter, the Company updates its estimate of the annual effective tax rate, and if the estimated annual effective tax rate changes, the Company makes a cumulative adjustment in such period. The Company’s quarterly tax provision, and estimate of its annual effective tax rate, is subject to variation due to several factors, including variability in accurately predicting our pre-tax income or loss and the mix of jurisdictions to which they relate, intercompany transactions, the applicability of special tax regimes, changes in how we do business, and acquisitions, as well as the integration of such acquisitions. 



The Company’s estimated effective tax rate for the year differs from the U.S. statutory rate of 21% primarily due to a substantial portion of its earnings being taxed at rates lower than the U.S. statutory rate. The Company's effective tax rate was adversely affected by pre-tax losses in certain non-U.S. tax jurisdictions that are subject to tax rates that are lower than 21%. These losses reduce the Company's pre-tax income without a corresponding reduction in its tax expense, and therefore increase its effective tax rate. 



The income tax expense of $1.5 million for the three months ended November 2, 2019 included a tax benefit from a net reduction in unrecognized tax benefits of $1.1 million, offset by $1.5 million of expense related to other discrete items.



The income tax benefit of $1.7 million for the nine months ended November 2, 2019 included a tax benefit from a net reduction in unrecognized tax benefits of $13.7 million, offset by $9.9 million in tax due on amounts that were previously considered indefinitely reinvested.



The Company's gross unrecognized tax benefits were $161.5 million and $158.3 million on November 2, 2019 and February 2, 2019, respectively. The net increase to the Company's gross unrecognized tax benefits of $3.2 million is primarily the result of certain unrecognized tax benefits recorded in the Company's accounting for the acquisition of Aquantia. If the gross unrecognized tax benefits as of November 2, 2019 were realized in a subsequent period, the Company would record a tax benefit of $123.8 million within its provision of income taxes at such time. The amount of interest and penalties accrued as of November 2, 2019 and February 2, 2019 was $12.1 million and $15.1 million, respectively. 



It is reasonably possible that the amount of unrecognized tax benefits could increase or decrease significantly due to changes in tax law in various jurisdictions, new tax audits and changes in the U.S. dollar as compared to foreign currencies within the next 12 months. Excluding these factors, uncertain tax positions may decrease by as much as $10.6 million from the lapse of statutes of limitation in various jurisdictions during the next 12 months. Government tax authorities from several non-U.S. jurisdictions are also examining the Company’s tax returns. The Company believes that it has adequately provided for any reasonably foreseeable outcomes related to its tax audits and that any settlement will not have a material effect on its results at this time.



The Company operates under tax incentives in certain countries that may be extended if certain additional requirements are satisfied. The tax incentives are conditional upon meeting certain employment and investment thresholds. The impact of these tax incentives decreased foreign taxes by $1.0 million and $2.7 million, respectively for the three and nine months ended November 2, 2019, and $0.6 million and $1.7 million for the three and nine months ended November 3, 2018, respectively. The benefit of the tax incentives on net income per share was less than $0.01 per share for both the three and nine months ended November 2, 2019 and November 3, 2018.



The Company’s principal source of liquidity as of November 2, 2019 consisted of approximately $438 million of cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments, of which approximately $388 million was held by subsidiaries outside of Bermuda. The Company has not recognized a deferred tax liability on $168 million of these assets as those amounts are deemed to be indefinitely reinvested. The Company plans to use such amounts to fund various activities outside of Bermuda, including working capital requirements, capital expenditures for expansion, funding of future acquisitions or other financing activities.

Note 13. Net Income Per Share



The Company reports both basic net income per share, which is based on the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period, and diluted net income per share, which is based on the weighted average number of common shares outstanding and potentially dilutive shares outstanding during the period. 



The computations of basic and diluted net income per share are presented in the following table (in thousands, except per share amounts):



[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]



Potential dilutive securities include dilutive common shares from share-based awards attributable to the assumed exercise of stock options, restricted stock units and employee stock purchase plan shares using the treasury stock method. Under the treasury stock method, potential common shares outstanding are not included in the computation of diluted net income per share if their effect is anti-dilutive.



Anti-dilutive potential shares are presented in the following table (in thousands): 



[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]



Anti-dilutive potential shares from share-based awards are excluded from the calculation of diluted earnings per share for all periods reported above because either their exercise price exceeded the average market price during the period or the share-based awards were determined to be anti-dilutive based on applying the treasury stock method. Anti-dilutive potential shares are also excluded from the calculation of diluted earnings per share for the three and nine months ended November 2, 2019 and for the three months ended November 3, 2018 due to the net loss reported in those periods.
