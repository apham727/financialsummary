 Repurchase of Equity Securities  



 On April 24, 2018, the Company’s Board of Directors authorized a new stock repurchase program under which the Company may purchase up to $2.0 billion of the Company’s Common Stock during the three-year period ending April 24, 2021 in accordance with the requirements of Rule 10b-18 of the Exchange Act (the “2018 Stock Repurchase Program”). During the three months ended June 30, 2018, the Company repurchased 3.1 million shares of its common stock for $263.4 million under the 2018 Stock Repurchase Program. These treasury shares have been retired by the Company, accordingly common stock and retained earnings were reduced. From July 1, 2018 to July 27, 2018, the Company repurchased approximately 0.4 million additional shares of its common stock for $34.8 million, leaving approximately $1,701.8 million available to purchase under the 2018 Stock Repurchase Program. The price and timing of any future purchases under the 2018 Stock Repurchase Program will depend on factors such as levels of cash generation from operations, the volume of stock option exercises by employees, cash requirements for acquisitions, dividends, economic and market conditions and stock price.   



 The table below reflects the Company’s stock repurchases for the three months ended June 30, 2018:
