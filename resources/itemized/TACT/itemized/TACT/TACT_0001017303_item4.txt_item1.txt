Item 1A.
RISK FACTORS      

Information regarding risk factors appears under Part I, Item 1A, “Risk Factors,” of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended  December 31, 2018.
There have been no material changes from the risk factors previously disclosed in that Annual Report on Form 10-K, except as amended and supplemented by the additional risk factor below.
The risks described in our Annual Report on Form 10-K and the additional risk factor below are not the only risks facing our Company.
Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial also may materially adversely affect our business, financial condition or future results.
The United Kingdom’s anticipated withdrawal from the European Union may have a negative effect on global economic conditions, financial markets and our business.
In 2016, the United Kingdom voted to depart from the European Union, known as Brexit and subsequently notified the European Council of its intention to leave the E.U.
and began to negotiate the terms of the future relationship between the U.K. and the E.U.
upon exit.
We have taken certain actions in response to Brexit and in anticipation of E.U.
legal requirements and the U.K.’s separation from the E.U.
The potential impact from Brexit on us and on our results of operations is unclear.
The actual effects of Brexit will depend upon many factors, including the final results of the Brexit negotiations.
We do not, however, expect Brexit to have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations as 15% and 10% of our total revenues for the three and six months ended June 30, 2019, respectively, are attributable to our U.K. operations.
However, we cannot predict the direction Brexit-related matters may take or the impact on our European operations, including our U.K. subsidiary.
