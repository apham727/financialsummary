Critical Accounting Judgments and Estimates 

Our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements, which have been prepared by us in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.
The presentation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses, and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities.
Our estimates include those related to revenue recognition, inventory obsolescence, the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities, depreciable lives of equipment, warranty obligations, and contingent liabilities.
We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances.
For a complete description of our accounting policies, see Part II, Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates,” of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018.
We have reviewed those policies and determined that they remain our critical accounting policies for the three months ended March 31, 2019.
Net sales for the first quarter of 2019 decreased $0.7 million, or 6%, from the same period in 2018.
Printer, terminal and other hardware sales volume decreased 11% to approximately 28,000 units driven primarily by a 27% decrease in unit volume from the POS automation and banking market and a 5% decrease in unit volume in the casino and gaming market.
The average selling price of our printers, terminals and other hardware increased 4% for the first quarter of 2019 compared to the first quarter of 2018 due primarily to lower POS automation and banking sales, which sell at a lower price than our other products.
International sales for the first quarter of 2019 increased $0.5 million, or 23%, from the same period in 2018 primarily due to increased sales in the international casino and gaming market.
The decrease in domestic restaurant solutions revenue for the first quarter of 2019 compared to the first quarter of 2018 was driven largely by lower sales of our AccuDate 9700 terminal to our former U.S. distributor.

solution.
The decrease in domestic POS automation and banking product revenue for the first quarter of 2019 compared to the first quarter of 2018 was primarily driven by a 24% decrease in domestic sales of our Ithaca® 9000 printer, as sales to McDonald’s decreased for the first quarter of 2019 compared to the same period in 2018.
We expect sales of our Ithaca® 9000 to McDonald’s to decrease in 2019 compared to 2018.
The decrease in domestic sales of our casino and gaming products for the first quarter of 2019 compared to the first quarter of 2018 was due to an 83% decrease in domestic sales of our off-premise gaming printers to an OEM, which we do not expect to reoccur in 2019; a 7% decrease in domestic sales of our thermal casino printers driven primarily by industry-wide weakness resulting in lower sales to our OEMs; and an 81% decrease in domestic EPICENTRAL™ software sales, as we had no new installations during the first quarter of 2019 compared to one new installation in 2018.
Sales of EPICENTRALTM are project based and as a result, may fluctuate significantly quarter-to-quarter and year-to-year.
International casino and gaming product sales increased for the first quarter of 2019 compared to the first quarter of 2018 due to a 77% increase in sales of our thermal casino printers largely to customers in Asia.
This increase was partially offset by a 70% decline in international sales of our off-premise gaming printers to Europe, Australia and Asia.
Sales of our off-premise gaming printers are largely project-oriented and therefore may fluctuate significantly from quarter-to-quarter and year-to-year.
We expect domestic and international casino and gaming sales in 2019 to be relatively consistent with the sales levels achieved during 2018.
Our sales to IGT are directly dependent on the timing and number of new and upgraded lottery terminal installations that IGT performs, and as a result, may fluctuate significantly quarter-to-quarter and year-to-year.
Our sales to IGT are not indicative of IGT’s overall business or revenue.
We expect lottery printer sales to be lower for 2019 compared to 2018, as we have shifted our focus away from the lottery market to our higher value, technology-enabled restaurant solutions and casino and gaming products.
The increase in sales of Printrex printers for the first quarter of 2019 compared to the first quarter of 2018 resulted from higher domestic and international sales in the oil and gas market.
We expect total Printrex sales to increase slightly for 2019 compared to 2018, as we expect to benefit from a continued modest recovery in the oil and gas industry.
The increase in domestic revenue from TSG for the first quarter of 2019 as compared to the first quarter of 2018 was primarily due to an increase in label sales and increased service revenue related to our restaurant solutions products.
terminals.
Service revenue also increased 24% for the first quarter of 2019 compared to the first quarter of 2018.
Additionally, we had a 18% increase in sales of our legacy HP inkjet cartridges used in our banking printers.
We do not expect this trend to continue for HP inkjet cartridges as we exited the banking market at the end of 2018.
These increases were offset by a 31% decrease in sales of lottery printer spare parts to IGT.
Based on our backlog of orders and contractual commitments for replacement parts, primarily from IGT, for our installed base of lottery printers, we expect TSG sales to decrease in 2019 compared to 2018.
Internationally, TSG revenue increased for the first quarter of 2019 compared to the first quarter of 2018 primarily due to a 102% increase in sales of replacement parts and accessories to international casino and gaming customers.
Gross profit is measured as revenue less cost of sales, which includes primarily the cost of all raw materials and component parts, direct labor, manufacturing overhead expenses, cost of finished products purchased directly from our contract manufacturers and expenses associated with installations of our EPICENTRALTM print system.
For the first quarter of 2019, gross profit increased $224 thousand, or 4%, despite a sales decrease of 6% for the first quarter in 2019 compared to the first quarter of 2018.
Our gross margin increased 480 basis points, increasing to 52.7% for the first quarter of 2019 compared to 47.9% for the first quarter of 2018.
The increased gross margin reflects a favorable shift in sales mix towards higher-value, technology driven solutions, as well as lower sales of POS printers, which carry lower margins than our other products.
Engineering, design and product development expenses primarily includes salary and payroll related expenses for our hardware and software engineering staff, depreciation and design expenses (including prototype printer expenses, outside design, development and testing services, supplies and contract software development expenses).
Such expenses decreased $56 thousand, or 5%, for the first quarter of 2019 compared to the first quarter of 2018, primarily due to lower expenses related to product development for the restaurant solutions and casino and gaming markets.
We expect engineering, design and product development expenses in 2019 to be consistent with 2018.
Selling and marketing expenses primarily include salaries and payroll related expenses for our sales and marketing staff, sales commissions, travel expenses, expenses associated with the lease of sales offices, advertising, trade show expenses, e-commerce and other promotional marketing expenses.
Such expenses increased by $281 thousand, or 18%, for the first quarter of 2019 compared to the first quarter of 2018 primarily due to higher compensation expenses related to the hiring of additional outside and technical sales staff during the latter part of 2018 and first quarter of 2019.
software and hardware solutions.
General and administrative expenses primarily include salaries, incentive compensation, and other payroll related expenses for our executive, accounting, human resources and information technology staff, expenses for our corporate headquarters, professional and legal expenses, telecommunication expenses, and other expenses related to being a publicly-traded company.
General and administrative expenses increased $78 thousand, or 4%, for the first quarter of 2019 compared to the first quarter of 2018 due primarily to higher professional and legal expenses.
These increases were partially offset by lower recruiting expense and severance expense incurred during the first quarter of 2019 compared to the first quarter of 2018.
We expect general and administrative expense to be higher in 2019 compared to 2018 due to higher incentive compensation and additional investment to support restaurant solutions.
Our operating income decreased $79 thousand, or 9%, and our operating margin decreased slightly by 30 basis points for the first quarter of 2019 compared to the first quarter of 2018.
The decrease in both operating profit and operating margin were primarily due to a 6% increase in operating expenses, partially offset by a 480 basis point increase in gross margin, for the first quarter of 2019 compared to the first quarter of 2018.
Interest.
We recorded net interest expense of $6 thousand for the first quarter of 2019 compared to $8 thousand for the first quarter of 2018.
We do not expect significant changes in net interest expense for the full year 2019.
Other, net.
We recorded other income of $90 thousand for the first quarter of 2019 compared to $10 thousand for the first quarter of 2018.
The increase in other income was due to higher foreign currency exchange gains recorded by our U.K. subsidiary for the first quarter of 2019 compared to the first quarter of 2018.
Going forward, we may continue to experience more foreign exchange gains or losses depending on the level of sales to Europe through our U.K. subsidiary and the change in exchange rates of the Euro and Pound Sterling against the U.S. dollar.
Income Taxes.
We recorded an income tax provision for the first quarter of 2019 of $115 thousand at an effective tax rate of 13.4%, compared to an income tax provision during the first quarter of 2018 of $178 thousand at an effective tax rate of 20.7%.
The effective tax rate for the first quarter of 2019 was lower as it included the foreign-derived intangible income (“FDII”) deduction under the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the “Tax Reform Act”).
The FDII deduction was not included in the effective tax rate for the first quarter of 2018 as the interpretive guidance for the deduction was not yet released.
We expect our effective tax rate to be between 13% and 14% for the full year 2019.
Net Income.
We reported net income for the first quarter of 2019 of $746 thousand, or $0.10 per diluted share, compared to $680 thousand, or $0.09 per diluted share, for the first quarter of 2018.
Liquidity and Capital Resources 

Cash Flow 

For the first three months of 2019, our cash and cash equivalents balance decreased $2.7 million, or 59%, from December 31, 2018.
We ended the first quarter of 2019 with $1.9 million in cash and cash equivalents, of which $0.5 million was held by our U.K. subsidiary, and no debt outstanding.
●  We reported net income of $0.7 million.
●  We recorded depreciation and amortization of $0.3 million, and share-based compensation expense of $0.2 million.
●  Accounts receivable decreased $1.2 million, or 15%, due to the collection of receivables for 2018 sales.

hardware product for the restaurant solutions market.
●  Prepaid income taxes decreased $0.1 million during the first quarter of 2019.
●  Other current and long term assets increased $0.4 million, or 65%, due primarily to an advanced payment of royalty fees.

●  Accrued liabilities and other liabilities decreased $1 million, or 27%, due primarily to the payment of 2018 annual bonuses in March 2019.
●  We reported net income of $0.7 million.
●  We recorded depreciation and amortization of $0.2 million, and share-based compensation expense of $0.2 million.
●  Accounts receivable decreased $2.3 million, or 21%, due to the collection of past due receivables for 2017 sales made to our former international casino and gaming distributor.
●  Prepaid income taxes decreased $0.2 million during the first quarter of 2018.
●  Accounts payable decreased $0.7 million, or 19%, due primarily to higher inventory purchases made towards the end of the fourth quarter of 2017 compared to the first quarter of 2018 that were subsequently paid in the first quarter of 2018.
●  Accrued liabilities and other liabilities decreased $0.9 million, or 21%, due primarily to the payment of 2017 annual bonuses in March 2018.
Capital expenditures and capitalized software development costs for 2019 are expected to be approximately $1.3 million, primarily for software development for our new restaurant solutions BOHA!
products, new product tooling, new computer software and equipment purchases.
Credit Facility and Borrowings 

We maintain a credit facility (the "TD Bank Credit Facility") with TD Bank N.A.
On November 21, 2017, we signed an amendment to the TD Bank Credit Facility through November 28, 2022.
Borrowings under the revolving credit line bear a floating rate of interest at the prime rate minus one percent and are secured by a lien on all of our assets.
We also pay a fee of 0.125% on unused borrowings under the revolving credit line.
The amendment increased the amount of revolving credit loans we may use to fund future cash dividend payments or treasury share buybacks to $12.5 million from $10 million.
As of March 31, 2019, borrowings available under the TD Bank Credit facility were $20 million.
Shareholder Dividend Payments 

In 2012, our Board of Directors initiated a quarterly cash dividend program which is subject to the Board’s approval each quarter.
Our Board of Directors declared an increase to the quarterly cash dividend from $0.06 to $0.07 per share in May 2013, from $0.07 to $0.08 per share in May 2014, and from $0.08 to $0.09 per share in May 2017.
Dividends declared and paid on our common stock totaled $0.7 million or $0.09 per share in the first quarter of both 2019 and 2018.
On April 30, 2019 our Board of Directors approved the second quarter 2019 dividend in the amount of $0.09 per share payable on or about June 14, 2019 to common shareholders of record at the close of business on May 20, 2019.
We expect to pay approximately $2.7 million in cash dividends to our common shareholders during 2019.
Stock Repurchase Program 

On March 1, 2018, our Board of Directors approved a new stock repurchase program (the “2018 Stock Repurchase Program”).
Under the 2018 Stock Repurchase Program, we are authorized to repurchase up to $5 million of our outstanding shares of common stock from time to time in the open market at prevailing market prices based on market conditions, share price and other factors.
The 2018 Stock Repurchase Program expires on December 31, 2019, if we do not discontinue the repurchase program prior to such time.
We use the cost method to account for treasury stock purchases, under which the price paid for the stock is charged to the treasury stock account.
Repurchases of our common stock are accounted for as of the settlement date.
During the three months ended March 31, 2019, we repurchased no shares of our common stock.
During the three months ended March 31, 2018, we repurchased 122,780 shares of our common stock for approximately $1.6 million at an average price per share of $12.72.
Resource Sufficiency 

We believe that our cash and cash equivalents on hand, our expected cash flows generated from operating activities and borrowings available under our TD Bank Credit Facility will provide sufficient resources to meet our working capital needs, finance our capital expenditures and additions to capitalized software, and dividend payments, and meet our liquidity requirements through at least the next twelve months.
We have no material off-balance sheet arrangements as defined in Item 303(a)(4)(ii) of Regulation S-K.
