Critical Accounting Judgments and Estimates
Our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements, which have been prepared by us in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.
The presentation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses, and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities.
Our estimates include those related to revenue recognition, inventory obsolescence, the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities, depreciable lives of equipment, warranty obligations, and contingent liabilities.
We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances.
For a complete description of our accounting policies, see Item 7 - Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, “Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates,” included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2017.
We have reviewed those policies and determined that they remain our critical accounting policies for the nine months ended September 30, 2018.
Net sales for the third quarter of 2018 increased $314 thousand, or 2%, from the same period in 2017.
Printer and terminal sales volume increased 12% to approximately 42 thousand units for the third quarter of 2018, driven primarily by a 73% increase in unit volume from the casino and gaming market and, to a lesser extent, a 9% increase in unit volume from the POS automation and banking market.
These increases were partially offset by a 74% decline in unit volume from the lottery market and, to a lesser extent, a 41% decline in unit volume from the restaurant solutions market.
The average selling price of our printers and terminals increased 4% in the third quarter of 2018 compared to the third quarter of 2017 due primarily to lower lottery printer sales, which sell at a lower price than our other products.
International sales for the third quarter of 2018 increased $1.1 million, or 55%, from the same period in 2017 due primarily to a 58% increase in sales in the international casino and gaming market.
The decrease in domestic restaurant solutions terminal sales in the third quarter of 2018 compared to the third quarter of 2017 was driven by lower sales of our AccuDate 9700 terminal due to lower sales to McDonald's.
This decrease was partially offset by increased sales of our newer AccuDate XL2e terminal to three large corporate customers in support of large-scale, multi-quarter rollouts of the terminal.
Shipments of AccuDate XL2e terminals exceeded sales of AccuDate 9700 terminals for the second consecutive quarter in the third quarter of 2018.
We expect full year 2018 sales of our restaurant solutions terminals to be relatively consistent with full year 2017 sales.
The increase in domestic POS automation and banking product revenue from the third quarter of 2017 was driven by a 22% increase in sales of our Ithaca® 9000 printer, as sales to McDonald’s have returned to the near record levels experienced during 2017.
We expect this level of sales to McDonald’s to decrease during the fourth quarter of 2018.
This increase was partially offset by 81% lower domestic sales of our legacy banking and other POS printers for the third quarter of 2018 compared to the third quarter of 2017.
We expect sales of these legacy products to continue to decline during the remainder of 2018, as we expect to exit the banking market at the end of 2018 and have shifted our focus to our newer products.
International sales from our POS automation and banking products decreased during the third quarter of 2018 compared to the third quarter of 2017 due to lower sales of our Ithaca® 9000 printer to our Canadian distributor for McDonald’s.
The increase in domestic sales of our casino and gaming products was due to an 79% increase in domestic sales of our thermal casino printer sales in the third quarter of 2018 compared to the third quarter of 2017, driven primarily by a large order of replacement printers from a domestic casino operator, as well as increased sales to our OEMs.
Additionally, we experienced an increase in domestic sales of our off-premise gaming printers to an OEM based in the U.S. that we don’t expect to reoccur in the fourth quarter of 2018.
These increases were partially offset by lower sales of our EPICENTRAL™ software systems as no new installations were completed during the third quarter of 2018 compared to two installations completed during the third quarter of 2017.
Sales of EPICENTRAL™ are project based, and as a result, may fluctuate significantly quarter-to-quarter and year-to-year.
The increase in international sales of our casino and gaming products in the third quarter of 2018 compared to the third quarter of 2017 was due to a 76% increase in sales of our thermal casino printers.
These increases were due to the success of the transition away from using our previous exclusive worldwide distributor whose contract ended at the end of 2017 and included a large non-recurring order to an international OEM that we don’t expect to reoccur in the fourth quarter of 2018.
While we expect casino and gaming sales to increase in the fourth quarter of 2018 compared to the fourth quarter of 2017, we do not expect domestic and international sales of our thermal casino printers to continue at the level experienced during the third quarter of 2018 for the remainder of 2018, as the third quarter results included two large orders that we do not expect to reoccur in 2018.
Our sales to IGT are directly dependent on the timing and number of new and upgraded lottery terminal installations that IGT performs, and as a result, may fluctuate significantly quarter-to-quarter and year-to-year.
However, our lottery market sales are not indicative of IGT’s overall business or revenue.
We expect lottery printer sales to be lower for the full year 2018 compared to the full year 2017, as we have shifted our focus away from the lottery market to our higher-value, technology enabled restaurant solutions and casino and gaming products.
The increase in sales of Printrex printers in the third quarter of 2018 compared to third quarter of 2017 resulted from a 67% increase in domestic and international sales of our oil and gas printers.
This increase was partially offset by 97% lower domestic and international sales of our medical and mobile printers in the third quarter of 2018 compared to the third quarter of 2017.
We expect Printrex sales for the full year of 2018 to be higher than 2017, as we expect a continued modest recovery in the global oil and gas industry to more than offset lower expected sales of medical and mobile printers as we shift our focus to our higher value, technology-enabled restaurant solutions and casino and gaming products.
The decrease in domestic revenue from TSG for the third quarter of 2018 as compared to the prior year period was due primarily to decreased replacement part sales and non-Printrex consumable product sales.
Replacement part sales decreased 44% due to lower sales of lottery printer spare parts to IGT.
Non-Printrex consumables declined 15% due to lower sales of our legacy HP inkjet cartridges used in our banking printers, as we continue to deemphasize our sales of this commoditized consumable product and expect to exit the banking market at the end of 2018.
The decreases were partially offset by increased AccuDate label sales which quadrupled during the third quarter of 2018 compared to the third quarter of 2017.
Based on our backlog of orders and contractual commitments for replacement parts for our installed base of lottery printers, we expect TSG sales to decrease for the full year 2018 compared to the unusually high level of spare parts sales, largely from lottery printer spare part sales to IGT, during 2017.
Internationally, TSG revenue increased due to a 370% increase in sales of replacement parts and accessories in the third quarter of 2018 compared to the third quarter of 2017, as sales of replacement parts and accessories to international casino and gaming customers have increased upon the transition away from using our previous exclusive worldwide distributor and using our new direct sales team to sell to end user casino and gaming customers.
Gross profit is measured as revenue less cost of sales, which includes primarily the cost of all raw materials and component parts, direct labor, manufacturing overhead expenses, cost of finished products purchased directly from our contract manufacturers and expenses associated with installations of our EPICENTRAL™ print system.
In the third quarter of 2018, gross profit increased $485 thousand, or 7%, compared to the same period in 2017 and our gross margin improved by 210 basis points to 50.5% in the third quarter of 2018.
The increase in gross profit was driven by 2% higher sales and a favorable product sales mix in the third quarter of 2018 compared to the third quarter of 2017.
We expect our full year gross margin to be higher for 2018 compared to the full year 2017, as our sales mix shifts towards higher-value, technology driven solutions in the restaurant solutions and casino and gaming markets.
Engineering, design and product development expenses primarily include salary and payroll related expenses for our hardware and software engineering staff, depreciation and design expenses (including prototype printer expenses, outside design, development and testing services, and supplies).
Such expenses decreased $41 thousand, or 4% in the third quarter of 2018 compared to the third quarter of 2017 due primarily to lower contracted design expense to support new product development in the restaurant solutions market.
This decrease was partially offset by the hiring of additional engineering staff during 2018 to support new product developments in the restaurant solutions and casino and gaming markets.
We expect engineering, design and product development expenses to be higher for the full year 2018 compared to full year 2017, due to the expanded engineering staff to support new product development for the restaurant solutions market.
Selling and marketing expenses primarily include salaries and payroll related expenses for our sales and marketing staff, sales commissions, travel expenses, expenses associated with the lease of sales offices, advertising, trade show expenses, e-commerce and other promotional marketing expenses.
Such expenses decreased by $97 thousand, or 5%, in the third quarter of 2018 compared to the third quarter of 2017 due primarily to the retirement of our EVP, Sales and Marketing in December 2017, whose position was replaced by an existing employee of TransAct, as well as the elimination of sales commission expense to our former international casino and gaming distributor, Suzo-Happ.
These decreases were somewhat offset by the hiring of additional sales staff in the U.K. to support our new direct selling model for the casino and gaming market in Europe.
We expect selling and marketing expenses in 2018 to be relatively consistent with 2017, as increased costs related to the build-out of our internal sales infrastructure in Europe during 2018 will be offset by savings from the retirement of our former EVP, Sales and Marketing and the elimination of sales commissions to our former gaming international distributor.
General and administrative expenses primarily include salaries, incentive compensation, and other payroll related expenses for our executive, accounting, human resource and information technology staff, expenses for our corporate headquarters, professional and legal expenses, telecommunication expenses, and other expenses related to being a publicly-traded company.
General and administrative expenses remained consistent during the third quarter of 2018 compared to the third quarter of 2017 due to higher legal expenses being mostly offset by lower incentive compensation expenses incurred during 2018.
We expect general and administrative expenses to be higher in 2018 than 2017 due to recruiting expenses related to the expansion of our restaurant solutions sales staff, sales staff for our European casino and gaming market, and engineering staff.
Our operating income increased $621 thousand, or 24%, in the third quarter of 2018 compared to the third quarter of 2017, and our operating margin increased to 20.3% of net sales largely due to higher gross profit resulting from an 2% increase in sales and a 210 basis point improvement in gross margin, as well as proportionately lower operating expenses as a percentage of net sales, in the third quarter of 2018 compared to the prior year period.
Interest expense, net.
We recorded net interest expense of $7 thousand in the third quarter of 2018 compared to $9 thousand in the third quarter of 2017.
We do not expect significant changes in net interest expense for the remainder of 2018.
Other expense, net.
We recorded other expense of $50 thousand in the third quarter of 2018 compared to no other income or expense recorded in the third quarter of 2017 due to higher foreign exchange losses recorded by our U.K. entity in the third quarter of 2018.
Going forward we may continue to experience more foreign exchange volatility as we increase our casino and gaming sales in Europe.
Income Taxes.
We recorded an income tax provision for the third quarter of 2018 of $581 thousand at an effective tax rate of 18.4%, compared to an income tax provision during the third quarter of 2017 of $769 thousand at an effective tax rate of 29.8%.
The effective tax rate in the third quarter of 2018 was lower than the effective tax rate in the third quarter of 2017 due to the passage of the Tax Reform Act that was signed on December 22, 2017.
The legislation significantly changed U.S. tax law by, among other things, lowering corporate income tax rates, implementing a territorial tax system and imposing a one-time repatriation tax on undistributed foreign earnings.
The Tax Reform Act reduced the U.S. corporate income tax rate from a maximum of 35% to a flat 21% rate effective January 1, 2018 and, as a result, reduced our statutory U.S. corporate income tax rate from 34% to 21%.
We expect our effective tax rate to be between 19% and 20% for the full year 2018.
Net Income.
We reported net income for the third quarter of 2018 of $2.6 million, or $0.33 per diluted share, compared to $1.8 million, or $0.24 per diluted share, for the third quarter of 2017.
Net sales for the first nine months of 2018 decreased $285 thousand, or 1%, from the same period in 2017.
Printer sales volume decreased by 5% to approximately 112 thousand units in the first nine months of 2018 driven primarily by an 79% decrease in unit volume from the lottery market and, to a lesser extent, a 4% decrease in the POS automation and banking market.
These decreases were partially offset by an increase in sales volume of 50% in the casino and gaming market.
Although unit volume decreased in the first nine months of 2018 compared to the first nine months of 2017, the average selling price of our printers increased 9% during the first nine months of 2018 compared to the first nine months of 2017, due primarily to the decreased volume of lottery printers which carry lower prices than our other products.
International sales increased $2 million, or 31%, primarily driven by 63% higher international sales in the casino and gaming market.
This increase was partially offset by a $1.1 million sales decrease in our international lottery market during the first nine months of 2018 compared to the first nine months of 2017.
The increase in domestic restaurant solutions terminal sales in the first nine months of 2018 compared to the first nine months of 2017 was driven by increased sales of our AccuDate XL2e to three large corporate customers in support of a large-scale, multi-quarter rollouts of the terminal.
This increase was partially offset by lower sales of our AccuDate 9700 terminal to McDonald’s and our former U.S. distributor.
International restaurant solutions sales increased during the first nine months of 2018 compared to the first nine months of 2017 due to increased sales of the AccuDate 9700 for McDonald’s through our Asian distributor.
The decrease in domestic POS automation and banking sales in the first nine months of 2018 compared to the first nine months of 2017 was primarily driven by a 74% decrease in sales of our legacy banking and other POS printers as we continue to deemphasize these products.
These decreases were partially offset by a slight increase in sales of our Ithaca® 9000 printers of 1% during the first nine months of 2018 compared to the first nine months of 2017, as sales rebounded to prior year, near-record levels during the second and third quarters of 2018.
International POS automation and banking sales decreased due to lower sales of our Ithaca® 9000 printer to our Canadian distributor for McDonald’s during the first nine months of 2018 compared to the first nine months of 2017.
The increase in domestic sales of our casino and gaming products was due primarily to a 35% increase in domestic sales of our thermal casino printer in the first nine months of 2018 compared to the first nine months of 2017, driven primarily by increased sales to our OEMs and a large order from a domestic casino operator for replacement printers in the third quarter of 2018.
Domestic sales also increased due to a significant sale of our off-premise gaming printers to an OEM based in the U.S.
These increases were partially offset by lower domestic sales of EPICENTRAL™ software which decreased 41% as we completed one new installation during the first nine months of 2018 compared to two new installations completed in the first nine months of 2017.
Sales of EPICENTRAL™ are project based, and as a result, may fluctuate significantly quarter-to-quarter and year-to-year.
The increase in international sales in the first nine months of 2018 compared to the first nine months of 2017 was due to a 98% increase of thermal casino printer sales and, to a lesser extent, a 9% increase in international sales of off-premise gaming printers.
These increases were due to the success of the transition away from using our previous exclusive worldwide distributor and using our new direct sales team to sell to end user casino and gaming customers in Europe and included a large order to an international OEM in the third quarter of 2018.
Our sales to IGT are directly dependent on the timing and number of new and upgraded lottery terminal installations that IGT performs, and as a result, may fluctuate significantly quarter-to-quarter and year-to-year.
However, our lottery market sales are not indicative of IGT’s overall business or revenue.
The decrease in international lottery sales in the first nine months of 2018 compared to the first nine months of 2017 was primarily due to a sale of lottery printers to IGT for the Canadian lottery in the first nine months of 2017 and no comparable sale occurring in the first nine months of 2018.
The increase in Printrex sales in the first nine months of 2018 compared to the first nine months of 2017 resulted from a 73% increase in domestic and international sales of our oil and gas printers due to a continued recovery in the oil and gas market.
This increase was partially offset by 86% lower sales of domestic and international medical and mobile printers in the first nine months of 2018 compared to the first nine months of 2017 as we shift our focus away from the medical and mobile markets to our higher value, technology-enabled restaurant solutions and casino and gaming products.
The decrease in domestic revenue from TSG in the first nine months of 2018 as compared to the first nine months of 2017 was due primarily to lower sales of replacement parts, non-Printrex consumable products and service revenue.
Replacement part sales decreased 24% due to lower sales of lottery printer spare parts to IGT.
Non-Printrex consumables sales declined 13% due to lower sales of our legacy HP inkjet cartridges used in our banking printers, as we continue to deemphasize our sales of this commoditized consumable product and expect to exit the banking market at the end of 2018.
Service revenue declined 10% in the first nine months of 2018 compared to the same period in 2017 due to paper testing sales that occurred in the 2017 period but did not repeat in the 2018 period.
These decreases were partially offset by increased AccuDate label sales which more than quadrupled in the first nine months of 2018 compared to the first nine months of 2017.
Internationally, TSG revenue increased primarily due to a 124% increase in sales of replacement parts and accessories in the first nine months of 2018 compared to the first nine months of 2017, as sales of replacement parts and accessories to international casino and gaming customers have increased upon the transition away from using our previous exclusive worldwide distributor and using our new direct sales team to sell to end user casino and gaming customers.
Gross profit increased $815 thousand, or 4%, and gross margin increased 220 basis points due primarily to a more favorable sales mix in the first nine months of 2018 compared to the first nine months of 2017.
The increased gross margin reflects a favorable shift in sales mix towards higher-value, technology driven solutions, as well as lower sales volume of lottery and POS printers, which carry lower margins than our other products.
Engineering, design and product development expenses increased $350 thousand, or 11%, in the first nine months of 2018 compared to the first nine months of 2017 due primarily to the hiring of additional engineering staff and increased expenses related to product development for the restaurant solutions and casino and gaming markets.
Selling and marketing expenses decreased $151 thousand, or 3%, in the first nine months of 2018 compared to the first nine months of 2017 primarily due to the retirement of our EVP, Sales and Marketing in December 2017, whose position was replaced by an existing employee of TransAct, as well as the elimination of sales commission expense to our former international casino and gaming distributor, Suzo-Happ.
These decreases were partially offset by the hiring of additional sales staff to replace our former distributor with a direct selling team for our casino and gaming sales in Europe.
General and administrative expenses increased $243 thousand, or 4%, in the first nine months of 2018 compared to the first nine months of 2017 due primarily to increased legal expenses and increased administrative expenses related to the expansion of our restaurant solutions sales staff and transitioning to a direct selling model for the casino and gaming market in Europe.
These increases were partially offset by lower incentive compensation expense in the first nine months of 2018 compared to the first nine months of 2017.
Our operating income increased by $373 thousand, or 7%, during the first nine months of 2018 compared to the first nine months of 2017 primarily due to a 220 basis point increase in gross margin.
The increase in operating income from the improved gross margin was partially offset by a 3% increase in operating expense.
Interest expense, net.
We recorded net interest expense of $21 thousand in the first nine months of 2018 compared to $25 thousand in the first nine months of 2017.
Other expense, net.
We recorded other expense of $137 thousand in the first nine months of 2018 compared to $8 thousand in the first nine months of 2017 due to higher foreign exchange losses recorded by our U.K. entity in the first nine months of 2018 compared to the first nine months of 2017.
Income Taxes.
We recorded an income tax provision for the first nine months of 2018 of $1.1 million at an effective tax rate of 19.2%, compared to an income tax provision during the first nine months of 2017 of $1.7 million at an effective tax rate of 31.4%.
The effective tax rate in the nine months ended 2018 was lower than the effective tax rate in the nine months ended 2017 due to the passage of the Tax Reform Act that was signed on December 22, 2017.
Net Income.
We reported net income during the first nine months of 2018 of $4.5 million, or $0.57 per diluted share, compared to $3.6 million, or $0.48 per diluted share, for the first nine months of 2017.
Impact of Inflation.
We believe that inflation has not had a material impact on our results of operations for the nine months ended September 30, 2018 or 2017.
However, there can be no assurance that future inflation would not have an adverse impact upon our future operating results and financial condition.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
Cash Flow
  ●  We reported net income of $4.5 million.
  ●  We recorded depreciation and amortization of $739 thousand, and share-based compensation expense of $524 thousand.
  ●  Accounts receivable increased $782 thousand, or 7%, due to a large volume of sales made late in the third quarter of 2018 that we expect to collect during the fourth quarter of 2018.
  ●  Inventories increased $4.2 million, or 47%, due to the buildup of inventory on hand to support future anticipated sales in the casino and gaming and restaurant solutions markets.
  ●  Prepaid income taxes decreased $467 thousand during the first nine months of 2018.
  ●  Accounts payable increased $2.5 million, or 65%, due to increased inventory purchases made during the third quarter of 2018.
  ●  Accrued liabilities and other liabilities decreased $341 thousand, or 8%, due primarily to the payment of 2017 annual bonuses in March 2018, partially offset by increased deferred revenue.
  ●  We reported net income of $3.6 million
  ●  We recorded depreciation and amortization of $866 thousand, and share-based compensation expense of $484 thousand.
  ●  Accounts receivable increased $740 thousand, or 7%, due largely to a 14% increase in sales in the third quarter of 2017 compared to the fourth quarter of 2016.
  ●  Inventories decreased $1.5 million, or 16%, due to the sell through of inventory on hand to support sales in the third quarter of 2017.
  ●  Other current assets and long-term assets increased $435 thousand or 107%, due largely to prepaid engineering expenses related to the development of our restaurant solutions terminals and prepaid trade show costs for G2E, our largest trade show, held in October 2017.
  ●  Accounts payable decreased $1.9 million, or 40%, due primarily to increased inventory purchases towards the end of the fourth quarter of 2016 to support anticipated sales of our restaurant solutions terminals and subsequently paid in the first nine months of 2017.
  ●  Accrued liabilities and other liabilities increased $355 thousand, or 14%, due primarily to an increase in our income tax payable balance and accrued incentive compensation.
Capital expenditures and capitalized software development costs for the full year 2018 are expected to be approximately $1.5 million primarily for new product tooling and tooling enhancements for our existing products, new computer software and equipment purchases, leasehold improvements at our Las Vegas and UK facilities, as well as capitalized software development costs related to our restaurant solutions products.
Credit Facility and Borrowings
We maintain a credit facility (the "TD Bank Credit Facility") with TD Bank N.A., which provides for a $20 million revolving credit line.
On November 21, 2017, we signed an amendment to the TD Bank Credit Facility through November 28, 2022.
Borrowings under the revolving credit line bear a floating rate of interest at the prime rate minus one percent and are secured by a lien on all of our assets.
We also pay a fee of 0.125% on unused borrowings under the revolving credit line.
The amendment increased the amount of revolving credit loans we may use to fund future cash dividend payments or treasury share buybacks to $12.5 million from $10 million.
As of September 30, 2018, borrowings available under the TD Bank Credit facility were $20 million.
Shareholder Dividend Payments
In 2012, our Board of Directors initiated a quarterly cash dividend program which is subject to the Board’s approval each quarter.
Our Board of Directors declared an increase to the quarterly cash dividend from $0.06 to $0.07 per share in May 2013, from $0.07 to $0.08 per share in May 2014, and from $0.08 to $0.09 per share in May 2017.
Dividends declared and paid on our common stock totaled $665 thousand, or $0.09 per share in the third quarter of 2018 and $661 thousand in the third quarter of 2017.
We expect to pay approximately $2.7 million in cash dividends to our common shareholders during the full year 2018.
For the nine months ended September 30, 2018 and 2017, dividends declared and paid totaled $2.0 million, or $0.27 per share and $1.9 million, or $0.26 per share, respectively.
Stock Repurchase Program
On March 1, 2018, our Board of Directors approved a new stock repurchase program (the "2018 Stock Repurchase Program").
Under the 2018 Stock Repurchase Program, we are authorized to repurchase up to $5 million of our outstanding shares of common stock from time to time in the open market at prevailing market prices based on market conditions, share price and other factors.
The 2018 Stock Repurchase Program expires on December 31, 2019, if we do not discontinue the repurchase program prior to such time.
We use the cost method to account for treasury stock purchases, under which the price paid for the stock is charged to the treasury stock account.
Repurchases of our common stock are accounted for as of the settlement date.
During the nine months ended September 30, 2018, we repurchased 156,410 shares of our common stock for approximately $2.0 million at an average price per share of $12.78.
During the nine months ended September 30, 2107, we purchased 36,465 shares of our common stock for $358 thousand at an average price per share of $9.84.
Resource Sufficiency
We believe that our cash and cash equivalents on hand, our expected cash flows generated from operating activities and borrowings available under our TD Bank Credit Facility will provide sufficient resources to meet our working capital needs, finance our capital expenditures and dividend payments and meet our liquidity requirements through at least the next twelve months.
The disclosure of payments we have committed to make under our contractual obligations is set forth under the heading "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Contractual Obligations" in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2017.
There have been no material changes in our contractual obligations outside the ordinary course of business since December 31, 2017.
We have no material off-balance sheet arrangements as defined in Item 303(a)(4)(ii) of Regulation S-K.
