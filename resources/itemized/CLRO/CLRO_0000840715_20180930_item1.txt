1. Business Description, Basis of Presentation and Significant Accounting Policies
ClearOne, Inc., together with its subsidiaries (collectively, “ClearOne” or the “Company”), is a global market leader enabling conferencing, collaboration, and network streaming solutions.
The performance and simplicity of our advanced, comprehensive solutions offer unprecedented levels of functionality, reliability and scalability.
The fiscal year for ClearOne is the 12 months ending on December 31.
The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of ClearOne and its subsidiaries.
All significant inter-company accounts and transactions have been eliminated.
These accompanying interim unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared by the Company pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) and are not audited.
Certain information and footnote disclosures that are usually included in financial statements prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (“GAAP”) have been either condensed or omitted in accordance with SEC rules and regulations.
The accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements contain all adjustments, consisting of normal recurring accruals, necessary for a fair presentation of our financial position as of September 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017, the results of operations for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2018 and 2017, and the cash flows for the nine months ended September 30, 2018 and 2017.
The results of operations for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2018 and 2017 are not necessarily indicative of the results for a full-year period.
These interim unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the financial statements included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2017 filed with the SEC.
The significant accounting policies were described in Note 1 to the audited consolidated financial statements included in the Company’s annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2017.
There have been no changes to these policies during the nine months ended September 30, 2018 that are of significance or potential significance to the Company except for the change in revenue recognition policy described below.
Prior to our change in accounting policy, revenue from product sales to distributors was not recognized until the return privilege had expired or until it can be determined with reasonable certainty that the return privilege had expired, which approximated when the product was sold-through to customers of our distributors (dealers, system integrators, value-added resellers, and end-users), rather than when the product was initially shipped to a distributor.
At each quarter-end, we evaluated the inventory in the distribution channel through information provided by our distributors.
The level of inventory in the channel fluctuated up or down each quarter based upon our distributors’ individual operations.
Accordingly, each quarter-end deferral of revenue and associated cost of goods sold were calculated and recorded based upon the actual channel inventory reported at quarter-end.
Further, with respect to distributors and other channel partners not reporting the channel inventory, the revenue and associated cost of goods sold were deferred until we received payment for the product sales made to such distributors or channel partners.

NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
After the change in the accounting policy, substantially all of the Company’s revenue is recognized following the transfer of control of the products to the customer, which typically occurs upon shipment or delivery depending on the terms of the underlying contracts.
During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2018, revenue decreased by $784 and $1,365, respectively due to the impact of the adoption of the New Revenue Standard.
Sales agreements with customers are renewable periodically and contain terms and conditions with respect to payment, delivery, warranty and supply, but typically do not require mandatory purchase commitments.
In the absence of a sales agreement, the Company’s standard terms and conditions at the time of acceptance of purchase orders apply.
The Company considers the customer purchase orders, governed by sales agreements or the Company’s standard terms and conditions, to be the contract with the customer.
The Company evaluates certain factors including the customer’s ability to pay (or credit risk).
In determining the transaction price, the Company evaluates whether the price is subject to refund or adjustment to determine the net consideration to which the Company expects to be entitled.
Sales to distributors, are typically made pursuant to agreements that provide return rights with respect to discontinued or slow-moving products, referred to as stock rotation.
Sales to distributors can also be subject to price adjustment on certain products, primarily for distributors with drop-shipping rights.
Although payment terms vary, most distributor agreements require payment within 45 days of invoicing.
The Company recognizes revenue when it satisfies a performance obligation.
The Company recognizes revenue from sales agreements upon transferring control of a product to the customer.
This typically occurs when products are shipped or delivered, depending on the delivery terms, or when products that are consigned at customer locations are sold to dealers or end users.
Revenue recognized during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2018 for equipment sales was $6,524 and $20,396, respectively and for software, licenses, etc.
was $159 and $547, respectively.
Sales returns and allowances are estimated based on historical experience.
Provisions for discounts and rebates to customers, estimated returns and allowances, ship and credit claims and other adjustments are provided for in the same period the related revenues are recognized, and are netted against revenues.
For returns, the Company recognizes a related asset for the right to recover returned products with a corresponding reduction to cost of goods sold.
The Company reviews warranty and related claims activity and records provisions, as necessary.
Frequently, the Company receives orders with multiple delivery dates that may extend across reporting periods.
Since each delivery constitutes a performance obligation, the Company allocates the transaction price of the contract to each performance obligation based on the stand-alone selling price of the products.
The Company invoices the customer for each delivery upon shipment and recognizes revenues in accordance with delivery terms.
Although payment terms vary, distributors typically pay within 45 days of invoicing and dealers pay within 30 days of invoicing.
As scheduled delivery dates are within one year, revenue allocated to future shipments of partially completed contracts are not disclosed.
The Company has elected to record freight and handling costs associated with outbound freight after control over a product has transferred to a customer as a fulfillment cost and include it in cost of revenues.
Taxes assessed by government authorities on revenue-producing transactions, including value-added and excise taxes, are presented on a net basis (excluded from revenues) in the Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income.

In February 2016, the FASB released ASU No.
2016-02, Leases (Topic 842) to bring transparency to lessee balance sheets.
The ASU will require organizations that lease assets (lessees) to recognize assets and liabilities on the balance sheet for the rights and obligations created by all leases with terms of more than 12 months.
The standard will apply to both types of leases-capital (or finance) leases and operating leases.
Previously, GAAP has required only capital leases to be recognized on lessee balance sheets.
The standard is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018 and interim periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018.
Early application will be permitted for all organizations.
The Company has not yet selected a transition method and is currently evaluating the effect that the updated standard will have on the consolidated financial statements.
In August 2016, the FASB released ASU No.
2016-15, Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments, which addresses eight specific cash flow issues with the objective of reducing the existing diversity in practice.

Earnings (Loss) Per Share
Earnings (loss) per common share is computed based on the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding and, when appropriate, dilutive potential common stock outstanding during the period.
Stock options are considered to be potential common stock.
The computation of diluted earnings (loss) per share does not assume exercise or conversion of securities that would have an anti-dilutive effect.
Basic earnings (loss) per common share is the amount of net earnings (loss) for the period available to each weighted-average share of common stock outstanding during the reporting period.
Diluted earnings (loss) per common share is the amount of earnings (loss) for the period available to each weighted-average share of common stock outstanding during the reporting period and to each share of potential common stock outstanding during the period, unless inclusion of potential common stock would have an anti-dilutive effect.

Fair Value Measurements
Level 1 - Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities.
Level 2 - Observable inputs other than quoted prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities; quoted prices in markets that are not active; or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities.
This category generally includes U.S. Government and agency securities; municipal securities; mutual funds and securities sold and not yet settled.
Level 3 - Unobservable inputs.
● sufficient taxable income within the allowed carryback or carryforward periods;
● future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences, including any tax planning strategies that could be utilized;
● nature or character (e.g., ordinary vs. capital) of the deferred tax assets and liabilities; and
● future taxable income exclusive of reversing temporary differences and carryforwards.
Based on the foregoing criteria, the Company determined that it no longer meets the “more likely than not” threshold that net operating losses, tax credits and other deferred tax assets will be realized.
Accordingly, the Company recorded a full valuation allowance at September 30, 2018.
The Company’s forecasted effective tax benefit rate at September 30, 2018 is 0%, as compared to the 10.8% effective tax rate recorded at December 31, 2017.
The 10.8% decrease is primarily due to not recognizing benefit in 2018-Q3 for pre-tax losses and credits, as a result of the Company’s full valuation allowance on net deferred tax assets.
The Company recorded discrete tax expense of $6.5M in 2018-Q3, due primarily to the recording of a full valuation allowance on the Company’s net deferred tax assets.

Item 1.
LEGAL PROCEEDINGS
Our stock price may in the future not meet the minimum bid price for continued listing on the Nasdaq Capital Market.
Our ability to publicly or privately sell equity securities and the liquidity of our common stock could be adversely affected if we are delisted from The Nasdaq Capital Market.
Nasdaq Listing Rule 5450(a)(1) provides that the closing bid price for our common stock may not be below $1.00 per share for any period of 30 consecutive trading days to maintain our continued listing on The Nasdaq Capital Market (“Minimum Bid Price Rule”).
Although we are currently in compliance with the Minimum Bid Price Rule, there can be no assurance that our common stock will continue to satisfy this rule.
If we were to fail to comply with the Minimum Bid Price Rule in the future and became subject to delisting, such delisting from Nasdaq would adversely affect our ability to raise additional financing through the public or private sale of equity securities, would significantly affect the ability of investors to trade our securities and would negatively affect the value and liquidity of our common stock.
Delisting also could have other negative results, including the potential loss of confidence by employees, the loss of institutional investor interest and fewer business development opportunities.
There have been no material developments in the legal proceedings described in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2017.
