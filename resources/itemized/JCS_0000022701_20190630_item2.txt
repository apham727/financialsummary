 Forward-looking statements 



In this report and, from time to time, in reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”), in press releases, and in other communications to shareholders or the investing public, the Company may make “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. We may make these forward-looking statements concerning possible or anticipated future financial performance, business activities, plans, pending claims, investigations or litigation, which are typically preceded by the words “believes,” “expects,” “anticipates,” “intends” or similar expressions. For these forward-looking statements, the Company claims the protection of the safe harbor for forward-looking statements contained in federal securities laws. Shareholders and the investing public should understand that these forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual performance, activities, anticipated results, outcomes or plans to differ significantly from those indicated in the forward-looking statements. These risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to: 



24 



General Risks and Uncertainties: 



 ●The ability of the Company’s four operating units to each function in an efficient and cost-effective manner, under the oversight of the CSI parent; 



 ●The ability of our four business units to operate profitably; 



 ●The ability of the Special Committee of the Board of Directors to develop strategic options for the Company and the Company’s ability to implement these strategies; 



 ●The impact of changing government expenditures in our markets; 



 ●The fact that the sale of the Company’s Minnetonka headquarters is subject to contingencies, some of which are beyond the Company’s control; and 



 ●The fact that our information technology systems may be exposed to various cybersecurity risks and other disruptions that could impair our ability to operate. 



Transition Networks Risks and Uncertainties: 



 ●The ability of Transition Networks to develop and sell new products for new and existing markets at a level adequate to counter the decline in sales of its traditional products; 



 ●Transition Networks’ ability to manufacture and deliver its POE+ (Power-over-Ethernet) switches in a timely manner to meet its 2019 obligations under a contract, through a distributor, with a major metropolitan DOT agency; 



 ●Transition Networks’ reliance on contract manufacturers and OEMs to supply it with components and products in a timely manner as Transition Networks develops and introduces new products; and 



 ●Transition Networks’ ability to manage its inventory of components and finished products is complex and complicated by its need to maintain a significant inventory of components that (i) are in short supply, (ii) have been discontinued by the component manufacturer, (iii) must be purchased in bulk to obtain favorable pricing, or (iv) require long lead times. These factors may result in Transition Networks purchasing and maintaining significant amounts of inventory, that if not used or expected to be used based on anticipated production requirements, (i) may become excess or obsolete and (ii) could result in sales price reductions or inventory write-downs that could adversely affect Transition Networks’ business and results of operations. 



Suttle Risks and Uncertainties: 



 ●Suttle’s dependence upon its sales to a small number of major communication service providers and these providers’ continued investment and deployment into building and maintaining their networks; 



 ●Volatility in purchases of Suttle’s products by major communication service providers as well as continuing pricing pressure that adversely affects Suttle’s margins; 



25 



 ●Suttle’s ability to develop and sell new product solutions for “Suttle Home, Securely Wired” applications to offset declining sales and lower or fluctuating gross margins in its legacy products; 



 ●Suttle’s ability to perform its obligations under a Transition Services Agreement under which Suttle agreed to manufacture products related to the FutureLinkTM Fiber business line until September 30, 2019, to ensure seamless supply to the customer base. 



 ●Suttle’s ability to utilize its production capacity profitably; and 



 ●The fact that following the April 2019 sale of its FutureLink business, the Company expects Suttle’s sales and operating income to continue decline and that the Company is exploring options for the remainder of this business. 



JDL Technologies Risks and Uncertainties: 



 ●JDL’s ability to continue to obtain and manage the historically fluctuating business from its traditional South Florida school district customer in light of continuing delays in the government funding of this customer and JDL’s ability to expand to other educational prospects; 



 ●JDL’s ability to profitably increase its business serving small and medium-sized commercial businesses; and 



 ●JDL’s ability to establish and maintain a productive and efficient workforce. 



Net2Edge’s Risks and Uncertainties: 



 ●Net2Edge’s ability to develop, field test, manufacture and sell new products in sufficient quantities to achieve profitability; and 



 ●Net2Edge’s ability to sustain meaningful product differentiation and achieve substantial gross margins. 



The Company discusses these and other risk factors from time to time in its filings with the SEC, including risk factors presented under Item 1A of the Company’s most recently filed Annual Report on Form 10-K and Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q.

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 



Sales in North America increased $1,602,000, or 25%, primarily due to more typical buying patterns as compared to 2018, where we experienced slow demand from a carrier customer and disruptions in our product supply.

Sales of Ethernet switches and adapters increased 18% or $745,000 due to strong demand for new products in North America.

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Critical Accounting Policies 



Our critical accounting policies, including the assumptions and judgments underlying them, are discussed in our 2018 Form 10-K in Note 1 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies included in our Consolidated Financial Statements. In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02, “Leases” (Topic 842), which amends existing guidance and requires an entity to recognize both assets and liabilities arising from financing and operating leases, along with additional qualitative and quantitative disclosures. The new standard is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within that reporting period, and early adoption is permitted. The Company adopted the accounting standard effective January 1, 2019. Please see Note 3 for the required disclosures related to the impact of adopting this standard. There were no other significant changes to our critical accounting policies during the six months ended June 30, 2019. 



The Company’s accounting policies have been consistently applied in all material respects and disclose matters such as allowance for doubtful accounts, sales returns, inventory valuation, warranty expense, income taxes, revenue recognition, asset impairment recognition and foreign currency translation. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates based on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the result of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Results may differ from these estimates due to actual outcomes being different from those on which we based our assumptions. Management reviews these estimates and judgments on an ongoing basis. 



Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements 



Recently issued accounting standards and their estimated effect on the Company’s condensed consolidated financial statements are also described in Note 17, Recent Accounting Pronouncements, to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements.
