Overview



CDW Corporation is a Fortune 500 company and a leading provider of integrated information technology ("IT") solutions to small, medium and large business, and government, education and healthcare customers in the US, the UK and Canada. Our broad array of offerings ranges from discrete hardware and software products to integrated IT solutions such as mobility, security, data center optimization, cloud computing, virtualization and collaboration.



We are technology "agnostic," with a broad portfolio including more than 100,000 products and services from more than 1,000 leading and emerging brands. Our solutions are delivered in physical, virtual and cloud-based environments through over 6,000 customer-facing coworkers, including sellers, highly-skilled technology specialists and advanced service delivery engineers. We are a leading sales channel partner for many original equipment manufacturers ("OEMs"), software publishers and cloud providers (collectively, our "vendor partners"), whose products we sell or include in the solutions we offer. We provide our vendor partners with a cost-effective way to reach customers and deliver a consistent brand experience through our established end-market coverage, technical expertise and extensive customer access.



We have three reportable segments, Corporate, Small Business and Public. Our Corporate segment primarily serves US private sector business customers with more than 250 employees. Our Small Business segment primarily serves US private sector business customers with up to 250 employees. Our Public segment is comprised of government agencies and education and healthcare institutions in the US. We also have two other operating segments: CDW UK and CDW Canada, each of which do not meet the reportable segment quantitative thresholds and, accordingly, are included in an all other category ("Other").



We may sell all or only select products that our vendor partners offer. Each vendor partner agreement provides for specific terms and conditions, which may include one or more of the following: product return privileges, price protection policies, purchase discounts and vendor incentive programs, such as purchase or sales rebates and cooperative advertising reimbursements. We also resell software for major software publishers. Our agreements with software publishers allow the end-user customer to acquire software or licensed products and services. In addition to helping our customers determine the best software solutions for their needs, we help them manage their software agreements, including warranties and renewals. A significant portion of our advertising and marketing expenses are reimbursed through cooperative advertising programs with our vendor partners. These programs are at the discretion of our vendor partners and are typically tied to sales or other commitments to be met by us within a specified period of time.



Trends and Key Factors Affecting our Financial Performance



We believe the following key factors may have a meaningful impact on our business performance, influencing our ability to generate sales and achieve our targeted financial and operating results:



•General economic conditions are a key factor affecting our results as they impact our customers' willingness to spend on information technology. This is particularly the case for our Corporate and Small Business customers, as their purchases tend to reflect confidence in their business prospects, which are driven by their discrete perceptions of business and general economic conditions. Additionally, changes in trade policy and product constraints from suppliers could have an adverse impact on our business. There continues to be substantial uncertainty regarding the impact of the UK's planned withdrawal from the European Union ("EU") (referred to as "Brexit"). Potential adverse consequences of Brexit such as global market uncertainty, volatility in currency exchange rates, greater restrictions on imports and exports between UK and EU countries and increased regulatory complexities could have a negative impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations. To date, CDW UK has not experienced significant changes in the buying behavior of its customers even with the uncertainty related to the timing and terms of Brexit. We have established a presence on the continent to support CDW UK's broader growth opportunities in the EU. This also serves as a contingency plan to address future developments as needed around Brexit.

•Changes in spending policies, budget priorities and funding levels are a key factor influencing the purchasing levels of government, healthcare and education customers.



•Technology trends drive customer purchasing behaviors in the market. Current technology trends are focused on delivering greater flexibility and efficiency, as well as designing IT securely. These trends are driving customer adoption of solutions such as those delivered via cloud, software defined architectures and hybrid on-premise and off-premise combinations, as well as the evolution of the IT consumption model to more "as-a-service" offerings, including Device-as-a-Service ("DaaS") and managed services.



Key Business Metrics



We monitor a number of financial and non-financial measures and ratios on a regular basis in order to track the progress of our business and make adjustments as necessary. Effective January 1, 2019, we made a change to the Non-GAAP financial measures that we use to provide meaningful methods of evaluating our financial performance and have replaced EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin with Non-GAAP operating income and Non-GAAP operating income margin. We made this change due to the continuing evolution of the IT consumption model. We believe Non-GAAP operating income will be more reflective of the costs of providing services to our customers and our own costs as the consumption model continues to evolve. Non-GAAP operating income is also being used for the first time in 2019 as a key business metric for our annual incentive compensation programs.



In addition to Non-GAAP operating income and Non-GAAP operating income margin, we believe that the most important financial and non-financial measures and ratios include average daily sales, gross margin, operating margin, Net income, Non-GAAP income before income taxes, Non-GAAP net income, Net income per diluted share, Non-GAAP net income per diluted share, free cash flow, return on working capital, Cash and cash equivalents, net working capital, cash conversion cycle (defined to be days of sales outstanding in Accounts receivable and certain receivables due from vendors plus days of supply in Merchandise inventory minus days of purchases outstanding in Accounts payable and Accounts payable-inventory financing, based on a rolling three-month average), debt levels including available credit, sales per coworker and coworker turnover. These measures and ratios are compared to standards or objectives set by management, so that actions can be taken, as necessary, in order to achieve the standards and objectives.



In this report, we discuss Non-GAAP operating income, Non-GAAP operating income margin, Non-GAAP income before income taxes and Non-GAAP net income, which are non-GAAP financial measures.



We believe these measures provide analysts, investors and management with helpful information regarding the underlying operating performance of our business, as they remove the impact of items that management believes are not reflective of underlying operating performance. Management uses these measures to evaluate period-over-period performance as management believes they provide a more comparable measure of the underlying business. For the definitions of Non-GAAP operating income, Non-GAAP income before income taxes and Non-GAAP net income and reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP measure, see "Results of Operations - Non-GAAP Financial Measure Reconciliations."

Results of Operations



Three Months Ended June 30, 2019 Compared to Three Months Ended June 30, 2018



Results of operations, in dollars and as a percentage of Net sales are as follows:



[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]



36

Net sales



Net sales by segment, in dollars and as a percentage of total Net sales, and the year-over-year dollar and percentage change in Net sales are as follows:



[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED][DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]



Total Net sales for the three months ended June 30, 2019 increased $444 million, or 10.6%, to $4,630 million, compared to $4,186 million for the three months ended June 30, 2018. Excluding the impact of foreign currency fluctuations, constant currency Net sales growth was 11.2%. See "Non-GAAP Financial Measure Reconciliations" below for additional information regarding constant currency Net sales growth.



For the three months ended June 30, 2019, Net sales growth reflected growth across most major product categories, particularly client devices (defined as notebooks/mobile devices and desktops) and NetComm. For additional details, see Note 12 (Segment Information) to the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements.



Corporate segment Net sales for the three months ended June 30, 2019 increased $150 million, or 8.7%, compared to the three months ended June 30, 2018. Growth was primarily driven by client devices and NetComm.



Small Business segment Net sales for the three months ended June 30, 2019 increased by $48 million, or 14.5%, compared to the three months ended June 30, 2018. Growth was primarily driven by client devices.



Public segment Net sales for the three months ended June 30, 2019 increased $205 million, or 12.5%, compared to the three months ended June 30, 2018. Net sales to Government customers increased 17.2% primarily driven by client devices and NetComm. Net sales to Healthcare customers increased 13.6% primarily driven by client devices. Net sales in Education increased 8.7% primarily driven by video, client devices and NetComm.



Net sales in Other, which is comprised of results from our UK and Canadian operations, for the three months ended June 30, 2019 increased $41 million, or 8.4%, compared to the three months ended June 30, 2018. The increase in Other was driven by Canada, which includes Scalar. This increase was partially offset by the impact of foreign currency exchange of approximately 540 basis points, due to the unfavorable impact resulting from the British pound and Canadian dollar to US dollar translations.



Gross profit



Gross profit increased $78 million, or 11.2%, to $774 million for the three months ended June 30, 2019, compared to $696 million for the three months ended June 30, 2018. As a percentage of Net sales, Gross profit margin increased 10 basis points to 16.7% for the three months ended June 30, 2019. Gross profit margin was positively impacted by an increase in the mix of netted down revenues that are booked net of costs of goods sold, such as warranties and Software-as-a-Service. This was partially offset by year-over-year Net sales growth out-pacing the year-over-year growth in partner funding. 



37

Selling and administrative expenses



Selling and administrative expenses increased $39 million, or 10.2%, to $420 million for the three months ended June 30, 2019, compared to $381 million for the three months ended June 30, 2018. The increase was driven by higher payroll expenses due to increased coworkers and higher sales payroll expenses, including sales commissions, which are primarily driven by higher gross profit, the inclusion of Scalar expenses, and performance-based compensation consistent with higher attainment against goals. Total coworker count was 9,783, up 866 from 8,917 at June 30, 2018, including the incremental headcount from Scalar. Total coworker count was 9,019 at December 31, 2018.



As a percentage of total Net sales, Selling and administrative expenses remained flat at 9.1% for the three months ended June 30, 2019.



Operating income



During the first quarter of 2019, we evaluated our methodology for allocating certain depreciation and amortization expenses to each of our segments. The evaluation resulted in a revision to the allocation of depreciation and amortization expenses from Headquarters to our reportable segments, effective January 1, 2019. The prior period results have been recast to reflect these changes and present comparable information.



Operating income by segment, in dollars and as a percentage of Net sales, and the year-over-year percentage change are as follows:



[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]



* Not meaningful



(1)Segment operating income includes the segment's direct operating income, allocations for Headquarters' costs, allocations for income and expenses from logistics services, certain inventory adjustments and volume rebates and cooperative advertising from vendors.



(2)Includes the financial results for our other operating segments, CDW UK and CDW Canada, which do not meet the reportable segment quantitative thresholds.



(3)Includes certain Headquarters' function costs that are not allocated to the segments.



Operating income was $300 million for the three months ended June 30, 2019, an increase of $35 million, or 13.1%, compared to $266 million for the three months ended June 30, 2018. Operating income increased primarily due to higher gross profit dollars partially offset by higher payroll expenses. Total operating margin percentage increased 20 basis points to 6.5% for the three months ended June 30, 2019, from 6.3% for the three months ended June 30, 2018.



Corporate segment Operating income was $157 million for the three months ended June 30, 2019, an increase of $18 million, or 12.5%, compared to $140 million for the three months ended June 30, 2018. Corporate segment Operating income increased primarily due to higher gross profit dollars partially offset by higher payroll expenses. Corporate segment operating margin percentage increased 20 basis points to 8.3% for the three months ended June 30, 2019, from 8.1% for the three months ended June 30, 2018. This increase in operating margin percentage was primarily driven by an increase in the mix of netted down revenues that are booked net of costs of goods sold.



Small Business segment Operating income was $27 million for the three months ended June 30, 2019, an increase of $2 million, or 9.5%, compared to $24 million for the three months ended June 30, 2018. Small Business segment Operating income increased primarily due to higher gross profit dollars partially offset by higher payroll expenses. Small Business segment operating margin 



38

percentage decreased 40 basis points to 7.0% for the three months ended June 30, 2019, from 7.4% for the three months ended June 30, 2018. This decrease in operating margin percentage was primarily driven by lower product margin.



Public segment Operating income was $129 million for the three months ended June 30, 2019, an increase of $18 million, or 16.1%, compared to $112 million for the three months ended June 30, 2018. Public segment Operating income increased primarily due to higher gross profit dollars, partially offset by higher sales payroll expenses. Public segment operating margin percentage increased 20 basis points to 7.0% for the three months ended June 30, 2019 from 6.8% for the three months ended June 30, 2018. This increase in operating margin percentage was primarily driven by an increase in the mix of netted down revenues that are booked net of costs of goods sold.



Other Operating income was $19 million for the three months ended June 30, 2019, a decrease of $3 million, or 12.0%, compared to $22 million for the three months ended June 30, 2018. Other Operating income decreased primarily due to higher payroll expenses, which was due to the inclusion of Scalar expenses, and the unfavorable translation of the British pound and Canadian dollar to US dollar, partially offset by higher gross profit dollars. Other operating margin percentage decreased 90 basis points to 3.6% for the three months ended June 30, 2019, from 4.5% for the three months ended June 30, 2018. This decrease was primarily driven by higher payroll expenses partially offset by lower intangible asset amortization as a percentage of Net sales.



Income tax expense



Income tax expense was $65 million for the three months ended June 30, 2019, compared to $57 million for the same period of the prior year. The effective tax rate, expressed by calculating the income tax expense as a percentage of Income before income taxes, was 24.7% for the both the three months ended June 30, 2019 and 2018 and differed from the US federal statutory rate of 21.0% primarily due to state income taxes partially offset by excess tax benefits on equity-based compensation. 



Non-GAAP Financial Measure Reconciliations



We have included reconciliations of Non-GAAP operating income, Non-GAAP income before income taxes, Non-GAAP net income and Net sales growth on a constant currency basis for the three months ended June 30, 2019 and 2018 below.



Non-GAAP operating income excludes, among other things, charges related to the amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets, equity-based compensation and the associated payroll taxes, and acquisition and integration expenses. Non-GAAP operating income margin is defined as Non-GAAP operating income as a percentage of Net sales. Non-GAAP income before income taxes, and Non-GAAP net income exclude, among other things, charges related to acquisition-related intangible asset amortization, equity-based compensation, acquisition and integration expenses, and the associated tax effects of each. Net sales growth on a constant currency basis is defined as Net sales growth excluding the impact of foreign currency translation on net sales compared to the prior period.



Non-GAAP operating income, Non-GAAP operating income margin, Non-GAAP income before income taxes, Non-GAAP net income and Net sales growth on a constant currency basis are considered non-GAAP financial measures. Generally, a non-GAAP financial measure is a numerical measure of a company's performance or financial position that either excludes or includes amounts that are not normally included or excluded in the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP. Non-GAAP measures used by management may differ from similar measures used by other companies, even when similar terms are used to identify such measures.



We believe these measures provide analysts, investors and management with helpful information regarding the underlying operating performance of our business, as they remove the impact of items that management believes are not reflective of underlying operating performance. Management uses these measures to evaluate period-over-period performance as management believes they provide a more comparable measure of the underlying business.



39

Non-GAAP operating income



Non-GAAP operating income was $358 million for the three months ended June 30, 2019, an increase of $35 million, or 10.7%, compared to $324 million for the three months ended June 30, 2018. As a percentage of Net sales, Non-GAAP operating income was 7.7% for both the three months ended June 30, 2019 and 2018.



[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]



(1)Includes amortization expense for acquisition-related intangible assets, primarily customer relationships, customer contracts and trade names.



(2)Includes other expenses such as payroll taxes on equity-based compensation.



Non-GAAP net income



Non-GAAP net income was $238 million for the three months ended June 30, 2019, an increase of $24 million, or 11.5%, compared to $213 million for the three months ended June 30, 2018.



[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]



(1)Income tax on non-GAAP adjustments includes excess tax benefits associated with equity-based compensation and the impact of global intangible low tax income ("GILTI") due to equity-based compensation and amortization of intangibles.

Net sales growth on a constant currency basis



Net sales increased $444 million, or 10.6%, to $4,630 million for the three months ended June 30, 2019, compared to $4,186 million for the three months ended June 30, 2018. Net sales on a constant currency basis, which excludes the impact of foreign currency translation, increased $467 million, or 11.2%.

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]



(1)There were 127 and 128 selling days for the six months ended June 30, 2019 and 2018, respectively.



Total Net sales for the six months ended June 30, 2019 increased $795 million, or 10.2%, to $8,588 million, compared to $7,792 million for the six months ended June 30, 2018. Excluding the impact of foreign currency fluctuations, constant currency Net sales growth was 10.9%. There was one fewer selling day in the six months ended June 30, 2019 compared to the same period of 2018, and Net sales on an average daily sales basis increased 11.1%. See "Non-GAAP Financial Measure Reconciliations" below for additional information regarding constant currency Net sales growth.



For the six months ended June 30, 2019, Net sales growth reflected growth across most major product categories, particularly client devices, NetComm and software. Additionally, five months of results from Scalar, which was acquired on February 1, 2019, 



42

contributed to our Net sales growth. For additional details, see Note 12 (Segment Information) to the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements.



Corporate segment Net sales for the six months ended June 30, 2019 increased $321 million, or 9.7%, compared to the six months ended June 30, 2018. On an average daily sales basis, Corporate segment Net sales increased 10.6%. Growth was primarily driven by client devices, software and NetComm.

On an average daily sales basis, Public segment Net sales increased 11.5%. The increase was primarily driven by growth in Government and Healthcare. On an average daily sales basis, Net sales to Government and Healthcare customers increased 17.9% and 11.1%, respectively, both primarily driven by client devices, NetComm and software. Net sales in Education increased 6.7% on an average daily sales basis, primarily driven by video and client devices.



Net sales in Other, which is comprised of results from our UK and Canadian operations, for the six months ended June 30, 2019 increased $94 million, or 9.6%, compared to the six months ended June 30, 2018. On an average daily sales basis, Net sales in Other increased 10.5%. Both operations grew in local currency and Canada growth included the incremental Net sales from Scalar. The impact of foreign currency exchange decreased Other sales growth by approximately 610 basis points, due to the unfavorable impact resulting from the British pound and Canadian dollar to US dollar translations.



Gross profit



Gross profit increased $146 million, or 11.3%, to $1,446 million for the six months ended June 30, 2019, compared to $1,300 million for the six months ended June 30, 2018. As a percentage of Net sales, Gross profit margin increased 10 basis points to 16.8% for the six months ended June 30, 2019.

The increase was driven by higher payroll expenses due to higher sales payroll expenses, including sales commissions, which are primarily driven by higher gross profit, the inclusion of Scalar expenses, and performance-based compensation consistent with higher attainment against goals.



As a percentage of total Net sales, Selling and administrative expenses increased 10 basis points to 9.6% during the six months ended June 30, 2019, from 9.5% in the six months ended June 30, 2018.



Operating income



During the first quarter of 2019, we evaluated our methodology for allocating certain depreciation and amortization expenses to each of our segments. The evaluation resulted in a revision to the allocation of depreciation and amortization expenses from Headquarters to our reportable segments, effective January 1, 2019. The prior period results have been recast to reflect these changes and present comparable information.

Operating income was $529 million for the six months ended June 30, 2019, an increase of $60 million, or 12.7%, compared to $470 million for the six months ended June 30, 2018. Operating income increased primarily due to higher gross profit dollars, partially offset by higher payroll expenses. Total operating margin percentage increased 20 basis points to 6.2% for the six months ended June 30, 2019, from 6.0% for the six months ended June 30, 2018, due to product margin improvement.



Corporate segment Operating income was $292 million for the six months ended June 30, 2019, an increase of $29 million, or 11.2%, compared to $263 million for the six months ended June 30, 2018. Corporate segment Operating income increased primarily due to higher gross profit dollars partially offset by higher payroll expenses. Corporate segment operating margin percentage increased 10 basis points to 8.1% for the six months ended June 30, 2019, from 8.0% for the six months ended June 30, 2018, due to an increase in the mix of netted down revenues that are booked net of costs of goods sold.



Small Business segment Operating income was $51 million for the six months ended June 30, 2019, an increase of $5 million, or 10.4%, compared to $46 million for the six months ended June 30, 2018. Small Business segment Operating income increased primarily due to higher gross profit dollars partially offset by higher payroll expenses. Small Business segment operating margin percentage remained flat at 7.0% for the six months ended June 30, 2019 and 2018.



Public segment Operating income was $206 million for the six months ended June 30, 2019, an increase of $24 million, or 13.1%, compared to $182 million for the six months ended June 30, 2018. Public segment Operating income increased primarily due to higher gross profit dollars, partially offset by higher sales payroll expenses. Public segment operating margin percentage increased 20 basis points to 6.5% for the six months ended June 30, 2019, from 6.3% for the six months ended June 30, 2018, due to product margin improvement and an increase in the mix of netted down revenues that are booked net of costs of goods sold, partially offset by higher payroll expenses.



Other Operating income was $45 million for the six months ended June 30, 2019, an increase of $3 million, or 7.8%, compared to $42 million for the six months ended June 30, 2018. Other Operating income increased primarily due to higher gross profit dollars, partially offset by higher payroll expenses and the unfavorable translation of the British pound and Canadian dollar to US dollar. Other operating margin percentage decreased 10 basis points to 4.2% for the six months ended June 30, 2019, from 4.3% for the six months ended June 30, 2018. This decrease was primarily driven by higher payroll expenses, partially offset by gross margin improvement and lower intangible asset amortization as a percentage of Net sales.



Income tax expense



Income tax expense was $103 million for the six months ended June 30, 2019, compared to $96 million for the same period of the prior year. The effective tax rate, expressed by calculating the income tax expense as a percentage of Income before income 



44

taxes, was 22.8% and 24.1% for the six months ended June 30, 2019 and 2018, respectively, and differed from the US federal statutory rate of 21.0% primarily due to state income taxes partially offset by excess tax benefits on equity-based compensation. 



The lower effective tax rate for the six months ended June 30, 2019 as compared to the same period of the prior year was primarily attributable to higher excess tax benefits on equity-based compensation and a discrete tax benefit related to CDW Canada's acquisition of Scalar.

(2)Represents the effect of translating the prior year results of CDW UK and CDW Canada at the average exchange rates applicable in the current year.



Seasonality



While we have not historically experienced significant seasonality throughout the year, sales in our Corporate segment, which primarily serves US private sector business customers with more than 250 employees, are typically higher in the fourth quarter than in other quarters due to customers spending their remaining technology budget dollars at the end of the year. Additionally, sales in our Public segment have historically been higher in the third quarter than in other quarters primarily due to the buying patterns of the federal government and education customers.



Liquidity and Capital Resources



Overview



We finance our operations and capital expenditures with internally generated cash from operations. As of June 30, 2019, we also have $973 million of availability for borrowings under our senior secured asset-based revolving credit facility and an additional £50 million ($63 million at June 30, 2019) under the CDW UK revolving credit facility. Our liquidity and borrowing plans are established to align with our financial and strategic planning processes and ensure we have the necessary funding to meet our operating commitments, which primarily include the purchase of inventory, payroll and general expenses. We also take into consideration our overall capital allocation strategy, which includes investment for future growth, dividend payments, acquisitions and share repurchases. We believe we have adequate sources of liquidity and funding available for at least the next year; however, there are a number of factors that may negatively impact our available sources of funds. The amount of cash generated from operations will be dependent upon factors such as the successful execution of our business plan and general economic conditions.



Long-Term Debt and Financing Arrangements



As of June 30, 2019, we had total indebtedness of $3.3 billion, of which $1.6 billion was secured indebtedness. At June 30, 2019, we were in compliance with the covenants under our various credit agreements and indentures. For additional details, see Note 7 (Long-Term Debt) to the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements.



Inventory Financing Agreements



We have entered into agreements with certain financial intermediaries to facilitate the purchase of inventory from various suppliers under certain terms and conditions. These amounts are classified separately as Accounts payable-inventory financing on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. We do not incur any interest expense associated with these agreements as balances are paid when they are due. For additional details, see Note 4 (Inventory Financing Agreements) to the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements.



Share Repurchase Program



During the six months ended June 30, 2019, we repurchased 3.4 million shares of our common stock for $332 million under the previously announced share repurchase program. For additional details on our share repurchase program, see Part II, Item 2, Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds.

Dividends



A summary of 2019 dividend activity for our common stock is as follows:



[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]



On July 31, 2019, we announced that our Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.295 per common share. The dividend will be paid on September 10, 2019 to all stockholders of record as of the close of business on August 26, 2019.



The payment of any future dividends will be at the discretion of our Board of Directors and will depend upon our results of operations, financial condition, business prospects, capital requirements, contractual restrictions, any potential indebtedness we may incur, restrictions imposed by applicable law, tax considerations and other factors that our Board of Directors deems relevant. In addition, our ability to pay dividends on our common stock will be limited by restrictions on our ability to pay dividends or make distributions to our stockholders and on the ability of our subsidiaries to pay dividends or make distributions to us, in each case, under the terms of our current and any future agreements governing our indebtedness.



Cash Flows



Cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities are as follows:



[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]



Operating Activities



[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]



(1)Includes items such as deferred income taxes, depreciation and amortization, and equity-based compensation expense.



(2)The change is primarily due to stronger operating results driven by Net sales and Gross profit growth, partially offset by higher payroll expenses.



(3)The change in Accounts receivable is primarily due to improved collections.



47

(4)The change in Merchandise inventory is due to higher customer-driven and strategic stocking positions.



(5)The change in Accounts payable-trade is due to increased sales in 2019 and the mix of vendors with longer payment terms.



(6)The change in Other is primarily driven by an increase in the receivables from vendors due to the growth in business and lower accrued compensation expense in 2019.



In order to manage our working capital and operating cash needs, we monitor our cash conversion cycle, defined as days of sales outstanding in Accounts receivable and certain receivables due from vendors plus days of supply in Merchandise inventory minus days of purchases outstanding in Accounts payable and Accounts payable-inventory financing, based on a rolling three-month average. Components of our cash conversion cycle are as follows:



[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]



(1)Represents the rolling three-month average of the balance of Accounts receivable, net at the end of the period, divided by average daily Net sales for the same three-month period. Also incorporates components of other miscellaneous receivables.



(2)Represents the rolling three-month average of the balance of Merchandise inventory at the end of the period divided by average daily Cost of sales for the same three-month period.



(3)Represents the rolling three-month average of the combined balance of Accounts payable-trade, excluding cash overdrafts, and Accounts payable-inventory financing at the end of the period divided by average daily Cost of sales for the same three-month period.



The cash conversion cycle decreased to 16 days at June 30, 2019, compared to 17 days at June 30, 2018. DSO, DIO and DPO increased 2, 1 and 4 days, respectively, compared to June 30, 2018. The increase in DSO was primarily driven by higher Net sales and third-party services such as software as a service and warranties. These sales have an unfavorable impact on DSO as the receivable is recognized on the Consolidated Balance Sheets on a gross basis while the corresponding sales amount in the Consolidated Statement of Operations is recorded on a net basis. This also results in a favorable impact on DPO as the payable is recognized on the Consolidated Balance Sheets without a corresponding Cost of sales in the Statement of Operations because the cost paid to the vendor or third-party service provider is recorded as a reduction to Net sales. In addition to the impact of these services on DPO, DPO also increased due to the mix of payables with certain vendors that have longer payment terms. Additionally, DIO increased due to higher customer-driven and strategic stocking positions.



Investing Activities



Net cash used in investing activities increased by $85 million in the six months ended June 30, 2019 compared to the same period of the prior year. The increase was primarily due to the completion of our acquisition of Scalar on February 1, 2019. Additionally, Capital expenditures were $44 million and $34 million for the six months ended June 30, 2019 and 2018, respectively. The increase in capital expenditures is primarily due to the timing of investments for improvements to our information technology systems.



Financing Activities



Net cash used in financing activities decreased by $33 million in the six months ended June 30, 2019 compared to the same period of the prior year. The decrease was primarily driven by further leveraging our inventory financing arrangements and borrowings under our revolving credit facilities, which were partially offset by our share repurchases and increasing our dividends per share during the six months ended June 30, 2019. For additional details regarding our debt activities, see Note 7 (Long-Term Debt) to the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements.
