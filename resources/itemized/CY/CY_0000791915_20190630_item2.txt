Results of Operations



Revenues



Our total revenue decreased by $91.9 million, or 14.7%, to $532.2 million in the three months ended June 30, 2019 compared to the same period in the prior year. Revenue from the NAND flash business which was divested on April 1, 2019 was $49.5 million in the three months ended July 1, 2018. Excluding the impact of the NAND flash business divestiture, our total revenues decreased by $42.4 million, or 7.4%, to $532.2 million for the three months ended June 30, 2019 compared to the same period in the prior year. The decrease was primarily due to demand softening across our NOR flash, microcontroller and wireless connectivity businesses.



Our total revenues decreased by $135.1 million, or 11.2%, to $1,071.2 million in the six months ended June 30, 2019 compared to the same period in the prior year. The decrease was attributable in part to the divestiture of our NAND flash business, which was completed on April 1, 2019. Revenue from the NAND flash business decreased by $63.4 million to $31.1 million in the six months ended June 30, 2019 compared to the same period in the prior year. The remainder of the decrease was primarily due to demand softening across our NOR flash, microcontroller and wireless connectivity businesses.









Revenues recorded by MCD decreased by $14.3 million, or 3.9%, in the three months ended June 30, 2019 compared to the same prior year period. The decrease was primarily due to a decline in demand for microcontroller and wireless connectivity products. 



Revenues recorded by MCD decreased by $40.6 million, or 5.8%, in the six months ended June 30, 2019 compared to the same prior year period. The decrease was primarily due to a decline in demand for microcontroller and wireless connectivity products. 





Revenues recorded by MPD decreased by $77.6 million, or 30.4%, in the three months ended June 30, 2019 compared to the same prior year period. The decrease was primarily due to the divestiture of our NAND flash business, which was completed on April 1, 2019, and due to a decline in revenue from NOR flash products. Revenue from the divested NAND flash business was $49.5 million in the three months ended July 1, 2018. 



Revenues recorded by MPD decreased by $94.5 million, or 18.9%, in the six months ended June 30, 2019 compared to the same prior year period. The decrease was primarily due to a decline in demand for NAND flash and NOR flash products, and the divestiture of our NAND flash business, which was completed on April 1, 2019. Revenue from the NAND flash business decreased by $63.4 million to $31.1 million in the six months ended June 30, 2019 compared to the same period in the prior year.









Our gross margin decreased to 37.3% in the three months ended June 30, 2019 from 37.5% in the three months ended July 1, 2018. A primary driver was the decrease in revenue in the second quarter of fiscal 2019 compared to the same period a year ago causing an increase in amortization expense from intangible assets as a percentage of revenue. Amortization of intangible assets included in cost of revenue was $46.9 million or 8.8% of revenues in the second quarter of fiscal 2019 compared to $48.1 million or 7.7% of revenues in the second quarter of fiscal 2018. In addition, sale of inventory that was previously written off or written down decreased in the second quarter of fiscal 2019 compared to the same period a year ago. Gross margins in the second quarters of fiscal 2019 and 2018 benefited 0.7% and 1.2%, respectively, from the sale of previously reserved inventory. The above unfavorable items impacting gross margin were partially offset by certain items which improved gross margin recorded in the second quarter of fiscal 2019 compared to same period in 2018. These favorable items included a shift in the product mix towards higher density memory products, a decrease in sales of commoditized products, and a reduction in the cost of certain products. 



Our gross margin improved to 37.4% in the six months ended June 30, 2019 from 37.0% in the six months ended July 1, 2018. 



The primary drivers of the improvement in gross margin were a shift in the product mix towards higher density memory products, a decrease in sales of commoditized products, which was due in part to the divestiture of the NAND business effective the second quarter of fiscal 2019, and a reduction in the cost of certain products. This improvement was partially offset by a decrease in the sale of inventory that was previously written off or written down for the six months ended June 30, 2019 as compared to the same prior year period. Gross margins in the six months ended June 30, 2019 and July 1, 2018 benefited 0.7% and 1.2%, respectively, from the sale of previously reserved inventory. Included in cost of revenues are amortization of intangible assets of $93.8 million and $96.2 million for the six months ended June 30, 2019 and July 1, 2018, respectively.





















Income Taxes





Impairment of Equity-Method Investment in Deca Technologies, Inc.



In the second quarter of fiscal 2019, we recorded a $29.5 million impairment charge for the equity-method investment in Deca Technologies, Inc. ("Deca"). The carrying value of our investment in Deca was $28.6 million and $65.1 million as of June 30, 2019 and December 30, 2018, respectively. There continues to be a substantial risk that the carrying value of this investment may be further impaired in the future as described in Note 7 (Equity-Method Investments) of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements in this Quarterly Report. Deca will likely need to secure additional funding to support its growth and cash needs. Failure to secure such funding will impact its ability to continue as a going concern. 



Liquidity and Capital Resources



Our Revolving Credit Facility had a capacity of $540 million which was undrawn as of June 30, 2019.



On July 31, 2019, we amended our existing Revolving Credit Facility thereby increasing the available amount from $540 million to $700 million and extending its maturity from March 12, 2020 to January 31, 2021. We may, at our sole discretion, extend the maturity for another six months to July 31, 2021. The financial covenants were amended to increase the maximum total leverage ratio from 3.75 to 4.0. We borrowed $447 million under the amended Revolving Credit Facility and repaid the entire outstanding Term Loan B principal balance of approximately $448 million as of July 31, 2019, resulting in extinguishment of Term Loan B, which was otherwise scheduled to mature on July 5, 2021.

Critical Policies and Estimates



The discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and the data used to prepare them. Our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States and we are required to make estimates, judgments and assumptions in the course of such preparation. Note 1 of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements under Part I, Item 1 describes the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements. On an ongoing basis, we re-evaluate our judgments and estimates including those related to revenue recognition, allowances for doubtful accounts receivable, inventory valuation, valuation of long-lived assets, goodwill and financial instruments, stock-based compensation, settlement costs, and income taxes. We base our estimates and judgments on historical experience, knowledge of current conditions and our beliefs of what could occur in the future considering available information. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.

recognition;



•Assessment of excess and obsolete inventory which impacts valuation of Inventories;



•Estimation of fair value of investments in equity interests;



•Valuation of certain awards that contain market based vesting condition which impacts our share-based compensation expense;



•Actuarial valuation of certain defined benefit plans; and



•Estimation of exposure related to uncertain tax positions which impacts our accounting for Income Taxes.



As discussed in Note 1, we adopted ASC Topic 842 on December 31, 2018. There have been no other changes to our critical accounting policies and estimates since the filing of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 30, 2018.
