Critical Accounting Judgments and Estimates 



Our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements, which have been prepared by us in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. The presentation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses, and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. Our estimates include those related to revenue recognition, inventory obsolescence, the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities, depreciable lives of equipment, warranty obligations, and contingent liabilities. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. 



For a complete description of our accounting policies, see Part II, Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates,” of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018. We have reviewed those policies and determined that they remain our critical accounting policies for the three months ended March 31, 2019.

Results of Operations: Three months ended March 31, 2019 compared to three months ended March 31, 2018 



Net Sales. Net sales, which include printer, terminal and software sales, as well as sales of replacement parts, consumables and maintenance and repair services, by market for the three months ended March 31, 2019 and 2018 were as follows (in thousands, except percentages): 



  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 



 *  International sales do not include sales of printers and terminals made to domestic distributors or other domestic customers who may, in turn, ship those printers and terminals to international destinations.       



Net sales for the first quarter of 2019 decreased $0.7 million, or 6%, from the same period in 2018. Printer, terminal and other hardware sales volume decreased 11% to approximately 28,000 units driven primarily by a 27% decrease in unit volume from the POS automation and banking market and a 5% decrease in unit volume in the casino and gaming market. The average selling price of our printers, terminals and other hardware increased 4% for the first quarter of 2019 compared to the first quarter of 2018 due primarily to lower POS automation and banking sales, which sell at a lower price than our other products.  



International sales for the first quarter of 2019 increased $0.5 million, or 23%, from the same period in 2018 primarily due to increased sales in the international casino and gaming market.  



Restaurant Solutions. Revenue from the restaurant solutions market includes sales of terminals that combine hardware and software in a device that includes an operating system, touchscreen and one or two thermal print mechanisms that print easy-to-read food rotation labels, grab and go labels for prepared foods, and “enjoy by” date labels. These terminals help food service establishments and restaurants (including fine dining, casual dining, quick-serve convenience and hospitality establishments) effectively manage food safety and automate and manage back-of-the-house operations. In addition to sales of terminals, revenue includes sales of cloud-based software applications and hardware (including handheld devices, tablets, temperature probes and temperature sensors). In 2019, we launched our BOHA! solution, which combines our latest generation terminal, cloud-based software application and hardware into a unique solution to automate the back-of-house operations in restaurants. Sales of our worldwide restaurant solutions products for the three months ended March 31, 2019 and 2018 were as follows (in thousands, except percentages): 



  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 



The decrease in domestic restaurant solutions revenue for the first quarter of 2019 compared to the first quarter of 2018 was driven largely by lower sales of our AccuDate 9700 terminal to our former U.S. distributor. This decrease was partially offset by increased sales of our AccuDate XL2e terminal, which has since been rebranded to the BOHA! terminal. Additionally, during the first quarter of 2019, we recognized our first sales of BOHA! software on a SaaS subscription basis. We expect sales of our restaurant solutions products to increase in 2019 compared to 2018 following the launch of our new BOHA! solution.  



POS automation and banking. Revenue from the POS automation and banking market includes sales of thermal and impact printers used primarily by quick serve restaurants located either at the checkout counter or within self-service kiosks to print receipts for consumers or print on linerless labels. In addition, revenue includes sales of inkjet printers used by banks, credit unions and other financial institutions to print deposit or withdrawal receipts and/or validate checks at bank teller stations. As of December 31, 2018, we exited the banking market but will continue to fulfill orders from legacy customers until our inventory is exhausted. Sales of our worldwide POS automation and banking products for the three months ended March 31, 2019 and 2018 were as follows (in thousands, except percentages): 



  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 



The decrease in domestic POS automation and banking product revenue for the first quarter of 2019 compared to the first quarter of 2018 was primarily driven by a 24% decrease in domestic sales of our Ithaca® 9000 printer, as sales to McDonald’s decreased for the first quarter of 2019 compared to the same period in 2018. We expect sales of our Ithaca® 9000 to McDonald’s to decrease in 2019 compared to 2018. 



14 



Casino and gaming. Revenue from the casino and gaming market includes sales of thermal ticket printers used in slot machines, video lottery terminals, and other gaming machines that print tickets or receipts instead of issuing coins at casinos and racetracks and other gaming venues worldwide. Revenue from this market also includes sales of thermal roll-fed printers used in the international off-premise gaming market in gaming machines such as Amusement with Prizes, Skills with Prizes and Fixed Odds Betting Terminals at non-casino gaming establishments. Revenue from this market also includes royalties related to our patented casino and gaming technology. In addition, casino and gaming market revenue includes sales of the EPICENTRAL™ print system, our software solution (including annual software maintenance), that enables casino operators to create promotional coupons and marketing messages and to print them real-time at the slot machine. Sales of our worldwide casino and gaming products for the three months ended March 31, 2019 and 2018 were as follows (in thousands, except percentages): 



  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 



The decrease in domestic sales of our casino and gaming products for the first quarter of 2019 compared to the first quarter of 2018 was due to an 83% decrease in domestic sales of our off-premise gaming printers to an OEM, which we do not expect to reoccur in 2019; a 7% decrease in domestic sales of our thermal casino printers driven primarily by industry-wide weakness resulting in lower sales to our OEMs; and an 81% decrease in domestic EPICENTRAL™ software sales, as we had no new installations during the first quarter of 2019 compared to one new installation in 2018. Sales of EPICENTRALTM are project based and as a result, may fluctuate significantly quarter-to-quarter and year-to-year. 



International casino and gaming product sales increased for the first quarter of 2019 compared to the first quarter of 2018 due to a 77% increase in sales of our thermal casino printers largely to customers in Asia. This increase was partially offset by a 70% decline in international sales of our off-premise gaming printers to Europe, Australia and Asia. Sales of our off-premise gaming printers are largely project-oriented and therefore may fluctuate significantly from quarter-to-quarter and year-to-year. 



We expect domestic and international casino and gaming sales in 2019 to be relatively consistent with the sales levels achieved during 2018. 



Lottery. Revenue from the lottery market includes sales of thermal on-line and other lottery printers primarily to International Game Technology and its subsidiaries (“IGT”) and, to a lesser extent, other lottery system companies for various lottery applications. Sales of our worldwide lottery printers for the three months ended March 31, 2019 and 2018 were as follows (in thousands, except percentages): 



  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 



Our sales to IGT are directly dependent on the timing and number of new and upgraded lottery terminal installations that IGT performs, and as a result, may fluctuate significantly quarter-to-quarter and year-to-year. Our sales to IGT are not indicative of IGT’s overall business or revenue. We expect lottery printer sales to be lower for 2019 compared to 2018, as we have shifted our focus away from the lottery market to our higher value, technology-enabled restaurant solutions and casino and gaming products. 



Printrex. Printrex branded printers are sold into markets that include wide format, desktop and rack mounted and vehicle mounted black/white thermal printers used by customers to log and plot oil field, seismic and down hole well drilling data in the oil and gas exploration industry. It also includes high-speed color inkjet desktop printers used to print logs at the data centers of the oil and gas field service companies. Prior to 2019, revenue in this market also includes sales of vehicle mounted printers used to print schematics and certain other critical information in emergency services vehicles and other mobile printing applications. We exited this market at the end of 2018 and do not expect any future sales. Sales of our worldwide Printrex printers for the three months ended March 31, 2019 and 2018 were as follows (in thousands, except percentages):  



  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 



The increase in sales of Printrex printers for the first quarter of 2019 compared to the first quarter of 2018 resulted from higher domestic and international sales in the oil and gas market. We expect total Printrex sales to increase slightly for 2019 compared to 2018, as we expect to benefit from a continued modest recovery in the oil and gas industry.  



15 



TSG. Revenue generated by our TSG includes sales of consumable products (inkjet cartridges, ribbons, receipt paper, color thermal paper, food safety labels and other printing supplies), replacement parts, maintenance and repair services, technical support services, testing services, refurbished printers, and shipping and handling charges. Sales in our worldwide TSG market for the three months ended March 31, 2019 and 2018 were as follows (in thousands, except percentages): 



  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 



The increase in domestic revenue from TSG for the first quarter of 2019 as compared to the first quarter of 2018 was primarily due to an increase in label sales and increased service revenue related to our restaurant solutions products. Sales of our restaurant solutions labels were five times higher on a growing installed base of AccuDate and BOHA! terminals. Service revenue also increased 24% for the first quarter of 2019 compared to the first quarter of 2018. Additionally, we had a 18% increase in sales of our legacy HP inkjet cartridges used in our banking printers. We do not expect this trend to continue for HP inkjet cartridges as we exited the banking market at the end of 2018. These increases were offset by a 31% decrease in sales of lottery printer spare parts to IGT. Based on our backlog of orders and contractual commitments for replacement parts, primarily from IGT, for our installed base of lottery printers, we expect TSG sales to decrease in 2019 compared to 2018. 



Internationally, TSG revenue increased for the first quarter of 2019 compared to the first quarter of 2018 primarily due to a 102% increase in sales of replacement parts and accessories to international casino and gaming customers. 



Gross Profit. Gross profit information for the three months ended March 31, 2019 and 2018 is summarized below (in thousands, except percentages): 



  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 



Gross profit is measured as revenue less cost of sales, which includes primarily the cost of all raw materials and component parts, direct labor, manufacturing overhead expenses, cost of finished products purchased directly from our contract manufacturers and expenses associated with installations of our EPICENTRALTM print system. For the first quarter of 2019, gross profit increased $224 thousand, or 4%, despite a sales decrease of 6% for the first quarter in 2019 compared to the first quarter of 2018. Our gross margin increased 480 basis points, increasing to 52.7% for the first quarter of 2019 compared to 47.9% for the first quarter of 2018. The increased gross margin reflects a favorable shift in sales mix towards higher-value, technology driven solutions, as well as lower sales of POS printers, which carry lower margins than our other products. 



Operating Expenses - Engineering, Design and Product Development. Engineering, design and product development information for the three months ended March 31, 2019 and 2018 is summarized below (in thousands, except percentages): 



  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 



Engineering, design and product development expenses primarily includes salary and payroll related expenses for our hardware and software engineering staff, depreciation and design expenses (including prototype printer expenses, outside design, development and testing services, supplies and contract software development expenses). Such expenses decreased $56 thousand, or 5%, for the first quarter of 2019 compared to the first quarter of 2018, primarily due to lower expenses related to product development for the restaurant solutions and casino and gaming markets. We expect engineering, design and product development expenses in 2019 to be consistent with 2018. 



16 



Operating Expenses - Selling and Marketing. Selling and marketing information for the three months ended March 31, 2019 and 2018 is summarized below (in thousands, except percentages): 



  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 



Selling and marketing expenses primarily include salaries and payroll related expenses for our sales and marketing staff, sales commissions, travel expenses, expenses associated with the lease of sales offices, advertising, trade show expenses, e-commerce and other promotional marketing expenses. Such expenses increased by $281 thousand, or 18%, for the first quarter of 2019 compared to the first quarter of 2018 primarily due to higher compensation expenses related to the hiring of additional outside and technical sales staff during the latter part of 2018 and first quarter of 2019. We expect selling and marketing expense to increase significantly in 2019 compared to 2018 due to the full-year impact of hiring additional sales staff during 2018, as well as investments to support our new suite of BOHA! software and hardware solutions.  



Operating Expenses - General and Administrative. General and administrative information for the three months ended March 31, 2019 and 2018 is summarized below (in thousands, except percentages): 



  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 



General and administrative expenses primarily include salaries, incentive compensation, and other payroll related expenses for our executive, accounting, human resources and information technology staff, expenses for our corporate headquarters, professional and legal expenses, telecommunication expenses, and other expenses related to being a publicly-traded company. General and administrative expenses increased $78 thousand, or 4%, for the first quarter of 2019 compared to the first quarter of 2018 due primarily to higher professional and legal expenses. These increases were partially offset by lower recruiting expense and severance expense incurred during the first quarter of 2019 compared to the first quarter of 2018. We expect general and administrative expense to be higher in 2019 compared to 2018 due to higher incentive compensation and additional investment to support restaurant solutions. 



Operating Income. Operating income information for the three months ended March 31, 2019 and 2018 is summarized below (in thousands, except percentages): 



  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 



Our operating income decreased $79 thousand, or 9%, and our operating margin decreased slightly by 30 basis points for the first quarter of 2019 compared to the first quarter of 2018. The decrease in both operating profit and operating margin were primarily due to a 6% increase in operating expenses, partially offset by a 480 basis point increase in gross margin, for the first quarter of 2019 compared to the first quarter of 2018. 



Interest. We recorded net interest expense of $6 thousand for the first quarter of 2019 compared to $8 thousand for the first quarter of 2018. We do not expect significant changes in net interest expense for the full year 2019. 



Other, net. We recorded other income of $90 thousand for the first quarter of 2019 compared to $10 thousand for the first quarter of 2018. The increase in other income was due to higher foreign currency exchange gains recorded by our U.K. subsidiary for the first quarter of 2019 compared to the first quarter of 2018. Going forward, we may continue to experience more foreign exchange gains or losses depending on the level of sales to Europe through our U.K. subsidiary and the change in exchange rates of the Euro and Pound Sterling against the U.S. dollar. 



Income Taxes. We recorded an income tax provision for the first quarter of 2019 of $115 thousand at an effective tax rate of 13.4%, compared to an income tax provision during the first quarter of 2018 of $178 thousand at an effective tax rate of 20.7%. The effective tax rate for the first quarter of 2019 was lower as it included the foreign-derived intangible income (“FDII”) deduction under the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the “Tax Reform Act”). The FDII deduction was not included in the effective tax rate for the first quarter of 2018 as the interpretive guidance for the deduction was not yet released. We expect our effective tax rate to be between 13% and 14% for the full year 2019. 



17 



Net Income. We reported net income for the first quarter of 2019 of $746 thousand, or $0.10 per diluted share, compared to $680 thousand, or $0.09 per diluted share, for the first quarter of 2018. 



Liquidity and Capital Resources 



Cash Flow 



For the first three months of 2019, our cash and cash equivalents balance decreased $2.7 million, or 59%, from December 31, 2018. We ended the first quarter of 2019 with $1.9 million in cash and cash equivalents, of which $0.5 million was held by our U.K. subsidiary, and no debt outstanding. 



Operating activities: The following significant factors affected our cash used in operating activities of $1.6 million for the first three months of 2019 as compared to cash provided by operating activities of $1.9 million for the first three months of 2018: 



During the first three months of 2019: 



  ●  We reported net income of $0.7 million.      



  ●  We recorded depreciation and amortization of $0.3 million, and share-based compensation expense of $0.2 million.      



  ●  Accounts receivable decreased $1.2 million, or 15%, due to the collection of receivables for 2018 sales.      



  ●  Inventory increased $1.5 million, or 12%, due to the buildup of inventory on hand to support future anticipated sales of BOHA! hardware product for the restaurant solutions market.      



  ●  Prepaid income taxes decreased $0.1 million during the first quarter of 2019.      



  ●  Other current and long term assets increased $0.4 million, or 65%, due primarily to an advanced payment of royalty fees.      



  ●  Accounts payable decreased $1.3 million, or 36%, due primarily to inventory purchases made towards the end of the fourth quarter of 2018 that were subsequently paid in the first quarter of 2019.      



  ●  Accrued liabilities and other liabilities decreased $1 million, or 27%, due primarily to the payment of 2018 annual bonuses in March 2019.      



During the first three months of 2018: 



  ●  We reported net income of $0.7 million.      



  ●  We recorded depreciation and amortization of $0.2 million, and share-based compensation expense of $0.2 million.      



  ●  Accounts receivable decreased $2.3 million, or 21%, due to the collection of past due receivables for 2017 sales made to our former international casino and gaming distributor.      



  ●  Prepaid income taxes decreased $0.2 million during the first quarter of 2018.      



  ●  Accounts payable decreased $0.7 million, or 19%, due primarily to higher inventory purchases made towards the end of the fourth quarter of 2017 compared to the first quarter of 2018 that were subsequently paid in the first quarter of 2018.      



  ●  Accrued liabilities and other liabilities decreased $0.9 million, or 21%, due primarily to the payment of 2017 annual bonuses in March 2018.      



Investing activities: Our capital expenditures, including capitalized software were $0.3 million for the first three months of both 2019 and 2018. Expenditures in 2019 were primarily for new product tooling equipment and, to a lesser extent, computer and networking equipment and leasehold improvements at our Ithaca facility. Expenditures for the first three months of 2018 were primarily for computer and networking equipment and furniture and fixtures purchases related to investments made in our U.K. facility to support the build-out of our internal sales infrastructure to sell directly to slot machine manufacturers and end user casino and gaming customers. To a lesser extent, expenditures in 2018 included computer and networking equipment for our U.S. operations. 



Capital expenditures and capitalized software development costs for 2019 are expected to be approximately $1.3 million, primarily for software development for our new restaurant solutions BOHA! products, new product tooling, new computer software and equipment purchases. 



Financing activities: We used $0.9 million of cash from financing activities during the first three months of 2019 to pay dividends of $0.7 million and $0.2 million related to the relinquishment of shares to pay for withholding taxes on stock issued from our stock compensation plan. During the first three months of 2018, we used $2.4 million of cash from financing activities to purchase $1.6 million of common stock for treasury, to pay dividends of $0.7 million to common shareholders and $0.2 million related to the relinquishment of shares to pay for withholding taxes on stock issued from our stock compensation plan, partially offset by proceeds from stock option exercises of $0.1 million.

Credit Facility and Borrowings 



We maintain a credit facility (the "TD Bank Credit Facility") with TD Bank N.A. (“TD Bank”), which provides for a $20 million revolving credit line. On November 21, 2017, we signed an amendment to the TD Bank Credit Facility through November 28, 2022. Borrowings under the revolving credit line bear a floating rate of interest at the prime rate minus one percent and are secured by a lien on all of our assets. We also pay a fee of 0.125% on unused borrowings under the revolving credit line. The amendment increased the amount of revolving credit loans we may use to fund future cash dividend payments or treasury share buybacks to $12.5 million from $10 million.  



The TD Bank Credit Facility imposes certain quarterly financial covenants on us and restricts, among other things, our ability to incur additional indebtedness and the creation of other liens. We were in compliance with all financial covenants of the TD Bank Credit Facility at March 31, 2019. The following table lists the financial covenants and the performance measurements at March 31, 2019: 



  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 



As of March 31, 2019, borrowings available under the TD Bank Credit facility were $20 million. 



Shareholder Dividend Payments 



In 2012, our Board of Directors initiated a quarterly cash dividend program which is subject to the Board’s approval each quarter. Our Board of Directors declared an increase to the quarterly cash dividend from $0.06 to $0.07 per share in May 2013, from $0.07 to $0.08 per share in May 2014, and from $0.08 to $0.09 per share in May 2017. Dividends declared and paid on our common stock totaled $0.7 million or $0.09 per share in the first quarter of both 2019 and 2018. On April 30, 2019 our Board of Directors approved the second quarter 2019 dividend in the amount of $0.09 per share payable on or about June 14, 2019 to common shareholders of record at the close of business on May 20, 2019. We expect to pay approximately $2.7 million in cash dividends to our common shareholders during 2019. 



Stock Repurchase Program 



On March 1, 2018, our Board of Directors approved a new stock repurchase program (the “2018 Stock Repurchase Program”). Under the 2018 Stock Repurchase Program, we are authorized to repurchase up to $5 million of our outstanding shares of common stock from time to time in the open market at prevailing market prices based on market conditions, share price and other factors. The 2018 Stock Repurchase Program expires on December 31, 2019, if we do not discontinue the repurchase program prior to such time. We use the cost method to account for treasury stock purchases, under which the price paid for the stock is charged to the treasury stock account. Repurchases of our common stock are accounted for as of the settlement date. During the three months ended March 31, 2019, we repurchased no shares of our common stock. During the three months ended March 31, 2018, we repurchased 122,780 shares of our common stock for approximately $1.6 million at an average price per share of $12.72.  



Resource Sufficiency 



We believe that our cash and cash equivalents on hand, our expected cash flows generated from operating activities and borrowings available under our TD Bank Credit Facility will provide sufficient resources to meet our working capital needs, finance our capital expenditures and additions to capitalized software, and dividend payments, and meet our liquidity requirements through at least the next twelve months. 



Contractual Obligations / Off-Balance Sheet ArrangementsThe disclosure of payments we have committed to make under our contractual obligations is set forth under Part II, Item 7, “Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Contractual Obligations” of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018. There have been no material changes in our contractual obligations outside the ordinary course of business since December 31, 2018. 



We have no material off-balance sheet arrangements as defined in Item 303(a)(4)(ii) of Regulation S-K. 



 Item 2.  UNREGISTERED SALES OF EQUITY SECURITIES AND USE OF PROCEEDS       



On March 1, 2018, our Board of Directors approved the 2018 Stock Repurchase Program. Under the 2018 Stock Repurchase Program, we are authorized to repurchase up to $5 million of our outstanding shares of common stock from time to time in the open market through December 31, 2019 at prevailing market prices based on market conditions, share price and other factors. During the three months ended March 31, 2019, we purchased no shares of our common stock. As of March 31, 2019, $3 million remains authorized for future repurchase under the 2018 Stock Repurchase Program. The following table summarizes the repurchase of our common stock in the three months ended March 31, 2019:
