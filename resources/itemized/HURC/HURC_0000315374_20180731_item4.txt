 Item 4.CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES
We conducted an evaluation, under the supervision and with participation of management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of July 31, 2018, pursuant to Rule 13a-15(b) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.
Based upon that evaluation, our management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of the evaluation date.
There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the three months ended July 31, 2018 that materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
