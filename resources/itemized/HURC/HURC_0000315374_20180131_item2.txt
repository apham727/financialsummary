 Item 2.MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
EXECUTIVE OVERVIEW
Hurco Companies, Inc. is an international, industrial technology company operating in a single segment.
We design, manufacture and sell computerized (i.e., Computer Numeric Control, or CNC) machine tools, consisting primarily of vertical machining centers (mills) and turning centers (lathes), to companies in the metal cutting industry through a worldwide sales, service and distribution network.
Although the majority of our computer control systems and software products are proprietary, they predominantly use industry standard personal computer components.
Our computer control systems and software products are primarily sold as integral components of our computerized machine tool products.
We also provide machine tool components, software options, control upgrades, accessories and replacement parts for our products, as well as customer service and training support.
The following overview is intended to provide a brief explanation of the principal factors that have contributed to our recent financial performance.
This overview is intended to be read in conjunction with the more detailed information included in our financial statements that appear elsewhere in this report.
The market for machine tools is international in scope.
We have both significant foreign sales and significant foreign manufacturing operations.
During the first three months of fiscal 2018, approximately 56% of our revenues were attributable to customers in Europe, where we typically sell more of our higher-performance, higher-priced VMX series machines.
Additionally, approximately 13% of our revenues were attributable to customers in the Asia Pacific region, where we sell more of our entry-level, lower-priced machines, but where we also encounter greater price pressures.
We sell our products through more than 190 independent agents and distributors throughout North and South America (the “Americas”), Europe and Asia.
Although some distributors carry competitive products, we are the primary line for the majority of our distributors globally.
We also have our own direct sales and service organizations in China, France, Germany, India, Italy, Poland, Singapore, South Africa, Taiwan, the United Kingdom and certain parts of the United States, which are among the world's principal machine tool consuming markets.
The vast majority of our machine tools are manufactured to our specifications primarily by our wholly-owned subsidiary in Taiwan, Hurco Manufacturing Ltd. (“HML”).
Machine castings and components to support HML’s production are manufactured at our wholly-owned subsidiary in Ningbo, China, Ningbo Machine Tool Co., Ltd.
Components to support our SRT line of five-axis machining centers, such as the direct drive spindle, swivel head and rotary table, are manufactured by our wholly-owned subsidiary in Italy, LCM.
Our sales to foreign customers are denominated, and payments by those customers are made, in the prevailing currencies in the countries in which those customers are located (primarily the Euro, Pound Sterling and Chinese Yuan).
Our product costs are incurred and paid primarily in the New Taiwan Dollar and the U.S Dollar.
Changes in currency exchange rates may have a material effect on our operating results and consolidated financial statements as reported under U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles.
For example, when the U.S. Dollar weakens in value relative to a foreign currency, sales made, and expenses incurred, in that currency when translated to U.S.
Dollars for reporting in our financial statements, are higher than would be the case when the U.S. Dollar is stronger.
In the comparison of our period-to-period results, we discuss the effect of currency translation on those results, which reflect translation to U.S.
Dollars at exchange rates prevailing during the period covered by those financial statements.
Our high levels of foreign manufacturing and sales also expose us to cash flow risks due to fluctuating currency exchange rates.
We seek to mitigate those risks through the use of various derivative instruments – principally foreign currency forward exchange contracts.
See Note 2 of Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.
RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
Three Months Ended January 31, 2018 Compared to Three Months Ended January 31, 2017
Sales and Service Fees.
Sales and service fees for the first quarter of fiscal 2018 were $68.4 million, an increase of $19.7 million, or 40%, compared to the corresponding prior year period and included a favorable currency impact of $4.4 million, or 9%, when translating foreign sales to U.S. dollars for financial reporting purposes.
Sales and Service Fees by Geographic Region
Sales in the Americas for the first quarter of fiscal 2018 increased by 26% compared to the corresponding period in fiscal 2017, and reflected improved U.S. market conditions and demand from U.S. customers for all product lines (Hurco, Takumi and Milltronics).
European sales for the first quarter of fiscal 2018 increased by 50%, compared to the corresponding period in fiscal 2017, and included a favorable currency impact of 15%, when translating foreign sales to U.S. dollars for financial reporting purposes.
The increase in European sales for the first quarter of fiscal 2018 was primarily attributable to increased customer demand for Hurco and Takumi vertical milling machines in Germany, the United Kingdom, France and Italy.
Asian Pacific sales for the first quarter of fiscal 2018 increased by 41%, compared to the corresponding period in fiscal 2017, and included a favorable currency impact of 8%, when translating foreign sales to U.S. dollars for financial reporting purposes.
The increase in Asian Pacific sales for the first quarter of 2018 was primarily attributable to increased customer demand of Hurco and Takumi vertical milling machines in China, and included a notable increase in sales of Hurco machines in Southeast Asia.
Sales and Service Fees by Product Category
† Amounts shown do not include computer control systems and software sold as an integrated component of computerized machine systems.
The increase in sales of Computerized Machine Tools during the first quarter of fiscal 2018 compared to the corresponding prior year period was primarily due to increased customer demand from customers across all three regions and for all product lines (Hurco, Takumi and Milltronics).
Orders.
Orders for the first quarter of fiscal 2018 were a record $76.9 million, an increase of $15.9 million, or 26%, compared to the corresponding period in fiscal 2017, and included a favorable currency impact of $5.0 million, or 8%, when translating foreign orders to U.S. dollars.
Orders in the Americas for the first quarter of fiscal 2018 increased by 1%, compared to the corresponding period in fiscal 2017.
This increase was primarily attributable to slight increased customer demand for higher-performance Hurco machines.
European orders for the first quarter increased by 37%, compared to the corresponding prior year period, and included a favorable currency impact of 13% when translating foreign orders to U.S. dollars.
The year-over-year increase in orders was driven primarily by increased customer demand for Hurco and Takumi vertical milling machines in Germany, Italy and France.
Asian Pacific orders for the first quarter increased by 46%, compared to the corresponding prior year period, and included a favorable currency impact of 11% when translating foreign orders to U.S. dollars.
The year-over-year increase in orders was driven primarily by increased customer demand for Hurco vertical milling machines in China.
Gross Profit.
Gross profit for the first quarter of fiscal 2018 was $20.1 million, or 29% of sales, compared to $12.6 million, or 26% of sales, for the corresponding prior year period.
The year-over-year increase in gross profit as a percentage of sales reflected the increased volume of sales of Hurco machines, particularly in Europe, and the favorable impact of foreign currency translation compared to the corresponding prior year period.
Operating Expenses.
Selling, general and administrative expenses for the first quarter of fiscal 2018 were $13.0 million, or 19% of sales, compared to $11.2 million, or 23% of sales, in the corresponding period in fiscal 2017, and included an unfavorable currency impact of $0.7 million when translating foreign expenses to U.S. dollars for financial reporting purposes.
Operating Income.
Operating income for the first quarter of fiscal 2018 was $7.2 million compared to $1.4 million for the corresponding period in fiscal 2017.
The increase in operating income year-over-year was primarily driven by the increased volume of sales of Hurco machines, particularly in Europe, and the favorable impact of foreign currency translation compared to the corresponding prior year period.
Other Income (Expense), Net.
Other income (expense), net in the first quarter of fiscal 2018 increased by $0.2 million from the corresponding period in fiscal 2017 primarily due to foreign currency gains on transactions denominated in foreign currencies experienced in fiscal 2018 compared to foreign currency losses experienced in fiscal 2017.
Income Taxes.
The effective tax rate for the first quarter of fiscal 2018 was 61% compared to 38% in the corresponding prior year period.
The increase in the effective tax rate for the first quarter of fiscal 2018 compared to the corresponding prior year period was primarily due to one-time provisional adjustments related to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the “Tax Reform Act”) that was enacted on December 22, 2017.
The Tax Reform Act, among other things, lowered the U.S. corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21% effective January 1, 2018, implemented a territorial tax system, and imposed a tax on the deemed repatriated earnings of foreign subsidiaries.
As a result of the change in the tax law, a one-time non-cash tax charge of $0.4 million related to the revaluation of deferred tax assets and liabilities was recorded in the first quarter of fiscal 2018.
In addition, a one-time charge of $2.5 million related to the transition tax on the deemed repatriation of accumulated foreign income was recorded in the first quarter of fiscal 2018, which amount is subject to adjustment during the measurement period of up to one year following the December 2017 enactment date, as provided by recent SEC guidance.
The impact of these charges increased our effective rate by approximately 39% for the first quarter of fiscal 2018.
Excluding the impact of these charges, earnings per diluted share would have been $0.43 higher than the earnings per diluted share we reported for the first quarter of fiscal 2018.
LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES
At January 31, 2018, we had cash and cash equivalents of $80.2 million, compared to $66.3 million at October 31, 2017.
Approximately 62% of the $80.2 million of cash and cash equivalents is denominated in U.S.
Dollars.
The balance is attributable to our foreign operations and is held in the local currencies of our various foreign entities, subject to fluctuations in currency exchange rates.
We do not believe that the indefinite reinvestment of these funds offshore impairs our ability to meet our domestic working capital needs.
Working capital was $183.2 million at January 31, 2018 compared to $175.5 million at October 31, 2017.
The increase in working capital was primarily due to an increase in inventories.
Capital expenditures of $1.5 million during the first three months of fiscal 2018 were primarily for capital improvements in existing facilities and software development costs.
We funded these expenditures with cash on hand.
At January 31, 2018, we had $1.6 million of borrowings outstanding under our China credit facility.
We had no other debt or borrowings under any of our other credit facilities.
At January 31, 2018, we had an aggregate of $19.9 million available for borrowing under our credit facilities and were in compliance with all covenants relating thereto.
We believe our cash position and borrowing capacity under our credit facilities provide adequate liquidity to fund our operations over the next twelve months and allow us to remain committed to our strategic plan of product innovation and targeted penetration of developing markets.
We continue to receive and review information on businesses and assets for potential acquisition, including intellectual property assets that are available for purchase.
CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES
Our accounting policies, which are described in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended October 31, 2017, require management to make significant estimates and assumptions using information available at the time the estimates are made.
These estimates and assumptions significantly affect various reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, and expenses.
If our future experience differs materially from these estimates and assumptions, our results of operations and financial condition would be affected.
There were no material changes to our critical accounting policies during the first three months of fiscal 2018.
CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS AND COMMITMENTS
There have been no material changes related to our contractual obligations and commitments from the information provided in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended October 31, 2017.
OFF BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS
From time to time, our subsidiaries guarantee third party payment obligations in connection with the sale of machines to customers that use financing.
We follow FASB guidance for accounting for guarantees (codified in ASC 460).
As of January 31, 2018, we had 27 outstanding third party payment guarantees totaling approximately $1.0 million.
The terms of these guarantees are consistent with the underlying customer financing terms.
Upon shipment of a machine, the customer assumes the risk of ownership.
The customer does not obtain title, however, until it has paid for the machine.
A retention of title clause allows us to recover the machine if the customer defaults on the financing.
We accrue liabilities under these guarantees at fair value, which amounts are insignificant.
