Note 1. Basis of Presentation



Basis of Presentation



The unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements of Juniper Networks, Inc. (the “Company” or “Juniper”) have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“U.S. GAAP”) for interim financial information. Accordingly, they do not include all of the information and footnotes required by U.S. GAAP for complete financial statements. The Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet as of December 31, 2017, has been derived from the audited Consolidated Financial Statements at that date. In the opinion of management, all adjustments, including normal recurring accruals, considered necessary for a fair presentation have been included. The results of operations for the three months ended March 31, 2018, are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for the year ending December 31, 2018, or any future period. 



The information included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q (“Report”) should be read in conjunction with “Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,” “Risk Factors,” “Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk,” and the Consolidated Financial Statements and footnotes thereto included in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2017 (the "Form 10-K"). 



The Company adopted Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") Accounting Standards Update ("ASU") No. 2016-18 (Topic 230) Statement of Cash Flow: Restricted Cash, effective January 1, 2018, using the retrospective transition method. Restricted cash of $47.4 million and $48.7 million in the prior period have been included with cash and cash equivalents when reconciling the beginning and ending total amounts, respectively, on the statement of cash flows for the three months ended March 31, 2017, to conform to the current period presentation. The adoption did not have a material impact on the cash flow activity presented on the Company's Condensed Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows for the three months ended March 31, 2017. See Note 3, Cash Equivalents and Investments for a reconciliation of the cash balances within our Condensed Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows to the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets.



The preparation of the financial statements and related disclosures in accordance with U.S. GAAP requires the Company to make judgments, assumptions, and estimates that affect the amounts reported in the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements and the accompanying notes. Actual results could differ materially from those estimates under different assumptions or conditions.



Note 2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies



Except for the change in certain policies upon adoption of the accounting standards described below, there have been no material changes to the Company's significant accounting policies, compared to the accounting policies described in Note 2, Significant Accounting Policies, in Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of Part II of the Form 10-K.



Recently Adopted Accounting Standard



Comprehensive Income: Effective January 1, 2018, the Company early adopted FASB ASU No. 2018-02 (Topic 220), Income Statement - Reporting Comprehensive Income, issued in February 2018, with an election to reclassify stranded tax effects resulting from the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the "Tax Act"), from accumulated other comprehensive income to retained earnings. The adoption resulted in a reclassification of $5.7 million in income from accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) to accumulated deficit as of the adoption date. The comparative information has not been restated and continues to be reported under the accounting standards in effect for those periods. 



Financial Instruments: On January 1, 2018, the Company adopted FASB ASU No. 2016-01, Financial Instruments—Overall: Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities and FASB ASU No. 2018-03, Technical Corrections and Improvements to Financial Instruments - Overall, which changes how entities classify and measure equity investments and present changes in the fair value of financial liabilities measured under the fair value option. The guidance also updates certain presentation and disclosure requirements. The impact of the adoption on the Company's Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements was as follows:

Juniper Networks, Inc.



Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)



(Unaudited)



•Equity investments with readily determinable fair value: The Company is required to account for changes in fair value of its equity investments with readily determinable fair value in the statements of operations. The Company adopted the standard using a modified retrospective transition method, resulting in no impact to the January 1, 2018 opening accumulated deficit balance.



•Equity investments without readily determinable fair value: The Company elected the measurement alternative, defined as cost, less impairments, adjusted for subsequent observable price changes on a prospective basis for all equity investments without readily determinable fair value and is required to account for any subsequent observable changes in fair value in the statements of operations. In addition, the Company is required to perform a qualitative assessment considering impairment indicators at each reporting period to evaluate whether the investment is impaired. If the investment is impaired, the Company will estimate the fair value of the investment and record an impairment loss in the statements of operations equal to the difference between the estimated fair value of the investment and its carrying amount. See Note 3, Cash Equivalents and Investments for additional disclosures required upon adopting the standard. 



•Deferred tax assets: The Company is required to assess the realizability of deferred tax assets related to available for sale debt securities in combination with its other deferred tax assets, using the same sources of taxable income that are used to assess the need for a valuation allowance on other deferred tax assets. The Company adopted the standard using a modified retrospective transition method, resulting in no impact to the January 1, 2018 opening accumulated deficit balance.



Revenue Recognition: On January 1, 2018, the Company adopted FASB ASU No. 2014-09 (Topic 606) - Revenue from Contracts with Customers (“ASU 2014-09” or "Topic 606"), which provides guidance for revenue recognition that superseded the revenue recognition requirements in Accounting Standards Codification ("ASC") Topic 605, Revenue Recognition ("Topic 605") and most industry specific guidance. Under ASU 2014-09, revenue is recognized when promised goods or services are transferred to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the Company expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. The Company adopted ASU 2014-09 under the modified retrospective approach, applying the amendments to prospective reporting periods. Results for reporting periods beginning after January 1, 2018 are presented under Topic 606, while prior period amounts are not adjusted and continue to be reported in accordance with the historic accounting under Topic 605. 



The cumulative effect of the changes made to our Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet as of January 1, 2018 for the adoption of Topic 606 to all contracts with customers that were not completed as of December 31, 2017 was recorded as an adjustment to accumulated deficit as of the adoption date as follows:



[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Juniper Networks, Inc.



Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)



(Unaudited)



Upon adoption, the Company recorded a cumulative effect adjustment of $313.5 million, net of tax adjustment of $61.4 million, which decreased the January 1, 2018 opening accumulated deficit balance on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet, primarily as a result of the following items:



•Distributor Sales: Under Topic 606, the Company recognizes revenue from sales to distributors upon delivery of the product to the distributor, rather than upon delivery of the product to the end customer. Rebates and incentives offered to distributors, which are earned when sales to end customers are completed, are estimated at the point of revenue recognition. 



•Software Revenue: Under Topic 605, the Company deferred revenue for software licenses where vendor-specific objective evidence ("VSOE") of fair value had not been established for undelivered items (primarily services). Under Topic 606, revenue for software licenses is recognized at the time of delivery unless the ongoing services provide frequent, critical updates to the software, without which the software functionality would be rapidly diminished. 



•Variable Consideration: Some of the Company's contracts include penalties, extended payment terms, acceptance provisions or other price variability that precluded revenue recognition under Topic 605 because of the requirement for amounts to be fixed or determinable. Topic 606 requires the Company to estimate and account for variable consideration as a reduction of the transaction price. 



•Revenue Allocation: Similar to Topic 605, Topic 606 requires an allocation of revenue between deliverables, or performance obligations, within an arrangement. Topic 605 restricted the allocation of revenue that is contingent on future deliverables to current deliverables; however, Topic 606 removes this restriction. In addition, the nature of the performance obligations identified within a contract under Topic 606 as compared to Topic 605 will impact the allocation of the transaction price between product and services. 



•Contract Acquisition Costs: Topic 606 requires the deferral and amortization of “incremental” costs incurred to obtain a contract where the associated contract duration is greater than one year. The primary contract acquisition cost for the Company are sales commissions. Prior to January 1, 2018, the Company expensed sales commissions. The change required by Topic 606 resulted in the creation of an asset on January 1, 2018.



The impact of adoption of Topic 606 on the Company's Condensed Consolidated Statement of Operations and Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet was as follows (in millions):



[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

* Except as disclosed above, the adoption of Topic 606 did not have a significant impact on the Company’s Condensed Consolidated Statement of Operations for the three months ended March 31, 2018.

Revenue Recognition



Revenue is recognized when promised goods or services are transferred to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the Company expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services by following a five-step process, (1) identify the contract with a customer, (2) identify the performance obligations in the contract, (3) determine the transaction price, (4) allocate the transaction price, and (5) recognize revenue when or as the Company satisfies a performance obligation, as further described below.



Identify the contract with a customer. The Company generally considers a sales contract or agreement with an approved purchase order as a customer contract provided that collection is considered probable, which is assessed based on the creditworthiness of the customer as determined by credit checks, payment histories, and/or other circumstances. The Company combines contracts with a customer if contracts are negotiated with a single commercial substance or contain price dependencies.



Identify the performance obligations in the contract. Product performance obligations include hardware and software licenses and service performance obligations include maintenance, software post-contract support, training, and professional services. Certain software licenses and related post-contract support are combined into a single performance obligation when the maintenance updates are critical to the continued functionality of the software. 



Determine the transaction price. The transaction price for the Company’s contracts with its customers consists of both fixed and variable consideration provided it is probable that a significant reversal of revenue will not occur when the uncertainty related to variable consideration is resolved. Fixed consideration includes amounts to be contractually billed to the customer while variable consideration includes estimates for rights of return, rebates, and price protection, which are based on historical sales returns and price protection credits, specific criteria outlined in rebate agreements, and other factors known at the time. The Company generally invoices customers for hardware, software licenses and related maintenance arrangements at time of delivery, and professional services either upfront or upon meeting certain milestones. Customer invoices are generally due within 30 to 90 days after issuance. The Company’s contracts with customers typically do not include significant financing components as the period between the transfer of performance obligations and timing of payment are generally within one year.



Allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract. For contracts that contain multiple performance obligations, the Company allocates the transaction price to the performance obligations on a relative standalone selling price basis. Standalone selling prices are based on multiple factors including, but not limited to historical discounting trends for products and

services, pricing practices in different geographies and through different sales channels, gross margin objectives, internal costs, competitor pricing strategies, and industry technology lifecycles.



Recognize revenue when or as the Company satisfies a performance obligation. Revenue for hardware and certain software licenses, are recognized at a point in time, which is generally upon shipment or delivery. Certain software licenses combined with post-contract support are recognized over time on a ratable basis over the term of the license. Revenue for maintenance and software post-contract support is recognized over time on a ratable basis over the contract term. Revenue from training and professional services is recognized over time as services are completed or ratably over the contractual period of generally one year or less.



Deferred Commissions



Sales commissions earned by the Company’s sales force are considered incremental and recoverable costs of obtaining a contract with a customer. These costs are deferred and then amortized over a period of benefit which is typically over the term of the customer contracts as initial commission rates and renewal rates are the same. Amortization expense is included in sales and marketing expenses in the accompanying Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations.



Recent Accounting Standards Not Yet Effective



Derivatives and Hedging: In August 2017, the FASB issued ASU No. 2017-12 (Topic 815) Derivatives and Hedging — Targeted Improvements to Accounting for Hedging Activities, which expands an entity's ability to hedge financial and nonfinancial risk components and amends how companies assess effectiveness as well as changes the presentation and disclosure requirements. The new standard is to be applied on a modified retrospective basis and is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2018, with early adoption permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of adoption on the Consolidated Financial Statements.



Amortization on Purchased Callable Debt Securities: In March 2017, the FASB issued ASU No. 2017-08 Receivables—Nonrefundable Fees and Other Costs (Subtopic 310-20): Premium Amortization on Purchased Callable Debt Securities which shortens the amortization period for the premium on certain purchased callable debt securities to the earliest call date. The ASU will not impact debt securities held at a discount. This standard is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim reporting periods within those annual reporting periods, and is to be applied on a modified retrospective basis with early adoption permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of adoption on the Consolidated Financial Statements.



Simplifying the Test for Goodwill Impairment: In January 2017, the FASB issued ASU No. 2017-04 (Topic 350) Intangibles—Goodwill and Other: Simplifying the Test for Goodwill Impairment, which removes Step 2 of the goodwill impairment test, which requires a hypothetical purchase price allocation. Under the amended guidance, a goodwill impairment charge will now be recognized for the amount by which the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, not to exceed the carrying amount of goodwill. This ASU will be applied on a prospective basis and is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2019, with early adoption permitted for any impairment tests performed after January 1, 2017. 



Credit Losses on Financial Instruments: In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-13 (Topic 326) Financial Instruments—Credit Losses: Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments, which provides more decision-useful information about the expected credit losses on financial instruments and changes the loss impairment methodology. This pronouncement is effective for reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2019, and interim periods within those fiscal years, using a modified retrospective adoption method. Early adoption is permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the impact that this standard will have on its Consolidated Financial Statements and disclosures.



Leases: In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02 (Topic 842), Leases, which requires recognition of lease assets and lease liabilities on the balance sheet by lessees for leases classified as operating leases with a lease term of more than twelve months. This ASU should be applied on a modified retrospective basis and is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, and interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted. The Company has commenced the assessment phase to determine the approach for implementing this standard and expects it to have a material impact on its Consolidated Balance Sheets and disclosures. The Company is still evaluating the impact this standard will have on the Consolidated Statements of Operations.

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]



[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]



For available-for-sale debt securities that have unrealized losses, the Company assesses impairment by evaluating various factors, including whether (i) it has the intention to sell any of these investments and (ii) whether it is more likely than not that it will be required to sell any of these investments before recovery of the entire amortized cost basis. As of March 31, 2018, the Company had 583 investments in unrealized loss positions. The gross unrealized losses related to these investments were primarily due to changes in market interest rates. The Company anticipates that it will recover the entire amortized cost basis of such available-for-sale debt securities and has determined that no other-than-temporary impairments associated with credit losses were required to be recognized during the three months ended March 31, 2018 and March 31, 2017.



During the three months ended March 31, 2018 and March 31, 2017, there were no material gross realized gains or losses from available-for-sale debt securities.

________________________________



(1) Prior to January 1, 2018, money market funds were classified as available-for-sale securities and accounted for at fair value with unrealized gains and losses recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). Realized gains or losses from sales or impairments were recognized in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations.



(2) Prior to January 1, 2018, mutual funds related to the Company's non-qualified deferred compensation ("NQDC") plan, were classified as trading securities. Unrealized gains or losses were recognized in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations.



(3) Prior to January 1, 2018, certain investments in privately-held companies were accounted for at cost less impairment. Realized gains or losses from sales or impairments were recognized in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations.



For the three months ended March 31, 2018 and March 31, 2017, there were no material unrealized gains or losses recognized for equity investments.



Restricted Cash and Investments



There have been no material changes to the composition of the Company's restricted cash and investments as described in Note 4, Cash Equivalents and Investments, in Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of Part II of the Form 10-K, except that the restricted investments are now designated as equity investments upon adoption of ASU 2016-01 as described in Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies. As of March 31, 2018, total restricted cash and investments was $98.5 million, of which $62.4 million was included in prepaid expenses and other current assets and $36.1 million was included in other long-term assets on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets.

Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)



(Unaudited)



The Company's Level 2 available-for-sale debt securities are priced using quoted market prices for similar instruments or non-binding market prices that are corroborated by observable market data. The Company uses inputs such as actual trade data, benchmark yields, broker/dealer quotes, or alternative pricing sources with reasonable levels of price transparency which are obtained from quoted market prices, independent pricing vendors, or other sources, to determine the ultimate fair value of these assets. The Company's derivative instruments are classified as Level 2, as they are not actively traded and are valued using pricing models that use observable market inputs. The Company's policy is to recognize asset or liability transfers among Level 1, Level 2, and Level 3 at the beginning of the quarter in which a change in circumstances resulted in a transfer. During the three months ended March 31, 2018, the Company had no transfers between levels of the fair value hierarchy of its assets or liabilities measured at fair value. 



All of the Company's privately-held debt and redeemable preferred stock securities are classified as Level 3 assets due to the lack of observable inputs to determine fair value. The Company estimates the fair value of its privately-held debt and redeemable preferred stock securities on a recurring basis using an analysis of the financial condition and near-term prospects of the investee, including recent financing activities and the investee's capital structure. During the three months ended March 31, 2018, there were no significant activities related to privately-held debt and redeemable preferred stocks securities. 



Assets and Liabilities Measured at Fair Value on a Nonrecurring Basis



Certain of the Company's assets, including intangible assets and goodwill are measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis, when they are deemed to be other-than temporarily impaired. There were no impairment charges recognized during the three months ended March 31, 2018.



Equity investments without readily determinable fair value are measured at fair value, when they are deemed to be impaired or when there is an adjustment from observable price changes. For the three months ended March 31, 2018, there was no impairment charges or adjustments resulting from observable price changes for equity investments without readily determinable fair value. 



As of March 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017, the Company had no liabilities required to be measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis.



Assets and Liabilities Not Measured at Fair Value



The carrying amounts of the Company's accounts receivable, accounts payable, and other accrued liabilities approximate fair value due to their short maturities. As of March 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017, the estimated fair value of the Company's short-term and long-term debt in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets was $2,200.0 million and $2,252.9 million, respectively, based on observable market inputs (Level 2). The carrying value of the promissory note issued to the Company in connection with the previously completed sale of Junos Pulse (the “Pulse Note”), of $61.2 million approximates its fair value as of March 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017. The Pulse Note is classified as a Level 3 asset due to the lack of observable inputs to determine fair value.

Note 5. Derivative Instruments



The Company uses derivatives to partially offset its market exposure to fluctuations in certain foreign currencies and does not enter into derivatives for speculative or trading purposes. 



The notional amount of the Company's foreign currency derivatives are summarized as follows (in millions): 



[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]



Cash Flow Hedges



The Company uses foreign currency forward contracts to hedge the Company's planned cost of revenues and operating expenses denominated in foreign currencies. These derivatives are designated as cash flow hedges. Execution of cash flow hedge derivatives typically occurs every month with maturities of eighteen months or less. As of March 31, 2018, an estimated $15.9 million of existing net gains within accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) is expected to be reclassified into earnings within the next 12 months.



The Company recognized an unrealized gain of $13.4 million and $7.0 million in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) for the effective portion of its derivative instruments for the three months ended March 31, 2018 and March 31, 2017, respectively. The Company reclassified a gain of $5.6 million out of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) to cost of revenues and operating expenses in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations during the three months ended March 31, 2018. The amount reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) to cost of revenues and operating expenses in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations during the three months ended March 31, 2017 was not material.



The ineffective portion of the Company's derivative instruments recognized in its Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations was not material during the three months ended March 31, 2018 and March 31, 2017.



See Note 4, Fair Value Measurements, for the fair values of the Company's derivative instruments in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets.



Non-Designated Derivatives 



The Company also uses foreign currency forward contracts to mitigate variability in gains and losses generated from the remeasurement of certain monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies. These foreign exchange forward contracts typically have maturities of approximately one to three months. The outstanding non-designated derivative instruments are carried at fair value. Changes in the fair value of these derivatives recorded in other expense, net within the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations were not material during the three months ended March 31, 2018 and March 31, 2017.

During 2017, the Company initiated a restructuring plan (the “2017 Restructuring Plan”) to realign its workforce and increase operational efficiencies. The 2017 Restructuring Plan consisted of severance and contract termination costs that were recorded to restructuring (benefits) charges in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations. 



Restructuring liabilities are reported within other accrued liabilities in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. The following table provides a summary of changes in the restructuring liabilities (in millions):



[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]



The Company does not anticipate future charges under the 2017 Restructuring Plan and expects to pay the remaining restructuring liabilities in the second quarter of 2018, at which time, the Company would consider the 2017 Restructuring Plan to be substantially completed.



Note 8. Financing Arrangements



The Company provides certain customers with access to extended financing arrangements that allow for longer payment terms than those typically provided by the Company by factoring accounts receivable to third-party financing providers (“financing providers”). The program does not and is not intended to affect the timing of the Company's revenue recognition. Under the financing arrangements, proceeds from the financing providers are due to the Company within 1 to 90 days from the sale of the receivable. In these transactions with the financing providers, the Company surrenders control over the transferred assets. 



Pursuant to the financing arrangements for the sale of receivables, the Company sold net receivables of $35.8 million and $25.4 million during the three months ended March 31, 2018 and March 31, 2017, respectively. The Company received cash proceeds from financing providers of $33.0 million and $23.1 million during the three months ended March 31, 2018 and March 31, 2017, respectively. As of March 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017, the amounts owed by the financing providers were $16.5 million and $13.7 million, respectively, which were recorded in accounts receivable in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets.



Note 9. Equity



Cash Dividends on Shares of Common Stock



During the three months ended March 31, 2018, the Company declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.18 per share of common stock on January 30, 2018, which was paid on March 22, 2018 to stockholders of record on March 1, 2018 in the aggregate amount of $62.1 million. Any future dividends, and the establishment of record and payment dates, are subject to approval by the Board of Directors (the “Board”) of Juniper Networks or an authorized committee thereof. See Note 15, Subsequent Events, for discussion of the Company's dividend declaration subsequent to March 31, 2018. 



Stock Repurchase Activities 



In January 2018, the Board approved a $2.0 billion share repurchase program, including $750.0 million to be used pursuant to an accelerated share repurchase program ("2018 Stock Repurchase Program"). The 2018 Stock Repurchase Program replaces the previous authorization approved by the Board in 2014 ("2014 Stock Repurchase Program"). 



As part of the 2018 Stock Repurchase Program, in February 2018, the Company entered into an accelerated share repurchase program (the "ASR") with two financial institutions to repurchase $750.0 million of the Company's common stock. During the three months ended March 31, 2018, the Company made an up-front payment of $750.0 million pursuant to the ASR and received an initial 23.3 million shares of the Company's common stock for an aggregate price of $600.0 million, based on the market value of the Company's common stock on the date of the transaction. The initial shares received by the Company were retired, accounted

for as a reduction to stockholders' equity in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets, and treated as a repurchase of common stock for purposes of calculating earnings per share. The forward contract for the remaining $150.0 million is considered indexed to the Company's common stock and met all of the applicable criteria for equity classification.



The total number of shares of the Company's common stock to be ultimately received under the ASR will be calculated using the average daily volume weighted average price of the Company's stock during the repurchase period, less an agreed upon discount. Final settlement of the transactions under the ASR is expected to be completed no sooner than May 11, 2018 and no later than August 6, 2018. If the initial shares received are less than the calculated total number of shares to be ultimately received under the ASR, then the financial institutions will be required to deliver additional shares of common stock to the Company at settlement. If however, the initial shares received are greater than the calculated total number of shares to be ultimately received, the Company has the option to either issue shares of common stock or make cash payments to the financial institutions.



The following table summarizes the Company's stock repurchases and retirements, including prepayment pursuant to the ASR, under its stock repurchase programs (in millions, except per share amounts):

(2) Shares repurchased under the 2014 Stock Repurchase Program.



As of March 31, 2018, there was $1.3 billion of authorized funds remaining under the 2018 Stock Repurchase Program.



Future share repurchases under the 2018 Stock Repurchase Program will be subject to a review of the circumstances at that time and will be made from time to time in private transactions or open market purchases as permitted by securities laws and other legal requirements. The Company's 2018 Stock Repurchase Program may be discontinued at any time.



In addition to repurchases under the 2018 Stock Repurchase Program, the Company also repurchases common stock from certain employees in connection with the net issuance of shares to satisfy applicable tax withholding requirements upon the vesting of certain stock awards issued to such employees. Repurchases associated with tax withholdings were not material during the three months ended March 31, 2018 and March 31, 2017.

Employee Stock Purchase Plan 



On November 6, 2017, the Company’s Compensation Committee amended and restated the ESPP to provide that for the offering period that begins on February 1, 2018, the ESPP will consist of a 24-month offering period with four 6-month purchase periods in each offering period. The purchase price for the Company’s common stock under the ESPP will be 85% of the lower of the fair market value of the shares at (1) the beginning of a rolling 2 year offering period or (2) the end of each 6-month purchase period during such offering period. The ESPP will continue in effect until February 25, 2028, unless terminated earlier under the provisions of the ESPP. 



For the three months ended March 31, 2018 and March 31, 2017, employees purchased approximately 1.3 million and 1.5 million shares of common stock through the ESPP at an average exercise price of $22.23 and $19.21 per share, respectively.

Note 12. Income Taxes



The following table provides details of income taxes (in millions, except percentages):



[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]



The Tax Act enacted in December 22, 2017 introduced significant changes to U.S. income tax law. Effective January 1, 2018, the Tax Act reduced the U.S. federal corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21% and created a minimum tax on foreign earnings. 



Due to the timing of the enactment and the complexity involved in applying the provisions of the Tax Act, the Company made reasonable estimates of the effects and recorded provisional amounts in the financial statements as of December 31, 2017. As the Company collects and prepares the necessary data, interprets the Tax Act and reviews any additional guidance issued by the U.S. Treasury Department, state revenue and taxation authorities and other standard-setting bodies, the Company may make adjustments to the provisional amounts which may materially impact its provision for income taxes from continuing operations in the period in which the adjustments are made. The adjustments made in the first quarter of 2018 were not material. The accounting for the tax effects of the Tax Act will be completed later in 2018.



The Tax Act also includes provisions for Global Intangible Low-Taxed Income (“GILTI”), which imposes taxes on foreign income in excess of a deemed return on tangible assets of foreign corporations. Because of the complexities of the new provisions, the Company is continuing to evaluate how the provisions will be accounted for under U.S. GAAP. Companies are allowed to make an accounting policy election of either (i) account for GILTI as a component of income tax expense in the period in which the Company is subject to the rules (the “period cost method”), or (ii) account for GILTI in the Company’s measurement of deferred taxes (the “deferred method”). The Company has not elected a method and will do so after completing its analysis of the GILTI provisions of the Tax Act depending on the analysis of the Company’s global income. Therefore, the Company has not recorded any potential deferred tax effects related to the GILTI in its financial statements and has no policy election regarding whether to record deferred taxes on GILTI or use the period cost method. The Company has however, included an estimate of the current GILTI impact in its annual effective tax rate for 2018. The Company expects to complete the accounting during the measurement period.



The Company's effective tax rate during the three months ended March 31, 2018 differs from the statutory rate of 21% primarily due to the benefit of the federal research and development credit and foreign earnings taxed at lower rates. The rate for the period includes a discrete benefit of 4.4% primarily related to the net impact of unrecognized tax benefits.



As of March 31, 2018, the total amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits was $263.1 million. 



The Company engages in continuous discussions and negotiations with tax authorities regarding tax matters in various jurisdictions. It is reasonably possible that the balance of unrecognized tax benefits could decrease up to $45.8 million within the next twelve months due to lapses of applicable statutes of limitations and the completion of tax review cycles in various tax jurisdictions. The balance primarily relates to matters involving U.S and non-U.S taxation of cross-border transactions and the utilization of losses.

Note 14. Commitments and Contingencies



Commitments



Except for the items below, there have been no material changes to the Company's commitments compared to the commitments described in Note 16, Commitments and Contingencies, in Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of Part II of the Form 10-K. 



Purchase Commitments with Contract Manufacturers and Suppliers



In order to reduce manufacturing lead times and in the interest of having access to adequate component supply, the Company enters into agreements with contract manufacturers and certain suppliers to procure inventory based on the Company's requirements. A significant portion of the Company's purchase commitments arising from these agreements consists of firm and non-cancelable commitments. These purchase commitments totaled $616.6 million as of March 31, 2018. 



The Company establishes a liability in connection with purchase commitments related to quantities in excess of its demand forecasts or obsolete materials charges for components purchased by the contract manufacturers based on the Company’s demand forecast or customer orders. As of March 31, 2018, the Company had accrued $25.8 million based on its estimate of such charges.



Guarantees



The Company enters into agreements with customers that contain indemnification provisions relating to potential situations where claims could be alleged that the Company’s products solely, or in combination with other third party products, infringe the intellectual property rights of a third-party. As of March 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017, the Company recorded $9.4 million and $20.4 million, respectively, for such indemnification obligations in other accrued liabilities and other long-term liabilities on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets.



Legal Proceedings



Investigations



The Company previously disclosed that the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") and the U.S. Department of Justice ("DOJ") were conducting investigations into possible violations by the Company of the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act ("FCPA"). The Company has been cooperating with these agencies regarding these matters. In the fourth quarter of 2017, the DOJ notified the Company that the DOJ has closed its investigation related to these matters without taking any action against the Company. The Company’s Audit Committee, with the assistance of independent advisors, has been investigating and conducting a thorough review of possible violations of the FCPA, and has made recommendations for remedial measures, including employee disciplinary actions in foreign jurisdictions, which the Company has implemented and continues to implement. The Company is unable to predict the duration, scope or outcome of the ongoing SEC investigation, but believes that an adverse outcome is reasonably possible. However, the Company is not able to estimate a reasonable range of possible loss. The SEC could take action against the Company or the Company could agree to settle. In such event, the Company could be required to pay substantial fines and sanctions and/or implement additional remedial measures; in addition, it may be determined that the Company violated the FCPA.



Other Litigations and Investigations



In addition to the investigations discussed above, the Company is involved in other investigations, disputes, litigations, and legal proceedings. The Company records an accrual for loss contingencies for legal proceedings when it believes that an unfavorable outcome is both (a) probable and (b) the amount or range of any possible loss is reasonably estimable. The Company intends to aggressively defend itself in these matters, and while there can be no assurances and the outcome of these matters is currently not determinable, the Company currently believes that none of these existing claims or proceedings are likely to have a material adverse effect on its financial position. Notwithstanding the foregoing, there are many uncertainties associated with any litigation and these matters or other third-party claims against the Company may cause the Company to incur costly litigation and/or substantial settlement charges. In addition, the resolution of any intellectual property litigation may require the Company to make royalty

payments, which could adversely affect gross margins in future periods. If any of those events were to occur, the Company's business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows could be adversely affected. The actual liability in any such matters may be materially different from the Company's estimates, if any, which could result in the need to adjust the liability and record additional expenses.



Note 15. Subsequent Events



Dividend Declaration



On May 2, 2018, the Company announced that it had declared a cash dividend of $0.18 per share of common stock payable on June 22, 2018 to stockholders of record as of the close of business on June 1, 2018.
