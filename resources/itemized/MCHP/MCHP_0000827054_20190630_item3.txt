Item 3.
QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK

As of June 30, 2019, our long-term debt totaled $11.40 billion.
We have no interest rate exposure to rate changes on our fixed rate debt, which totaled $6.48 billion as of June 30, 2019.
We do have interest rate exposure with respect to the $4.92 billion balance of our variable interest rate debt outstanding as of June 30, 2019.
A 50 basis point increase in interest rates would impact our expected annual interest expense for the next 12 months by approximately $24.7 million.
