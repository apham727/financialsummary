FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS 



In addition to historical information, certain sections of this Form 10-Q contain forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, such as those pertaining to the Company’s capital resources and profitability, the timing and amount of payment obligation relating to the arbitration award and the Company’s ability to pay these obligations. Forward-looking statements involve numerous risks and uncertainties. The Company derives a material portion of its revenues from contracts with agencies of the U.S. Government or their prime contractors. The Company’s business is performed under fixed price contracts and the following factors, among others discussed herein, could cause actual results and future events to differ materially from those set forth or contemplated in the forward-looking statements: uncertainties in today’s global economy and global competition, and difficulty in predicting defense appropriations, the vitality of the commercial aviation industry and its ability to purchase new aircraft, the willingness and ability of the Company’s customers to fund long-term purchase programs, and market demand and acceptance both for the Company’s products and its customers’ products which incorporate Company-made components. The success of the Company also depends upon the trends of the economy, including interest rates, income tax laws, governmental regulation, legislation, population changes and those risk factors discussed elsewhere in this Form 10-Q. Readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on forward-looking statements, which reflect management’s analysis only as of the date hereof. The Company assumes no obligation to update forward-looking statements.
