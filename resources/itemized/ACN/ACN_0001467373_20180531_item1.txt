BASIS OF PRESENTATION
The accompanying unaudited interim Consolidated Financial Statements of Accenture plc and its controlled subsidiary companies have been prepared pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) for quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and do not include all of the information and note disclosures required by U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“U.S.
GAAP”) for complete financial statements.
We use the terms “Accenture,” “we” and “our” in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements to refer to Accenture plc and its subsidiaries.
These Consolidated Financial Statements should therefore be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes thereto for the fiscal year ended August 31, 2017 included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC on October 26, 2017.
The accompanying unaudited interim Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP, which requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect amounts reported in the Consolidated Financial Statements and accompanying disclosures.
Although these estimates are based on management’s best knowledge of current events and actions that we may undertake in the future, actual results may differ from those estimates.
The Consolidated Financial Statements reflect all adjustments of a normal, recurring nature that are, in the opinion of management, necessary for a fair presentation of results for these interim periods.
The results of operations for the three and nine months ended May 31, 2018 are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for the fiscal year ending August 31, 2018.
On March 13, 2018, Accenture Holdings plc merged with and into Accenture plc, with Accenture plc as the surviving entity.
As a result, all of the assets and liabilities of Accenture Holdings plc were acquired by Accenture plc, and Accenture Holdings plc ceased to exist.
In connection with this internal merger, shareholders of Accenture Holdings plc (other than Accenture entities that held shares of Accenture Holdings plc), who primarily consisted of current and former members of Accenture Leadership and their permitted transferees, received one Class A ordinary share of Accenture plc for each share of Accenture Holdings plc that they owned, and Accenture plc redeemed all Class X ordinary shares of Accenture plc owned by such shareholders.
Allowances for Client Receivables and Unbilled Services
As of May 31, 2018 and August 31, 2017, total allowances recorded for client receivables and unbilled services were $56,653 and $74,450, respectively.
Depreciation and Amortization
Depreciation expense was $101,814 and $315,410 for the three and nine months ended May 31, 2018, respectively, and $86,148 and $255,807 for the three and nine months ended May 31, 2017, respectively.
As of May 31, 2018 and August 31, 2017, total accumulated depreciation was $2,028,174 and $1,912,146, respectively.
Deferred transition amortization expense was $95,696 and $248,838 for the three and nine months ended May 31, 2018, respectively, and $66,634 and $205,763 for the three and nine months ended May 31, 2017, respectively.
See Note 5 (Goodwill and Intangible Assets) for intangible asset amortization balances.

MATERIAL TRANSACTIONS AFFECTING SHAREHOLDERS’ EQUITY
Dividends
The payment of the cash dividends also resulted in the issuance of an immaterial number of additional restricted share units to holders of restricted share units.
7.
DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS
In the normal course of business, we use derivative financial instruments to manage foreign currency exchange rate risk.
Our derivative financial instruments consist of deliverable and non-deliverable foreign currency forward contracts.
Cash Flow Hedges
For a cash flow hedge, the effective portion of the change in estimated fair value of a hedging instrument is recorded in Accumulated other comprehensive loss as a separate component of Shareholders’ Equity and is reclassified into Cost of services in the Consolidated Income Statements during the period in which the hedged transaction is recognized.
For information related to derivatives designated as cash flow hedges that were reclassified into Cost of services during the three and nine months ended May 31, 2018 and 2017 as well as those expected to be reclassified into Cost of services in the next 12 months, see Note 3 (Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss) to these Consolidated Financial Statements.
Other Derivatives
Realized gains or losses and changes in the estimated fair value of foreign currency forward contracts that have not been designated as hedges were net losses of $84,480 and $37,698 for the three and nine months ended May 31, 2018, respectively, and a net gain of $89,035 and a net loss of $29,279 for the three and nine months ended May 31, 2017, respectively.
Gains and losses on these contracts are recorded in Other income (expense), net in the Consolidated Income Statements and are offset by gains and losses on the related hedged items.

RETIREMENT AND PROFIT SHARING PLANS
In May 2017, we settled our U.S. pension plan obligations.
Plan participants elected to receive either a lump-sum distribution or to transfer benefits to a third-party annuity provider.
As a result of the settlement, we were relieved of any further obligation under our U.S. pension plan.
During the three months ended May 31, 2017, we recorded a pension settlement charge of $509,793, and related income tax benefits of $198,219.
The charge primarily consisted of unrecognized actuarial losses of $460,908 previously included in Accumulated other comprehensive loss.
In connection with the settlement, we made a $118,500 cash contribution ($48,885 related to additional actuarial losses and $69,615 to fund previously recorded pension liabilities).
On December 22, 2017, the U.S. enacted the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the “Tax Act”), which significantly changed U.S. tax law.
The Tax Act lowered the U.S. statutory federal income tax rate from 35% to 21%, effective January 1, 2018, resulting in a blended U.S. statutory federal income tax rate of 25.7% for our fiscal year ended August 31, 2018.
The Tax Act could modestly impact our ongoing effective tax rate by imposing taxes on our intercompany transactions and limiting our ability to deduct certain expenses.
ACCENTURE PLC
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (continued)
Due to the recent enactment and the complexity involved in applying the provisions of the Tax Act, we have recorded provisional amounts in our financial statements.
In the three months ended February 28, 2018, we recognized a provisional tax expense of $136,724 primarily to remeasure our net deferred tax assets at the new, lower rates.
In the three months ended May 31, 2018, we recorded an adjustment of $40,927 to our provisional tax expense resulting from our continued analysis of the Tax Act.
As we collect and analyze data, including our forecast of when we expect to realize certain deferred tax amounts, we may adjust the provisional amounts.
In addition, we have not yet made an accounting policy election to consider the taxes on our intercompany transactions in determining the amount of our valuation allowance.
Those adjustments and the election may materially impact our provision for income taxes and effective tax rate in the period in which the adjustments are made.
We apply an estimated annual effective tax rate to our year-to-date operating results to determine the interim provision for income tax expense.
In addition, we recognize taxes related to unusual or infrequent items or resulting from a change in judgment regarding a position taken in a prior year as discrete items in the interim period in which the event occurs.
Our effective tax rates for the three months ended May 31, 2018 and 2017 were 34.4% and 19.4%, respectively.
Our effective tax rates for the nine months ended May 31, 2018 and 2017 were 27.2% and 20.2%, respectively.
Excluding the provisional tax expense associated with the enactment of the Tax Act and $80,847 of expense from a non-U.S. tax law change, the effective tax rates would have been 26.8% and 21.3% for the three and nine months ended May 31, 2018, respectively.
Absent the pension settlement charge (see Note 8 Retirement and Profit Sharing Plans) and related tax impact recorded during the three months ended May 31, 2017, the effective tax rates would have been 26.6% and 22.7% for the three and nine months ended May 31, 2017, respectively.
The effective tax rate for the nine months ended May 31, 2018 benefited from lower expenses for adjustments to prior year tax liabilities in fiscal 2018, partially offset by lower benefits from final determinations of prior year U.S. taxes in fiscal 2018.

COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES
Commitments
We have either the right to purchase at fair value or, if certain events occur, may be required to purchase at fair value outstanding shares of our Avanade Inc. and SinnerSchrader AG subsidiaries.
As of May 31, 2018 and August 31, 2017, we have reflected the fair value of $103,122 and $52,996, respectively, related to redeemable common stock and the intrinsic value of the options on redeemable common stock of these subsidiaries in Other accrued liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.
Indemnifications and Guarantees
In the normal course of business and in conjunction with certain client engagements, we have entered into contractual arrangements through which we may be obligated to indemnify clients with respect to certain matters.
As of May 31, 2018 and August 31, 2017, our aggregate potential liability to our clients for expressly limited guarantees involving the performance of third parties was approximately $811,000 and $697,000, respectively, of which all but approximately $145,000 and $149,000, respectively, may be recovered from the other third parties if we are obligated to make payments to the indemnified parties as a consequence of a performance default by the other third parties.
For arrangements with unspecified limitations, we cannot reasonably estimate the aggregate maximum potential liability, as it is inherently difficult to predict the maximum potential amount of such payments, due to the conditional nature and unique facts of each particular arrangement.
