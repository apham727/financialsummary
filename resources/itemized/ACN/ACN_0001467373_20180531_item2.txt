ITEM 2.
MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
The following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our Consolidated Financial Statements and related Notes included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended August 31, 2017, and with the information under the heading “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended August 31, 2017.
We use the terms “Accenture,” “we,” “our” and “us” in this report to refer to Accenture plc and its subsidiaries.
All references to years, unless otherwise noted, refer to our fiscal year, which ends on August 31.
For example, a reference to “fiscal 2018” means the 12-month period that will end on August 31, 2018.
All references to quarters, unless otherwise noted, refer to the quarters of our fiscal year.
We use the term “in local currency” so that certain financial results may be viewed without the impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, thereby facilitating period-to-period comparisons of business performance.
Financial results “in local currency” are calculated by restating current period activity into U.S. dollars using the comparable prior year period’s foreign currency exchange rates.
This approach is used for all results where the functional currency is not the U.S. dollar.
Disclosure Regarding Forward-Looking Statements
This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the “Exchange Act”) relating to our operations, results of operations and other matters that are based on our current expectations, estimates, assumptions and projections.
Words such as “may,” “will,” “should,” “likely,” “anticipates,” “expects,” “intends,” “plans,” “projects,” “believes,” “estimates,” “positioned,” “outlook” and similar expressions are used to identify these forward-looking statements.
These statements are not guarantees of future performance and involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions that are difficult to predict.
Forward-looking statements are based upon assumptions as to future events that may not prove to be accurate.
Actual outcomes and results may differ materially from what is expressed or forecast in these forward-looking statements.
Risks, uncertainties and other factors that might cause such differences, some of which could be material, include, but are not limited to:
•Our results of operations could be adversely affected by volatile, negative or uncertain economic and political conditions and the effects of these conditions on our clients’ businesses and levels of business activity.
•Our business depends on generating and maintaining ongoing, profitable client demand for our services and solutions, including through the adaptation and expansion of our services and solutions in response to ongoing changes in technology and offerings, and a significant reduction in such demand or an inability to respond to the evolving technological environment could materially affect our results of operations.
•If we are unable to keep our supply of skills and resources in balance with client demand around the world and attract and retain professionals with strong leadership skills, our business, the utilization rate of our professionals and our results of operations may be materially adversely affected.
•The markets in which we operate are highly competitive, and we might not be able to compete effectively.
•Our profitability could materially suffer if we are unable to obtain favorable pricing for our services and solutions, if we are unable to remain competitive, if our cost-management strategies are unsuccessful or if we experience delivery inefficiencies.
•Changes in our level of taxes, as well as audits, investigations and tax proceedings, or changes in tax laws or in their interpretation or enforcement, could have a material adverse effect on our effective tax rate, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.
•Our results of operations could be materially adversely affected by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates.
•Our business could be materially adversely affected if we incur legal liability.
•Our work with government clients exposes us to additional risks inherent in the government contracting environment.
•We might not be successful at identifying, acquiring, investing in or integrating businesses, entering into joint ventures or divesting businesses.
•Our global delivery capability is increasingly concentrated in India and the Philippines, which may expose us to operational risks.
•As a result of our geographically diverse operations and our growth strategy to continue geographic expansion, we are more susceptible to certain risks.
•Adverse changes to our relationships with key alliance partners or in the business of our key alliance partners could adversely affect our results of operations.
•If we are unable to protect or enforce our intellectual property rights, or if our services or solutions infringe upon the intellectual property rights of others or we lose our ability to utilize the intellectual property of others, our business could be adversely affected.
•Our ability to attract and retain business and employees may depend on our reputation in the marketplace.
•If we are unable to manage the organizational challenges associated with our size, we might be unable to achieve our business objectives.
•We make estimates and assumptions in connection with the preparation of our consolidated financial statements, and any changes to those estimates and assumptions could adversely affect our financial results.
•Our results of operations and share price could be adversely affected if we are unable to maintain effective internal controls.
•We might be unable to access additional capital on favorable terms or at all.
If we raise equity capital, it may dilute our shareholders’ ownership interest in us.
•We are incorporated in Ireland and a significant portion of our assets is located outside the United States.
As a result, it might not be possible for shareholders to enforce civil liability provisions of the federal or state securities laws of the United States.
We may also be subject to criticism and negative publicity related to our incorporation in Ireland.
•Irish law differs from the laws in effect in the United States and might afford less protection to shareholders.
For a more detailed discussion of these factors, see the information under the heading “Risk Factors” in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended August 31, 2017.
Our forward-looking statements speak only as of the date of this report or as of the date they are made, and we undertake no obligation to update any forward-looking statements.
Overview
Revenues are driven by the ability of our executives to secure new contracts and to deliver services and solutions that add value relevant to our clients’ current needs and challenges.
The level of revenues we achieve is based on our ability to deliver market-leading services and solutions and to deploy skilled teams of professionals quickly and on a global basis.
Our results of operations are affected by economic conditions, including macroeconomic conditions and levels of business confidence.
There continues to be significant volatility and economic and geopolitical uncertainty in many markets around the world, which may impact our business.
We continue to monitor the impact of this volatility and uncertainty and seek to manage our costs in order to respond to changing conditions.
There also continues to be volatility in foreign currency exchange rates.
The majority of our net revenues are denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar, including the Euro and the U.K. pound.
Unfavorable fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates have had and could have in the future a material effect on our financial results.
As we are a global company, our revenues are denominated in multiple currencies and may be significantly affected by currency exchange rate fluctuations.
If the U.S. dollar weakens against other currencies, resulting in favorable currency translation, our revenues, revenue growth and results of operations in U.S. dollars may be higher.
If the U.S. dollar strengthens against other currencies, resulting in unfavorable currency translation, our revenues, revenue growth and results of operations in U.S. dollars may be lower.
The U.S. dollar weakened against various currencies during the three and nine months ended May 31, 2018 compared to the three and nine months ended May 31, 2017, resulting in favorable currency translation and U.S. dollar revenue growth that was approximately 5% and 4% higher, respectively, than our revenue growth in local currency.
Assuming that exchange rates stay within recent ranges for the remainder of fiscal 2018, we estimate that our full fiscal 2018 revenue growth in U.S. dollars will be approximately 3.0% higher in U.S. dollars than our revenue growth in local currency.
and administrative costs primarily include costs for non-client-facing personnel, information systems, office space and certain acquisition-related costs.
Gross margin (Net revenues less Cost of services before reimbursable expenses as a percentage of net revenues) for the third quarter of fiscal 2018 was 32.2%, compared with 32.8% for the third quarter of fiscal 2017.
Gross margin for the nine months ended May 31, 2018 was 31.3%, compared with 31.7% for the nine months ended May 31, 2017.
The decrease in gross margin for the nine months ended May 31, 2018 was principally due to higher labor costs compared to the same period in fiscal 2017 as well as higher acquisition-related costs, partially offset by other cost efficiencies and improved contract profitability in the third quarter of fiscal 2018.
Sales and marketing and General and administrative costs as a percentage of net revenues were 16.5% for the third quarter of fiscal 2018 and 16.4% for the nine months ended May 31, 2018, compared with 17.3% for the third quarter of fiscal 2017 and 16.7% for the nine months ended May 31, 2017.
We continuously monitor these costs and implement cost-management actions, as appropriate.
For the third quarter of fiscal 2018 compared to the same period in fiscal 2017, Sales and marketing costs as a percentage of net revenues decreased 40 basis points, principally due to improved operational efficiency in our business development activities, and General and administrative costs as a percentage of net revenues decreased 50 basis points.
For the nine months ended May 31, 2018 compared to the same period in fiscal 2017, Sales and marketing and General and administrative costs as a percentage of net revenues each decreased 10 basis points.
During the third quarter of fiscal 2017, we recorded a $510 million pension settlement charge and related $198 million reduction in taxes for the U.S. pension plan termination.
For additional information, see Note 8 (Retirement and Profit Sharing Plans) to our Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 1, “Financial Statements.”
Operating margin (Operating income as a percentage of net revenues) for the third quarter of fiscal 2018 was 15.7%, compared with 9.8% for the third quarter of fiscal 2017.
Operating margin for the nine months ended May 31, 2018 was 14.9%, compared with 13.0% for the nine months ended May 31, 2017.
The pension settlement charge decreased operating margin by 570 and 200 basis points for the three and nine months ended May 31, 2017, respectively.
Excluding the effect of the pension settlement charge, operating margin for the three and nine months ended May 31, 2017 would have been 15.5% and 15.0%, respectively.
The effective tax rates for the three and nine months ended May 31, 2018 were 34.4% and 27.2%, respectively.
The effective tax rates for the three and nine months ended May 31, 2017 were 19.4% and 20.2%, respectively.
For the three and nine months ended May 31, 2018, we recorded a provisional tax charge associated with the enactment of the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the “Tax Act”) of $41 million and $178 million, respectively.
Absent these charges and $81 million of expense from a non-U.S. tax law change, our effective tax rate for the three and nine months ended May 31, 2018 would have been 26.8% and 21.3%, respectively.
Absent the pension settlement charge and related taxes, our effective tax rates for the three and nine months ended May 31, 2017 would have been 26.6% and 22.7%, respectively.
For additional information see Note 9 (Income Taxes) to our Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 1, “Financial Statements”.
Diluted earnings per share were $1.60 for the third quarter of fiscal 2018, compared with $1.05 for the third quarter of fiscal 2017.
Diluted earnings per share were $4.76 for the nine months ended May 31, 2018, compared with $3.96 for the nine months ended May 31, 2017.
The impact of tax law changes decreased diluted earnings per share by $0.19 and $0.40 during the three and nine months ended May 31, 2018, respectively.
The impact of the pension settlement
charge, net of taxes, decreased diluted earnings per share by $0.47 in both the three and nine months ended May 31, 2017.
Excluding these impacts, diluted earnings per share would have been $1.79 and $1.52 for the third quarter of fiscal 2018 and 2017, respectively and $5.16 and $4.43 for the nine months ended May 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively.
We have presented effective tax rate and diluted earnings per share excluding the impacts of the tax law changes in fiscal 2018 and the pension settlement charge in fiscal 2017 as well as operating income and operating margin excluding the impact of the pension settlement charge in fiscal 2017, as we believe doing so facilitates understanding as to both the impacts of these items and our financial performance in comparison to the prior period.
As described further in Note 1 (Basis of Presentation), on March 13, 2018 our subsidiary Accenture Holdings plc merged with and into Accenture plc, with Accenture plc as the surviving entity.
As a result, all of the assets and liabilities of Accenture Holdings plc were acquired by Accenture plc, and Accenture Holdings plc ceased to exist.
The merger was internal and administrative in nature.
New Bookings
New bookings for the third quarter of fiscal 2018 were $11.75 billion, with consulting bookings of $5.91 billion and outsourcing bookings of $5.84 billion.
New bookings for the nine months ended May 31, 2018 were $31.98 billion, with consulting bookings of $17.49 billion and outsourcing bookings of $14.49 billion.

Operating Expenses
Operating expenses for the third quarter of fiscal 2018 increased $728 million, or 9%, over the third quarter of fiscal 2017, and decreased as a percentage of revenues to 85.1% from 90.8% during this period.
Operating expenses before reimbursable expenses for the third quarter of fiscal 2018 increased $694 million, or 9%, over the third quarter of fiscal 2017, and decreased as a percentage of net revenues to 84.3% from 90.2% during this period.
Cost of Services
Cost of services for the third quarter of fiscal 2018 increased $1,073 million, or 17%, over the third quarter of fiscal 2017, and increased as a percentage of revenues to 69.4% from 68.9% during this period.
Cost of services before reimbursable expenses for the third quarter of fiscal 2018 increased $1,038 million, or 17%, over the third quarter of fiscal 2017, and increased as a percentage of net revenues to 67.8% from 67.2% during this period.
Gross margin for the third quarter of fiscal 2018 decreased to 32.2% from 32.8% during this period .
The decrease in gross margin was principally due to higher labor costs as a percentage of net revenues compared to the same period in fiscal 2017, partially offset by other cost efficiencies and improved contract profitability.
Sales and Marketing
Sales and marketing expense for the third quarter of fiscal 2018 increased $121 million, or 12%, over the third quarter of fiscal 2017, and decreased as a percentage of net revenues to 10.7% from 11.1% during this period principally due to improved operational efficiency in our business development activities.
General and Administrative Costs
General and administrative costs for the third quarter of fiscal 2018 increased $44 million, or 8%, over the third quarter of fiscal 2017, and decreased as a percentage of net revenues to 5.7% from 6.2% during this period.
Pension Settlement Charge
We recorded a pension settlement charge of $510 million during the third quarter of fiscal 2017 as a result of the termination of our U.S. pension plan.
For additional information, refer to Note 8 (Retirement and Profit Sharing Plans) to our Consolidated Financial Statements above under Item 1, “Financial Statements.”
Operating Income and Operating Margin
Operating income for the third quarter of fiscal 2018 increased $754 million, or 87%, over the third quarter of fiscal 2017.
The pension settlement charge decreased operating margin for the third quarter of fiscal 2017 by 570 basis points.
Excluding the effect of this charge, operating margin for the third quarter of fiscal 2018 increased 20 basis points compared to the third quarter of fiscal 2017.
Amounts in table may not total due to rounding.
•Financial Services operating income increased primarily due to consulting revenue growth and higher outsourcing contract profitability.
•Products operating income increased primarily due to revenue growth.
•Resources operating income increased primarily due to revenue growth and lower sales and marketing costs as a percentage of net revenues, partially offset by lower contract profitability.
Provision for Income Taxes
The effective tax rate for the third quarter of fiscal 2018 was 34.4%, compared with 19.4% for the third quarter of fiscal 2017.
In the three months ended May 31, 2018, we recorded a $122 million charge associated with tax law changes.
Absent this charge, the effective tax rate would have been 26.8% for the third quarter of fiscal 2018.
Absent the pension settlement charge and related tax impact, the tax rate for the third quarter of fiscal 2017 would have been 26.6%.
For additional information see Note 9 (Income Taxes) to our Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 1, “Financial Statements”.
In addition, as described in Note 1 (Basis of Presentation), beginning in fiscal 2019 we will recognize incremental income tax expense as a result of adoption of ASU 2016-16.
Net Income Attributable to Noncontrolling Interests
Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests for the third quarter of fiscal 2018 decreased $20 million, or 57%, from the third quarter of fiscal 2017 due to the decrease in the non-controlling ownership percentage from 4% held by Accenture Holdings plc and Accenture Canada Holdings Inc. to less than 1% held by only Accenture Canada Holdings Inc. driven by the Accenture Holdings plc merger with and into Accenture plc.
Earnings Per Share
Diluted earnings per share were $1.60 for the third quarter of fiscal 2018, compared with $1.05 for the third quarter of fiscal 2017.
The $0.55 increase in our diluted earnings per share included the impact of tax law changes, which decreased diluted earnings per share for the third quarter of fiscal 2018 by $0.19.
The impact of the pension settlement charge, net of taxes, decreased diluted earnings per share by $0.47 for the third quarter of fiscal 2017.
Excluding these impacts, diluted earnings per share for the third quarter of fiscal 2018 increased $0.27 compared with the third quarter of fiscal 2017 due to an increase of $0.28 from higher revenues and operating results, $0.01 from lower weighted average shares outstanding and $0.01 from lower net income attributable to other non-controlling interests.
These increases were partially offset by decreases of $0.02 from higher non-operating expense and $0.01 from a higher effective tax rate.
For information regarding our earnings per share calculations, see Note 2 (Earnings Per Share) to our Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 1, “Financial Statements.”
Results of Operations for the Nine Months Ended May 31, 2018 Compared to the Nine Months Ended May 31, 2017

Cost of services for the nine months ended May 31, 2018 increased $2,761 million, or 15% over the nine months ended May 31, 2017, and increased as a percentage of revenues to 70.2% from 70.0% during this period.
Cost of services before reimbursable expenses for the nine months ended May 31, 2018 increased $2,647 million or 15% over the nine months ended May 31, 2017, and increased as a percentage of net revenues to 68.7% from 68.3% during this period.
Gross margin for the nine months ended May 31, 2018 decreased to 31.3% from 31.7% during this period.
The decrease in gross margin was principally due to higher labor costs compared to the same period in fiscal 2017 as well as higher acquisition-related costs, partially offset by other cost efficiencies and improved contract profitability in the third quarter of fiscal 2018.
Sales and Marketing
Sales and marketing expense for the nine months ended May 31, 2018 increased $362 million, or 13%, over the nine months ended May 31, 2017, and decreased as a percentage of net revenues to 10.6% from 10.7% during this period.

For additional information, refer to Note 8 (Retirement and Profit Sharing Plans) to our Consolidated Financial Statements above under Item 1, “Financial Statements.”
Operating Income and Operating Margin
Operating income for the nine months ended May 31, 2018 increased $1,052 million, or 32%, over the nine months ended May 31, 2017.
The pension settlement charge decreased operating margin for the nine months ended May 31, 2017 by 200 basis points.
Excluding the effect of this charge, operating margin for the nine months ended May 31, 2018 decreased 10 basis points compared to the nine months ended May 31, 2017.
Amounts in table may not total due to rounding.
•Financial Services operating income increased primarily due to consulting revenue growth and higher outsourcing contract profitability, partially offset by lower consulting contract profitability.
•Products operating income increased primarily due to revenue growth, partially offset by lower consulting contract profitability and higher sales and marketing costs as a percentage of net revenues.
•Resources operating income increased primarily due to revenue growth, partially offset by lower contract profitability.
Other Income (Expense), net
Other income (expense), net primarily consists of foreign currency gains and losses as well as gains and losses associated with our investments in privately held companies.
For the nine months ended May 31, 2018, other expense increased $33 million over the nine months ended May 31, 2017, primarily due to higher net foreign exchange losses.
Provision for Income Taxes
The effective tax rate for the nine months ended May 31, 2018 was 27.2% compared with 20.2% for the nine months ended May 31, 2017.
In the nine months ended May 31, 2018, we recorded a $258 million charge associated with tax law changes.
Absent this charge, our effective tax rate for the nine months ended May 31, 2018 would have been 21.3%.
Absent the pension settlement charge and related tax impact, the tax rate for the nine months ended May 31, 2017 would have been 22.7%.
The effective tax rate for the nine months ended May 31, 2018 benefited from lower expenses for adjustments to prior year tax liabilities in fiscal 2018, partially offset by lower benefits from final
determinations of prior year U.S. taxes in fiscal 2018.
For additional information see Note 9 (Income Taxes) to our Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 1, “Financial Statements”.
 Our provision for income taxes is based on many factors and subject to volatility year to year.
We expect the fiscal 2018 annual effective tax rate to be in the range of 27% to 28%.
Excluding the tax law changes, we expect the fiscal 2018 annual effective tax rate to be in the range of 22.5% to 23.5%.
The effective tax rate for interim periods can vary because of the timing of when certain events occur during the year.
In addition, as described in Note 1 (Basis of Presentation), beginning in fiscal 2019 we will recognize incremental income tax expense as a result of adoption of ASU 2016-16.
Earnings Per Share
Diluted earnings per share were $4.76 for the nine months ended May 31, 2018, compared with $3.96 for the nine months ended May 31, 2017.
The $0.80 increase in our diluted earnings per share included the impact of tax law changes, which decreased diluted earnings per share for the nine months ended May 31, 2018 by $0.40.
The impact of the pension settlement charge, net of taxes, decreased diluted earnings per share by $0.47 for the nine months ended May 31, 2017.
Excluding these impacts, diluted earnings per share for the nine months ended May 31, 2018 increased $0.73 compared with the nine months ended May 31, 2017, due to increases of  $0.64 from higher revenues and operating results, $0.09 from a lower effective tax rate and $0.04 from lower weighted average shares outstanding.
These increases were partially offset by decreases of $0.03 from higher non-operating expenses and $0.01 from higher net income attributable to other non-controlling interests.
For information regarding our earnings per share calculations, see Note 2 (Earnings Per Share) to our Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 1, “Financial Statements.”
Liquidity and Capital Resources
As of May 31, 2018, Cash and cash equivalents was $3.9 billion, compared with $4.1 billion as of August 31, 2017.
Amounts in table may not total due to rounding.
We believe that our current and longer-term working capital, investments and other general corporate funding requirements will be satisfied for the next twelve months and thereafter through cash flows from operations and, to the extent necessary, from our borrowing facilities and future financial market activities.
Substantially all of our cash is held in jurisdictions where there are no regulatory restrictions or material tax effects on the free flow of funds.
Domestic cash inflows for our Irish parent, principally dividend distributions from lower-tier subsidiaries, have been sufficient to meet our historic cash requirements, and we expect this to continue into the future.
Borrowing Facilities
Under the borrowing facilities described above, we had an aggregate of $267 million of letters of credit outstanding as of May 31, 2018.
In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017, we entered into agreements that will allow us to establish a commercial paper program for short-term borrowings of up to $1 billion, backed by our syndicated loan facility.
Share Purchases and Redemptions
The Board of Directors of Accenture plc has authorized funding for our publicly announced open-market share purchase program for acquiring Accenture plc Class A ordinary shares and for purchases and redemptions of Accenture plc Class A ordinary shares and Accenture Canada Holdings Inc. exchangeable shares held by current and former members of Accenture Leadership and their permitted transferees.
Other Share Redemptions
 During the nine months ended May 31, 2018, we issued 25,906,176 Accenture plc Class A ordinary shares.
The merger, described in Note 1 (Basis of Presentation), resulted in 25,554,372 Accenture plc Class A ordinary shares being issued in exchange for Accenture Holdings plc shares on March 13, 2018.
Additionally, prior to the merger, we issued 351,804 Accenture plc Class A ordinary shares upon redemptions of an equivalent number of Accenture Holdings plc ordinary shares pursuant to a registration statement on Form S-3 (the “registration statement”).
Under the registration statement we, at our option, could issue freely tradable Accenture plc Class A ordinary shares in lieu of cash upon redemptions of Accenture Holdings plc ordinary shares held by current and former members of Accenture Leadership and their permitted transferees.
In connection with the merger of Accenture Holdings plc with and into Accenture plc, we have terminated the registration statement.
For a complete description of all share purchase and redemption activity for the third quarter of fiscal 2018, see Part II, Item 2, “Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds.”
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
In the normal course of business and in conjunction with some client engagements, we have entered into contractual arrangements through which we may be obligated to indemnify clients with respect to certain matters.
To date, we have not been required to make any significant payment under any of the arrangements described above.
For further discussion of these transactions, see Note 10 (Commitments and Contingencies) to our Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 1, “Financial Statements.”
New Accounting Pronouncements
See Note 1 (Basis of Presentation) to our Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 1, “Financial Statements.”
ITEM 2.
UNREGISTERED SALES OF EQUITY SECURITIES AND USE OF PROCEEDS
Purchases and Redemptions of Accenture plc Class A Ordinary Shares and Class X Ordinary Shares
The following table provides information relating to our purchases of Accenture plc Class A ordinary shares and redemptions of Accenture plc Class X ordinary shares during the third quarter of fiscal 2018.
In connection with the merger of Accenture Holdings plc with and into Accenture plc on March 13, 2018, the Accenture plc Class X ordinary shares held by Accenture Holdings plc shareholders were redeemed.
Purchases and Redemptions of Accenture Holdings plc Ordinary Shares and Accenture Canada Holdings Inc.
Exchangeable Shares
The following table provides additional information relating to our purchases and redemptions of Accenture Holdings plc ordinary shares and Accenture Canada Holdings Inc. exchangeable shares for cash during the third quarter of fiscal 2018.
We believe that the following table and footnotes provide useful information regarding the share purchase and redemption activity of Accenture.
Generally, purchases and redemptions of Accenture Canada Holdings Inc. exchangeable shares for cash and employee forfeitures reduce shares outstanding for purposes of computing diluted earnings per share.
In connection with the merger of Accenture Holdings plc with and into Accenture plc on March 13, 2018, shareholders of Accenture Holdings plc (other than Accenture plc and Accenture Holdings plc) received one Class A ordinary share of Accenture plc for each share of Accenture Holdings plc that they owned.
Accordingly, as of March 13, 2018, there were no longer any ordinary shares of Accenture Holdings plc outstanding.
