ITEM 2.
MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
The following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our Consolidated Financial Statements and related Notes included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended August 31, 2017, and with the information under the heading “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended August 31, 2017.
We use the terms “Accenture,” “we,” “our” and “us” in this report to refer to Accenture plc and its subsidiaries.
All references to years, unless otherwise noted, refer to our fiscal year, which ends on August 31.
For example, a reference to “fiscal 2018” means the 12-month period that will end on August 31, 2018.
All references to quarters, unless otherwise noted, refer to the quarters of our fiscal year.
We use the term “in local currency” so that certain financial results may be viewed without the impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, thereby facilitating period-to-period comparisons of business performance.
Financial results “in local currency” are calculated by restating current period activity into U.S. dollars using the comparable prior year period’s foreign currency exchange rates.
This approach is used for all results where the functional currency is not the U.S. dollar.
Disclosure Regarding Forward-Looking Statements
This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the “Exchange Act”) relating to our operations, results of operations and other matters that are based on our current expectations, estimates, assumptions and projections.
Words such as “may,” “will,” “should,” “likely,” “anticipates,” “expects,” “intends,” “plans,” “projects,” “believes,” “estimates,” “positioned,” “outlook” and similar expressions are used to identify these forward-looking statements.
These statements are not guarantees of future performance and involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions that are difficult to predict.
Forward-looking statements are based upon assumptions as to future events that may not prove to be accurate.
Actual outcomes and results may differ materially from what is expressed or forecast in these forward-looking statements.
Risks, uncertainties and other factors that might cause such differences, some of which could be material, include, but are not limited to:
•Our results of operations could be adversely affected by volatile, negative or uncertain economic and political conditions and the effects of these conditions on our clients’ businesses and levels of business activity.
•Our business depends on generating and maintaining ongoing, profitable client demand for our services and solutions, including through the adaptation and expansion of our services and solutions in response to ongoing changes in technology and offerings, and a significant reduction in such demand or an inability to respond to the evolving technological environment could materially affect our results of operations.
•If we are unable to keep our supply of skills and resources in balance with client demand around the world and attract and retain professionals with strong leadership skills, our business, the utilization rate of our professionals and our results of operations may be materially adversely affected.
•The markets in which we operate are highly competitive, and we might not be able to compete effectively.
•Our profitability could materially suffer if we are unable to obtain favorable pricing for our services and solutions, if we are unable to remain competitive, if our cost-management strategies are unsuccessful or if we experience delivery inefficiencies.
•Changes in our level of taxes, as well as audits, investigations and tax proceedings, or changes in tax laws or in their interpretation or enforcement, could have a material adverse effect on our effective tax rate, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.
•Our results of operations could be materially adversely affected by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates.
•Our business could be materially adversely affected if we incur legal liability.
•Our work with government clients exposes us to additional risks inherent in the government contracting environment.
•We might not be successful at identifying, acquiring, investing in or integrating businesses, entering into joint ventures or divesting businesses.
•Our global delivery capability is increasingly concentrated in India and the Philippines, which may expose us to operational risks.
•As a result of our geographically diverse operations and our growth strategy to continue geographic expansion, we are more susceptible to certain risks.
•Adverse changes to our relationships with key alliance partners or in the business of our key alliance partners could adversely affect our results of operations.
•If we are unable to protect or enforce our intellectual property rights, or if our services or solutions infringe upon the intellectual property rights of others or we lose our ability to utilize the intellectual property of others, our business could be adversely affected.
•Our ability to attract and retain business and employees may depend on our reputation in the marketplace.
•If we are unable to manage the organizational challenges associated with our size, we might be unable to achieve our business objectives.
•We make estimates and assumptions in connection with the preparation of our consolidated financial statements, and any changes to those estimates and assumptions could adversely affect our financial results.
•Our results of operations and share price could be adversely affected if we are unable to maintain effective internal controls.
•We might be unable to access additional capital on favorable terms or at all.
If we raise equity capital, it may dilute our shareholders’ ownership interest in us.
•We are incorporated in Ireland and a significant portion of our assets is located outside the United States.
As a result, it might not be possible for shareholders to enforce civil liability provisions of the federal or state securities laws of the United States.
We may also be subject to criticism and negative publicity related to our incorporation in Ireland.
•Irish law differs from the laws in effect in the United States and might afford less protection to shareholders.
For a more detailed discussion of these factors, see the information under the heading “Risk Factors” in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended August 31, 2017.
Our forward-looking statements speak only as of the date of this report or as of the date they are made, and we undertake no obligation to update any forward-looking statements.
Overview
Revenues are driven by the ability of our executives to secure new contracts and to deliver services and solutions that add value relevant to our clients’ current needs and challenges.
The level of revenues we achieve is based on our ability to deliver market-leading services and solutions and to deploy skilled teams of professionals quickly and on a global basis.
Our results of operations are affected by economic conditions, including macroeconomic conditions and levels of business confidence.
There continues to be significant volatility and economic and geopolitical uncertainty in many markets around the world, which may impact our business.
We continue to monitor the impact of this volatility and uncertainty and seek to manage our costs in order to respond to changing conditions.
There also continues to be volatility in foreign currency exchange rates.
The majority of our net revenues are denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar, including the Euro and the U.K. pound.
Unfavorable fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates have had and could have in the future a material effect on our financial results.
As we are a global company, our revenues are denominated in multiple currencies and may be significantly affected by currency exchange rate fluctuations.
If the U.S. dollar weakens against other currencies, resulting in favorable currency translation, our revenues, revenue growth and results of operations in U.S. dollars may be higher.
If the U.S. dollar strengthens against other currencies, resulting in unfavorable currency translation, our revenues, revenue growth and results of operations in U.S. dollars may be lower.
The U.S. dollar weakened against various currencies during the three and six months ended February 28, 2018 compared to the three and six months ended February 28, 2017, resulting in favorable currency translation and U.S. dollar revenue growth that was approximately 6% and 4% higher, respectively, than our revenue growth in local currency.
Assuming that exchange rates stay within recent ranges for the remainder of fiscal 2018, we estimate that our full fiscal 2018 revenue growth in U.S. dollars will be approximately 4.0% higher in U.S. dollars than our revenue growth in local currency.
and administrative costs primarily include costs for non-client-facing personnel, information systems, office space and certain acquisition-related costs.
Gross margin (Net revenues less Cost of services before reimbursable expenses as a percentage of net revenues) for the second quarter of fiscal 2018 was 29.7%, compared with 30.1% for the second quarter of fiscal 2017.
Gross margin for the six months ended February 28, 2018 was 30.9%, compared with 31.1% for the six months ended February 28, 2017.
The decrease in gross margin for three and six months ended February 28, 2018 was principally due to lower consulting contract profitability as well as higher acquisition-related costs, partially offset by cost efficiencies.
Sales and marketing and General and administrative costs as a percentage of net revenues were 16.3% for the second quarter of fiscal 2018 and 16.4% for the six months ended February 28, 2018, compared with 16.4% for both the second quarter of fiscal 2017 and six months ended February 28, 2017.
We continuously monitor these costs and implement cost-management actions, as appropriate.
For the three and six months ended February 28, 2018 compared to the same periods in fiscal 2017, Sales and marketing costs as a percentage of net revenues decreased 10 basis points and were flat, respectively, and General and administrative costs as a percentage of net revenues were flat and decreased 10 basis points, respectively.
Operating margin (Operating income as a percentage of Net revenues) for the second quarter of fiscal 2018 was 13.4%, compared with 13.7% for the second quarter of fiscal 2017.
Operating margin for the six months ended February 28, 2018 was 14.5%, compared with 14.7% for the six months ended February 28, 2017.
The effective tax rates for the three and six months ended February 28, 2018 were 26.1% and 23.0%, respectively.
The effective tax rates for the three and six months ended February 28, 2017 were 20.7% and 20.5%, respectively.
In the second quarter of fiscal 2018, we recorded a $137 million charge associated with the enactment of the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the “Tax Act”).
Absent this charge, our effective tax rates for the three and six months ended February 28, 2018 would have been 15.1% and 18.0%, respectively.
For additional information see Note 8 (Income Taxes) to our Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 1, “Financial Statements”.
Diluted earnings per share were $1.37 for the second quarter of fiscal 2018, compared with $1.33 for the second quarter of fiscal 2017.
Diluted earnings per share were $3.16 for the six months ended February 28, 2018, compared with $2.91 for the six months ended February 28, 2017.
The $137 million charge associated with the Tax Act decreased diluted earnings per share by $0.21 in both the second quarter of fiscal 2018 and six months ended February 28, 2018.
Excluding the impact of this charge, diluted earnings per share would have been $1.58 for the second quarter of fiscal 2018 and $3.37 for the six months ended February 28, 2018.
New Bookings
New bookings for the second quarter of fiscal 2018 were $10.25 billion, with consulting bookings of $5.65 billion and outsourcing bookings of $4.60 billion.
New bookings for the six months ended February 28, 2018 were $20.23 billion, with consulting bookings of $11.59 billion and outsourcing bookings of $8.65 billion.

Gross margin for the second quarter of fiscal 2018 decreased to 29.7% from 30.1% during the second quarter of fiscal 2017.
The decrease in gross margin was principally due to lower consulting contract profitability as well as higher acquisition-related costs, partially offset by cost efficiencies.
Sales and Marketing
Sales and marketing expense for the second quarter of fiscal 2018 increased $128 million, or 15%, over the second quarter of fiscal 2017, and decreased as a percentage of net revenues to 10.4% from 10.5% during this period.
General and Administrative Costs
General and administrative costs for the second quarter of fiscal 2018 increased $72 million, or 15%, over the second quarter of fiscal 2017, and remained flat as a percentage of net revenues at 5.9% during this period.
Operating Income and Operating Margin

•Products operating income increased primarily due to revenue growth, partially offset by lower consulting contract profitability and higher sales and marketing costs as a percentage of net revenues.
•Resources operating income increased primarily due to revenue growth, partially offset by lower contract profitability.
Other Income (Expense), net
Other income (expense), net primarily consists of foreign currency gains and losses as well as gains and losses associated with our investments in privately held companies.
For the second quarter of fiscal 2018, other expense increased $31 million over the second quarter of fiscal 2017, primarily due to higher net foreign exchange losses.
Provision for Income Taxes
The effective tax rate for the second quarter of fiscal 2018 was 26.1%, compared with 20.7% for the second quarter of fiscal 2017.
In the second quarter of fiscal 2018, we recorded a $137 million charge associated with the enactment of the Tax Act.
Absent this charge, our effective tax rate for the second quarter of fiscal 2018 would have been 15.1%.
The effective tax rate for the three months ended February 28, 2018 benefited from lower expenses for adjustments to prior year tax liabilities in fiscal 2018, partially offset by lower benefits from final determinations of prior year U.S. taxes in fiscal 2018.
For additional information see Note 8 (Income Taxes) to our Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 1, “Financial Statements”.
In addition, as described in Note 1 (Basis of Presentation), beginning in fiscal 2019 we will recognize incremental income tax expense as a result of adoption of ASU 2016-16.
Net Income Attributable to Noncontrolling Interests
Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests for the second quarter of fiscal 2018 increased $7 million, or 15%, over the second quarter of fiscal 2017.
Earnings Per Share
Diluted earnings per share were $1.37 for the second quarter of fiscal 2018, compared with $1.33 for the second quarter of fiscal 2017.
The $0.04 increase in our diluted earnings per share included the impact of the $137 million charge associated with the Tax Act, which decreased diluted earnings per share for the second quarter of fiscal 2018 by $0.21.
Excluding the impact of this charge, diluted earnings per share for the second quarter of fiscal 2018 increased $0.25 compared with the second quarter of fiscal 2017, due to increases of $0.17 from higher revenues and operating results, $0.10 from a lower effective tax rate and $0.01 from lower weighted average shares outstanding.
These increases were partially offset by decreases of $0.02 from higher non-operating expense and $0.01 from higher net income attributable to other non-controlling interests.
For information regarding our earnings per share calculations, see Note 2 (Earnings Per Share) to our Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 1, “Financial Statements.”

Liquidity and Capital Resources
As of February 28, 2018, Cash and cash equivalents was $3.6 billion, compared with $4.1 billion as of August 31, 2017.
Amounts in table may not total due to rounding.
We believe that our current and longer-term working capital, investments and other general corporate funding requirements will be satisfied for the next twelve months and thereafter through cash flows from operations and, to the extent necessary, from our borrowing facilities and future financial market activities.
Substantially all of our cash is held in jurisdictions where there are no regulatory restrictions or material tax effects on the free flow of funds.
Domestic cash inflows for our Irish parent, principally dividend distributions from lower-tier subsidiaries, have been sufficient to meet our historic cash requirements, and we expect this to continue into the future.
Borrowing Facilities
Under the borrowing facilities described above, we had an aggregate of $246 million of letters of credit outstanding as of February 28, 2018.
In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017, we entered into agreements that will allow us to establish a commercial paper program for short-term borrowings of up to $1 billion, backed by our syndicated loan facility.
Share Purchases and Redemptions
The Board of Directors of Accenture plc has authorized funding for our publicly announced open-market share purchase program for acquiring Accenture plc Class A ordinary shares and for purchases and redemptions of Accenture plc Class A ordinary shares, Accenture Holdings plc ordinary shares and Accenture Canada Holdings Inc. exchangeable shares held by current and former members of Accenture Leadership and their permitted transferees.
Other Share Redemptions
During the six months ended February 28, 2018, we issued 351,804 Accenture plc Class A ordinary shares upon redemptions of an equivalent number of Accenture Holdings plc ordinary shares pursuant to our registration statement on Form S-3 (the “registration statement”).
The registration statement allowed us, at our option, to issue freely tradable Accenture plc Class A ordinary shares in lieu of cash upon redemptions of Accenture Holdings plc ordinary shares held by current and former members of Accenture Leadership and their permitted transferees.
In connection with the merger of Accenture Holdings plc with and into Accenture plc, we have terminated the registration statement.
For additional information, see Note 11 (Subsequent Event) to our Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 1, “Financial Statements”.
For a complete description of all share purchase and redemption activity for the second quarter of fiscal 2018, see Part II, Item 2, “Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds.”
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
In the normal course of business and in conjunction with some client engagements, we have entered into contractual arrangements through which we may be obligated to indemnify clients with respect to certain matters.
To date, we have not been required to make any significant payment under any of the arrangements described above.
For further discussion of these transactions, see Note 9 (Commitments and Contingencies) to our Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 1, “Financial Statements.”

ITEM 2.
UNREGISTERED SALES OF EQUITY SECURITIES AND USE OF PROCEEDS
Purchases and Redemptions of Accenture plc Class A Ordinary Shares and Class X Ordinary Shares
The following table provides information relating to our purchases of Accenture plc Class A ordinary shares and redemptions of Accenture plc Class X ordinary shares during the second quarter of fiscal 2018.
In connection with the merger of Accenture Holdings plc with and into Accenture plc on March 13, 2018, the Accenture plc Class X ordinary shares held by Accenture Holdings plc shareholders were redeemed.
For additional information, see Note 11 (Subsequent Event) to our Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 1, “Financial Statements”.
Purchases and Redemptions of Accenture Holdings plc Ordinary Shares and Accenture Canada Holdings Inc.
Exchangeable Shares
The following table provides additional information relating to our purchases and redemptions of Accenture Holdings plc ordinary shares and Accenture Canada Holdings Inc. exchangeable shares for cash during the second quarter of fiscal 2018.
We believe that the following table and footnotes provide useful information regarding the share purchase and redemption activity of Accenture.
Generally, purchases and redemptions of Accenture Holdings plc ordinary shares and Accenture Canada Holdings Inc. exchangeable shares for cash and employee forfeitures reduce shares outstanding for purposes of computing diluted earnings per share.
However, in connection with the merger of Accenture Holdings plc with and into Accenture plc on March 13, 2018, shareholders of Accenture Holdings plc (other than Accenture plc and Accenture Holdings plc) received one Class A ordinary share of Accenture plc for each share of Accenture Holdings plc that they owned.
Accordingly, as of March 13, 2018, there were no longer any ordinary shares of Accenture Holdings plc outstanding.
For additional information, see Note 11 (Subsequent Event) to our Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 1, “Financial Statements”.
