BASIS OF PRESENTATION
The accompanying unaudited interim Consolidated Financial Statements of Accenture plc and its controlled subsidiary companies have been prepared pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) for quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and do not include all of the information and note disclosures required by U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“U.S.
GAAP”) for complete financial statements.
We use the terms “Accenture,” “we” and “our” in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements to refer to Accenture plc and its subsidiaries.
These Consolidated Financial Statements should therefore be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes thereto for the fiscal year ended August 31, 2019 included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC on October 29, 2019.
The accompanying unaudited interim Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP, which requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect amounts reported in the Consolidated Financial Statements and accompanying disclosures.
Although these estimates are based on management’s best knowledge of current events and actions that we may undertake in the future, actual results may differ from those estimates.
The Consolidated Financial Statements reflect all adjustments of a normal, recurring nature that are, in the opinion of management, necessary for a fair presentation of results for these interim periods.
The results of operations for the three months ended November 30, 2019 are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for the fiscal year ending August 31, 2020.
Allowances for Client Receivables
As of November 30, 2019 and August 31, 2019, total allowances recorded for client receivables were $45,016 and $45,538, respectively.
Depreciation and Amortization
Depreciation expense was $97,090 and $102,713 for the three months ended November 30, 2019 and 2018, respectively.
As of November 30, 2019 and August 31, 2019, total accumulated depreciation was $2,096,462 and $1,956,029, respectively.
Deferred transition amortization expense was $67,914 and $68,879 for the three months ended November 30, 2019 and 2018, respectively.
See Note 6 (Goodwill and Intangible Assets) to these Consolidated Financial Statements for intangible asset amortization balances.

Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements
Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) No.
2016-02 and related updates (“Topic 842”)
On September 1, 2019, we adopted FASB ASU No.
2016-02, Leases, and related updates (“Topic 842”) using the effective date method.
Prior period amounts were not adjusted.
The primary impact of adoption is the requirement for lessees to recognize assets and liabilities on the balance sheet for the rights and obligations created by both operating and finance leases.
Enhanced quantitative and qualitative disclosures about leasing arrangements are also required.
We elected the package of practical expedients which does not require reassessment of prior conclusions related to identifying leases, lease classification or initial direct costs.
We also elected the practical expedient to combine lease and nonlease components, accounting for the combined components as a single lease component, for our office real estate and automobile leases.
The standard did not have a material impact on our Consolidated Income Statement.
See Note 7 (Leases) to these Consolidated Financial Statements for further details.

Disaggregation of Revenue
See Note 12 (Segment Reporting) to these Consolidated Financial Statements for our disaggregated revenues.
Remaining Performance Obligations
We had remaining performance obligations of approximately $19 billion and $20 billion as of November 30, 2019 and August 31, 2019, respectively.
Our remaining performance obligations represent the amount of transaction price for which work has not been performed and revenue has not been recognized.
The majority of our contracts are terminable by the client on short notice with little or no termination penalties, and some without notice.
Under Topic 606, only the non-cancelable portion of these contracts is included in our performance obligations.
Additionally, our performance obligations only include variable consideration if we assess it is probable that a significant reversal of cumulative revenue recognized will not occur when the uncertainty is resolved.
Based on the terms of our contracts, a significant portion of what we consider contract bookings is not included in our remaining performance obligations.
We expect to recognize approximately 61% of our remaining performance obligations as of November 30, 2019 as revenue in fiscal 2020, an additional 19% in fiscal 2021, and the balance thereafter.
Contract Estimates
Adjustments in contract estimates related to performance obligations satisfied or partially satisfied in prior periods were immaterial for the three months ended November 30, 2019 and 2018, respectively.
Contract Balances
Deferred transition revenues were $583,531 and $563,245 as of November 30, 2019 and August 31, 2019, respectively, and are included in Non-current deferred revenues.
Costs related to these activities are also deferred and are expensed as the services are provided.
Generally, deferred amounts are protected in the event of early termination of the contract and are monitored regularly for impairment.
Impairment losses are recorded when projected remaining undiscounted operating cash flows of the related contract are not sufficient to recover the carrying amount of contract assets.
Deferred transition costs were $691,727 and $681,492 as of November 30, 2019 and August 31, 2019, respectively, and are included in Deferred contract costs.
Changes in the contract asset and liability balances during the three months ended November 30, 2019, were a result of normal business activity and not materially impacted by any other factors.
Revenues recognized during the three months ended November 30, 2019 that were included in Deferred revenues as of August 31, 2019 were $1.8 billion.
Revenues recognized during the three months ended November 30, 2018 that were included in Deferred revenues as of September 1, 2018 were $1.8 billion.

The pro forma effects of these acquisitions on our operations were not material.

GOODWILL AND INTANGIBLE ASSETS

Intangible Assets
ACCENTURE PLC
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (continued)
We account for leases in accordance with Topic 842.
See Note 1 (Basis of Presentation) to these Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on our adoption.
As a lessee, substantially all of our lease obligation is for office real estate.
Our significant judgments used in determining our lease obligation include whether a contract is or contains a lease and the determination of the discount rate used to calculate the lease liability.
Our leases may include the option to extend or terminate before the end of the contractual term and are often non-cancelable or cancelable only by the payment of penalties.
Our lease assets and liabilities include these options in the lease term when it is reasonably certain that they will be exercised.
In certain cases, we sublease excess office real estate to third-party tenants.
Lease assets and liabilities recognized at the lease commencement date are determined predominantly as the present value of the payments due over the lease term.
Unless the implicit rate can be determined, we use our incremental borrowing rate on that date to calculate the present value.
Our incremental borrowing rate approximates the rate at which we could borrow, on a secured basis for a similar term, an amount equal to our lease payments in a similar economic environment.
Effective September 1, 2019, when we are the lessee, all leases are recognized as lease liabilities and associated lease assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheet.
Lease liabilities represent our obligation to make payments arising from the lease.
Lease assets represent our right to use an underlying asset for the lease term and may also include advance payments, initial direct costs or lease incentives.
Fixed and variable payments that depend upon an index or rate, such as the Consumer Price Index (CPI), are included in the recognition of lease assets and liabilities at the commencement-date rate.
Other variable payments, such as common area maintenance, property and other taxes, utilities and insurance that are based on the lessor’s cost, are recognized in the Consolidated Income Statement in the period incurred.
As of November 30, 2019, our operating leases had a weighted average remaining lease term of 7.4 years and a weighted average discount rate of 4.2%.
ACCENTURE PLC
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (continued)
As of November 30, 2019, we have entered into operating leases that have not yet commenced with future lease payments of $430 million that are not reflected in the table above.
These leases are primarily related to office real estate and will commence in or before fiscal year 2022 with lease terms of up to 17 years.

MATERIAL TRANSACTIONS AFFECTING SHAREHOLDERS’ EQUITY
Dividends
The payment of the cash dividends also resulted in the issuance of an immaterial number of additional restricted share units to holders of restricted share units.
Subsequent Event
On December 16, 2019, the Board of Directors of Accenture plc declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.80 per share on its Class A ordinary shares for shareholders of record at the close of business on January 16, 2020 payable on February 14, 2020.
The payment of the cash dividend will result in the issuance of an immaterial number of additional restricted share units to holders of restricted share units.
Derivatives
In the normal course of business, we use derivative financial instruments to manage foreign currency exchange rate risk.
Our derivative financial instruments consist of deliverable and non-deliverable foreign currency forward contracts.
Cash Flow Hedges
For a cash flow hedge, the effective portion of the change in estimated fair value of a hedging instrument is recorded in Accumulated other comprehensive loss as a separate component of Shareholders’ Equity and is reclassified into Cost of services in the Consolidated Income Statements during the period in which the hedged transaction is recognized.
For information related to derivatives designated as cash flow hedges that were reclassified into Cost of services during the three months ended November 30, 2019 and 2018, as well as those expected to be reclassified into Cost of services in the next 12 months, see Note 4 (Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss) to these Consolidated Financial Statements.
Other Derivatives
Realized gains or losses and changes in the estimated fair value of foreign currency forward contracts that have not been designated as hedges were net losses of $56,619 and $48,983 for the three months ended November 30, 2019 and 2018, respectively.
Gains and losses on these contracts are recorded in Other income (expense), net in the Consolidated Income Statements and are offset by gains and losses on the related hedged items.
ACCENTURE PLC
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (continued)
Fair Value of Derivative Instruments
Equity Securities Without Readily Determinable Fair Values
We hold investments in equity securities that do not have readily determinable fair values.
We record these investments at cost and remeasure them to fair value based on certain observable price changes or impairment events as they occur.
The carrying amount of these investments was $149,525 and $131,675 as of November 30, 2019 and August 31, 2019, respectively.
We apply an estimated annual effective tax rate to our year-to-date operating results to determine the interim provision for income tax expense.
In addition, we recognize taxes related to unusual or infrequent items or resulting from a change in judgment regarding a position taken in a prior year as discrete items in the interim period in which the event occurs.
Our effective tax rates for the three months ended November 30, 2019 and 2018 were 23.6% and 19.8%, respectively.
The effective tax rate for the three months ended November 30, 2019 was higher primarily due to lower benefits from final determinations of prior year taxes and the phased-in effects of US tax reform.

COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES
Indemnifications and Guarantees
In the normal course of business and in conjunction with certain client engagements, we have entered into contractual arrangements through which we may be obligated to indemnify clients with respect to certain matters.
As of November 30, 2019 and August 31, 2019, our aggregate potential liability to our clients for expressly limited guarantees involving the performance of third parties was approximately $730,000 and $794,000, respectively, of which all but approximately $144,000 and $128,000, respectively, may be recovered from the other third parties if we are obligated to make payments to the indemnified parties as a consequence of a performance default by the other third parties.
For arrangements with unspecified limitations, we cannot reasonably estimate the aggregate maximum potential liability, as it is inherently difficult to predict the maximum potential amount of such payments, due to the conditional nature and unique facts of each particular arrangement.
Legal Contingencies
On July 24, 2019, Accenture was named in a putative class action lawsuit filed by consumers of Marriott International, Inc. (“Marriott”) in the U.S. District Court for the District of Maryland.
The complaint alleges negligence by us, and seeks monetary damages, costs and attorneys’ fees and other related relief, relating to a data security incident involving unauthorized access to the reservations database of Starwood Worldwide Resorts, Inc. (“Starwood”), which was acquired by Marriott on September 23, 2016.
Since 2009, we have provided certain IT infrastructure outsourcing services to Starwood.
We believe the lawsuit is without merit and we will vigorously defend it.
We cannot reasonably estimate a range of loss, if any, at this time.
