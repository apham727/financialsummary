ITEM 2.
MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
The following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements and the accompanying notes included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.
The following discussion may contain forward-looking statements that reflect our plans, estimates, and beliefs.
Our actual results could differ materially from those discussed in these forward-looking statements as a result of many factors, including but not limited to those under the heading “Forward-Looking Information” and “Part II.
Item 1A.
Risk Factors.”
Our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared in United States (“U.S.”) dollars, in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. (“GAAP”).
The following discussion includes organic net sales growth which is a non-GAAP financial measure.
See “Non-GAAP Financial Measure” for additional information regarding this measure.
Overview
TE Connectivity Ltd. (“TE Connectivity” or the “Company,” which may be referred to as “we,” “us,” or “our”) is a global technology and manufacturing leader creating a safer, sustainable, productive, and connected future.
For more than 75 years, our connectivity and sensor solutions, proven in the harshest environments, have enabled advancements in transportation, industrial applications, medical technology, energy, data communications, and the home.
●Our net sales decreased 5.4% and 3.2% in the third quarter and first nine months of fiscal 2019, respectively, as compared to the same periods of fiscal 2018, with sales declines in the Transportation Solutions and Communications Solutions segments, partially offset by growth in the Industrial Solutions segment.
On an organic basis, our net sales decreased 2.8% and 0.5% during the third quarter and first nine months of fiscal 2019, respectively, as compared to the same periods of fiscal 2018.
●Transportation Solutions—Our net sales decreased 6.8% and 5.6% in the third quarter and first nine months of fiscal 2019, respectively, due primarily to sales declines in the automotive end market.
●Industrial Solutions—Our net sales increased 1.7% and 3.4% during the third quarter and first nine months of fiscal 2019, respectively, primarily as a result of increased sales in the aerospace, defense, oil, and gas end market.
●Communications Solutions—Our net sales decreased 13.5% and 5.6% in the third quarter and first nine months of fiscal 2019, respectively, due to sales declines in both the appliances and the data and devices end markets.
●Net cash provided by continuing operating activities was $1,575 million in the first nine months of fiscal 2019.
​
Outlook
●Industrial Solutions—We expect our net sales declines in the industrial equipment and energy end markets to be partially offset by growth in the aerospace, defense, oil, and gas end market.
In the industrial equipment end market, sales declines resulting from high inventory levels at distributors are expected to be partially offset by growth in medical applications.
●Communications Solutions—We expect our net sales to decline in the data and devices and the appliances end markets primarily as a result of reduced demand resulting from high inventory levels at distributors.
We expect diluted earnings per share from continuing operations to be in the range of $0.81 to $0.87 per share in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019.
This outlook reflects the negative impact of foreign currency exchange rates on net sales and earnings per share of approximately $50 million and $0.03 per share, respectively, in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019 as compared to the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018.
●Transportation Solutions—We expect our net sales to decrease in the automotive end market due primarily to market weakness in China and the EMEA region.
We expect global automotive production to decline approximately 7% in fiscal 2019.
●Industrial Solutions—We expect our net sales increase in the aerospace, defense, oil, and gas end market to be partially offset by declines in the industrial equipment and energy end markets.
In the industrial equipment end market, we expect net sales declines resulting from market weakness in industrial applications to be partially offset by growth in medical applications.
●Communications Solutions—We expect our net sales to decline in the appliances and the data and devices end markets due to market weakness in the Asia–Pacific region and reduced demand resulting from high inventory levels at distributors.
We expect diluted earnings per share from continuing operations to be in the range of $5.42 to $5.48 per share in fiscal 2019.
This outlook reflects the negative impact of foreign currency exchange rates on net sales and earnings per share of approximately $400 million and $0.16 per share, respectively, in fiscal 2019 as compared to fiscal 2018.
The above outlook is based on foreign currency exchange rates and commodity prices that are consistent with current levels.
We are monitoring the current macroeconomic environment, including the uncertain market conditions in China, and its potential effects on our customers and the end markets we serve.
We continue to closely manage our costs in line with economic conditions.
Additionally, we are managing our capital resources and monitoring capital availability to ensure that we have sufficient resources to fund future capital needs.
See further discussion in “Liquidity and Capital Resources.”
Swiss Parliament approved the Federal Act on Tax Reform and AHV Financing (“Swiss Tax Reform”) in September 2018, and it was approved by public vote in May 2019.
Certain measures became effective in the third quarter of fiscal 2019 and accordingly are reflected in our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements.
We are currently assessing the impacts of the federal provisions and subsequent cantonal implementation.
We will reflect the impacts of the remaining measures on our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements when enacted.
Upon enactment at the cantonal level, which is expected to occur in the first quarter of fiscal 2020, we expect to recognize approximately $300 million of income tax expense related to the write-down of certain deferred tax assets.
See Note 12 to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding Swiss Tax Reform.
Acquisitions
During the first nine months of fiscal 2019, we acquired three businesses for a combined cash purchase price of $296 million, net of cash acquired.
The acquisitions were reported as part of our Transportation Solutions segment from the date of acquisition.
In June 2019, we announced our intent to acquire all outstanding shares of First Sensor AG through a voluntary public tender offer.
We expect to complete the transaction in fiscal 2020.
Discontinued Operations
During the first nine months of fiscal 2019, we sold our Subsea Communications (“SubCom”) business for net cash proceeds of $297 million and incurred a pre-tax loss on sale of $86 million.
The SubCom business met the held for sale and discontinued operations criteria and was reported as such in all periods presented on the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements.
Prior to reclassification to discontinued operations, the SubCom business was included in the Communications Solutions segment.
See Note 3 to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding discontinued operations.
Results of Operations
Net Sales
Net sales decreased $192 million, or 5.4%, in the third quarter of fiscal 2019 as compared to the third quarter of fiscal 2018 primarily as a result of the negative impact of foreign currency translation of 3.4% due to the weakening of certain foreign currencies and organic net sales declines of 2.8%.
Price erosion adversely affected organic net sales by $20 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2019.
In the first nine months of fiscal 2019, net sales decreased $331 million, or 3.2%, as compared to the first nine months of fiscal 2018.
The decrease resulted primarily from the negative impact of foreign currency translation of 3.3% due to the weakening of certain foreign currencies.
Price erosion adversely affected organic net sales by $75 million in the first nine months of fiscal 2019.
See further discussion of net sales below under “Segment Results.”
Net Sales by Geographic Region.
Our business operates in three geographic regions—EMEA, Asia–Pacific and the Americas—and our results of operations are influenced by changes in foreign currency exchange rates.
Increases or decreases in the value of the U.S. dollar, compared to other currencies, will directly affect our reported results as we translate those currencies into U.S. dollars at the end of each fiscal period.
Approximately 60% of our net sales were invoiced in currencies other than the U.S. dollar in the first nine months of fiscal 2019.
Cost of Sales and Gross Margin
Gross margin decreased $77 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2019 due primarily to lower volume, the unfavorable impact of product mix, and the negative impact of foreign currency translation, partially offset by lower material costs.
In the first nine months of fiscal 2019, gross margin decreased $221 million primarily as a result of the unfavorable impact of product mix, the negative impact of foreign currency translation, and price erosion, partially offset by lower material costs.
Gross margin as a percentage of net sales decreased to 32.8% in the third quarter of fiscal 2019 from 33.1% in the third quarter of fiscal 2018 and decreased to 32.9% in the first nine months of fiscal 2019 from 34.0% in the same period of fiscal 2018.
Operating Expenses
Selling, General, and Administrative Expenses.
Selling, general, and administrative expenses decreased $38 million and $62 million in the third quarter and first nine months of fiscal 2019 from the same periods of fiscal 2018 due primarily to cost control measures and savings attributable to restructuring actions as well as lower incentive compensation costs and reduced selling expenses.
Selling, general, and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales decreased to 10.5% in the third quarter of fiscal 2019 from 11.0% in the third quarter of fiscal 2018 and decreased to 11.0% in the first nine months of fiscal 2019 from 11.3% in the same period of fiscal 2018.
Restructuring and Other Charges, Net.
We are committed to continuous productivity improvements, and we evaluate opportunities to simplify our global manufacturing footprint, migrate facilities to lower-cost regions, reduce fixed costs, and eliminate excess capacity.
These initiatives are designed to help us maintain our competitiveness in the industry, improve our operating leverage, and position us for future growth.
During fiscal 2019, we initiated a restructuring program associated with footprint consolidation and structural improvements impacting all segments.
During fiscal 2018, we initiated a restructuring program associated with footprint consolidation and structural improvements primarily impacting the Industrial Solutions and Transportation Solutions segments.
In connection with these initiatives, we incurred net restructuring charges of $184 million during the first nine months of fiscal 2019, of which $179 million related to the fiscal 2019 restructuring program.
Annualized cost savings related to the fiscal 2019 actions commenced during the first nine months of fiscal 2019 are expected to be approximately $145 million and are expected to be realized by the end of fiscal 2021.
Cost savings will be reflected primarily in cost of sales and selling, general, and administrative expenses.
In response to market weakness, we are initiating incremental restructuring actions, primarily consisting of employee severance, to broaden the scope of our cost reduction initiatives and accelerate cost reduction and factory footprint consolidation activities.
We previously disclosed that we expected total restructuring charges to be approximately $250 million in fiscal 2019.
We have now increased this amount by $125 million.
We currently expect total restructuring charges, which will impact all segments, to be approximately $375 million and total spending, which will be funded with cash from operations, to be approximately $165 million in 2019.
See Note 2 to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding net restructuring and other charges.
Operating Income
See discussion of operating income below under “Segment Results.”
Non-Operating Items
Interest Expense.
Interest expense decreased $13 million and $25 million during the third quarter and first nine months of fiscal 2019, respectively, due primarily to the expansion of our cross-currency swap program in fiscal 2019.
Under the terms of the fiscal 2019 contracts, we receive interest in U.S. dollars at a weighted-average rate of 2.96% per annum and pay no interest.
See Note 10 to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding our cross-currency swap program.
Income Taxes.
See Note 12 to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding items impacting income tax expense and the effective tax rate for the third quarters and first nine months of fiscal 2019 and 2018 and information regarding Swiss Tax Reform.
Income (Loss) from Discontinued Operations, Net of Income Taxes.
During the first nine months of fiscal 2019, we sold our SubCom business for net cash proceeds of $297 million and incurred a pre-tax loss on sale of $86 million.
The
net sales of the business were $41 million and $510 million in the first nine months of fiscal 2019 and 2018, respectively.
The results for the first nine months of fiscal 2019 represent one month of activity.
In the first nine months of fiscal 2018, net sales and operating income were negatively impacted by production delays on a program.
See Note 3 to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding discontinued operations.
Segment Results
Transportation Solutions
●Automotive—Our organic net sales decreased 3.9% in the third quarter of fiscal 2019 due primarily to declines of 5.2% and 4.3% in the Asia–Pacific and EMEA regions, respectively.
Organic net sales in the Americas region were flat relative to the third quarter of fiscal 2018.
Our declines in the Asia–Pacific and EMEA regions were driven by market weakness.

Excluding these items, operating income decreased in the third quarter and first nine months of fiscal 2019 as compared to the same periods of fiscal 2018 due primarily to lower volume.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
Our ability to fund our future capital needs will be affected by our ability to continue to generate cash from operations and may be affected by our ability to access the capital markets, money markets, or other sources of funding, as well as the capacity and terms of our financing arrangements.
We believe that cash generated from operations and, to the extent necessary, these other sources of potential funding will be sufficient to meet our anticipated capital needs for the foreseeable future, including the payment of $250 million of 2.35% senior notes due in 2019.
We may use excess cash to purchase a portion of our common shares pursuant to our authorized share repurchase program, to acquire strategic businesses or product lines, to pay dividends on our common shares, or to reduce our outstanding debt.
The cost or availability of future funding may be impacted by financial market conditions.
We will continue to monitor financial markets and respond as necessary to changing conditions.
Cash Flows from Operating Activities
In the first nine months of fiscal 2019, net cash provided by continuing operating activities increased $196 million to $1,575 million from $1,379 million in the first nine months of fiscal 2018.
The increase resulted primarily from higher collections of accounts receivable and fluctuations in cash collateral requirements under our cross-currency swap contracts, partially offset by a decrease in pre-tax income levels.
The amount of income taxes paid, net of refunds, during the first nine months of fiscal 2019 and 2018 was $277 million and $317 million, respectively.
Cash Flows from Investing Activities
Capital expenditures were $570 million and $673 million in the first nine months of fiscal 2019 and 2018, respectively.
We expect fiscal 2019 capital spending levels to be approximately 5-6% of net sales.
We believe our capital funding levels are adequate to support new programs, and we continue to invest in our manufacturing infrastructure to further enhance productivity and manufacturing capabilities.
During the first nine months of fiscal 2019, we acquired three businesses for a combined cash purchase price of $296 million, net of cash acquired.
See Note 4 to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements.
During the first nine months of fiscal 2019, we received net cash proceeds of $297 million related to the sale of our SubCom business.
See additional information in Note 3 to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements.
Cash Flows from Financing Activities and Capitalization
Total debt at June 28, 2019 and September 28, 2018 was $4,036 million and $4,000 million, respectively.
See Note 8 to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding debt.
During the third quarter of fiscal 2019, Tyco Electronics Group S.A. (“TEGSA”), our 100%-owned subsidiary, issued €350 million aggregate principal amount of fixed-to-floating rate senior notes due June 2021.
The fixed-to-floating rate senior notes bear interest at a rate of 0% until June 2020 and then at a rate of three-month Euro Interbank Offered Rate (“EURIBOR”) plus 0.30% per year until maturity.
In June 2020, we may, at our option, redeem the fixed-to-floating rate senior notes, as a whole, at 100% of the principal amount.
Also, during the first nine months of fiscal 2019, TEGSA issued $350 million aggregate principal amount of floating rate senior notes due June 2020.
The floating rate senior notes bear interest at a rate of three-month London Interbank Offered Rate (“LIBOR”) plus 0.45% per year.
The fixed-to-floating rate senior notes and floating rate senior notes are TEGSA’s unsecured senior obligations and rank equally in right of payment with all existing and any future senior indebtedness of TEGSA and senior to any subordinated indebtedness that TEGSA may incur.
During the first nine months of fiscal 2019, TEGSA repaid, at maturity, $325 million 2.375% senior notes due 2018.
TEGSA has a five-year unsecured senior revolving credit facility (“Credit Facility”) with total commitments of $1,500 million.
The Credit Facility was amended in November 2018 primarily to extend the maturity date from December
2020 to November 2023.
The amended Credit Facility contains provisions that allow for incremental commitments of up to $500 million, an option to temporarily increase the financial ratio covenant following a qualified acquisition, and borrowings in designated currencies.
TEGSA had no borrowings under the Credit Facility at June 28, 2019 or September 28, 2018.
The Credit Facility contains a financial ratio covenant providing that if, as of the last day of each fiscal quarter, our ratio of Consolidated Total Debt to Consolidated EBITDA (as defined in the Credit Facility) for the then most recently concluded period of four consecutive fiscal quarters exceeds 3.75 to 1.0, an Event of Default (as defined in the Credit Facility) is triggered.
The Credit Facility and our other debt agreements contain other customary covenants.
None of our covenants are presently considered restrictive to our operations.
As of June 28, 2019, we were in compliance with all of our debt covenants and believe that we will continue to be in compliance with our existing covenants for the foreseeable future.
In addition to the Credit Facility, TEGSA is the borrower under our senior notes and commercial paper.
TEGSA’s payment obligations under its senior notes, commercial paper, and Credit Facility are fully and unconditionally guaranteed by its parent, TE Connectivity Ltd.
Payments of common share dividends to shareholders were $454 million and $435 million in the first nine months of fiscal 2019 and 2018, respectively.
In March 2019, our shareholders approved a dividend payment to shareholders of $1.84 per share, payable in four equal quarterly installments of $0.46 per share beginning in the third quarter of fiscal 2019 and ending in the second quarter of fiscal 2020.
During the first nine months of fiscal 2019, our board of directors authorized an increase of $1.5 billion in our share repurchase program.
We repurchased approximately 10 million of our common shares for $836 million and approximately 6 million of our common shares for $612 million under the share repurchase program during the first nine months of fiscal 2019 and 2018, respectively.
At June 28, 2019, we had $1.7 billion of availability remaining under our share repurchase authorization.
Commitments and Contingencies
Legal Proceedings
In the normal course of business, we are subject to various legal proceedings and claims, including patent infringement claims, product liability matters, employment disputes, disputes on agreements, other commercial disputes, environmental matters, antitrust claims, and tax matters, including non-income tax matters such as value added tax, sales and use tax, real estate tax, and transfer tax.
Although it is not feasible to predict the outcome of these proceedings, based upon our experience, current information, and applicable law, we do not expect that the outcome of these proceedings, either individually or in the aggregate, will have a material effect on our results of operations, financial position, or cash flows.
Guarantees
In certain instances, we have guaranteed the performance of third parties and provided financial guarantees for uncompleted work and financial commitments.
The terms of these guarantees vary with end dates ranging from fiscal 2019 through the completion of such transactions.
The guarantees would be triggered in the event of nonperformance, and the potential exposure for nonperformance under the guarantees would not have a material effect on our results of operations, financial position, or cash flows.
At June 28, 2019, we had outstanding letters of credit, letters of guarantee, and surety bonds of $316 million.
As discussed above, in the first nine months of fiscal 2019, we sold our SubCom business.
In connection with the sale, we contractually agreed to continue to honor performance guarantees and letters of credit related to the SubCom business’ projects that existed as of the date of sale.
These guarantees had a combined value of approximately $1.7 billion as of June 28, 2019 and are expected to expire at various dates through fiscal 2025; however, the majority are expected to expire within two years.
Also, under the terms of the definitive agreement, we are required to issue up to $300 million of new performance guarantees, subject to certain limitations, for projects entered into by the SubCom business following the sale for a period of up to three years.
As of June 28, 2019, there were no such new performance guarantees outstanding.
We have contractual recourse against the SubCom business if we are required to perform on any SubCom guarantees; however, based on historical experience, we do not anticipate having to perform.
See Note 3 to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding the divestiture of the SubCom business.
Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates
The preparation of the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities, and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses.
Our accounting policies for revenue recognition, goodwill and other intangible assets, income taxes, and pension liabilities are based on, among other things, judgments and assumptions made by management.
For additional information regarding these policies and the underlying accounting assumptions and estimates used in these policies, refer to the Consolidated Financial Statements and accompanying notes contained in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended September 28, 2018.
Except as set forth below, there were no significant changes to this information during the first nine months of fiscal 2019.
Revenue Recognition
We adopted Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, in the first quarter of fiscal 2019.
See Note 1 to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding our revenue recognition policy and the adoption of ASC 606.
Accounting Pronouncements
See Note 1 to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding recently issued and adopted accounting pronouncements.
Non-GAAP Financial Measure
Organic Net Sales Growth
We present organic net sales growth as we believe it is appropriate for investors to consider this adjusted financial measure in addition to results in accordance with GAAP.
Organic net sales growth represents net sales growth (the most comparable GAAP financial measure) excluding the impact of foreign currency exchange rates, and acquisitions and divestitures that occurred in the preceding twelve months, if any.
Organic net sales growth is a useful measure of our performance because it excludes items that are not completely under management’s control, such as the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates, and items that do not reflect the underlying growth of the company, such as acquisition and divestiture activity.
Organic net sales growth provides useful information about our results and the trends of our business.
Management uses organic net sales growth to monitor and evaluate performance.
Also, management uses organic net sales growth together with GAAP financial measures in its decision-making processes related to the operations of our reportable segments and our overall company.
It is also a significant component in our incentive compensation plans.
We believe that investors benefit from having access to the same financial measures that management uses in evaluating operations.
The tables presented in “Results of Operations” and “Segment Results” provide reconciliations of organic net sales growth to net sales growth calculated in accordance with GAAP.
Organic net sales growth is a non-GAAP financial measure and should not be considered a replacement for results in accordance with GAAP.
This non-GAAP financial measure may not be comparable to similarly-titled measures reported by other companies.
The primary limitation of this measure is that it excludes the financial impact of items that would otherwise either increase or decrease our reported results.
This limitation is best addressed by using organic net sales growth in combination with net sales growth in order to better understand the amounts, character, and impact of any increase or decrease in reported amounts.
