Risk Factors."
Our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared in United States ("U.S.") dollars, in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. ("GAAP").
The following discussion includes organic net sales growth which is a non-GAAP financial measure.
We believe this non-GAAP financial measure, together with GAAP financial measures, provides useful information to investors because it is one of the financial measures that management uses in evaluating the underlying results of our operations.
See "Non-GAAP Financial Measure" for more information about this non-GAAP financial measure, including our reasons for including the measure and material limitations with respect to the usefulness of the measure.
Overview

 Net cash provided by operating activities was $350 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2018.
Outlook  

 In the second quarter of fiscal 2018, we expect our net sales to be between $3.55 billion and $3.65 billion as compared to $3.2 billion in the second quarter of fiscal 2017.
This increase reflects sales growth in the Transportation Solutions and Industrial Solutions segments, and to a lesser degree, the  


Table of Contents 


Transportation SolutionsWe expect our net sales increase in the automotive end market to exceed anticipated global automotive production growth of approximately 2% due primarily to increased content per vehicle, market share gains, and sales contributions from a recent acquisition.
We also expect continued growth in the commercial transportation and sensors end markets.

Results of Operations 

  Net Sales  





 Net sales increased $417 million, or 13.6%, in the first quarter of fiscal 2018 as compared to the first quarter of fiscal 2017.
The increase in net sales resulted from organic net sales growth of 7.9%, the positive impact of foreign currency translation of 3.7% due to the strengthening of certain foreign currencies, and sales contributions from acquisitions of 2.0%.
Price erosion adversely affected organic net sales by $44 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2018.
See further discussion of net sales below under "Segment Results."
Approximately 60% of our net sales were invoiced in currencies other than the U.S. dollar in the first quarter of fiscal 2018.
Table of Contents 






  Cost of Sales and Gross Margin  



 Gross margin increased $110 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2018 as compared to the first quarter of fiscal 2017.
The increase in gross margin was due primarily to higher volume and improved manufacturing productivity, partially offset by the negative impact of price erosion.
Gross margin as a percentage of net sales decreased to 33.8% in the first quarter of 2018 from 34.8% in the first quarter of fiscal 2017.
Cost of sales and gross margin are subject to variability in raw material prices which continue to fluctuate for many of the raw materials used in the manufacture of our products.
We expect to purchase approximately 200 million pounds of copper, 140,000 troy ounces of gold, and 2.7 million troy

  Operating Expenses  



 Selling, General, and Administrative Expenses.
Selling, general, and administrative expenses increased $16 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2018 from the first quarter of fiscal 2017.
The increase resulted primarily from increased selling expenses to support higher sales levels.
Selling, general, and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales decreased to 11.0% in the first quarter of 2018 from 12.0% in the first quarter of fiscal 2017.
Research, Development, and Engineering Expenses.
In the first quarter of fiscal 2018, research, development, and engineering expenses increased $20 million as compared to the same period of fiscal 2017 due to costs related to growth initiatives, primarily in the Transportation Solutions segment.
Restructuring and Other Charges, Net.
We are committed to continuous productivity improvements and consistently evaluate opportunities to simplify our global manufacturing footprint, migrate facilities to lower-cost regions, reduce fixed costs, and eliminate excess capacity.
These initiatives are designed to help us maintain our competitiveness in the industry, improve our operating leverage, and position us for future growth.
During fiscal 2018, we initiated a restructuring program associated with footprint consolidation and structural improvements primarily impacting the Industrial Solutions segment.
During fiscal 2017, we initiated a restructuring program associated with footprint consolidation related to recent acquisitions and structural improvements impacting all segments.
In connection with these initiatives, we incurred net restructuring charges of $35 million during the first quarter of fiscal 2018, of which $22 million related to the fiscal 2018 restructuring program.
Annualized cost savings related to fiscal 2018 actions commenced during the first quarter of fiscal 2018 are expected to be approximately $20 million and are expected to be realized by the end of fiscal 2019.
Cost savings will be reflected primarily in cost of sales and selling, general, and administrative expenses.
During fiscal 2018, we expect to incur net restructuring charges of approximately $150 million.
We

Table of Contents  





Excluding these items, operating income decreased in the first quarter of fiscal 2018 due primarily to declines in our Subsea Communications business related to production delays.
Liquidity and Capital Resources 

 Our ability to fund our future capital needs will be affected by our ability to continue to generate cash from operations and may be affected by our ability to access the capital markets, money markets, or other sources of funding, as well as the capacity and terms of our financing arrangements.
We believe that cash generated from operations and, to the extent necessary, these other sources of potential funding will be sufficient to meet our anticipated capital needs for the foreseeable future, including the payment of $325 million of 2.375% senior notes due in 2018.
We may use excess cash to purchase a portion of our common shares pursuant to our authorized share repurchase program, to acquire strategic businesses or product lines, to pay dividends on our common shares, or to reduce our outstanding debt, including through the possible repurchase of our debt in accordance with applicable law.
The cost or availability of future funding may be impacted by financial market conditions.
We will continue to monitor financial markets and respond as necessary to changing conditions.
Cash Flows from Operating Activities  

 In the first quarter of fiscal 2018, net cash provided by operating activities decreased $54 million to $350 million from $404 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2017.
The decrease resulted primarily from an increase in employee-compensation related payments, partially offset by higher pre-tax income levels.
The amount of income taxes paid, net of refunds, during the first quarters of fiscal 2018 and 2017 was $82 million and $96 million, respectively.
Cash Flows from Investing Activities  

 Capital expenditures were $241 million and $130 million in the first quarters of fiscal 2018 and 2017, respectively.
We expect fiscal 2018 capital spending levels to be approximately 5% of net sales.
We believe our capital funding levels are adequate to support new programs, and we continue to invest in our manufacturing infrastructure to further enhance productivity and manufacturing capabilities.

  Cash Flows from Financing Activities and Capitalization  

 Total debt at December 29, 2017 and September 29, 2017 was $4,005 million and $4,344 million, respectively.
See Note 6 to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding debt.
During October 2017, Tyco Electronics Group S.A. ("TEGSA"), our 100%-owned subsidiary, repaid, at maturity, $708 million 6.55% senior notes due 2017.
During December 2017, TEGSA entered into an uncommitted revolving credit facility under which it borrowed €100 million, at a 0% interest rate with repayment due at maturity in December 2018.
TEGSA has a five-year unsecured senior revolving credit facility ("Credit Facility") with a maturity date of December 2020 and total commitments of $1,500 million.
TEGSA had no borrowings under the Credit Facility at December 29, 2017 or September 29, 2017.
Borrowings under our commercial paper program are backed by the Credit Facility and reduce the availability of funds from the Credit Facility.
The Credit Facility contains a financial ratio covenant providing that if, as of the last day of each fiscal quarter, our ratio of Consolidated Total Debt to Consolidated EBITDA (as defined in the Credit Facility) for the then most recently concluded period of four consecutive fiscal quarters exceeds 3.75 to 1.0, an Event of Default (as defined in the Credit Facility) is triggered.
The Credit Facility and our other debt agreements contain other customary covenants.
None of our covenants are presently considered restrictive to our operations.
As of December 29, 2017, we were in compliance with all of our debt covenants and believe that we will continue to be in compliance with our existing covenants for the foreseeable future.
In addition to the Credit Facility, TEGSA is the borrower under our senior notes and commercial paper.
TEGSA's payment obligations under its senior notes, commercial paper, and Credit Facility are fully and unconditionally guaranteed by its parent, TE Connectivity Ltd.  

 Payments of common share dividends to shareholders were $141 million and $132 million in the first quarters of fiscal 2018 and 2017, respectively.

At December 29, 2017, we had $1,766 million of availability remaining under our share repurchase authorization.
Commitments and Contingencies 

  Legal Proceedings  

 In the normal course of business, we are subject to various legal proceedings and claims, including patent infringement claims, product liability matters, employment disputes, disputes on agreements, other commercial disputes, environmental matters, antitrust claims, and tax matters, including non-income tax matters such as value added tax, sales and use tax, real estate tax, and transfer tax.
Although it is not feasible to predict the outcome of these proceedings, based upon our experience, current information, and applicable law, we do not expect that the outcome of these proceedings, either individually or in the aggregate, will have a material effect on our results of operations, financial position, or cash flows.
Guarantees  

 In certain instances, we have guaranteed the performance of third parties and provided financial guarantees for uncompleted work and financial commitments.
The terms of these guarantees vary with  


Table of Contents 

end dates ranging from fiscal 2018 through the completion of such transactions.
The guarantees would be triggered in the event of nonperformance, and the potential exposure for nonperformance under the guarantees would not have a material effect on our results of operations, financial position, or cash flows.
At December 29, 2017, we had outstanding letters of credit, letters of guarantee, and surety bonds of $291 million.
Tax Sharing Agreement  

 As previously reported, we are a party to a Tax Sharing Agreement that generally governs our, Tyco International plc's, and Covidien plc's respective rights, responsibilities, and obligations with respect to taxes for periods prior to and including June 29, 2007.
See Note 7 to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding the Tax Sharing Agreement.
Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 

 The preparation of the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities, and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses.
Our accounting policies for revenue recognition, goodwill and other intangible assets, income taxes, and pension liabilities are based on, among other things, judgments and assumptions made by management.
For additional information regarding these policies and the underlying accounting assumptions and estimates used in these policies, refer to the Consolidated Financial Statements and accompanying notes contained in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended September 29, 2017.
There were no significant changes to this information during the first quarter of fiscal 2018.
Accounting Pronouncements 

 See Note 1 to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding recently issued and adopted accounting pronouncements.
Non-GAAP Financial Measure 

  Organic Net Sales Growth  

 We present organic net sales growth as we believe it is appropriate for investors to consider this adjusted financial measure in addition to results in accordance with GAAP.
Organic net sales growth represents net sales growth (the most comparable GAAP financial measure) excluding the impact of foreign currency exchange rates, and acquisitions and divestitures that occurred in the preceding twelve months, if any.
Organic net sales growth is a useful measure of our performance because it excludes items that are not completely under management's control, such as the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates, and items that do not reflect the underlying growth of the company, such as acquisition and divestiture activity.
Table of Contents 

 Organic net sales growth provides useful information about our results and the trends of our business.
Management uses organic net sales growth to monitor and evaluate performance.
Also, management uses organic net sales growth together with GAAP financial measures in its decision-making processes related to the operations of our reportable segments and our overall company.
It is also a significant component in our incentive compensation plans.
We believe that investors benefit from having access to the same financial measures that management uses in evaluating operations.
The tables presented in "Results of Operations" and "Segment Results" provide reconciliations of organic net sales growth to net sales growth calculated in accordance with GAAP.
Organic net sales growth is a non-GAAP financial measure and should not be considered a replacement for results in accordance with GAAP.
This non-GAAP financial measure may not be comparable to similarly-titled measures reported by other companies.
The primary limitation of this measure is that it excludes the financial impact of items that would otherwise either increase or decrease our reported results.
This limitation is best addressed by using organic net sales growth in combination with net sales growth in order to better understand the amounts, character, and impact of any increase or decrease in reported amounts.
