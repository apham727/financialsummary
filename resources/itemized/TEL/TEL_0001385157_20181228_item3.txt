Item 3.
Legal Proceedings" in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended September 28, 2018 for additional information regarding legal proceedings.
During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018, one of our manufacturing sites in China was found to have failed to complete the environmental impact assessment inspection for certain of its production lines and assets within the mandatory timeframe as defined within applicable environmental regulation.
At the request of the Shanghai Xuhui Environmental Protection Bureau, we are taking remedial actions to cure the deficiencies, and we paid an administrative penalty in the amount of 700,000 Chinese renminbi (approximately $0.1 million using an exchange rate of $0.15 per renminbi).
We do not anticipate that any monetary sanctions or remedial actions we take will have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial position, or cash flows.
RISK FACTORS
