RISK FACTORS 

 There have been no material changes in our risk factors from those disclosed in "Part I.
Item 1A.
Risk Factors" in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended September 29, 2017 except as described below.
The risk factors described in our Annual Report on Form 10-K, in addition to other information set forth below and in this report, could materially affect our business operations, financial condition, or liquidity.
Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently believe are immaterial may also impair our business operations, financial condition, and liquidity.
Changes in United States federal tax laws could result in adverse consequences to United States persons treated as owning 10% or more of our shares.
Although we are a Swiss corporation, recent U.S. tax law changes have expanded application of certain ownership attribution rules and cause certain of our non-U.S. subsidiaries to be treated as Controlled Foreign Corporations ("CFCs") for U.S. federal income tax purposes.
A U.S. person that is treated for U.S. federal income tax purposes as owning, directly, indirectly, or constructively, 10% or more of our shares may be required to annually report and include in its U.S. taxable income its pro rata share of certain types of income earned by our subsidiaries that are treated as CFCs, whether or not we make any distributions to such U.S. shareholder.
A U.S. person that owns 10% or more of our shares should consult its own tax advisers regarding any potential implications to it of these changes in U.S. federal income tax law.
The risk of U.S. federal income tax reporting and compliance obligations with respect to our subsidiaries that now are treated as CFCs may deter our current shareholders from increasing their investment in us, and others from investing in us, which could impact the demand for, and value of, our shares.
