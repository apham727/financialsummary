Our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared in United States ("U.S.") dollars, in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. ("GAAP").
The following discussion includes organic net sales growth which is a non-GAAP financial measure.
See "Non-GAAP Financial Measure" for additional information regarding this measure.
Overview 

 TE Connectivity Ltd. ("TE Connectivity" or the "Company," which may be referred to as "we," "us," or "our") is a global technology and manufacturing leader creating a safer, sustainable, productive, and connected future.
For more than 75 years, our connectivity and sensor solutions, proven in the harshest environments, have enabled advancements in transportation, industrial applications, medical technology, energy, data communications, and the home.
 Our net sales increased 16.1% and 14.9% in the second quarter and first six months of fiscal 2018, respectively, as compared to the same periods of fiscal 2017 primarily as a result of growth in the Transportation Solutions and Industrial Solutions segments.
Foreign currency exchange rates positively impacted net sales by $235 million and $350 million in the second quarter and first six months of fiscal 2018, respectively, as compared to the same periods of fiscal 2017.
On an organic basis, our net sales increased 6.9% and 7.4% during the second quarter and first six months of fiscal 2018, respectively, as compared to the same periods of fiscal 2017.
Transportation SolutionsOur net sales increased 21.6% and 21.5% in the second quarter and first six months of fiscal 2018, respectively, as a result of sales increases in all end markets.
Industrial SolutionsOur net sales increased 14.0% and 12.5% during the second quarter and first six months of fiscal 2018, respectively, due primarily to increased sales in the industrial equipment end market.
Communications SolutionsOur net sales increased 3.2% in the second quarter of fiscal 2018 and decreased 0.6% in the first six months of fiscal 2018 with sales increases in the appliances and the data and devices end markets and sales declines in the subsea communications end market.
 Net cash provided by operating activities was $727 million in the first six months of fiscal 2018.
Outlook  

 In the third quarter of fiscal 2018, we expect our net sales to be between $3.65 billion and $3.7 billion as compared to $3.4 billion in the third quarter of fiscal 2017.
We expect our net sales to be  


Table of Contents 


Transportation SolutionsWe expect our net sales to increase in the automotive end market as a result of increased content per vehicle, market share gains, and sales contributions from a recent acquisition.
We expect global automotive production growth of approximately 2% in fiscal 2018.
We also expect continued growth in the commercial transportation and sensors end markets.
Industrial SolutionsWe expect our net sales to increase in the industrial equipment end market due primarily to continued strength in factory automation and controls applications.
Also, we expect net sales growth in the aerospace, defense, oil, and gas end market to be driven by growth in the defense and commercial aerospace markets.
Communications SolutionsWe expect our net sales growth in the appliances and the data and devices end markets to be more than offset by sales declines in the subsea communications end market.
We expect our net sales in the subsea communications end market to be in the range of $700 million to $750 million in fiscal 2018.
We expect diluted earnings per share from continuing operations to be in the range of $1.13 to $1.15 per share in the third quarter of fiscal 2018.
For fiscal 2018, we expect diluted earnings per share from continuing operations to be in the range of $3.70 to $3.76 per share.
This outlook reflects the positive impact of foreign currency exchange rates on net sales and earnings per share of approximately $120 million and $0.05 per share, respectively, in the third quarter of fiscal 2018 as compared to the same period of fiscal 2017 and approximately $500 million and $0.20 per share, respectively, in fiscal 2018 as compared to fiscal 2017.
The above outlook is based on foreign currency exchange rates and commodity prices that are consistent with current levels.
We are monitoring the current macroeconomic environment and its potential effects on our customers and the end markets we serve.
We continue to closely manage our costs in line with economic conditions.
Additionally, we are managing our capital resources and monitoring capital availability to ensure that we have sufficient resources to fund future capital needs.

Results of Operations 

  Net Sales  




Table of Contents 



 Net sales increased $518 million, or 16.1%, in the second quarter of fiscal 2018 as compared to the second quarter of fiscal 2017.
The increase in net sales resulted from the positive impact of foreign currency translation of 7.3% due to the strengthening of certain foreign currencies, organic net sales growth of 6.9%, and sales contributions from acquisitions of 1.9%.
Price erosion adversely affected organic net sales by $49 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2018.
In the first six months of fiscal 2018, net sales increased $935 million, or 14.9%, as compared to the first six months of fiscal 2017 as a result of organic net sales growth of 7.4%, the positive impact of foreign currency translation of 5.5% due to the strengthening of certain foreign currencies, and sales contributions from acquisitions of 2.0%.
Price erosion adversely affected organic net sales by $93 million in the first six months of fiscal 2018.
See further discussion of net sales below under "Segment Results."
Approximately 59% of our net sales were invoiced in currencies other than the U.S. dollar in the first six months of fiscal 2018.

  Cost of Sales and Gross Margin  



 Gross margin increased $133 million and $243 million in the second quarter and first six months of fiscal 2018, respectively, as compared to the same periods of fiscal 2017.
The increases were due primarily to higher volume, the positive impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates, and lower material costs, partially offset by the negative impact of price erosion and declines in our Subsea Communications business related to production delays.
Gross margin as a percentage of net sales decreased to 33.2% in the second quarter of fiscal 2018 from 34.4% in the second quarter of fiscal 2017 and decreased to 33.5% in the first six months of fiscal 2018 from 34.6% in the same period of fiscal 2017.

  Operating Expenses  



 Selling, General, and Administrative Expenses.
Selling, general, and administrative expenses increased $21 million and $37 million in the second quarter and first six months of fiscal 2018, respectively, from the same periods in fiscal 2017.
The increases resulted primarily from increased selling expenses to support higher sales levels.
Selling, general, and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales decreased to 11.4% in the second quarter of fiscal 2018 from 12.6% in the second quarter of fiscal 2017 and decreased to 11.2% in the first six months of fiscal 2018 from 12.3% in the same period of fiscal 2017.
Research, Development, and Engineering Expenses.
In the second quarter and first six months of fiscal 2018, research, development, and engineering expenses increased $21 million and $41 million, respectively, as compared to the same periods of fiscal 2017 due to costs related to growth initiatives, primarily in the Transportation Solutions segment.
Restructuring and Other Charges, Net.
We are committed to continuous productivity improvements and consistently evaluate opportunities to simplify our global manufacturing footprint, migrate facilities to lower-cost regions, reduce fixed costs, and eliminate excess capacity.
These initiatives are designed to help us maintain our competitiveness in the industry, improve our operating leverage, and position us for future growth.
During fiscal 2018, we initiated a restructuring program associated with footprint consolidation and structural improvements primarily impacting the Industrial Solutions segment.
During fiscal 2017, we initiated a restructuring program associated with footprint consolidation related to recent acquisitions and structural improvements impacting all segments.
In connection with these initiatives, we incurred net restructuring charges of $45 million during the first six months of fiscal 2018, of which $36 million related to the fiscal 2018 restructuring program.
Annualized cost savings related to the fiscal 2018 actions commenced during the first six months of fiscal 2018 are expected to be approximately $30 million and are expected to be realized by the end of fiscal 2019.
Cost savings will be reflected primarily in cost of sales and selling, general, and administrative expenses.
During fiscal 2018, we expect to incur net restructuring charges of approximately $150 million.
We expect total spending, which will be funded with cash from operations, to be approximately $130 million in fiscal 2018.
See Note 2 to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding net restructuring and other charges.

Excluding these items, operating income decreased in the second quarter and first six months of fiscal 2018 due primarily to declines in our Subsea Communications business related to production delays.
Liquidity and Capital Resources 

 Our ability to fund our future capital needs will be affected by our ability to continue to generate cash from operations and may be affected by our ability to access the capital markets, money markets, or other sources of funding, as well as the capacity and terms of our financing arrangements.
We believe that cash generated from operations and, to the extent necessary, these other sources of potential funding will be sufficient to meet our anticipated capital needs for the foreseeable future, including the payment of $325 million of 2.375% senior notes and €100 million borrowed under the uncommitted revolving credit facility, both of which are due in December 2018.
We may use excess cash to purchase a portion of our common shares pursuant to our authorized share repurchase program, to acquire strategic businesses or product lines, to pay dividends on our common shares, or to reduce our outstanding debt, including through the possible repurchase of our debt in accordance with applicable law.
The cost or availability of future funding may be impacted by financial market conditions.
We will continue to monitor financial markets and respond as necessary to changing conditions.
Cash Flows from Operating Activities  

 In the first six months of fiscal 2018, net cash provided by operating activities decreased $198 million to $727 million from $925 million in the first six months of fiscal 2017.
The decrease resulted primarily from an increase in employee-compensation related payments and the unfavorable effects of changes in accounts receivable and inventory levels, partially offset by higher pre-tax income levels.
Table of Contents 

 The amount of income taxes paid, net of refunds, during the first six months of fiscal 2018 and 2017 was $208 million and $177 million, respectively.
We do not expect a significant change in our income tax payments as a result of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act.
Cash Flows from Investing Activities  

 Capital expenditures were $447 million and $289 million in the first six months of fiscal 2018 and 2017, respectively.
We expect fiscal 2018 capital spending levels to be approximately 6% of net sales.
We believe our capital funding levels are adequate to support new programs, and we continue to invest in our manufacturing infrastructure to further enhance productivity and manufacturing capabilities.
Cash Flows from Financing Activities and Capitalization  

 Total debt at March 30, 2018 and September 29, 2017 was $4,010 million and $4,344 million, respectively.
See Note 6 to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding debt.
During the first six months of fiscal 2018, Tyco Electronics Group S.A. ("TEGSA"), our 100%-owned subsidiary, repaid, at maturity, $708 million of 6.55% senior notes due October 2017.
During the first six months of fiscal 2018, TEGSA entered into an uncommitted revolving credit facility under which it borrowed €100 million at a 0% interest rate with repayment due at maturity in December 2018.
TEGSA has a five-year unsecured senior revolving credit facility ("Credit Facility") with a maturity date of December 2020 and total commitments of $1,500 million.
TEGSA had no borrowings under the Credit Facility at March 30, 2018 or September 29, 2017.
Borrowings under our commercial paper program are backed by the Credit Facility and reduce the availability of funds from the Credit Facility.
The Credit Facility contains a financial ratio covenant providing that if, as of the last day of each fiscal quarter, our ratio of Consolidated Total Debt to Consolidated EBITDA (as defined in the Credit Facility) for the then most recently concluded period of four consecutive fiscal quarters exceeds 3.75 to 1.0, an Event of Default (as defined in the Credit Facility) is triggered.
The Credit Facility and our other debt agreements contain other customary covenants.
None of our covenants are presently considered restrictive to our operations.
As of March 30, 2018, we were in compliance with all of our debt covenants and believe that we will continue to be in compliance with our existing covenants for the foreseeable future.
In addition to the Credit Facility, TEGSA is the borrower under our senior notes and commercial paper.
TEGSA's payment obligations under its senior notes, commercial paper, and Credit Facility are fully and unconditionally guaranteed by its parent, TE Connectivity Ltd.  

 Payments of common share dividends to shareholders were $281 million and $263 million in the first six months of fiscal 2018 and 2017, respectively.
In March 2018, our shareholders approved a dividend payment to shareholders of $1.76 per share, payable in four equal quarterly installments of $0.44 per share beginning in the third quarter of fiscal 2018 and ending in the second quarter of fiscal 2019.
During the first six months of fiscal 2018, our board of directors authorized an increase of $1.5 billion in the share repurchase program.
We repurchased approximately 4 million of our common shares for $383 million and approximately 3 million of our common shares for $205 million under our share repurchase program during the first six months of fiscal 2018 and 2017, respectively.
At March 30, 2018, we had $1.6 billion of availability remaining under our share repurchase authorization.

 Commitments and Contingencies 

  Legal Proceedings  

 In the normal course of business, we are subject to various legal proceedings and claims, including patent infringement claims, product liability matters, employment disputes, disputes on agreements, other commercial disputes, environmental matters, antitrust claims, and tax matters, including non-income tax matters such as value added tax, sales and use tax, real estate tax, and transfer tax.
Although it is not feasible to predict the outcome of these proceedings, based upon our experience, current information, and applicable law, we do not expect that the outcome of these proceedings, either individually or in the aggregate, will have a material effect on our results of operations, financial position, or cash flows.
Guarantees  

 In certain instances, we have guaranteed the performance of third parties and provided financial guarantees for uncompleted work and financial commitments.
The terms of these guarantees vary with end dates ranging from fiscal 2018 through the completion of such transactions.
The guarantees would be triggered in the event of nonperformance, and the potential exposure for nonperformance under the guarantees would not have a material effect on our results of operations, financial position, or cash flows.
At March 30, 2018, we had outstanding letters of credit, letters of guarantee, and surety bonds of $285 million.
Tax Sharing Agreement  

 We are a party to a Tax Sharing Agreement that generally governs our, Tyco International plc's, and Covidien plc's respective rights, responsibilities, and obligations with respect to taxes for periods prior to and including June 29, 2007.
See Note 7 to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding the Tax Sharing Agreement.
Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 

 The preparation of the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities, and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses.
Our accounting policies for revenue recognition, goodwill and other intangible assets, income taxes, and pension liabilities are based on, among other things, judgments and assumptions made by management.
For additional information regarding these policies and the underlying accounting assumptions and estimates used in these policies, refer to the Consolidated Financial Statements and accompanying notes contained in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended September 29, 2017.
There were no significant changes to this information during the first six months of fiscal 2018.

Non-GAAP Financial Measure 

  Organic Net Sales Growth  

 We present organic net sales growth as we believe it is appropriate for investors to consider this adjusted financial measure in addition to results in accordance with GAAP.
Organic net sales growth represents net sales growth (the most comparable GAAP financial measure) excluding the impact of foreign currency exchange rates, and acquisitions and divestitures that occurred in the preceding twelve months, if any.
Organic net sales growth is a useful measure of our performance because it excludes items that are not completely under management's control, such as the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates, and items that do not reflect the underlying growth of the company, such as acquisition and divestiture activity.
Organic net sales growth provides useful information about our results and the trends of our business.
Management uses organic net sales growth to monitor and evaluate performance.
Also, management uses organic net sales growth together with GAAP financial measures in its decision-making processes related to the operations of our reportable segments and our overall company.
It is also a significant component in our incentive compensation plans.
We believe that investors benefit from having access to the same financial measures that management uses in evaluating operations.
The tables presented in "Results of Operations" and "Segment Results" provide reconciliations of organic net sales growth to net sales growth calculated in accordance with GAAP.
Organic net sales growth is a non-GAAP financial measure and should not be considered a replacement for results in accordance with GAAP.
This non-GAAP financial measure may not be comparable to similarly-titled measures reported by other companies.
The primary limitation of this measure is that it excludes the financial impact of items that would otherwise either increase or decrease our reported results.
This limitation is best addressed by using organic net sales growth in combination with net sales growth in order to better understand the amounts, character, and impact of any increase or decrease in reported amounts.

LEGAL PROCEEDINGS 

 There have been no material developments in our legal proceedings since we filed our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended September 29, 2017.
Refer to "Part I.
Item 3.
Legal Proceedings" in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended September 29, 2017 for additional information regarding legal proceedings.
RISK FACTORS 

 There have been no material changes in our risk factors from those disclosed in "Part I.
Item 1A.
Risk Factors" in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended September 29, 2017 except as described below.
The risk factors described in our Annual Report on Form 10-K, in addition to other information set forth below and in this report, could materially affect our business operations, financial condition, or liquidity.
Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently believe are immaterial may also impair our business operations, financial condition, and liquidity.
Changes in United States federal tax laws could result in adverse consequences to United States persons treated as owning 10% or more of our shares.
Although we are a Swiss corporation, recent U.S. tax law changes have expanded application of certain ownership attribution rules and cause certain of our non-U.S. subsidiaries to be treated as Controlled Foreign Corporations ("CFCs") for U.S. federal income tax purposes.
A U.S. person that is treated for U.S. federal income tax purposes as owning, directly, indirectly, or constructively, 10% or more of our shares may be required to annually report and include in its U.S. taxable income its pro rata share of certain types of income earned by our subsidiaries that are treated as CFCs, whether or not we make any distributions to such U.S. shareholder.
A U.S. person that owns 10% or more of our shares should consult its own tax advisers regarding any potential implications to it of these changes in U.S. federal income tax law.
The risk of U.S. federal income tax reporting and compliance obligations with respect to our subsidiaries that now are treated as CFCs may deter our current shareholders from increasing their investment in us, and others from investing in us, which could impact the demand for, and value of, our shares.
