Controls and Procedures  

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures  

We carried out an evaluation required by Rules 13a-15 and 15d-15 under the Exchange Act (the Evaluation), under the supervision and with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer (CEO) and Chief Financial Officer (CFO), of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as defined in Rules 13a-15 and 15d-15 under the Exchange Act as of November 30, 2018.
Based on the Evaluation, our CEO and CFO concluded that the design and operation of our disclosure controls were effective to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is (i) recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in SEC rules and forms, and (ii) accumulated and communicated to our senior management, including our CEO and CFO, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.
Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting  

For our fiscal quarter ended November 30, 2018, other than explained below, we did not identify any modifications to our internal control over financial reporting that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
Effective September 1, 2018, we adopted the new revenue standard under ASC Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, using the modified retrospective method of adoption.
The adoption of this guidance required changes to our processes, policies and internal controls, including controls around information used in disclosures, to meet the impact of the new standard and disclosure requirements.
