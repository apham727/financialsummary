 24 



General Risks and Uncertainties:  



●   



The ability of the Company’s four operating units to each function in an efficient and cost-effective manner, under the oversight of the CSI parent;    



●   



The ability of our four business units to operate profitably;    



●   



The ability of the Special Committee of the Board of Directors to develop strategic options for the Company and the Company’s ability to implement these strategies;    



●   



The impact of changing government expenditures in our markets;    



●   



The fact that the sale of the Company’s Minnetonka headquarters is subject to contingencies, some of which are beyond the Company’s control; and    



●   



The fact that our information technology systems may be exposed to various cybersecurity risks and other disruptions that could impair our ability to operate.    



Transition Networks Risks and Uncertainties: 



●   



The ability of Transition Networks to develop and sell new products for new and existing markets at a level adequate to counter the decline in sales of its traditional products;    



●   



Transition Networks’ ability to manufacture and deliver its POE+ (Power-over-Ethernet) switches in a timely manner to meet its 2019 obligations under a contract, through a distributor, with a major metropolitan DOT agency;    



●   



Transition Networks’ reliance on contract manufacturers and OEMs to supply it with components and products in a timely manner as Transition Networks develops and introduces new products    



●   



The fact that as Transition Networks has more success in selling its products as part of a major infrastructure projects, it may experience significant fluctuations in quarter-to-quarter and year-to-year revenue and profitability; and    



●   



Transition Networks’ ability to manage its inventory of components and finished products is complex and complicated by its need to maintain a significant inventory of components (i) that may be or become in short supply or discontinued by the component manufacturer, (ii) that must be purchased in bulk to obtain favorable pricing, or (iii) that require long lead times. These factors may result in Transition Networks purchasing and maintaining significant amounts of inventory, that if not used or expected to be used based on anticipated production requirements, (i) may become excess or obsolete and (ii) could result in sales price reductions or inventory write-downs that could adversely affect Transition Networks’ business and results of operations.    



Suttle Risks and Uncertainties: 



●   



Suttle’s dependence upon its sales to a small number of major communication service providers and these providers’ continued investment and deployment into building and maintaining their networks;    



25 



●   



Volatility in purchases of Suttle’s products by major communication service providers as well as continuing pricing pressure that adversely affects Suttle’s margins;    



●   



Suttle’s ability to develop and sell new product solutions for “Suttle Home, Securely Wired” applications to offset declining sales and lower or fluctuating gross margins in its legacy products;    



●   



Suttle’s ability to utilize its production capacity profitably; and    



●   



The fact that following the April 2019 sale of its FutureLink business, the Company expects Suttle’s sales and operating income to continue to decline and that the Company is exploring options for the remainder of this business.    



JDL Technologies Risks and Uncertainties: 



●   



JDL’s ability to continue to obtain and manage the historically fluctuating business from its traditional South Florida school district customer in light of continuing delays in the government funding of this customer and JDL’s ability to expand to other educational prospects;    



●   



JDL’s ability to profitably increase its business serving small and medium-sized commercial businesses; and    



●   



JDL’s ability to establish and maintain a productive and efficient workforce.    



Net2Edge’s Risks and Uncertainties: 



●   



Net2Edge’s ability to develop, field test, manufacture and sell new products in sufficient quantities to achieve profitability; and    



●   



Net2Edge’s ability to sustain meaningful product differentiation and achieve substantial gross margins.    



The Company discusses these and other risk factors from time to time in its filings with the SEC, including risk factors presented under Item 1A of the Company’s most recently filed Annual Report on Form 10-K and Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q.

The following table summarizes Transition Networks’ 2019 and 2018 first nine month sales by its major product groups: [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 



Sales in North America increased $4,335,000, or 20%, primarily due to sales related to a major metropolitan smart city IoT project that should be substantially complete by the end of 2019, smaller security and surveillance projects and more typical buying patterns as compared to 2018, where we experienced slow demand from a carrier customer and disruptions in our product supply, partially offset by lower sales to a major Tier 1 telecommunications provider. International sales remained flat, with a significant project with a customer in our EMEA region for media converter products in the first quarter of this year, offset by weakness in our rest of world region. Media converter sales increased 2% or $357,000 due to a large EMEA project in the first quarter. Sales of Ethernet switches and adapters increased 62% or $4,138,000 due to involvement in a major metropolitan smart city IoT project and strong demand for new products in North America for smaller security and surveillance projects. All other product sales decreased 3% or $166,000 due mainly to slower activity in our ancillary products business during the first quarter and reduced purchases from a major Tier 1 telecommunications provider. 



Gross profit on first nine months sales increased 17% to $13,739,000 in 2019 as compared to $11,783,000 in 2018.

In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02, “Leases” (Topic 842), which amends existing guidance and requires an entity to recognize both assets and liabilities arising from financing and operating leases, along with additional qualitative and quantitative disclosures. The new standard is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within that reporting period, and early adoption is permitted. The Company adopted the accounting standard effective January 1, 2019. Please see Note 3 for the required disclosures related to the impact of adopting this standard. There were no other significant changes to our critical accounting policies during the nine months ended September 30, 2019. 



The Company’s accounting policies have been consistently applied in all material respects and disclose matters such as allowance for doubtful accounts, sales returns, inventory valuation, warranty expense, income taxes, revenue recognition, asset impairment recognition and foreign currency translation. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates based on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the result of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Results may differ from these estimates due to actual outcomes being different from those on which we based our assumptions. Management reviews these estimates and judgments on an ongoing basis.
