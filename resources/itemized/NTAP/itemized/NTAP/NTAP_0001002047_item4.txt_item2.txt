Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds.
Purchases of equity securities  




In May 2003, our Board of Directors approved a stock repurchase program.
As of October 25, 2019, our Board of Directors has authorized the repurchase of up to $13.6 billion of our common stock.
Since inception of the program through October 25, 2019, we repurchased a total of 327 million shares of our common stock for an aggregate purchase price of $12.5 billion.
Under this program, which we may suspend or discontinue at any time, we may purchase shares of our outstanding common stock through solicited or unsolicited transactions in the open market, in privately negotiated transactions, through accelerated share repurchase programs, pursuant to a Rule 10b5-1 plan or in such other manner as deemed appropriate by our management.
