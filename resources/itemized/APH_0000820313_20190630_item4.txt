Item 4. Controls and Procedures



​



The Company’s management, with the participation of the Company’s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, has evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures, pursuant to Rules 13a-15(e) or 15d-15(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”), as of the end of the period covered by this report. These controls and procedures are designed to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed by the Company in reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission rules and forms, and such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Based on their evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of the end of the period covered by this report.

Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 



​



Beginning January 1, 2019, the Company adopted ASU 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842) (“Topic 842”) and its related subsequent amendments. Although the adoption of Topic 842 did not have a material impact on our Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income for the three and six months ended June 30, 2019, or our Condensed Consolidated Statements of Cash Flow for the six months ended June 30, 2019, the Company implemented changes to our processes related to our lease commitments and the related control activities, including the implementation of a new lease management system and certain controls over financial reporting necessary for the required disclosures, as well as the implementation of new policies and any necessary changes to existing related policies. Refer to Notes 2 and 15 of the accompanying Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion on the adoption of Topic 842. There has been no other change in our internal control over financial reporting during the Company’s most recent fiscal quarter that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
