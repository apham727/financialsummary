Item 2.
Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds.
In February 2018, our Board of Directors authorized a new share repurchase program of up to 20 million shares of our outstanding common stock.
The shares may be repurchased from time to time in one or more open market repurchases or privately negotiated transactions, including accelerated share repurchase transactions.
The actual timing, number and value of shares repurchased under the program will depend on a number of factors, including the market price of our common stock, general market and economic conditions, applicable legal requirements, compliance with the terms of our outstanding indebtedness and other considerations.
There is no assurance as to the number of shares that will be repurchased, and the repurchase program may be suspended or discontinued at any time at our discretion.
This share repurchase authorization replaces the previous share repurchase authorization announced in December 2013.
