Item 1A.
Risk Factors

In addition to the other information set forth in this report, before deciding to invest in j2 Global or to maintain or increase your investment, you should carefully consider the factors discussed in Part I, Item 1A “Risk Factors” in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2017 (the “10-K Risk Factors”) as well as in other documents we file from time to time with the SEC, including the Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q and any Current Reports on Form 8-K filed or to be filed by us in 2018.
If any of these risks occur, our business, prospects, financial condition, operating results and cash flows could be materially adversely affected.
The 10-K Risk Factors are not the only ones we face.
Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial also may impair our business operations.
There have been no material changes from the 10-K Risk Factors.
