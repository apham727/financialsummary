Results of Operations—Three months ended June 29, 2019 compared to three months ended June 30, 2018 



The results of operations for the second quarter of 2019 are not necessarily indicative of the operating results to be expected for the full year. Historically, we have experienced higher revenues in the fourth quarter as compared to the rest of the quarters of our fiscal year as a result of the purchasing patterns of our customers.



Net Sales



[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]



The Products and Systems Integration segment’s net sales represented 67% of our consolidated net sales in the second quarter of 2019 and 68% in the second quarter of 2018. The Services and Software segment’s net sales represented 33% of our consolidated net sales in the second quarter of 2019 and 32% in the second quarter of 2018.



Net sales were up $100 million, or 6%, compared to the second quarter of 2018. The increase in net sales was driven by the Americas, partially offset by a sales decline in EMEA and AP, with a 4% increase in the Products and Systems Integration segment and a 9% increase in the Services and Software segment. This growth includes:



•growth in Devices primarily due to strong demand in the Americas inclusive of acquisitions;



•$33 million of revenue from the acquisitions of VaaS and Avtec; and



•partially offset by $37 million from unfavorable currency rates.



Regional results include:



•growth in the Americas region of 11% across both the Products and Systems Integration and the Services and Software segments, inclusive of revenue from acquisitions; [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]



•a decline in the AP region of 7% due to currency headwinds and lower sales in China.



Products and Systems Integration



The 4% increase in the Products and Systems Integration segment was driven by the following:



•$16 million of revenue from the acquisitions of VaaS and Avtec which closed in the first quarter of 2019;



•12% growth in Devices revenue primarily due to strong demand for land mobile radio ("LMR") and video cameras in the Americas inclusive of revenue from acquisitions; and[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]



Services and Software



The 9% increase in the Services and Software segment was driven by the following:



•$17 million of revenue from the acquisitions of VaaS and Avtec, which closed in the first quarter of 2019;



•34% growth in Software, driven primarily by growth in our video security solutions portfolio and command center software sales inclusive of acquisitions; and



•3% growth in Services, driven by growth in maintenance revenue, partially offset by unfavorable currency headwinds.



Gross Margin 



[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]



Gross margin was 50.1% of net sales in the second quarter of 2019 compared to 46.7% in the second quarter of 2018. The primary drivers of the increase are as follows:



31



•higher margins in the Products and Systems Integration segment driven by a favorable mix of Devices to Systems and Systems Integration, as well as higher margin contribution from the acquisitions of VaaS and Avtec; and



•higher margins within the Services and Software segment primarily driven by operational efficiencies in service delivery costs of our Services portfolio and higher margin contribution within our Software portfolio from acquisitions.



Selling, General and Administrative Expenses



[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]



SG&A expenses increased 11% compared to the second quarter of 2018. SG&A expenses were 18.9% of net sales compared to 18.0% of net sales in the second quarter of 2018. The increase in SG&A expenditures is primarily due to increased expenses associated with acquired businesses and our video security solutions portfolio.



Research and Development Expenditures



[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]



R&D expenditures increased 5% primarily due to increased expenses associated with acquired businesses. R&D expenditures were 9.1% of net sales compared to 9.2% of net sales in the second quarter of 2018. 



Other Charges



[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]



The reduction of Other charges in the second quarter of 2019 as compared to the second quarter of 2018 is due to $8 million of net reorganization of business charges in the second quarter of 2019 as compared to $18 million in the second quarter of 2018, (see further detail in “Reorganization of Businesses” section).



Operating Earnings



[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Interest Expense, net



[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]



The decrease in net interest expense in the second quarter of 2019 compared to the second quarter of 2018 was a result of less average debt outstanding as of and for the period ending June 29, 2019 as compared to the period ending June 30, 2018.



Gains on Sales of Investments and Businesses, net



[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]



Net gains on sales of investments and businesses were $3 million in the second quarter of 2019 compared to losses of $1 million during the second quarter of 2018.

Sales of Receivables



The following table summarizes the proceeds received from sales of accounts receivable and long-term customer financing receivables for the three and six months ended June 29, 2019 and June 30, 2018: 



[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]



The proceeds of our receivable sales are included in "Operating activities" within our Condensed Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.



Debt



We had outstanding long-term debt of $5.3 billion, including the current portions of $28 million and $31 million at June 29, 2019 and December 31, 2018, respectively. 



In February of 2018, we issued $500 million of 4.60% Senior notes due 2028. After debt issuance costs and debt discounts, we recognized net proceeds of $497 million. These proceeds were then used to make a $500 million contribution to our U.S. pension plan in the first quarter of 2018. During the second half of 2018, we issued an additional $200 million on the outstanding notes. We recognized net proceeds of $196 million after debt issuance costs and debt discounts.



To complete the acquisition of Avigilon during the quarter ended March 31, 2018, we entered into a term loan for $400 million with a maturity date of March 26, 2021 (the "Term Loan"). Interest on the Term Loan is variable, indexed to London Inter-bank Offered Rate ("LIBOR"), and paid monthly. The weighted average borrowing rate for amounts outstanding during the three and six months ended June 29, 2019 was 3.72% and 3.74%, respectively. No additional borrowings are permitted and amounts borrowed and repaid or prepaid may not be re-borrowed. 



In May of 2019, we issued $650 million of 4.60% Senior notes due 2029. We recognized net proceeds of $645 million after debt issuance costs and debt discounts. These proceeds were then used to fund a tender offer which resulted in the repurchase of $614 million in principal amount of our outstanding long-term debt for a purchase price of $654 million, excluding approximately $3 million of accrued interest, all of which occurred during the three months ended June 29, 2019. After accelerating the amortization of debt issuance costs and debt discounts, we recognized a loss of approximately $43 million related to this debt tender in Other within Other income (expense) in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations. 



As of June 29, 2019, we had $800 million of 2.0% Senior Convertible Notes outstanding with Silver Lake Partners which mature in September 2020 and are fully convertible. The notes are convertible based on a conversion rate of 14.8968, as may be adjusted for dividends declared, per $1,000 principal amount (which is currently equal to a published conversion price of $67.13 per share). The exercise price adjusts automatically for dividends. In the event of a conversion, the notes may be settled in either cash or stock, at our discretion. We intend to settle the principal amount of the Senior Convertible Notes in cash.



We continue to believe that we hold sufficient liquidity to cover the day-to-day operations of our business as well as any future volatility or uncertainty that may arise in the capital markets.



Credit Facilities



As of June 29, 2019, we had a $2.2 billion syndicated, unsecured revolving credit facility scheduled to mature in April 2022 (the "2017 Motorola Solutions Credit Agreement"). The 2017 Motorola Solutions Credit Agreement includes a $500 million letter of credit sub-limit with $450 million of fronting commitments. Borrowings under the facility bear interest at the prime rate plus the applicable margin, or at a spread above LIBOR, at our option. An annual facility fee is payable on the undrawn amount of the credit line. The interest rate and facility fee are subject to adjustment if our credit rating changes. We must comply with certain customary covenants including a maximum leverage ratio, as defined in the 2017 Motorola Solutions Credit Agreement. We were in compliance with our financial covenants as of June 29, 2019. During the first quarter of 2018, we borrowed $400 million to facilitate the Avigilon acquisition. There were no borrowings outstanding or letters of credit issued under the revolving credit facility as of June 29, 2019.



Share Repurchase Program



During the three and six months ended June 29, 2019, we paid an aggregate of $25 million and $170 million, including transaction costs, to repurchase approximately 0.2 million and 1.4 million shares at an average price of $146.65 and $122.31 per share, respectively. As of June 29, 2019, we had used approximately $12.6 billion of the share repurchase authority, including transaction costs, to repurchase shares, leaving $1.4 billion of authority available for future repurchases.



39



Dividends



During the second quarter of 2019, we paid $94 million in cash dividends to holders of our common stock. During the first half of 2019, we paid $187 million in cash dividends to holders of our common stock. Subsequent to quarter end, we paid an additional $94 million in cash dividends to holders of our common stock. 



Long-Term Customer Financing Commitments



We had outstanding commitments to provide long-term financing to third parties totaling $53 million at June 29, 2019, compared to $62 million at December 31, 2018. 



Other Contingencies



There were no significant changes impacting our commitments and contingencies during the three months ended June 29, 2019.



Recent Accounting Pronouncements



In August 2018, the FASB issued ASU No. 2018-14, “Compensation - Retirement Benefits - Defined Benefit Plans - General (Subtopic 715-20) - Changes to the Disclosure Requirements for Defined Benefit Plans,” which modifies the disclosure requirements for the defined benefit pension plans and other postretirement plans. The ASU is effective for us on January 1, 2021 with early adoption permitted. The ASU requires a retrospective adoption method. We do not believe the ASU will have a material impact on our financial statement disclosures.



In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-13, “Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments,” which requires us to measure and recognize expected credit losses for financial assets held and not accounted for at fair value through net income. In November 2018, April 2019 and May 2019, the FASB issued ASU No. 2018-19, “Codification Improvements to Topic 326, Financial Instruments - Credit Losses,”“ASU No. 2019-04, Codification Improvements to Topic 326, Financial Instruments - Credit Losses, ”“Topic 815, Derivatives and Hedging, and Topic 825, Financial Instruments,” and “ASU No. 2019-05, Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326): Targeted Transition Relief,” which provided additional implementation guidance on the previously issued ASU. The ASU is effective for us on January 1, 2020. The ASU requires a modified retrospective adoption method. We are still evaluating the impact of adoption on our financial statements and disclosures. 



Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements



In February 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued Accounting Standards Update ("ASU") No. 2016-02, "Leases," which amends existing guidance to require lessees to recognize assets and liabilities on the balance sheet for the rights and obligations created by long-term leases and to disclose additional quantitative and qualitative information about leasing arrangements. This was subsequently amended by ASU No. 2018-01, “Land Easement Practical Expedient for Transition to Topic 842,” ASU No. 2018-10, “Codification Improvements to Topic 842, Leases,” and ASU No. 2018-11, “Targeted Improvements” (collectively "ASC 842"). ASC 842 establishes a right-of-use model ("ROU") that requires a lessee to recognize a ROU asset and lease liability on the balance sheet for all leases with an initial term longer than twelve months. Leases will be classified as finance or operating, with classification affecting the pattern and presentation of expense recognition in the income statement.



We adopted ASC 842 as of January 1, 2019 using a modified retrospective transition approach for all leases existing at January 1, 2019, the date of the initial application. Consequently, financial information will not be updated and disclosures required under ASC 842 will not be provided for dates and periods before January 1, 2019.



ASC 842 provides for a number of optional practical expedients in transition. We elected the practical expedients, which permit us to not reassess prior conclusions about lease identification, lease classification and initial direct costs under ASC 842. We did not elect the "use-of hindsight" practical expedient to determine the lease term or in assessing the likelihood that a lease purchase option will be exercised, allowing us to carry forward the lease term as determined prior to adoption of ASC 842. Finally, we also elected the practical expedient related to land easements, which enabled us to continue our accounting treatment for land easements on existing agreements as of January 1, 2019.



ASC 842 also provides practical expedients for an entity’s ongoing accounting. We elected the short-term lease recognition exemption for all leases that qualify. A short-term lease is one with a term of 12 months or less, including any optional periods that are reasonably certain of exercise. For those leases that qualify, the exemption allows us to not recognize ROU assets or lease liabilities, including not recognizing ROU assets or lease liabilities for existing short-term leases at transition. Short-term lease costs are recognized as rent expense on a straight-line basis over the lease term consistent with our prior accounting. We also elected the practical expedient to not separate lease and non-lease components for all current lease categories. 



As of January 1, 2019, we recognized operating lease liabilities of $648 million based on the present value of the remaining minimum rental payments determined under prior lease accounting standards and corresponding ROU assets of $588 million. The $60 million difference between operating lease liabilities and ROU assets recognized is due to deferred rent and exit cost accruals recorded under prior lease accounting standards. ASC 842 requires such balances to be reclassified against ROU assets at transition.



40



For arrangements where we are the lessor, the adoption of ASC 842 did not have a material impact on our financial statements as the majority of our leases are operating leases embedded within managed services contracts. ASC 842 provides a practical expedient for lessors in which the lessor may elect, by class of underlying asset, to not separate non-lease components from the associated lease component and, instead, to account for these components as a single component if both of the following are met: (i) the timing and pattern of transfer of the non-lease component(s) and associated lease component are the same and (ii) the lease component, if accounted for separately, would be classified as an operating lease. The accounting under the practical expedient depends on which component(s) is predominant in the contract. If the non-lease component is predominant, the single component is accounted under ASC Topic 606 "Revenue from Contracts with Customers" and accounting and disclosure under ASC 842 is not applicable. We have elected the above practical expedient and determined that non-lease components are predominant and is accounting for the single components as managed service contracts under ASC Topic 606.
