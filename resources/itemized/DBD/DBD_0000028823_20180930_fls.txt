Forward-Looking Statement Disclosure
In this quarterly report on Form 10-Q, statements that are not reported financial results or other historical information are “forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.” Forward-looking statements give current expectations or forecasts of future events and are not guarantees of future performance.
These forward-looking statements relate to, among other things, the Company's future operating performance, the Company's share of new and existing markets, the Company's short- and long-term revenue and earnings growth rates, and the Company's implementation of cost-reduction initiatives and measures to improve pricing, including the optimization of the Company's manufacturing capacity.

Some of the risks, uncertainties and other factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed in or
implied by the forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to:
