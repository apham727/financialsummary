 Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements
The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements of Diebold Nixdorf, Incorporated and its subsidiaries (collectively, the Company) have been prepared in accordance with the instructions to Form 10-Q and therefore do not include all information and footnotes necessary for a fair presentation of financial position, results of operations and cash flows in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (U.S. GAAP); however, such information reflects all adjustments (consisting solely of normal recurring adjustments) that are, in the opinion of management, necessary for a fair statement of the results for the interim periods.
The condensed consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes contained in the Company’s annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018.
In addition, some of the Company’s statements in this quarterly report on Form 10-Q may involve risks and uncertainties that could significantly impact expected future results.
The results of operations for the three months ended March 31, 2019 are not necessarily indicative of results to be expected for the full year.
Reclassification
Recently Adopted Accounting Guidance
The Company utilizes lease agreements to meet its operating needs.
These leases support global staff via the use of office space, warehouses, vehicles for technicians and information technology (IT) equipment.
The Company utilizes both operating and finance leases in its portfolio of leased assets, however, the majority of these leases are classified as operating.
A significant portion of the volume of the lease portfolio is in fleet vehicles and IT office equipment, however, real estate leases constitute a majority of the value of the ROU assets.
Lease agreements are utilized worldwide, with the largest location concentration in the United States, Germany and India.
•The Company elected the option to apply the transition requirements in ASC 842 at the effective date of January 1, 2019.
The effects of initially applying ASC 842 resulted in no cumulative adjustment to retained earnings in the period of adoption.
•The Company elected the package of practical expedients permitted under the transition guidance within the new standard, which allowed the Company to carry forward its ASC 840 assessment regarding definition of a lease, lease classification, and initial direct costs.
•The practical expedient related to land easements is not applicable as the Company currently does not utilize any easements.

•The Company declined the hindsight practical expedient to determine the lease term and ROU asset impairment for existing leases.
The decision to decline the hindsight practical expedient resulted in relying on assessments made under ASC 840 during transition and re-assessing under ASC 842 going forward.
•The Company declined the short-term lease exception, therefore recognizing all leases in the ROU asset and lease liability balances.
Consistent with ASC 842 requirements, leases that are one month or less are not included in the balance.
•The Company elected to not separate non-lease components from lease components and, instead, to account for each separate lease component and the non-lease components associated with it as a single lease component, recognized on the balance sheet.
This election has been made for all classes of underlying assets.
The weighted-average discount rates used for operating and finance leases varies due to the jurisdictional composition, whereas the Company has an immaterial amount of finance leases that are primarily comprised of leases in Turkey which have higher interest rates.
Certain lease agreements include payments based on a variety of global indexes or rates.
These payment amounts have been projected using the index or rate as of lease commencement or the transition date and measured in ROU assets and lease liabilities.
Other leases contain variable payments that are based on actual usage of the underlying assets and therefore are not measured in assets or liabilities as the variable payments are not based on an index or a rate.
For real estate leases, these payments are most often tied to non-committed maintenance or utilities charges, and for equipment leases, to actual output or hours in operation.
These amounts typically become known when the invoice is received, which is when expense is recognized.
In rare circumstances, our lease agreements may contain residual value guarantees.
Our lease agreements do not contain any restrictions or covenants, such as those relating to dividends or incurring additional financial obligations.
As of March 31, 2019, the Company did not have any leases that have not yet commenced but that create significant rights and obligations.

The Company determines whether an arrangement is or includes a lease at contract inception.
All contracts containing the right to use an underlying asset are reviewed to confirm that the contract meets the definition of a lease.
ROU assets and liabilities are recognized at commencement date and initially measured based on the present value of lease payments over the defined lease term.
As most leases do not provide an implicit rate, we use our incremental borrowing rate based on the information available at commencement date in determining the present value of lease payments.
In order to apply the incremental borrowing rate, a rate table was developed to assign the appropriate rate to each lease based on lease term and currency of payments.
For leases with large numbers of underlying assets, a portfolio approach with a collateralized rate was utilized.
Assets were grouped based on similar lease terms and economic environments in a manner whereby the Company reasonably expects that the application does not differ materially from a lease-by-lease approach.

Finance leases are included in other assets, other current liabilities and other liabilities on the condensed consolidated balance sheets.
Basic earnings (loss) per share is based on the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding.
Diluted earnings (loss) per share includes the dilutive effect of potential common shares outstanding.
Under the two-class method of computing earnings (loss) per share, non-vested share-based payment awards that contain rights to receive non-forfeitable dividends are considered participating securities.
The Company’s participating securities include restricted stock units (RSUs), director deferred shares and shares that were vested but deferred by employees.
The Company calculated basic and diluted earnings (loss) per share under both the treasury stock method and the two-class method.
For the three months ended March 31, 2019 and 2018, there were no differences in the earnings (loss) per share amounts calculated under the two methods.
Accordingly, the treasury stock method is disclosed below.

The Company’s share-based compensation payments to employees are recognized based on their grant-date fair values during the period in which the employee is required to provide services in exchange for the award.
Share-based compensation is primarily recognized as a component of selling and administrative expense.
Total share-based compensation expense was $9.3 and $13.7 for the three months ended March 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively.
In the first quarter of 2019, the Company changed its accounting estimate from using a forfeiture assumption to recording actual forfeitures.
The change resulted in an immaterial increase in share-based compensation expense for the three months ended March 31, 2019.

Performance shares are granted to employees and vest based on the achievement of certain performance objectives, as determined by the board of directors each year.
Each performance share earned entitles the holder to one common share of the Company.
The Company's performance shares include performance objectives that are assessed after a three-year period as well as performance objectives that are assessed annually over a three-year period.
No shares are vested unless certain performance threshold objectives are met.
As of March 31, 2019, there were 0.1 non-employee director deferred shares vested and outstanding.
On April 25, 2019, the Company's shareholders approved amendments to the 2017 Plan, which provide for an additional 3.0 common shares available for award.
The 2017 Plan is expected to attract and retain directors, officers and employees of the Company by providing incentives and rewards for performance.
The effective tax rate on loss from continuing operations was (85.0) percent for the three months ended March 31, 2019.
The expense on the loss is due primarily to the tax impacts of the the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the Tax Act) on the estimated projected tax rate.
More specifically, the impacts of the global intangible low-taxed income (GILTI) and base erosion and anti-abuse tax (BEAT).
In addition, the Company collapsed its Barbados structure to meet the debt covenant requirements from our lenders during the quarter which resulted in additional discrete tax expense which is being offset in part by the valuation allowance release relating to the Company’s nondeductible interest expense resulting in no additional cash taxes.
The above items noted as well as the Company’s jurisdictional income (loss) mix and varying respective statutory rates are the primary drivers of the quarterly tax rate.
The effective tax rate on the net loss was (40.4) percent for the three months ended March 31, 2018.
The expense on the loss is due primarily from impacts related to GILTI on the estimated annual tax rate.

The increase in finished goods inventory was primarily attributable to increased in transit inventory to meet customer orders in Brazil, Thailand and Europe, Middle East and Africa (EMEA).
The Company’s investments, primarily in Brazil, consist of certificates of deposit that are classified as available-for-sale and stated at fair value based upon quoted market prices.
Unrealized gains and losses are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income (AOCI).
Realized gains and losses are recognized in investment income and are determined using the specific identification method.
There were no realized gains from the sale of securities or proceeds from the sale of available-for-sale securities for the three months ended March 31, 2019 and 2018.
The Company has deferred compensation plans that enable certain employees to defer receipt of a portion of their cash, 401(k) or share-based compensation and non-employee directors to defer receipt of director fees at the participants’ discretion.
For deferred cash-based compensation, the Company established rabbi trusts (refer to note 18), which are recorded at fair value of the underlying securities within securities and other investments.
The related deferred compensation liability is recorded at fair value within other long-term liabilities.
Realized and unrealized gains and losses on marketable securities in the rabbi trusts are recognized in interest income.
Securities and other investments also includes a cash surrender value of insurance contracts of $9.3 and $11.1 as of March 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018, respectively.
The decrease is primarily due to death benefits paid.
In addition, it includes an interest rate swap asset carrying value of $2.8 and $4.8 as of March 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018, respectively, which also represents fair value (refer to note 18).

The Company reviews the aging of its financing receivables to determine past due and delinquent accounts.
Credit quality is reviewed at inception and is re-evaluated as needed based on customer-specific circumstances.
Receivable balances 60 days to 89 days past due are reviewed and may be placed on nonaccrual status based on customer-specific circumstances.
Receivable balances are placed on nonaccrual status upon reaching greater than 89 days past due.
Upon receipt of payment on nonaccrual financing receivables, interest income is recognized and accrual of interest is resumed once the account has been made current or the specific circumstances have been resolved.
As of March 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018, the recorded investment in past-due financing receivables was minimal and no recorded investment in the finance receivables was past due 90 days or more and still accruing interest.

Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)
each of the Company's reporting units exceed their carrying values except for the Services-Asia Pacific (AP) and Software-EMEA reporting units which resulted in a non-cash impairment loss of $83.1 during the second quarter 2018.
The Company identified four reporting units, which are Eurasia Banking, Americas Banking, EMEA Retail and Rest of World Retail.
Management determined that the Americas Banking and EMEA Retail reporting unit had a cushion of approximately 20 percent and 10 percent, respectively, when compared to their carrying amounts.
The Eurasia Banking had minimal excess fair value or cushion when compared to their carrying amounts, but primarily due to the reporting unit's improved performance, it did not indicate any impairment during the qualitative annual goodwill impairment test.
Rest of World Retail had no carrying value as of December 31, 2018.
Changes in certain assumptions or the Company's failure to execute on the current plan could have a significant impact to the estimated fair value of the reporting units.
During the second and third quarters 2018, the Company estimated the fair value of its reporting units using a combination of the income valuation and market approach methodologies.
The determination of the fair value of a reporting unit requires significant estimates and assumptions, including significant unobservable inputs.
The key inputs included, but were not limited to, discount rates, terminal growth rates, market multiple data from selected guideline public companies, management’s internal forecasts which include numerous assumptions such as projected net sales, gross profit, sales mix, operating and capital expenditures and earnings before interest and taxes margins, among others.
As a result of certain impairment triggering events, the Company performed an interim impairment test of goodwill for its four reporting units during the third quarter of 2018.
Based on the results of the impairment testing, the Company recorded a non-cash goodwill impairment loss of $134.4 related to the Eurasia Banking, EMEA Retail and Rest of World Retail reporting units during the third quarter of 2018.

The Company has qualified retirement plans covering certain U.S. employees that have been closed to new participants since 2003 and frozen since December 2013.
Plans that cover salaried employees provide retirement benefits based on an employee’s compensation during the ten years before the date of the plan freeze or the date of the employee's actual separation from service, if earlier.
The Company’s funding policy for salaried plans is to contribute annually based on actuarial projections and applicable regulations.
Plans covering hourly employees generally provide benefits of stated amounts for each year of service.
The Company’s funding policy for hourly plans is to make at least the minimum annual contributions required by applicable regulations.
The Company has non-qualified pension plans to provide supplemental retirement benefits to certain officers, which have also been frozen since December 2013.
Benefits are payable at retirement based upon a percentage of the participant’s compensation, as defined.
In addition to providing retirement benefits, the Company provides post-employment healthcare and life insurance benefits (referred to as other benefits) for certain retired employees.
Retired eligible employees in the United States may be entitled to these benefits based upon years of service with the Company, age at retirement and collective bargaining agreements.
There are no plan assets and the Company funds the benefits as the claims are paid.
The post-employment benefit obligation was determined by application of the terms of medical and life insurance plans together with relevant actuarial assumptions and healthcare cost trend rates.
The Company also has defined benefit plans in Germany and Switzerland, among others.
In Germany, post-employment benefit plans are set up as employer funded pension plans and deferred compensation plans.
The employer funded pension commitments in Germany are based upon direct performance-related commitments in terms of defined contribution plans.
Each beneficiary receives, depending on individual pay-scale grouping, contractual classification or income level, different yearly contributions.
The contribution is multiplied by an age factor appropriate to the respective pension plan and credited to the individual retirement account of the employee.
The retirement accounts may be used up at retirement by either a one-time lump-sum payout or payments of up to ten years.
Insured events include disability, death and reaching of retirement age.
In Switzerland, the post-employment benefit plan is required due to statutory provisions.
The employees receive their pension payments as a function of contributions paid, a fixed interest rate and annuity factors.
Insured events are disability, death and reaching of retirement age.

The Company is exposed to certain risks arising from both its business operations and economic conditions.
The Company principally manages its exposures to a wide variety of business and operational risks through management of its core business activities.
The Company manages economic risks, including interest rate and foreign exchange rate risk, through the use of derivative financial instruments.
Specifically, the Company enters into derivative financial instruments to manage exposures that arise from business or financing activities.
The Company’s derivative foreign currency instruments are used to manage differences in the amount of the Company’s known or expected cash receipts and cash payments principally related to the Company’s non functional currency assets and liabilities.
The Company's interest rate derivatives are used to manage the differences in amount due to variable rate interest rate borrowings.

Interest Rate
Cash Flow Hedges The Company’s objectives in using interest rate derivatives are to add stability to interest expense and to manage its exposure to interest rate movements.
Amounts reported in AOCI related to derivatives will be reclassified to interest expense as interest payments are made on the Company’s variable-rate debt.
The Company estimates that a minimal amount will be reclassified as a decrease to interest expense over the next year.
In November 2016, the Company entered into multiple pay-fixed receive-variable interest rate swaps with an aggregate notional amount of $400.0.
The effective portion of changes in the fair value of derivatives designated and that qualify as cash flow hedges is recorded in AOCI and is subsequently reclassified into earnings in the period that the hedged forecasted transaction affects earnings.
The ineffective portion of the change in fair value of the derivatives is recognized directly in earnings.
The Company has an interest rate swap for a nominal sum of €50.0, which was entered into in May 2010 with a ten-year term from October 1, 2010 until September 30, 2020.

Refer to note 11 for further details surrounding the Company's long-term debt as of March 31, 2019 compared to December 31, 2018.

In the second and third quarters of 2018, in connection with certain triggering events, the Company performed impairment tests of goodwill for all of its reporting units, refer to note 8 for further details.
Besides goodwill from certain reporting units noted above, there were no significant assets or liabilities that were remeasured at fair value on a non-recurring basis during the period presented.
Contractual Obligation
At March 31, 2019, the Company had purchase commitments due within one year totaling $0.1 for materials and services through contract manufacturing agreements at negotiated prices.
The Company guarantees a fixed cost of certain products used in production to its China strategic partners.
Indirect Tax Contingencies
The Company accrues non-income-tax liabilities for indirect tax matters when management believes that a loss is probable and the amounts can be reasonably estimated, while contingent gains are recognized only when realized.
In the event any losses are sustained in excess of accruals, they are charged against income.
In evaluating indirect tax matters, management takes into consideration factors such as historical experience with matters of similar nature, specific facts and circumstances, and the likelihood of prevailing.
Management evaluates and updates accruals as matters progress over time.
It is reasonably possible that some of the matters for which accruals have not been established could be decided unfavorably to the Company and could require recognizing future expenditures.
Also, statutes of limitations could expire without the Company paying the taxes for matters for which accruals have been established, which could result in the recognition of future gains upon reversal of these accruals at that time.
The Company has challenged multiple customs rulings in Thailand seeking to retroactively collect customs duties on previous imports of automatic teller machines (ATMs).
In August 2017 and March 2019, the Supreme Court of Thailand ruled in the Company's favor in two of the matters, finding that Customs' attempt to collect duties for importation of ATMs was improper.
The surviving matters remain at various stages of the appeals process and the Company will use the Supreme Court's decisions in support of its position in those matters.
Management remains confident that the Company has a valid legal position in these appeals.
Accordingly, the Company does not have any amount accrued for this contingency.
A loss contingency is reasonably possible if it has a more than remote but less than probable chance of occurring.
Although management believes the Company has valid defenses with respect to its indirect tax positions, it is reasonably possible that a loss could occur in excess of the estimated accrual.
The Company estimated the aggregate risk at March 31, 2019 to be up to $118.7 for its material indirect tax matters, of which $27.0 related to the Thailand customs matter disclosed above.
The aggregate risk related to indirect taxes is adjusted as the applicable statutes of limitations expire.
Legal Contingencies
At December 31, 2018, the Company was a party to several lawsuits that were incurred in the normal course of business, which neither individually nor in the aggregate were considered material by management in relation to the Company’s financial position or results of operations.
In management’s opinion, the Company's consolidated financial statements would not be materially affected by the outcome of these legal proceedings, commitments or asserted claims.

A ruling by the court would apply to all Diebold Nixdorf AG shares outstanding at the time the DPLTA became effective.
