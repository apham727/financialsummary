Gross Profit
Services gross margin increased 5.0 percent and 2.7 percent in the three and six months ended June 30, 2019, respectively.
Both the three and six months ended June 30, 2019 were unfavorably impacted by higher restructuring charges of $2.9 and $2.4, respectively.
For the three months ended June 30, 2019, non-routine charges were flat compared to the prior-year period.
The six months ended June 30, 2019 were favorably impacted by lower non-routine charges of $2.0 primarily related to a recovery on a spare parts inventory provision in 2019 and higher integration costs in 2018.
Excluding restructuring and non-routine charges, services gross margin increased 5.4 percent and 2.8 percent, respectively, for the three and six months ended June 30, 2019 as services margin increased in the Eurasia banking segment related to the favorable impact of the services modernization initiatives and favorable mix of higher margin installation activity driven by the Company's focus on more profitable business.
The three and six months ended June 30, 2018, were unfavorably impacted by one-time banking services cost in Brazil.
Product gross margin increased 4.0 percent and 3.6 percent in the three and six months ended June 30, 2019, respectively.
The three months ended June 30, 2019 were unfavorably impacted by higher restructuring charges of $0.5, while the six months ended June 30, 2019 experienced lower restructuring charges of $0.1.
Both the three and six months ended June 30, 2019 were favorably impacted by lower non-routine charges of $8.7 and $13.3, respectively, primarily related to lower purchase accounting adjustments of amortization and gain on a product inventory provision, partially offset by the reversal of a Brazil indirect tax accrual in the first quarter of 2018.
Excluding the impact of restructuring and non-routine charges, products gross margin increased 2.0 percent and 1.9 percent in the three and six months ended June 30, 2019, respectively.
The increase was primarily due to higher volume and a more favorable solution mix in Brazil and Canada along with higher margin Windows 10 upgrades in Austria.
Additionally, product gross margin improved from the Company's focus on higher margin product mix in Eurasia and Latin America as well as improved supply chain management and lower expedited freight costs in the Americas.
The increases were partially offset by increased software cost throughout the segments.
Operating Expenses
Management's Discussion and Analysis of
Financial Condition and Results of Operations as of June 30, 2019
DIEBOLD NIXDORF, INCORPORATED AND SUBSIDIARIES
Selling and administrative expense increased in both the three and six months ended June 30, 2019 by $2.3 and $2.7, respectively.
Excluding higher incremental restructuring of $1.7 and higher non-routine charges of $11.0, the three months ended June 30, 2019 expense decreased $10.4.
For the six months ended June 30, 2019, excluding higher incremental restructuring of $2.6 and non-routine charges of $17.1, the expense decreased $17.0.
The decrease in selling and administrative expense for both the three and six months ended June 30, 2019 is primarily attributable to the cost reduction initiatives and restructuring program savings across the segments tied to the DN Now program partially offset by an unfavorable impact of the mark-to-market adjustment of the legacy Wincor Nixdorf stock option program.
Non-routine cost in selling and administrative expense was $52.0 and $98.8 in the three and six months ended June 30, 2019, respectively, an increase of $12.8 and $19.8, respectively, compared to the prior-year periods.
The higher non-routine costs in the three months ended June 30, 2019 consisted of increased DN Now transformation expense and $2.5 related to a one-time non-cash item in Brazil.
The six months ended June 30, 2019 consisted of increased DN Now transformation expense, a one-time non-cash accounts receivable discount in Brazil and $5.6 related to the German real estate tax from the squeeze out in the first quarter of 2019.
These increases were partially offset by lower integration expense of $26.5 and purchase accounting adjustments of $3.9.
Selling and administrative expense included restructuring charges of $4.8 and $7.0 for the three and six months ended June 30, 2019, respectively, or $1.7 and $2.6, respectively, higher than the prior-year periods, related to the workforce alignment under the DN Now plan.
Research, development and engineering expense in the three months ended June 30, 2019 decreased $4.5 including a net favorable currency impact of $1.6, primarily related to the euro.
In the six months ended June 30, 2019, research, development and engineering expense decreased $9.3 including a net favorable currency impact of $3.9.
Excluding the impact of currency, Research, development and engineering expense decreased $2.9 and $5.4 due primarily lower headcount tied to the Company’s DN Now restructuring program, partially offset by increased software development cost.
The Company recorded a goodwill impairment charge of $83.1 in the second quarter of 2018.
In the three months ended June 30, 2019, the loss on sale of assets consists mainly of the loss on the finalization of divestitures in the retail and banking SecurCash businesses.
The six months ended June 30, 2019 included the loss of the Venezuela business and losses from the divestiture and liquidation of non-core businesses in Eurasia.
The gain of $6.9 in the prior-year period was primarily related to the sale of a building in North America of $4.5 and the liquidation of the Barbados operating entity of $3.3.
Operating expense as a percent of net sales in the three months ended June 30, 2019 decreased 7.6 percent to 23.5 percent compared to the same period in 2018 and decreased 3.2 percent to 24.7 percent for the six months ended June 30, 2019 compared to the same period in 2018.
The decreases were due primarily from the impairment charge in 2018 and lower research, development and engineering expense, partially offset by the gains on sale of a building in North America and the impact of divestitures.
Operating Profit (Loss)
The operating profit increased in the three and six months ended June 30, 2019 compared to the same periods in 2018.
The change is primarily due to the impairment charge in 2018 and higher product gross profit in the Americas and Eurasia banking segments from large roll out and upgrade projects, partially offset by the increase in the loss on sale of assets.

DIEBOLD NIXDORF, INCORPORATED AND SUBSIDIARIES
Other Income (Expense)
Interest income was relatively flat for the three and six months ended June 30, 2019.
Interest expense increased $21.5 and $46.4 in the three and six months ended June 30, 2019, respectively, compared to the same prior-year periods due to higher domestic interest rates and the incurrence of the additional $650.0 of Term Loan A-1 Facility debt with higher incremental interest rates and related fee amortization.
Foreign exchange loss increased $2.0 in the three months ended June 30, 2019 and decreased $2.2 in the six months ended June 30, 2019 primarily as a result of the currency devaluation in the Venezuela operating entity in the current year.
Miscellaneous net, decreased $2.3 and $1.0 in the three and six months ended June 30, 2019, respectively, impacted by lower costs associated with the company owned life insurance.
Net Loss
The loss before taxes and net loss decreased primarily due to the reasons described above.
Net loss was also impacted by the change in the income tax expense.
The effective tax rate on loss from continuing operations was (20.0) percent for the three months ended June 30, 2019 and (59.5) percent for the six months ended June 30, 2019.
The tax expense on the loss is due primarily to the impacts of the Tax Act on the estimated projected tax rate, more specifically, the impacts of GILTI and BEAT.
In addition, for the six months ended June 30, 2019, the Company collapsed its Barbados structure to meet the covenant requirements under its credit agreement, which resulted in additional discrete tax expense, which was offset in part by the valuation allowance release relating to the Company’s nondeductible interest expense that was carried forward from December 31, 2018.
The above items noted as well as the Company’s jurisdictional income (loss) mix at varying statutory rates are the primary drivers of the quarterly tax rate.
The effective tax rate on loss from continuing operations was 18.8 percent for the three months ended June 30, 2018 and 5.1 percent for the six months ended June 30, 2018.
The benefit on the losses for these periods was decreased primarily due to nondeductible permanent discrete adjustment associated with the goodwill impairment charge and the impacts of the Tax Act, more specifically, impacts related to GILTI on the estimated annual tax rate.

Excluding currency and a small divestiture, net sales increased $89.7 driven primarily by product sales in Canada, Brazil Mexico and the U.S regional customers related to unit replacements from Windows 10 upgrades.

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates
Management’s discussion and analysis of the Company’s financial condition and results of operations are based upon the Company’s condensed consolidated financial statements.
The preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions about future events.
These estimates and the underlying assumptions affect the amounts of assets and liabilities reported, disclosures about contingent assets and liabilities and reported amounts of revenues and expenses.
Such estimates include revenue recognition, the valuation of trade, finance lease receivables, inventories, goodwill, intangible assets, other long-lived assets, legal contingencies, guarantee obligations and assumptions used in the calculation of income taxes, pension and post-retirement benefits and customer incentives, among others.
These estimates and assumptions are based on management’s best estimates and judgment.
Management evaluates its estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis using historical experience and other factors.
Management monitors the economic conditions and other factors and will adjust such estimates and assumptions when facts and circumstances dictate.
As future events and their effects cannot be determined with precision, actual results could differ significantly from these estimates.
In addition to the items that the Company disclosed as its critical accounting policies and estimates in Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in the Company’s annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018, the Company adopted ASU 2016-02 and its subsequent amendments related to lease accounting.
The standard requires that a lessee recognize on its balance sheet right-of-use assets and corresponding liabilities resulting from leasing transactions, as well as additional financial statement disclosures.
Previously, U.S. GAAP only required balance sheet recognition for leases classified as capital leases.
The provisions of this update apply to substantially all leased assets.
Subsequent ASUs related to this standard are updates, which prescribe a practical expedient for implementation and narrow-scope improvements for lessors.
For more information regarding the implementation of this standard, refer to note 2.
