PART II -- OTHER INFORMATION

LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

We are presently engaged in various legal actions arising in the normal course of business.
We believe that it is unlikely that any of these actions will have a material adverse impact on our operating results; however, because of the inherent uncertainties of litigation, the outcome of any of these actions could be unfavorable and could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.
For additional information about our material legal proceedings, please see Note 6, Commitments and Contingencies, of the accompanying notes to the condensed consolidated financial statements.
RISK FACTORS 

You should carefully consider the risk factors discussed in Part I, "Item 1A.
Risk Factors" in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2018, filed with the SEC on May 9, 2018 (the "Form 10-K"), each of which could materially affect our business, financial position, or future results of operations.
Except as described below, there have been no material changes to the risk factors included in the Form 10-K.
The failure to successfully integrate the business and operations of Polycom in the expected time frame and achieve the expected synergies may adversely affect the business and financial results of the combined company.
•the inability to integrate the businesses in a timely and cost-efficient manner or do so without adversely impacting revenue, operations, including new product launches;

•expected synergies or operating efficiencies may fail to materialize in whole or part, or may not occur within expected time-frames;

•the failure to successfully manage relationships with each company’s historic customers, resellers, end-users, suppliers and strategic partners and their operating results and businesses generally (including the diversion of management time to react to new and unforeseen issues);

•the failure to accurately estimate the potential markets and market shares for the combined company’s products, the nature and extent of competitive responses to the acquisition and the ability of the combined company to achieve or exceed projected market growth rates;

•the inability to retain or attract key personnel;

•the failure to successfully advocate the benefits of the combined company for existing and potential end-users, customers, and resellers or general uncertainty regarding the value proposition of the combined entity or its products;

•the failure to effectively compete against larger companies or companies with well-established market shares in the broader markets expected to be served by the combined company or the perceived threat by competitors that the combined company represents to their existing markets; 

•difficulties forecasting financial results, particularly in light of distinct business cycles between the two companies with a significantly higher proportion of Polycom’s quarterly bookings and revenues being recognized in the third month of each quarter, making the timing of revenue and expenses more difficult to predict and providing accurate guidance to financial analysts and investors less certain;

•outcomes or rulings in known or as yet to be discovered regulatory enforcement, litigation or other similar matters that are, alone or in the aggregate, materially adverse;

•negative effects on the market price of our common stock as a result of the transaction, particularly in light of the issuance of our stock in the transaction and forecasts and expectations of analysts;

•our financial reporting including those resulting from system implementations in the context of the integration, our ability to report or forecast financial results of the combined company and that we may be unable to successfully discover and assess and integrate into our reporting system, any of which may adversely impact our ability to make timely and accurate filings with the SEC and other domestic and foreign governmental agencies;

•difficulties integrating professional services revenue streams with historic hardware sales and subscription services without adversely impacting revenue recognition;

•the potential impact of the transaction on our future tax rate and payments based on the consolidation global entity and our ability to quickly integrate foreign operations;

•the challenges of integrating the supply chains of the two companies; and

•the potential that our due diligence did not uncover risks and potential liabilities of Polycom.
The actual integration may result in additional and unforeseen expenses or delays, distract management from other revenue or acquisition opportunities, and increase the combined company’s expenses and working capital requirements, particularly in the short-term.
If we are unable to successfully integrate Polycom's business and operations in a timely manner, the anticipated benefits of the acquisition may not be fully realized, or at all, or may take longer to realize than anticipated.
Should any of the foregoing or other currently unanticipated risks arise, our business and results of operations may be materially adversely impacted.
We have incurred significant indebtedness to finance the acquisition of Polycom, which will decrease our business flexibility and increase borrowing costs, which may adversely affect our operations and financial results.
In connection with the acquisition of Polycom, we borrowed approximately $1.275 billion, which was financed through a senior secured term loan bearing interest at LIBOR plus 250 bps maturing in July 2025 (“Credit Agreement”).
As a result, upon completion of the acquisition we increased our indebtedness in an amount materially greater than our historical indebtedness.
The financial and other covenants in the Credit Agreement and our increased indebtedness and higher debt-to-equity ratio will have the effect, among other things, of reducing our flexibility to respond to changing business and economic conditions and increasing borrowing costs, and may adversely affect our operations and financial results.
In addition, our failure to comply with the covenants could result in a default under the Credit Agreement and our other debt, which could permit the holders to accelerate such debt or demand payment in exchange for a waiver of such default.
If any of our debt is accelerated, we may not have sufficient funds available to repay such debt as due.
The current debt under the Credit Agreement has a floating interest rate that is based on variable and unpredictable U.S. and international economic risks and uncertainties and an increase in interest rates may negatively impact our financial results.
We enter into interest rate hedging transactions that reduce, but do not mitigate, the impact of unfavorable changes in interest rates.
There is no guarantee that our hedging efforts will be effective or, if effective in one period will continue to remain effective in future periods.
In addition, the mandatory debt repayment schedule of the Credit Agreement and the maturity our existing 5.50% Senior Notes in 2023 may negatively impact our cash position and further reduce our financial flexibility.
Furthermore, any changes by rating agencies to our credit rating in connection with such indebtedness may negatively impact the value and liquidity of our debt and equity securities.
Were any of the risks referenced above or related risks were to occur, our operations and financial results may be materially and adversely impacted.
The integration of the combined companies may result in significant expenses and accounting charges that adversely affect our operating results and financial condition.
We have significant manufacturing, assembly and packaging operations in Mexico and rely on third party manufacturers located outside of U.S., and a significant amount of our revenues are generated internationally, each of which subjects our business to risks of international operations.
We own and operate a manufacturing facility in Tijuana, Mexico, which is responsible for assembly of a significant portion of our Enterprise products from materials and components sourced from various suppliers in Asia and North America, and other suppliers.
Additionally, our Tijuana facility is primarily responsible for the packaging and final processing of most of our Consumer products after manufacturing and assembly by third parties, many of which are located in Asia, China in particular.
Also, we generate a significant amount of our revenues from foreign customers.
•Fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates;

•Tariffs, taxes and other trade barriers, including recent actions in the United States, China as well as historical regulations in developing nations such as Brazil, India, and others;

•Greater difficulty in accounts receivable collection and longer collection periods;

•Impact of recessionary, volatile or adverse global economic conditions;

•Reduced intellectual property rights protections in some countries;

•Different and changing regulatory requirements;

•Cultural differences in the conduct of business;

•Implementation or expansion of trade restrictions, sanctions or other penalties against one or more countries, its citizens or industries;

•Unstable or uncertain political and economic situations such as the United Kingdom’s decision to leave the European Union;

•Political conditions, health epidemics, civil unrest, or criminal activities within countries in which we operate;

•Management, operation, and expenses associated with an enterprise spread over various countries;

•Burden and administrative costs of complying with a wide variety of foreign laws and regulations;

•Currency restrictions; and

•Compliance with anti-bribery laws, including the United States Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and the United Kingdom's Bribery Act.
Additionally, recently announced tariffs by the United States will, if implemented as currently proposed, levy tariffs on products, including those incorporating Bluetooth technology that are manufactured in China.
A portion of our Consumer and Enterprise products contain Bluetooth technology and a number of our accessory products are manufactured in China.
If implemented in their currently proposed form, the tariffs are expected to have a materially adverse impact on the profitability of our Consumer category.
Similarly, proposals to impose tariffs, border taxes, and other actions related to the importation of goods from Mexico as well as renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement with Mexico and Canada have been suggested by the United States.
Considering the nature and extent of our imports from China and operations in Tijuana, our revenues and results of operations may be materially and adversely impacted should any legislation or executive actions take effect that limit or increase the cost of 

importing our products.
Alternatively, if we deem it necessary to alter all or a portion of our domestic and international activities in response to such legislation or executive actions, our capital and operating costs may increase, possibly substantially.
The above listed and other inherent risks of international operations could materially and adversely affect regional economic activity and business operations in general, which in turn may harm our business, financial conditions, and results of operations.
Our largest stockholder has the means to influence our business and operations, its interests may differ from those of our other stockholders, and sales by that shareholder into the market could impact the price of our common stock.
As a consequence of our acquisition of Polycom, Inc. on July 2, 2018, we issued shares of our common stock to Triangle Private Holdings II, LLC ("Triangle"), an entity indirectly controlled by Siris Capital Group, LLC ("Siris"), equivalent to approximately 16% of our issued and outstanding shares, which made Triangle our largest single stockholder.
In addition, we entered into a Stockholder Agreement with Triangle pursuant to which we appointed two individuals selected by Triangle to our board of directors.
The interests of Triangle, Siris and its other affiliated entities and individuals may differ from the interests of other holders of our common stock.
Siris also holds, or in the future may hold, interests in other companies, that may compete with us, and the director representatives of Triangle are not required to present to us corporate opportunities such as potential acquisitions or new clients.
Triangle will be permitted to sell up to one-third of the shares issued pursuant to the acquisition on July 2, 2019, up to two-thirds of their shares beginning on January 2, 2020 and all of the shares after July 2, 2020.
The average daily trading volume of our stock is limited, and any resale of the shares held by Triangle will increase the number of shares of our common stock available for public trading, which may depress the price of our stock.
Additionally, the sale by Triangle or their successors of all or a substantial portion of the shares in the public market, or the perception that such sales may occur, could impact the price of our common stock.
The risks described here and on the Form 10-K are not the only risks we face.
Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial also may materially adversely affect our business, financial position, or future results of operations.
