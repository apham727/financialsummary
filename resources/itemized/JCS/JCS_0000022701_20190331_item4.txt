Item 4. Controls and Procedures 





The Company maintains disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934) that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the Company in reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is (i) recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in SEC rules and forms and (ii) accumulated and communicated to the Company’s management, including its principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.  



Management, with the participation of the Company’s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, has evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of the disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as of the end of the period covered by this report. Based on that evaluation, as detailed below, management concluded that the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures are effective. 





Beginning January 1, 2019, we adopted ASU No. 2016-02, “Leases (Topic 842),” which resulted in recording lease liabilities and right-of-use assets on our consolidated balance sheet. ASC 842 requires management to make significant judgments and estimates. As a result, we implemented changes to our internal controls related to leases for the three months ended March 31, 2019. These changes include implementing updated processes and controls affected by ASC 842. There was no other change in our internal control over financial reporting during our most recently completed fiscal quarter that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. As disclosed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018, we concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective.
