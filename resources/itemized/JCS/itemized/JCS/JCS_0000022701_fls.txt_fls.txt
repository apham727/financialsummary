●   

Transition Networks’ ability to manufacture and deliver its POE+ (Power-over-Ethernet) switches in a timely manner to meet its 2019 obligations under a contract, through a distributor, with a major metropolitan DOT agency;

Transition Networks’ reliance on contract manufacturers and OEMs to supply it with components and products in a timely manner as Transition Networks develops and introduces new products    

●   

The fact that as Transition Networks has more success in selling its products as part of a major infrastructure projects, it may experience significant fluctuations in quarter-to-quarter and year-to-year revenue and profitability; and    

●   

Transition Networks’ ability to manage its inventory of components and finished products is complex and complicated by its need to maintain a significant inventory of components (i) that may be or become in short supply or discontinued by the component manufacturer, (ii) that must be purchased in bulk to obtain favorable pricing, or (iii) that require long lead times.
These factors may result in Transition Networks purchasing and maintaining significant amounts of inventory, that if not used or expected to be used based on anticipated production requirements, (i) may become excess or obsolete and (ii) could result in sales price reductions or inventory write-downs that could adversely affect Transition Networks’ business and results of operations.
●   

Suttle’s dependence upon its sales to a small number of major communication service providers and these providers’ continued investment and deployment into building and maintaining their networks;    


●   

Volatility in purchases of Suttle’s products by major communication service providers as well as continuing pricing pressure that adversely affects Suttle’s margins;    

●   

Suttle’s ability to develop and sell new product solutions for “Suttle Home, Securely Wired” applications to offset declining sales and lower or fluctuating gross margins in its legacy products;    

●   

Suttle’s ability to utilize its production capacity profitably; and    

●   

The fact that following the April 2019 sale of its FutureLink business, the Company expects Suttle’s sales and operating income to continue to decline and that the Company is exploring options for the remainder of this business.
●   

JDL’s ability to continue to obtain and manage the historically fluctuating business from its traditional South Florida school district customer in light of continuing delays in the government funding of this customer and JDL’s ability to expand to other educational prospects;

●
