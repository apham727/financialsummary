Item 1A.Risk Factors 

There have been no material changes in our risk factors from those included in “Item 1A.
Risk Factors” in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2018, except as noted below.
We participate in the MCA industry, which presents a number of unique risks.
In December 2018, we acquired certain advance assets from an MCA originator and funder that is a leader in the MCA sector.
An MCA funder provides small businesses with cash advances in return for the purchase of an amount of the small business’s future receipts.
This type of transaction is not characterized or structured as a loan.
Small businesses typically seek these advances for working capital purposes to finance their purchase of inventory or equipment, or to otherwise address immediate business needs.
This business presents a number of unique risks, including the illiquidity of the cash advances; our critical reliance on certain individuals to operate the business; collection and cash advance repayment issues and challenges given that the MCAs are typically unsecured; and sensitivity to general economic conditions.
Because real estate assets are relatively illiquid, we may not be able to diversify, liquidate, or monetize our real estate portfolio in response to changes in economic and other relevant conditions, which may result in losses.
The illiquidity of our real estate portfolio may also result in us seeking financing in order to expand our operations while maintaining sufficient liquid assets to execute our business plan.
Real estate assets are relatively illiquid.
A variety of factors could make it difficult for us to modify our real estate portfolio in response to changing economic or other relevant conditions, thus creating risk of loss associated with those changed conditions.
In addition, we may seek to restrict the percentage of our assets that are contained in illiquid real estate assets by seeking financing to continue expansion of our real estate operations while maintaining sufficient liquid assets to execute our business plan and invest in other value producing assets, including acquisition of additional businesses and assets.
Further, reserving a certain percentage of our liquid assets may benefit our financial performance by increasing our ability to modify our operations to respond to adverse economic or other relevant conditions.
Any financing that we obtain creates risks normally associated with financing, including the risk that our cash flow is insufficient to make timely payments of interest or principal.
We may engage in real estate transactions or other strategic opportunities that involve property types or structures with which we have less familiarity, thereby increasing our risk of loss.
We may decide to participate in real estate transactions and other strategic opportunities in which we have limited or no prior experience.
When engaging in such transactions, we may not be successful in our diligence and underwriting efforts.
We may also be unsuccessful in preserving value if conditions deteriorate and we may expose ourselves to unknown substantial risks.
Furthermore, engaging in unfamiliar transactions may require additional management time and attention relative to transactions with which we are more familiar.
All of these factors increase our risk of loss.
We may continue to grow our business through acquisitions, which entails substantial risk.
We may continue growing our operating business through one or more acquisitions.
Such acquisitions entail substantial risk.
During our due diligence of such acquisitions, we may not uncover all relevant liabilities and we may have limited, if any, recourse against the sellers.
We may also incur significant transaction and integration costs in connection with such acquisitions.
Further, we may not successfully integrate the acquired assets or businesses into our existing business and operations, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial performance.
In addition, post-closing expansion of any acquired assets and businesses may subject us to additional costs or make us vulnerable to regulations or rules that were not assessed prior to acquisition.
We may be limited in the types of acquisitions that we can pursue in order to preserve use of our NOLs.
We currently have NOLs valued at $56.1 million as of June 30, 2018.
We may be able to achieve greater realization of the value of our NOLs with certain business or asset acquisitions.
There is no guarantee that we will be able to find or consummate an acquisition that allows for utilization of our NOLs and we may engage in acquisitions that do not facilitate use of the NOLs.
In any acquisition we may be limited by our available cash and cash equivalents or our ability to obtain financing in order to preserve use of our NOLs.
Use of our NOLs can be impaired by certain shifts in the ownership of our common stock and, thus, we are limited in our ability to use stock in an acquisition for NOL preservation purposes.
Alternatively, while we have not identified or committed to any such transactions, we may identify acquisitions that we believe will provide value sufficient to forgo preservation of the NOLs to participate in the acquisition opportunity.
Failure of the Asset Manager to effectively perform its obligations to us could have an adverse effect on our business and performance.
We have engaged the Asset Manager to provide asset management and other services to us pursuant to the Management Agreement.
Our ability to achieve investment and business objectives will be impacted by the performance of the Asset Manager and its ability to provide us with asset management and other services.
If, for any reason, the Asset Manager is unable to perform such services at the level we require, our business operations and financial performance may be adversely affected.
The fee structure with the Asset Manager could encourage the Asset Manager to invest our assets in riskier investments.
The Asset Manager has discretionary management over our portfolio of publicly traded securities, subject to our investment policy and oversight of the Board.
The Asset Manager has the ability to earn a management fee calculated based on the value of our total assets which may create incentive for the Asset Manager to invest, to the extent permitted by our investment policy, in investments with higher yield potential, that are generally riskier or more speculative, or sell an investment prematurely for a gain, in an effort to increase our short-term net income and thereby increase the fee to which it is entitled.
If our interests and those of the Asset Manager are not aligned, the execution of our business plan and results of operations could be adversely affected, which could materially and adversely affect the market price of our common stock.
The Asset Manager may not be successful in equitably allocating investment opportunities between its managed accounts.
The Management Agreement requires the Asset Manager to act in a fair and reasonable manner in allocating investment and trading opportunities among our account and any other account managed by the Asset Manager or any of its affiliates.
Specifically, the Asset Manager is charged with (i) executing orders on an equitable basis whenever it would be appropriate for our account and the Asset Manager’s other managed accounts to participate in an investment opportunity and (ii) causing our account to pay or receive a price that is no less favorable than the average of the prices paid by the Asset Manager’s other managed accounts.
However, there is no assurance that the Asset Manager will be able to successfully eliminate any conflicts of interest arising from the allocation of investment opportunities.
In addition, the Asset Manager assists with the Company’s identification of target businesses and assets for acquisition.
The Asset Manager may identify target operating businesses and assets that would be appropriate for acquisition by us and other entities managed by the Asset Manager and, after consideration of relevant factors, the Asset Manager may determine the target opportunity is more suitable for us or a different entity.
The Asset Manager manages our portfolio pursuant to broad investment guidelines and the Board of Directors and Asset Management Committee do not approve each investment and financing decision made by the Asset Manager unless required by our investment guidelines.
Pursuant to the Management Agreement, the Asset Manager has exclusive authority to manage the Company’s securities investment portfolio pursuant to the parameters set in our investment guidelines.
The Board of Directors periodically reviews our investment guidelines but does not, and is not required to, review all of our proposed investments, except in certain circumstances outlined in the investment guidelines.
While the Asset Manager is required to provide reporting of transactions undertaken on our behalf, those transactions may be costly, difficult, or impossible to unwind by the time they are reviewed by the Board of Directors.
The Asset Manager has flexibility, within the broad parameters of our investment guidelines, in determining the types and amounts of investments in which to invest on our behalf, including making investments that may result in returns that are substantially below expectations or in losses, which could materially and adversely affect our business and results.
An increase in merchant defaults may reduce our overall profitability and historical merchant default rates may not be indicative of future results.
Merchant default rates on MCA transactions may be significantly affected by economic downturns or general economic conditions beyond our control or beyond the control of the merchants who repay the amounts advanced based on the volume of their accounts receivables.
In particular, merchant default rates may increase due to factors such as the level of consumer and business confidence, the value of the U.S. dollar, changes in consumer and business spending, the number of personal and business bankruptcies and other factors.
While we do not transact directly with merchants, we have purchased participation interests in MCAs through funders that directly advance funding amounts to merchants and the returns received for those participation interests are at risk if merchants default in repayment.
Additionally, the fees obtained by our LMCS subsidiary for its servicing functions to funders and syndicate participants may be negatively impacted if merchant default rates are higher than the historical rates.
Our allowance for MCA losses is determined based upon both objective and subjective factors and may not be adequate to absorb MCA losses.
We face the risk that merchants will fail to repay advances made in MCA transactions.
We reserve for such losses by establishing an allowance for MCA losses, the increase of which results in a reduction of our earnings as we record a provision expense for MCA losses.
We have established an evaluation process designed to determine the adequacy of our allowance for MCA losses.
While this evaluation process uses historical and other objective information, it is also dependent on our subjective assessment based upon our experience and judgment.
Actual losses are difficult to forecast and, as a result, there can be no assurance that our allowance for MCA losses will be sufficient to absorb actual losses or prevent a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations.
We have a limited history in an evolving MCA industry which makes it difficult to successfully evaluate future prospects and risk.
·effectively manage our growth potential to achieve desired profitability but with adequate provisions to mitigate risk; 

 ·maintain or increase our syndication network of syndicate participants and funders; 

 ·successfully develop and deploy new MCA-related services to provide additional services to, and receive compensation from, our existing network and services that will attract a wider network and favorably compete; 

 ·compete with other companies that are in or entering the MCA market and that may provide similar or expanded services; 

 ·successfully mitigate against fluctuations in the economic market that impact the MCA industry; 

 ·effectively determine proper expansion to any additional jurisdictions, including international jurisdictions; and 

 ·successfully evaluate and continue to modify the MCA business under the relevant regulatory scheme.
We may not be able to successfully address these risks and difficulties, which could harm our business and operating results.
If we decide to expand our MCA business domestically or internationally, we may be exposed to substantially more risk that negatively impacts the results of our operations.
·changes to the way we operate the MCA business to accommodate varying state and international regulations, customs and economic conditions and needs; 

 ·competition with service providers that have greater experience in the local markets than we do or pre-existing relationships that provide significant leverage; 

 ·difficulties in providing adequate staffing and managing operations in different locales; 

 ·potentially conflicting and evolving laws and regulations within different jurisdictions; 

 ·risks of transacting in foreign currencies and the associated exposure; 

 ·difficulties of reconciling different taxing regimes; and 

 ·regional economic and political conditions.
The MCA industry may become highly regulated and regulations may continue to vary widely as the MCA industry starts to become less concentrated in certain areas and more widely accessible across the United States and international territories.
Over the last few years, as the MCA industry has been able to cover a significant gap in the availability of immediate funding for small merchant businesses, state and federal regulators have become more interested in learning the industry and exploring whether additional laws and regulations are needed to manage this evolving industry.
We may not be able to successfully forecast any new laws or regulations that may result from investigations and any additional regulatory compliance may require us to modify our business operations in a manner that negatively impacts the results of our operations.
In addition, if new laws and regulations are imposed inconsistently, in terms of their manner and timing, across the jurisdictions in which our MCA business operates, this may create greater difficulty and expense in satisfying our regulatory compliance requirements.
It may also result in conflicting requirements between different jurisdictions.
While our MCA-related contracts typically contain a choice of law provision, the parties' choice of law is not guaranteed to be recognized and respected by a court depending upon the facts and circumstances considered to be determinative by the relevant court.
If the law of a state or jurisdiction is applied that is different from our selected choice of law, we may be subject to unanticipated laws and regulations that require additional expenses and resources for compliance or incur penalties for any failure to do so that affects our operating and performance results.
