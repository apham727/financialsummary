Controls and Procedures  

Evaluation of Controls and Procedures 

We conducted an evaluation as of September 30, 2018, under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures.
The term “disclosure controls and procedures,” as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act, means controls and other procedures of a company that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms.
Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to the company’s management, including its principal executive and principal financial officers, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.
Our management concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of September 30, 2018.
Changes in Internal Control 

There were no changes to our internal controls over financial reporting during the quarter ended September 30, 2018 that materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal controls over financial reporting.
