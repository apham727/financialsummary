 Item 4.Controls and Procedures
Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures
As of March 31, 2019 we conducted an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures.
Based upon that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of March 31, 2019.
Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
During the three months ended March 31, 2019, we implemented additional controls over merger and acquisition activities, as well as controls over our MCA activities and processes, both in consideration of our LuxeMark acquisition during the period.
Otherwise, there were no changes in our internal controls over financial reporting during the quarter ended March 31, 2019 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal controls over financial reporting.
