Overview  



We are a leading global supplier of automation equipment for test and industrial applications. We design, develop, manufacture and sell automatic test systems used to test semiconductors, wireless products, data storage and complex electronics systems in the consumer electronics, wireless, automotive, industrial, computing, communications, and aerospace and defense industries. Our industrial automation products include collaborative robotic arms, autonomous mobile robots and advanced robotic control software used by global manufacturing and light industrial customers to improve quality, increase manufacturing and material handling efficiency and decrease manufacturing costs. Our automatic test equipment and industrial automation products and services include:  



       



semiconductor test (Semiconductor Test) systems;  



       



defense/aerospace (Defense/Aerospace) test instrumentation and systems, storage test (Storage Test) systems, and circuit-board test and inspection (Production Board Test) systems (collectively these products represent System Test);  



       



industrial automation (Industrial Automation) products; and  



       



wireless test (Wireless Test) systems.  



We have a customer base which includes integrated device manufacturers (IDMs), outsourced semiconductor assembly and test providers (OSATs), original equipment manufacturers (OEMs), wafer foundries, fabless companies that design, but contract with others for the manufacture of integrated circuits (ICs), developers of wireless devices and consumer electronics, manufacturers of circuit boards, automotive suppliers, wireless product manufacturers, storage device manufacturers, aerospace and military contractors, and distributors that sell collaborative robots, autonomous mobile robots and wireless test systems.  



The market for our test products is concentrated with a limited number of significant customers accounting for a substantial portion of the purchases of test equipment. One customer drives significant demand for our products both through direct sales and sales to the customers supply partners. We expect that sales of our test products will continue to be concentrated with a limited number of significant customers for the foreseeable future.  



The sales of our products and services are dependent, to a large degree, on customers who are subject to cyclical trends in the demand for their products. These cyclical periods have had, and will continue to have, a significant effect on our business because our customers often delay or accelerate purchases in reaction to changes in their businesses and to demand fluctuations in the semiconductor and electronics industries. Historically, these demand fluctuations have resulted in significant variations in our results of operations. During the first quarter of 2018, demand outlook for mobile device test capacity in 2018 declined sharply for our Semiconductor Test business. As a result, we reduced our revenue outlook for 2018 to reflect the demand decline.

In 2015, we acquired Universal Robots A/S (Universal Robots), the leading supplier of collaborative robots, which are low-cost, easy-to-deploy and simple-to-program robots that work side by side with production workers to improve quality, increase manufacturing efficiency and decrease manufacturing costs. The acquisition of Universal Robots provides a growth engine to our business. The total purchase price for Universal Robots was approximately $315 million, which included cash paid of approximately $284 million and $32 million in fair value of contingent consideration payable upon achievement of revenue and earnings targets through 2018. The contingent consideration related to revenue for the period from July 1, 2015 to December 31, 2017 in the amount of $24.6 million was paid in March 2018. The remaining maximum contingent consideration that could be paid in 2019 is $25 million.  



On February 26, 2018, we acquired Energid Technologies Corporation (Energid) for a total purchase price of approximately $27.6 million. Energids technology enables and simplifies the programming of complex robotic motions used in a wide variety of end markets, ranging from heavy industry to healthcare, utilizing both traditional robots and collaborative robots.  



On April 25, 2018, we acquired Mobile Industrial Robots ApS (MiR), a Danish limited liability company. The total purchase price for MiR was approximately $197 million, which included cash paid of approximately $146 million and $51 million in fair value of contingent consideration payable upon achievement of revenue and earnings targets through 2020. The maximum amount of contingent consideration that could be paid is $118.9 million.  



Universal Robots, MiR and Energid are included in our Industrial Automation segment.  



We believe our recent acquisitions have enhanced our opportunities for growth. We intend to continue to invest in our business, grow market share in our markets and expand further our addressable markets while tightly managing our costs.  



Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates  



We have identified the policies which are critical to understanding our business and our results of operations. There have been no significant changes during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2018 to the items disclosed as our critical accounting policies and estimates in Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2017, except as noted below.  



Preparation of Financial Statements and Use of Estimates  



The preparation of consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements. Actual results may differ significantly from these estimates.  



Revenue from Contracts with Customers  



We adopted Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (ASC 606) on January 1, 2018 using the modified retrospective method for all contracts not completed as of the date of adoption. The reported results for 2018 reflect the application of ASC 606 while the reported results for 2017 were prepared under the guidance of ASC 605, Revenue Recognition (ASC 605), which is also referred to herein as Legacy GAAP or the previous guidance. We recorded a net increase to retained earnings of $12.7 million as of January 1, 2018 due to the cumulative impact of adopting ASC 606. Refer to Note B: Accounting Policies in our 2017 annual report on Form 10-K for the policies in effect for revenue prior to January 1, 2018. The adoption of ASC 606 represents a change in accounting principle that will more closely align revenue recognition with the delivery of our hardware and services and will provide financial  



40

 statement readers with enhanced disclosures. In accordance with ASC 606, revenue is recognized when or as a customer obtains control of promised goods or services. The amount of revenue recognized reflects the consideration to which we expect to be entitled to receive in exchange for fulfillment of the performance obligation. Our primary source of revenue will continue to be from the sale of systems, instruments, robots, and the delivery of services.  



In accordance with ASC 606, we recognize revenues, when or as control is transferred to a customer. Our determination of revenue is dependent upon a five step process outlined below.  



Step 1: Identify the contract with the customer  



We account for a contract with a customer when there is written approval, the contract is committed, the rights of the parties, including payment terms, are identified, the contract has commercial substance and consideration is probable of collection.  



Step 2: Identify the performance obligations in the contract  



We periodically enter into contracts with customers in which a customer may purchase a combination of goods and services, such as products with extended warranty obligations. We determine performance obligations by assessing whether the products or services are distinct from the other elements of the contract. In order to be distinct, the product or service must perform either on its own or with readily available resources and must be separate within the context of the contract.  



Step 3: Determine the transaction price  



We consider the amount stated on the face of the purchase order to be the transaction price. We do not have variable consideration which could impact the stated purchase price agreed to by us and the customer.  



Step 4: Allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract  



Transaction price is allocated to each individual performance obligation based on the standalone selling price of that performance obligation. We use standalone transactions when available to value each performance obligation. If standalone transactions are not available, we will estimate the standalone selling price through market assessments or cost plus a reasonable margin analysis. Any discounts from standalone selling price are spread over each performance obligation.  



Step 5: Recognize revenue when (or as) the entity satisfies a performance obligation  



In order to determine the appropriate timing for revenue recognition, we first determine if the transaction meets any of three criteria for over time recognition. If the transaction meets the criteria for over time recognition, we recognize revenue as the good or service is delivered. We use input variables such as hours or months utilized or costs incurred to determine the amount of revenue to recognize in a given period. Input variables are used as they best align consumption with benefit to the customer. For transactions that do not meet the criteria for over time recognition, we will recognize revenue at a point in time based on an assessment of the five criteria for transfer of control. We have concluded that revenue should be recognized when shipped or delivered based on contractual terms. Typically, acceptance of our products and services is a formality as we deliver similar systems, instruments, and robots to standard specifications. In cases where acceptance is not deemed a formality, we will wait for customer acceptance before recognizing revenue.  



Retirement Benefits  



In March 2017, the FASB issued ASU 2017-07, CompensationRetirement Benefits (Topic 715): Improving the Presentation of Net Periodic Pension Cost and Net Periodic Postretirement Benefit Cost. We  



41   



Table of Contents 



 retrospectively adopted the new accounting guidance on presentation of net periodic pension costs and net periodic postretirement benefit costs in the first quarter of 2018. This guidance requires the service cost component of net benefit costs to be reported in the same line item in the consolidated statement of operations as other employee compensation costs. The non-service components of net benefit costs such as interest cost, expected return on assets, amortization of prior service cost, and actuarial gains or losses, are required to be reported separately outside of income or loss from operations. Following the adoption of this guidance, we continue to record the service cost component in the same line item as other employee compensation costs and the non-service components of net benefit costs such as interest cost, expected return on assets, amortization of prior service cost, and actuarial gains or losses are reported within other (income) expense, net. In the three months ended October 1, 2017, the retrospective adoption of this standard increased income from operations by $0.4 million due to the removal of net actuarial pension losses and decreased non-operating (income) expense by the same amount with no impact to net income. In the nine months ended October 1, 2017, the retrospective adoption of this standard decreased income from operations by $1.3 million due to the removal of net actuarial pension gains and increased non-operating (income) expense by the same amount with no impact to net income.  



Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities  



In January 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-01, Financial InstrumentsOverall (Subtopic 825-10): Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities. We adopted the new accounting guidance in the first quarter of 2018 using the modified retrospective approach. This guidance requires that changes in fair value of equity securities be accounted for directly in earnings. Previously, the changes in fair value were recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income on the balance sheet. We continue to record realized gains in interest income and realized losses in interest expense. The adoption of this new accounting guidance increased the January 1, 2018 retained earnings balance by $3.1 million and decreased the accumulated other comprehensive income balance by the same amount.

Revenues by our four reportable segments were as follows:  



  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 



43   



Table of Contents 



The increase in Semiconductor Test revenues of $20.4 million, or 5.1%, was driven primarily by an increase in the memory test sales, partially offset by lower mobility test segment sales. The increase in Industrial Automation revenues of $25.8 million, or 64.0%, was due to higher demand for collaborative robotic arms and the acquisition of MiR, completed in April 2018. MiR added $6.5 million of revenue in the three months ended September 30, 2018. The increase in System Test revenues of $14.0 million, or 39.3%, was primarily due to higher sales in Storage Test of 3.5 hard disk drive and system level testers. The increase in Wireless Test revenues of $3.4 million, or 11.0%, was primarily due to higher demand for next generation wireless products, partially offset by lower demand for connectivity test systems.  



Revenues by country as a percentage of total revenues were as follows (1):

Gross Profit  



Our gross profit was as follows:  



  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 



Gross profit as a percent of revenue increased by 0.3 points, primarily due to favorable product mix.  



We assess the carrying value of our inventory on a quarterly basis by estimating future demand and comparing that demand against on-hand and on-order inventory positions. Forecasted revenue information is obtained from sales and marketing groups and incorporates factors such as backlog and future revenue demand. This quarterly process identifies obsolete and excess inventory. Obsolete inventory, which represents items for which there is no demand, is fully reserved. Excess inventory, which represents inventory items that are not expected to be consumed during the next twelve quarters for our Semiconductor Test, System Test and Industrial Automation segments and the next four quarters for our Wireless Test segment, is written-down to estimated net realizable value.

Table of Contents 



During the three months ended September 30, 2018, we recorded an inventory provision of $3.3 million included in cost of revenues primarily due to downward revisions to previously forecasted demand levels. The $3.3 million of total excess and obsolete provisions was primarily related to Semiconductor Test ($2.1 million) and Wireless Test ($0.7 million).  



During the three months ended October 1, 2017, we recorded an inventory provision of $1.9 million included in cost of revenues primarily due to downward revisions to previously forecasted demand levels for certain products. The $1.9 million of total excess and obsolete provisions was primarily related to Semiconductor Test ($0.7 million) and Wireless Test ($0.7 million).  



During the three months ended September 30, 2018 and October 1, 2017, we scrapped $1.7 million and $1.2 million of inventory, respectively. During the three months ended September 30, 2018 and October 1, 2017, we sold $1.0 million and $3.1 million of previously written-down or written-off inventory, respectively. As of September 30, 2018, we had inventory related reserves for inventory, which had been written-down or written-off totaling $104.3 million. We have no pre-determined timeline to scrap the remaining inventory.  



Selling and Administrative  



Selling and administrative expenses were as follows:  



  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 



The increase of $14.1 million in selling and administrative expenses was due primarily to higher spending in the Industrial Automation segment due to higher sales and marketing spending in Universal Robots and due to the acquisitions of MiR and Energid in 2018.  



Engineering and Development  



Engineering and development expenses were as follows:  



  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 



The decrease in System Test engineering expenses was offset by an increase in engineering spending in Industrial Automation.

Table of Contents 



Acquired intangible assets amortization expense increased primarily due to Industrial Automation segment acquisitions of MiR and Energid in 2018.  



Restructuring and Other  



During the three months ended September 30, 2018, we recorded $1.7 million for employee severance charges, primarily in Semiconductor Test, and $0.8 million of acquisition related compensation, partially offset by a $0.8 million gain for the decrease in the fair value of the Universal Robots contingent consideration liability.  



During the three months ended October 1, 2017, we recorded $5.1 million of property insurance recovery related to the Japan earthquake, a $0.4 million credit related to a previously impaired lease termination of a Wireless Test facility in Sunnyvale, CA, which was terminated in September 2017, and a $0.3 million credit for the decrease in the fair value of the Universal Robots contingent consideration liability, partially offset by $0.8 million of Japan earthquake related expenses and $0.6 million recorded for employee severance charges, primarily in Semiconductor Test.  



Interest and Other  



  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 



Interest income increased by $1.7 million due primarily to higher interest rates in 2018. Other (income) expense, net increased by $2.6 million due primarily to higher foreign exchange losses in 2018.  



Income (Loss) Before Income Taxes

Included in Corporate and Other are: contingent consideration adjustments, employee severance, interest income, interest expense, net foreign exchange gains and losses, intercompany eliminations, and acquisition related expenses.  



The increase in income before income taxes in Semiconductor Test was driven primarily by an increase in memory test sales partially offset by lower mobility segment sales. The increase in income before income taxes in System Test was primarily due to higher sales in Storage Test of 3.5 hard disk drive and system level testers. The increase in income before income taxes in Wireless Test was primarily due to higher demand for next generation wireless products, partially offset by lower demand for connectivity test systems. The decrease in income before income taxes in Industrial Automation was primarily due to increased intangible assets amortization expense from the acquisitions of MiR and Energid in 2018.

Income Taxes  



The effective tax rate for the three months ended September 30, 2018 and October 1, 2017 was 14.8% and 18.8%, respectively. The decrease in the effective tax rate from the three months ended October 1, 2017 to the three months ended September 30, 2018 primarily resulted from the benefit of the U.S. foreign derived intangible income deduction. The tax rate effect of a projected shift in the geographic distribution of income, which increases the income subject to taxation in the U.S. relative to lower tax rate jurisdictions, was substantially offset by the reduction in the U.S. corporate tax rate from 35% to 21%.

In January 2018, May 2018 and August 2018, our Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.09 per share. Dividend payments for the nine months ended September 30, 2018 were $51.3 million.  



In January 2017 and May 2017 and August 2017, our Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.07 per share. Dividend payments for the nine months ended October 1, 2017 were $41.7 million.  



In January 2018, our Board of Directors cancelled the December 2016 stock repurchase program and authorized a new stock repurchase program for up to $1.5 billion of common stock. We intend to repurchase $750 million in 2018. During the nine months ended September 30, 2018, we repurchased 13.8 million shares of common stock for $562.3 million at an average price of $40.62 per share.  



In December 2016, our Board of Directors approved a $500 million share repurchase authorization, which commenced on January 1, 2017. During the nine months ended October 1, 2017, we repurchased 4.6 million shares of common stock for $151.8 million at an average price of $32.66 per share.  



While we declared a quarterly cash dividend and authorized a share repurchase program, we may reduce or eliminate the cash dividend or share repurchase program in the future. Future cash dividends and stock repurchases are subject to the discretion of our Board of Directors, which will consider, among other things, our earnings, capital requirements and financial condition.

We believe our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities balance will be sufficient to pay our quarterly dividend, execute our authorized share repurchase program and meet our working capital and expenditure needs for at least the next twelve months. Inflation has not had a significant long-term impact on earnings.  



Equity Compensation Plans  



As discussed in Note O: Stock Based Compensation in our 2017 Annual Report on Form 10-K, we have a 1996 Employee Stock Purchase Plan and a 2006 Equity and Cash Compensation Incentive Plan (the 2006 Equity Plan).  



The purpose of the 1996 Employee Stock Purchase Plan is to encourage stock ownership by all eligible employees of Teradyne. The purpose of the 2006 Equity Plan is to provide equity ownership and compensation opportunities in Teradyne to our employees, officers, directors, consultants and/or advisors. Both plans were approved by our shareholders.  



Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements  



On January 26, 2017, the FASB issued ASU 2017-04, Intangibles  Goodwill and Other (Topic 350): Simplifying the Accounting for Goodwill Impairment. The new guidance removes Step 2 of the goodwill impairment test, which requires a hypothetical purchase price allocation. Goodwill impairment will now be the amount by which a reporting units carrying value exceeds its fair value, not to exceed the carrying amount of goodwill. All other goodwill impairment guidance will remain largely unchanged. Entities will continue to have the option to perform a qualitative assessment to determine if a quantitative impairment test is necessary. The same one-step impairment test will be applied to goodwill at all reporting units, even those with zero or negative carrying amounts. Entities will be required to disclose the amount of goodwill at reporting units with zero or negative carrying amounts. The revised guidance will be applied prospectively, and is effective in 2020. Early adoption is permitted for any impairment tests performed after January 1, 2017. We are currently evaluating the impact of this ASU on our financial position, results of operations and statements of cash flows.  



In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842). The guidance in this ASU supersedes the lease recognition requirements in Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) Topic 840, Leases. The new standard establishes a right- of-use (ROU) model that requires a lessee to record an ROU asset and a lease liability on the balance sheet for all leases with terms longer than twelve months. Leases will be classified as either finance or operating, with classification affecting the pattern of expense recognition in the statements of operations. The new standard is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2018 with early adoption permitted. A modified retrospective transition approach is required for lessees for capital and operating leases existing at, or entered into after, the beginning of the earliest comparative period presented in the financial statements. In July 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-11, Leases (Topic 842): Targeted Improvements, which amends ASU 2016-02. The new ASU offers an additional transition method by which entities may elect not to recast the comparative periods presented in financial statements in the period of adoption and allows lessors to elect a practical expedient to not separate lease and non-lease components when certain conditions are met. This ASU has the same transition requirements and effective date as ASU 2016-02. We elected not to recast the comparative periods presented in financial statements in the period of adoption. We continue to assess potential changes from this ASU, but expect the adoption of this guidance to have a material impact on our consolidated balance sheets due to the requirement to recognize lease ROU assets and corresponding liabilities related to leases, and immaterial impact on our results of operations.
