 Item 2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds  



 Repurchase of Equity Securities  



 On April 24, 2018, the Company’s Board of Directors authorized the 2018 stock repurchase program under which the Company may purchase up to $2.0 billion of the Company’s Common Stock during the three-year period ending April 24, 2021 (the “2018 Stock Repurchase Program”) in accordance with the requirements of Rule 10b-18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. During the three months ended March 31, 2019, the Company repurchased 1.8 million shares of its Common Stock for $160.0 million under the 2018 Stock Repurchase Program. Of the total repurchases during the first quarter of 2019, approximately 1.0 million shares, or $87.6 million, have been retained in Treasury stock; the remaining 0.8 million shares, or $72.4 million, have been retired by the Company.  The Company has not repurchased any additional shares of its Common Stock through April 23, 2019, and has remaining authorization to purchase up to approximately $1,286.7 million of its Common Stock under the 2018 Stock Repurchase Program. The price and timing of any future purchases under the 2018 Stock Repurchase Program will depend on factors such as levels of cash generation from operations, the volume of stock option exercises by employees, cash requirements for acquisitions, dividends, economic and market conditions and stock price.
