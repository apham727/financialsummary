During the three months ended June 30, 2019, the Company repurchased 2.6 million shares of its Common Stock for $248.7 million under the 2018 Stock Repurchase Program. These treasury shares were retired by the Company.

The price and timing of any future purchases under the 2018 Stock Repurchase Program will depend on factors such as levels of cash generation from operations, the volume of stock option exercises by employees, cash requirements for acquisitions, dividends, economic and market conditions and stock price.
