NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED)



1. Basis of Presentation and Accounting Policies



Basis of Presentation



The unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements of TE Connectivity Ltd. (“TE Connectivity” or the “Company,” which may be referred to as “we,” “us,” or “our”) have been prepared in United States (“U.S.”) dollars, in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. (“GAAP”) and the instructions to Form 10-Q under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. In management’s opinion, the unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements contain all normal recurring adjustments necessary for a fair presentation of interim results. The results of operations reported for interim periods are not necessarily indicative of the results of operations for the entire fiscal year or any subsequent interim period.



The year-end balance sheet data was derived from audited financial statements, but does not include all of the information and disclosures required by GAAP. These financial statements should be read in conjunction with our audited Consolidated Financial Statements contained in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended September 28, 2018.



Unless otherwise indicated, references in the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements to fiscal 2019 and fiscal 2018 are to our fiscal years ending September 27, 2019 and ended September 28, 2018, respectively.



Revenue Recognition



We account for revenue in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, which introduced a single, comprehensive, five-step revenue recognition model. Our revenues are generated principally from the sale of our products. Revenue is recognized as performance obligations under the terms of a contract, such as a purchase order with a customer, are satisfied; generally this occurs with the transfer of control. We transfer control and recognize revenue when we ship product to our customers, the customers accept and have legal title for the product, and we have a right to payment for such product. Revenue is measured as the amount of consideration that we expect to receive in exchange for those products and excludes taxes assessed by governmental authorities and collected from customers concurrent with the sale of products. Shipping and handling costs are treated as fulfillment costs and are included in cost of sales. Since we typically invoice our customers when we satisfy our performance obligations, we do not have material contract assets or contract liabilities. Our credit terms are customary and do not contain significant financing components that extend beyond one year of fulfillment of performance obligations. We apply the practical expedient of ASC 606 with respect to financing components and do not evaluate contracts in which payment is due within one year of satisfaction of the related performance obligation. Since our performance obligations to deliver products are part of contracts that generally have original durations of one year or less, we have elected to use the optional exemption to not disclose the aggregate amount of transaction prices associated with unsatisfied or partially satisfied performance obligations as of June 28, 2019. See Note 16 for net sales disaggregated by industry end market and geographic region which is summarized by segment and that we consider meaningful to depict the nature, amount, timing, and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows affected by economic factors.



We generally warrant that our products will conform to our, or mutually agreed to, specifications and that our products will be free from material defects in materials and workmanship for a limited time. We limit our warranty to the replacement or repair of defective parts, or a refund or credit of the price of the defective product. We do not account for these warranties as separate performance obligations.



Although products are generally sold at fixed prices, certain distributors and customers receive incentives or awards, such as sales rebates, return allowances, scrap allowances, and other rights, which are accounted for as variable consideration. We estimate these amounts in the same period revenue is recognized based on the expected value to be provided to customers and reduce revenue accordingly. Our estimates of variable consideration and ultimate determination of

(Continued)



the estimated amounts to include in the transaction price are based primarily on our assessment of anticipated performance and historical and forecasted information that is reasonably available to us.



Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements



In February 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) No. 2016-02 which codified ASC 842, Leases. This guidance, as subsequently amended, requires lessees to recognize a lease liability and a right-of-use asset for most leases and is effective for us in the first quarter of fiscal 2020. We are currently in the process of updating policies, internal controls, financial statement disclosures, and systems to incorporate the impact of the new standard in our financial reporting processes. We intend to adopt the standard using the optional transition method permitted by ASU No. 2018-11, which allows for application of the standard at the adoption date and no restatement of comparative periods. We expect that adoption will likely have a material impact on our Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet; however, we currently do not expect adoption to have a material impact on our results of operations or cash flows. We believe that we are following an appropriate timeline to allow for the proper recognition, reporting, and disclosure of leases upon adoption of ASC 842 at the beginning of fiscal 2020.



Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements



In August 2017, the FASB issued ASU No. 2017-12, an update to ASC 815, Derivatives and Hedging. The update improves and simplifies hedge accounting and related disclosures. We elected to early adopt this update, which did not have a material impact on our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements, in the quarter ended December 28, 2018.



In October 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-16, an update to ASC 740, Income Taxes. This guidance requires the recognition of the income tax consequences of intra-entity transfers of assets other than inventory in the period in which the transfer occurs. The update was adopted on a modified retrospective basis in the quarter ended December 28, 2018 and resulted in a $443 million cumulative-effect adjustment to beginning accumulated earnings, which represented the net reversal of all balances associated with deferred tax impacts of intra-entity transfers of assets other than inventory. This included a decrease in other assets of $798 million, an increase in deferred tax assets of $418 million, and a decrease in prepaid expenses and other current assets of $63 million on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet.



In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-09 which codified ASC 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers. This guidance supersedes ASC 605, Revenue Recognition, and introduces a single, comprehensive, five-step revenue recognition model. ASC 606 also enhances disclosures related to revenue recognition. We adopted ASC 606, as amended, in the quarter ended December 28, 2018 using a modified retrospective approach. Prior period amounts have not been adjusted and continue to be reported under the accounting standards in effect for those periods. Transition impacts, which relate primarily to incentive compensation arrangements, were not material to our results of operations or financial position. Because the impact of adoption was immaterial, we have not recorded a cumulative-effect adjustment to beginning accumulated earnings.

​[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]



​



Fiscal 2019 Actions



During fiscal 2019, we initiated a restructuring program associated with footprint consolidation and structural improvements impacting all segments. In connection with this program, during the nine months ended June 28, 2019, we recorded restructuring charges of $179 million. We expect to complete all restructuring actions commenced during the nine months ended June 28, 2019 by the end of fiscal 2021 and to incur additional charges of approximately $25 million related primarily to employee severance in the Transportation Solutions and Industrial Solutions segments.



Fiscal 2018 Actions



During fiscal 2018, we initiated a restructuring program associated with footprint consolidation and structural improvements primarily impacting the Industrial Solutions and Transportation Solutions segments. In connection with this program, during the nine months ended June 28, 2019 and June 29, 2018, we recorded net restructuring charges of $5 million and $109 million, respectively. We expect to complete all restructuring actions commenced during fiscal 2018 by the end of fiscal 2020 and anticipate that any additional charges will be insignificant.

Pre-Fiscal 2018 Actions



Prior to fiscal 2018, we initiated a restructuring program associated with footprint consolidation related to recent acquisitions and structural improvements impacting all segments. Also prior to fiscal 2018, we initiated a restructuring program associated with headcount reductions impacting all segments and product line closures in the Communications Solutions segment. During the nine months ended June 29, 2018, we recorded net restructuring charges of $9 million related to pre-fiscal 2018 actions. We expect additional charges related to pre-fiscal 2018 actions to be insignificant.



Total Restructuring Reserves



Restructuring reserves included on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets were as follows:



​[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]



​



3. Discontinued Operations



During the nine months ended June 28, 2019, we sold our Subsea Communications (“SubCom”) business for net cash proceeds of $297 million and incurred a pre-tax loss on sale of $86 million, related primarily to the recognition of cumulative translation adjustment losses of $67 million and the guarantee liabilities discussed below. The SubCom business met the held for sale and discontinued operations criteria and was reported as such in all periods presented on the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. Prior to reclassification to discontinued operations, the SubCom business was included in the Communications Solutions segment.



In connection with the sale, we contractually agreed to continue to honor performance guarantees and letters of credit related to the SubCom business’ projects that existed as of the date of sale. These guarantees had a combined value of approximately $1.7 billion as of June 28, 2019 and are expected to expire at various dates through fiscal 2025; however, the majority are expected to expire within two years. At the time of sale, we determined that the fair value of these guarantees was $12 million, which we recognized by a charge to pre-tax loss on sale. Also, under the terms of the definitive agreement, we are required to issue up to $300 million of new performance guarantees, subject to certain limitations, for projects entered into by the SubCom business following the sale for a period of up to three years. As of June 28, 2019, there were no such new performance guarantees outstanding. We have contractual recourse against the SubCom business if we are required to perform on any SubCom guarantees; however, based on historical experience, we do not anticipate having to perform.

​



8. Debt



During the quarter ended June 28, 2019, Tyco Electronics Group S.A. (“TEGSA”), our 100%-owned subsidiary, issued €350 million aggregate principal amount of fixed-to-floating rate senior notes due June 2021. The fixed-to-floating rate senior notes bear interest at a rate of 0% until June 2020 and then at a rate of three-month Euro Interbank Offered Rate (“EURIBOR”) plus 0.30% per year until maturity. In June 2020, we may, at our option, redeem the fixed-to-floating rate senior notes, as a whole, at 100% of the principal amount. Also, during the nine months ended June 28, 2019, TEGSA issued $350 million aggregate principal amount of floating rate senior notes due June 2020. The floating rate senior notes bear interest at a rate of three-month London Interbank Offered Rate (“LIBOR”) plus 0.45% per year. The fixed-to-floating rate senior notes and floating rate senior notes are TEGSA’s unsecured senior obligations and rank equally in right of payment with all existing and any future senior indebtedness of TEGSA and senior to any subordinated indebtedness that TEGSA may incur.



During the nine months ended June 28, 2019, TEGSA repaid, at maturity, $325 million 2.375% senior notes due 2018. 



TEGSA has a five-year unsecured senior revolving credit facility (“Credit Facility”) with total commitments of $1,500 million. The Credit Facility was amended in November 2018 primarily to extend the maturity date from December 2020 to November 2023. The amended Credit Facility contains provisions that allow for incremental commitments of up to $500 million, an option to temporarily increase the financial ratio covenant following a qualified acquisition, and borrowings in designated currencies. TEGSA had no borrowings under the Credit Facility at June 28, 2019 or September 28, 2018.



As of September 28, 2018, TEGSA had $270 million of commercial paper outstanding at a weighted-average interest rate of 2.35%. TEGSA had no commercial paper outstanding at June 28, 2019.



The fair value of our debt, based on indicative valuations, was approximately $4,295 million and $4,149 million at June 28, 2019 and September 28, 2018, respectively.



9. Commitments and Contingencies



Legal Proceedings



In the normal course of business, we are subject to various legal proceedings and claims, including patent infringement claims, product liability matters, employment disputes, disputes on agreements, other commercial disputes, environmental matters, antitrust claims, and tax matters, including non-income tax matters such as value added tax, sales and use tax, real estate tax, and transfer tax. Although it is not feasible to predict the outcome of these proceedings, based upon our experience, current information, and applicable law, we do not expect that the outcome of these proceedings, either individually or in the aggregate, will have a material effect on our results of operations, financial position, or cash flows.

TE CONNECTIVITY LTD.



NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED)



(Continued)



Environmental Matters



We are involved in various stages of investigation and cleanup related to environmental remediation matters at a number of sites. The ultimate cost of site cleanup is difficult to predict given the uncertainties regarding the extent of the required cleanup, the interpretation of applicable laws and regulations, and alternative cleanup methods. As of June 28, 2019, we concluded that we would incur investigation and remediation costs at these sites in the reasonably possible range of $15 million to $44 million, and we accrued $18 million as the probable loss, which was the best estimate within this range. We believe that any potential payment of such estimated amounts will not have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial position, or cash flows.



Guarantees



In disposing of assets or businesses, we often provide representations, warranties, and/or indemnities to cover various risks including unknown damage to assets, environmental risks involved in the sale of real estate, liability for investigation and remediation of environmental contamination at waste disposal sites and manufacturing facilities, and unidentified tax liabilities and legal fees related to periods prior to disposition. We do not expect that these uncertainties will have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial position, or cash flows.



At June 28, 2019, we had outstanding letters of credit, letters of guarantee, and surety bonds of $316 million. 



We sold our SubCom business during the nine months ended June 28, 2019. In connection with the sale, we contractually agreed to honor certain performance guarantees and letters of credit related to the SubCom business. See Note 3 for additional information regarding these guarantees and the divestiture of the SubCom business.



10. Financial Instruments



Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Risk



During fiscal 2015, we entered into cross-currency swap contracts with an aggregate notional value of €1,000 million to reduce our exposure to foreign currency exchange rate risk associated with certain intercompany loans. Under the terms of these contracts, which have been designated as cash flow hedges, we make interest payments in euros at 3.50% per annum and receive interest in U.S. dollars at a weighted-average rate of 5.33% per annum. Upon the maturity of these contracts in fiscal 2022, we will pay the notional value of the contracts in euros and receive U.S. dollars from our counterparties. In connection with the cross-currency swap contracts, both counterparties to each contract are required to post cash collateral.



At June 28, 2019 and September 28, 2018, these cross-currency swap contracts were in liability positions of $36 million and $100 million, respectively, and were recorded in other liabilities on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. At June 28, 2019 and September 28, 2018, collateral paid to our counterparties approximated the derivative positions and was recorded in prepaid expenses and other current assets on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. The impacts of these cross-currency swap contracts were as follows:



​[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]



(1)Gains and losses excluded from the hedging relationship are recognized prospectively in selling, general, and administrative expenses and are offset by losses and gains generated as a result of re-measuring certain intercompany loans to the U.S. dollar.

TE CONNECTIVITY LTD.



NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED)



(Continued)



Hedge of Net Investment



We hedge our net investment in certain foreign operations using intercompany loans and external borrowings denominated in the same currencies. The aggregate notional value of these hedges was $3,202 million and $4,064 million at June 28, 2019 and September 28, 2018, respectively. 



During fiscal 2019, we expanded our cross-currency swap program to hedge our net investment in certain foreign operations. The aggregate notional value of the fiscal 2019 contracts was $1,901 million at June 28, 2019. Under the terms of these contracts, we receive interest in U.S. dollars at a weighted-average rate of 2.96% per annum and pay no interest. Upon the maturity of these contracts at various dates through fiscal 2023, we will pay the notional value of the contracts in the designated foreign currencies and receive U.S. dollars from our counterparties.



The impacts of our hedge of net investment programs were as follows:[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]



(1)Foreign currency exchange gains and losses on intercompany loans and external borrowings are recorded as currency translation, a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), and are offset by changes attributable to the translation of the net investment. 



(2)Gains and losses on cross-currency swap contracts designated as hedges of net investment are recorded as currency translation.



11. Retirement Plans



The net periodic pension benefit cost for all non-U.S. and U.S. defined benefit pension plans was as follows:

During the nine months ended June 28, 2019, we contributed $29 million to our non-U.S. pension plans.



12. Income Taxes



We recorded an income tax benefit of $245 million and income tax expense of $77 million for the quarters ended June 28, 2019 and June 29, 2018, respectively. The income tax benefit for the quarter ended June 28, 2019 included a $214 million income tax benefit related to the tax impacts of certain measures of the Switzerland Federal Act on Tax Reform and AHV Financing (“Swiss Tax Reform”) and a $93 million income tax benefit related to the effective settlement of a tax audit in a non-U.S. jurisdiction. See “Swiss Tax Reform” below for additional information. The income tax expense for the quarter ended June 29, 2018 included a $17 million income tax benefit resulting from lapses of statutes of limitations in the U.S. and certain non-U.S. jurisdictions.



We recorded an income tax benefit of $76 million and income tax expense of $784 million for the nine months ended June 28, 2019 and June 29, 2018, respectively. The income tax benefit for the nine months ended June 28, 2019 included a $214 million income tax benefit related to the tax impacts of certain measures of Swiss Tax Reform, a $93 million income tax benefit related to the effective settlement of a tax audit in a non-U.S. jurisdiction, and $15 million of income tax expense associated with the tax impacts of certain legal entity restructurings and intercompany transactions. The income tax expense for the nine months ended June 29, 2018 included $567 million of income tax expense related to the tax impacts of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the “Act”), a $61 million net income tax benefit related to certain legal entity restructurings, and a $34 million income tax benefit resulting from lapses of statutes of limitations in the U.S. and certain non-U.S. jurisdictions. During the quarter ended December 29, 2017, the period of enactment of the Act, we were required to revalue our U.S. federal deferred tax assets and liabilities at a U.S. federal corporate income tax rate of 21% and we recorded income tax expense of $567 million primarily in connection with the write-down of our U.S. federal deferred tax asset for net operating loss and interest carryforwards. Included in the expense of $567 million was an income tax benefit of $34 million related to the reduction in the existing valuation allowance recorded against certain U.S. federal tax credit carryforwards.



We record accrued interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions as part of income tax expense. As of June 28, 2019 and September 28, 2018, we had $40 million and $60 million, respectively, of accrued interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets, recorded primarily in income taxes. During the nine months ended June 28, 2019, we recognized $17 million of income tax benefit related to interest and penalties on the Condensed Consolidated Statement of Operations.



 Although it is difficult to predict the timing or results of our worldwide examinations, we estimate that approximately $100 million of unrecognized income tax benefits, excluding the impact relating to accrued interest and penalties, could be resolved within the next twelve months.

TE CONNECTIVITY LTD.



NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED)



(Continued)



We are not aware of any other matters that would result in significant changes to the amount of unrecognized income tax benefits reflected on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet as of June 28, 2019.



Swiss Tax Reform



Swiss Parliament approved the Federal Act on Tax Reform and AHV Financing in September 2018, and it was approved by public vote on May 19, 2019. Swiss Tax Reform eliminates certain preferential tax items at both the federal and cantonal levels. In addition, the cantons will implement new tax rates. The federal provisions of Swiss Tax Reform are expected to be enacted into law in the quarter ending September 27, 2019 and the cantons will implement thereafter. 



In reaction to the public approval of Swiss Tax Reform, on May 24, 2019 the federal tax authority issued guidance abolishing certain interest deductions effective January 1, 2020. As a result of this measure, during the quarter ended June 28, 2019, we recorded a $214 million income tax benefit related primarily to the reduction to the valuation allowance for deferred tax assets. Based on our forecast of taxable income, reflecting the abolishment of certain interest deductions, we believe it is more likely than not that additional deferred tax assets for tax loss carryforwards in Switzerland will be realized in the future.



​



We are currently assessing the impacts of the federal provisions and subsequent cantonal implementation, including reductions in tax rates. We will reflect the impacts of the remaining measures on our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements when enacted. Upon enactment at the cantonal level, which is expected to occur in the quarter ending December 27, 2019, we expect to recognize approximately $300 million of income tax expense related to the write-down of certain deferred tax assets to the expected lower tax rates. 



​



Tax Sharing Agreement



Under a Tax Sharing Agreement, we, Tyco International plc (“Tyco International”), and Covidien plc (“Covidien”) share 31%, 27%, and 42%, respectively, of income tax liabilities that arise from adjustments made by tax authorities to the collective income tax returns for periods prior to and including June 29, 2007. Pursuant to the Tax Sharing Agreement, we entered into certain guarantee commitments and indemnifications with Tyco International and Covidien. As a result of subsequent transactions, Tyco International and Covidien now operate as part of Johnson Controls International plc and Medtronic plc, respectively. We have substantially settled all U.S. federal income tax matters with the Internal Revenue Service for periods covered under the Tax Sharing Agreement. Certain shared U.S. state and non-U.S. income tax matters remain open. We do not expect these matters will have a material effect on our results of operations, financial position, or cash flows.

14. Shareholders’ Equity



Common Shares Held in Treasury



In March 2019, our shareholders approved the cancellation of 6 million shares purchased under our share repurchase program during the period beginning September 30, 2017 and ending September 28, 2018. The capital reduction by cancellation of these shares was subject to a notice period and filing with the commercial register in Switzerland and became effective in May 2019.



Dividends



We paid cash dividends to shareholders as follows:



​[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]



​



In March 2019, our shareholders approved a dividend payment to shareholders of $1.84 per share, payable in four equal quarterly installments of $0.46 per share beginning in the third quarter of fiscal 2019 and ending in the second quarter of fiscal 2020.



Upon shareholders’ approval of a dividend payment, we record a liability with a corresponding charge to shareholders’ equity. At June 28, 2019 and September 28, 2018, the unpaid portion of the dividends recorded in accrued and other current liabilities on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets totaled $464 million and $303 million, respectively.



Share Repurchase Program



During the nine months ended June 28, 2019, our board of directors authorized an increase of $1.5 billion in our share repurchase program. Common shares repurchased under the share repurchase program were as follows:
