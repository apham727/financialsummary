ITEM 2.
MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
The following "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations", as well as disclosures included elsewhere in this Report on Form 10-Q, include "forward-looking statements" within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.
This Act provides a safe harbor for forward-looking statements to encourage companies to provide prospective information about themselves so long as they identify these statements as forward-looking and provide meaningful cautionary statements identifying important factors that could cause actual results to differ from the projected results.
All statements other than statements of historical fact we make in this Report on Form 10-Q are forward-looking, which address a variety of subjects including, for example, future sales and operating results; growth or contraction, and trends in the industry and markets in which the Company participates; the acquisition of, investment in, or collaboration with other entities, including the Company’s acquisition of KMG Chemicals, Inc. (“KMG”), and the expected benefits and synergies of such acquisition; new product introductions; development of new products, technologies and markets; product performance; the financial conditions of the Company's customers; competitive landscape; the Company's supply chain; natural disasters; various economic or political factors and international or national events, including related to the enactment of trade sanctions, tariffs, or other similar matters; the generation, protection and acquisition of intellectual property, and litigation related to such intellectual property or third party intellectual property; environmental laws and regulations; the operation of facilities by Cabot Microelectronics; the Company's management; foreign exchange fluctuation; the Company's current or future tax rate, including the effects of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act in the United States (“tax act”); cybersecurity threats; and financing facilities and related debt, pay off or payment of principal and interest, and compliance with covenants and other terms; and, uses and investment of the Company's cash balance, including dividends and share repurchases, which may be suspended, terminated or modified at any time for any reason by the Company, based on a variety of factors.
Statements that are not historical facts, including statements about Cabot Microelectronics’ beliefs, plans and expectations, are forward-looking statements.
Such statements are based on current expectations of Cabot Microelectronics’ management and are subject to a number of factors and uncertainties, which could cause actual results to differ materially from those described in the forward-looking statements.
For information about factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those described in the forward-looking statements, please refer to Cabot Microelectronics’ filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”), including the risk factors contained in Cabot Microelectronics’ Annual Report on Form 10-K and in this Report on Form 10-Q.

The section entitled "Risk Factors" describes some, but not all, of the factors that could cause these differences.
 SECOND QUARTER OF FISCAL 2019 OVERVIEW
 INDEX
In the Electronic Materials segment, our CMP slurries revenue declined this quarter due primarily to softer market conditions, particularly in the memory, but also in the foundry, sectors.
Our CMP slurries play a critical role in enabling DRAM and NAND production and this quarter our business was adversely impacted as our customers reduced utilization rates to address higher chip inventories and falling memory prices.
In CMP pads, we delivered another quarter of strong results.
In electronic chemicals, we saw stable demand this quarter.
Looking ahead, recent reports from customers and industry analysts suggest there is still some level of uncertainty in overall semiconductor industry demand given the weakness in certain end markets, but most believe there will be some level of recovery in the second half of calendar 2019.
We remain confident about growth in our business from increased future demand for global semiconductor materials, and believe we will continue to benefit from increased device complexity and growing computing power and storage requirements, which translates to additional demand for consumable materials.
In our Performance Materials segment, we recorded strong revenue, driven by results in our pipeline performance business.
With continued growth expected in U.S. oil production, primarily in the Permian basin as well as expansion internationally, we continue to experience strong demand for our drag-reducing agents, which enable pipeline operators to optimize the efficiency and throughput of oil transport.
However, there are many factors that make it difficult for us to predict future revenue trends for our Company, including those discussed in Part II, Item 1A entitled “Risk Factors” of this Report on Form 10-Q.
Revenue for our second quarter of fiscal 2019 was $265.4 million, which benefited from the acquisition of KMG and represented an increase of 85.6% from the same quarter of fiscal 2018.
Net income was $27.1 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2019, which represented a decrease of 8.7% from the same quarter of fiscal 2018.
Results benefited from the acquisition of KMG, but were more than offset by acquisition-related expenses, a charge for the fair value write-up of acquired inventory sold, increased amortization and depreciation associated with re-valuing KMG assets to fair value, and higher interest expenses resulting from the debt borrowing to finance the Acquisition.
For the same reasons, diluted earnings per share decreased from $1.14 in the second quarter of fiscal 2018 to $0.92 in the current quarter.
Adjusted EBITDA was $85.5 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2019.
This represents an increase of $41.9 million, or a 96.0% increase from the same quarter of fiscal 2018.
Adjusted EBITDA benefited from the addition of the KMG businesses and improved profitability in the Company’s heritage businesses.
Refer to the “Use of certain GAAP and Non-GAAP Financial Information” section below for the calculation of adjusted EBITDA.
Adjusted EBITDA margin, which represents adjusted EBITDA as a percentage of revenue, was 32.2% for the second quarter of fiscal 2019, compared to 30.5% for the same quarter of fiscal 2018.
CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES AND EFFECTS OF RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS
We discuss our critical accounting estimates and effects of recent accounting pronouncements in “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” included in Item 7 of Part II of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2018.
Except for the discussion on revenue recognition in Note 2 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements of this Report on Form 10-Q, no material changes have been made to the Company’s significant accounting policies during the first six months of fiscal 2019.
See Note 2 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements of this Report on Form 10-Q for a discussion of new accounting pronouncements.
 INDEX
RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2019, VERSUS THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2018
REVENUE
Revenue was $265.4 million for the three months ended March 31, 2019, which represented an 85.6%, or $122.4 million, increase from the three months ended March 31, 2018, primarily due to the Acquisition.
Revenue from Cabot Microelectronics’ heritage businesses decreased slightly by $0.7 million, or 0.5%, primarily due to lower sales volume, partially offset by a higher value product mix and price changes.
COST OF SALES
Total cost of sales was $150.6 million for the three months ended March 31, 2019, which represented an increase of 121.6%, or $82.6 million, from the three months ended March 31, 2018, primarily due to the Acquisition.
The cost of sales from Cabot Microelectronics’ heritage businesses decreased by $3.2 million, primarily driven by lower sales volume.
GROSS MARGIN
Our gross margin was 43.3% for the three months ended March 31, 2019, compared to 52.5% for the three months ended March 31, 2018.
The decrease in gross margin was primarily due to the inclusion of the KMG businesses, which reduced gross margin by 11.3 percentage points, of which 1.7 percentage points was due to the impact of the fair value write-up of acquired inventory sold.
Within Cabot Microelectronics’ heritage businesses, gross margin increased by 2.1 percentage points, which was primarily due to lower production cost and a higher value product mix, partially offset by lower sales volume.
RESEARCH, DEVELOPMENT AND TECHNICAL
Total research, development and technical expenses were $12.8 million for the three months ended March 31, 2019, which represented a decrease of 4.4%, or $0.6 million, from the three months ended March 31, 2018.
The decrease was primarily due to lower staffing-related costs of $0.9 million, including incentive compensation costs.
  ●  Research related to fundamental CMP technology;
  ●  Development of new and enhanced CMP consumable products, including collaboration on joint development projects with technology-leading customers and suppliers;
  ●  Process development to support rapid and effective commercialization of new products;
  ●  Technical support of CMP products in our customers’ research, development and manufacturing facilities; and,
  ●  Development of polishing and metrology applications outside of the semiconductor industry.
SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE
Selling, general and administrative expenses were $50.3 million for the three months ended March 31, 2019, which represented an increase of 104.7%, or $25.7 million, from the three months ended March 31, 2018.
The increase was primarily due to $13.0 million of amortization expense related to the Acquisition, $10.8 million in KMG-related costs, and $2.9 million of acquisition and integration related costs.
These items were partially offset by $1.5 million lower staffing-related costs, including incentive compensation costs.
 INDEX
INTEREST EXPENSE
Interest expense was $13.3 million for the three months ended March 31, 2019, which represented an increase of $12.2 million from the three months ended March 31, 2018.
The increase resulted from the debt borrowing to finance the Acquisition.
INTEREST INCOME
Interest income was $0.6 million for the three months ended March 31, 2019, which represented a decrease of 50.9%, or $0.6 million from the three months ended March 31, 2018 due to lower cash balances compared to the same period last year.
OTHER INCOME (EXPENSE), NET
Other expense was $1.0 million for the three months ended March 31, 2019, which represented an increase of $0.9 million, from the three months ended March 31, 2018.
The change was primarily due to the absence of the gain on sale of assets that had occurred in the second quarter of fiscal 2018.
PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES
The Company’s effective tax rate for the second quarter of fiscal 2019 was 28.5%, compared to 19.6% in the same quarter last year.
The increase is primarily driven by unfavorable tax treatment of certain KMG acquisition-related costs, such as compensation deduction limitations, as well as non-deductibility of certain professional fees.
NET INCOME
 Net income was $27.1 million for the three months ended March 31, 2019, which represented a decrease of 8.7%, or $2.6 million, from the three months ended March 31, 2018.
Net income benefited from the addition of the KMG businesses, and was partially offset by acquisition and integration-related expenses, a charge for fair value write-up of acquired inventory sold, increased amortization and depreciation associated with re-valuing KMG assets to fair value, and higher interest expenses resulting from the debt borrowing to finance the Acquisition.
 INDEX
SIX MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2019, VERSUS SIX MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2018
REVENUE
Revenue was $487.2 million for the six months ended March 31, 2019, which represented a 72.2%, or $204.2 million increase from the six months ended March 31, 2018.
The increase in revenue was primarily due to the Acquisition.
Revenue from Cabot Microelectronics’ heritage businesses increased by $19.1 million, or 6.7%.
This increase was primarily driven by a higher value product mix, selected price increases and higher sales volume.
COST OF SALES
Total cost of sales was $273.0 million for the six months ended March 31, 2019, which represented an increase of 103.9%, or $139.1 million, from the six months ended March 31, 2018.
The increase in cost of sales was primarily due to the Acquisition.
Cost of sales of Cabot Microelectronics’ heritage businesses was relatively flat compared to the same period last year, as the higher costs associated with higher sales volume was offset by lower per unit costs.
GROSS MARGIN
Our gross margin was 44.0% for the six months ended March 31, 2019, compared to 52.7% for the six months ended March 31, 2018.
The gross margin was adversely impacted by the inclusion of the KMG businesses, which reduced gross margin by 11.4 percentage points, of which 3.0 percentage points was due to the impact of the fair value write-up of acquired inventory sold.
Excluding the KMG businesses, gross margin increased by 2.7 percentage points, which was primarily due to a higher value product mix.
RESEARCH, DEVELOPMENT AND TECHNICAL
Total research, development and technical expenses were $26.8 million for the six months ended March 31, 2019, which represented an increase of 5.1%, or $1.3 million, from the six months ended March 31, 2018.
The increase was primarily due to higher supplies and equipment costs used in research and development of $1.1 million.
SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE
Selling, general and administrative expenses were $111.5 million for the six months ended March 31, 2019, which represented an increase of 125.9%, or $62.1 million, from the six months ended March 31, 2018.
The increase was primarily due to $30.2 million of acquisition and integration related costs, $19.5 million of amortization expense related to the Acquisition, and $15.9 million in incremental KMG-related costs associated with the post Acquisition period during the six months period.
These items were partially offset by the absence of executive officer transition costs of $2.8 million that occurred in the first quarter of fiscal 2018.
INTEREST EXPENSE
Interest expense was $20.2 million for the six months ended March 31, 2019, which represented an increase of 783.0%, or $17.9 million for the six months ended March 31, 2018.
The increase resulted from the debt borrowing to finance the Acquisition.
 INDEX
INTEREST INCOME
Interest income was $1.6 million for the six months ended March 31, 2019, which represented a decrease of 24.7%, or $0.5 million for the six months ended March 31, 2018 due to lower cash balances.
OTHER INCOME (EXPENSE), NET
Other expense was $2.4 million for the six months ended March 31, 2019, which represented an increase of 550.1%, or $2.1 million, from the six months ended March 31, 2018.
The change was primarily due to the absence of the gain on sale of assets that occurred in the second quarter of fiscal 2018.
PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES
The Company’s effective tax rate was 26.0% for the six months ended March 31, 2019, compared to 63.8% for the six months ended March 31, 2018.
The decrease in our effective tax rate for the six months ended March 31, 2019 compared to the prior year is primarily attributable to the changes introduced by the Tax Act enacted in December 2017.
Other factors that impacted the Company’s effective tax rate for the six months ended March 31, 2019 were primarily related to unfavorable tax treatment of certain Acquisition-related costs, such as compensation deduction limitations, as well as non-deductibility of certain professional fees.
Additionally, we recorded incremental tax expense for the GILTI provision of the Tax Act, which was effective for the first time during our fiscal 2019.
Partially offsetting these adverse items, the Tax Act reduced the corporate income tax rate to 21.0% effective January 1, 2018, resulting in a change in our blended tax rate of 24.5% in fiscal 2018 to 21.0% beginning with our fiscal 2019.
See Note 15 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements of this Report on Form 10-Q for more information on our income taxes.
NET INCOME
Net income was $40.6 million for the six months ended March 31, 2019, which represented an increase of 52.2%, or $13.9 million, from the six months ended March 31, 2018.
The increase was primarily due to the absence of the adverse impact of the Tax Act in the first quarter of fiscal 2018, the addition of the KMG businesses post-Acquisition, and higher revenue and profitability within our heritage businesses.
These items were partially offset by acquisition and integration-related expenses, a charge for fair value write-up of acquired inventory sold, increased amortization and depreciation associated with re-valuing KMG assets to fair value, and higher interest expenses resulting from the debt borrowing to finance the Acquisition.
 INDEX
SEGMENT ANALYSIS
 Segment data is presented for our two reportable segments for the three and six months ended March 31, 2019 and 2018.
The segment data should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this Report on Form 10-Q.
 INDEX
THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2019, VERSUS THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2018
ELECTRONIC MATERIALS
The $76.7 million increase in Electronic Materials revenue was driven by the addition of KMG’s electronic chemicals business in the quarter.
Electronic Materials revenue from Cabot Microelectronics’ heritage businesses decreased slightly primarily due to softer industry conditions that resulted in lower demand for the Company’s products.
This decrease was partially offset by higher value product mix and price changes.
Electronic Materials adjusted EBITDA increased from the prior year driven by the addition of KMG’s electronic chemicals results.
The slightly lower adjusted EBITDA margin was primarily due to change in mix of products, as a result of the Acquisition.
PERFORMANCE MATERIALS
The $45.7 million increase in Performance Materials revenue was primarily driven by the addition of KMG’s performance materials business in the quarter.
Performance Materials’ adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA margin expanded from the prior year due to the addition of KMG’s heritage performance materials business.
SIX MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2019, VERSUS SIX MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2018
ELECTRONIC MATERIALS
The $134.0 million increase in Electronic Materials revenue was driven by the addition of KMG’s electronic chemicals business since the Acquisition.
The remaining increase was driven by strong organic demand for the Company’s heritage CMP slurries and polishing pads product lines, which increased 3% and 22%, respectively, primarily on higher sales volume.
Electronic Materials adjusted EBITDA increased from the prior year driven by the addition of KMG’s electronic chemicals results, as well as stronger organic profitability, driven by the leverage achieved on higher sales volume.
The slightly lower adjusted EBITDA margin was primarily due to change in mix of products, as a result of the Acquisition.
PERFORMANCE MATERIALS
The $70.2 million increase in Performance Materials revenue was primarily driven by the addition of KMG’s performance materials business post-Acquisition.
Performance Materials’ adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA margin expanded from the prior year due to the addition of KMG’s heritage performance materials business.
USE OF CERTAIN GAAP AND NON-GAAP FINANCIAL INFORMATION
Adjusted EBITDA margin is defined as adjusted EBITDA as a percentage of revenue.
Adjusted EBITDA is defined as earnings before interest, income taxes, depreciation and amortization, adjusted for certain items that affect comparability from period to period.
These adjustments include items related to our acquisition of KMG, such as expenses incurred to complete the acquisition, integration related expenses, and impact of fair value adjustments to inventory acquired from KMG.
The non-GAAP financial information provided is a supplement to, and not a substitute for, the Company’s financial results presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP.
Management strongly encourages investors to review the Company’s consolidated financial statements in their entirety and to not rely on any single financial measure.
These non-GAAP financial measures are provided to enhance the investor's understanding about the Company's ongoing operations.
Specifically, the Company believes the impact of KMG acquisition-related expenses and acquisition-related amortization expenses are not indicative of its core operating results, and thus presents these certain metrics excluding these effects.
The presentation of non-GAAP financial information is not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for results prepared and presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP.
A reconciliation table of GAAP to non-GAAP financial measures is contained below.
 INDEX
Adjusted EBITDA for the Electronic Materials and Performance Materials segments is presented in conformity with Accounting Standards Codification Topic 280, Segment Reporting.
This measure is reported to the chief operating decision maker for purposes of making decisions about allocating resources to the segments and assessing their performance.
For these reasons, this measure is excluded from the definition of non-GAAP financial measures under the SEC Regulation G and Item 10(e) of Regulation S-K.
RECONCILIATION OF NET INCOME TO ADJUSTED EBITDA
 INDEX
LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES
We generated $53.5 million in cash flows from operating activities in the first six months of fiscal 2019, compared to $67.1 million in cash from operating activities in the first six months of fiscal 2018.
The decrease in operating cash flows was primarily due to $26.9 million spent on acquisition and integration related costs, net of tax, and an increase in working capital associated with operating a larger business.
In the first six months of fiscal 2019, cash flows used in investing activities were $1,197 million, compared to $5.9 million in cash used in investing activities in the first six months of fiscal 2018.
The increase was driven by the use of $1,182 million for the Acquisition.
The remainder of the purchase price was satisfied with the issuance of common stock.
Capital expenditures in the first six months were $19.5 million, compared to $8.8 million in the prior year.
In the first six months of fiscal 2019, cash flows used in financing activities were $982.3 million, compared to $8.6 million used in financing activities in the six months ended March 31, 2018.
During the first quarter of fiscal 2019, we received $1,044 million in debt proceeds, net of $21.4 million in debt issuance costs and original issue discount fees, which was used for the Acquisition.
In March 2019, we made a $45 million repayment on this debt, an increase of $38 million in debt repayment compared to prior year.
In addition, our dividend payments increased by $12 million versus the prior year, driven by the doubling of our quarterly dividend, as announced in March 2018, and the new shares issued in connection with the KMG acquisition.
On the Acquisition Date, we entered into a credit agreement by and among the Company, the lenders party thereto and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as administrative agent (the “Credit Agreement”), which provides for senior secured financing of up to $1,265.0 million, consisting of a term loan facility in an aggregate principal amount of $1,065.0 million (the “Term Loan Facility”) and a revolving credit facility in an aggregate principal amount of up to $200.0 million, including a letter of credit sub-facility of up to $50.0 million (the “Revolving Credit Facility”).
The Term Loan Facility and the Revolving Credit Facility are referred to as the “Credit Facilities.” The Company may generally prepay outstanding loans under the Credit Facilities at any time, without prepayment premium or penalty, subject to customary “breakage” costs with respect to LIBOR rate loans.
Prepayments of the Term Loan Facility in connection with certain “repricing events” resulting in a lower yield occurring at any time during the first six months after the Acquisition Date must be accompanied by a 1.00% prepayment premium.
The Revolving Credit Facility requires that the Company maintain a maximum first lien secured net leverage ratio, as defined in the Credit Agreement, of 4.00 to 1.00 as of the last day of each fiscal quarter if any revolving loans are outstanding, commencing with the first full fiscal quarter after the Acquisition Date.
Additionally, the Credit Agreement contains certain affirmative and negative covenants that limit the ability of the Company, among other things and subject to certain significant exceptions, to incur debt or liens, make investments, enter into certain mergers, consolidations, asset sales and acquisitions, pay dividends and make other restricted payments and enter into transactions with affiliates.
The Credit Agreement also contains customary affirmative covenants and events of default.
We believe we are in compliance with these covenants.
In the second quarter of fiscal 2019, we entered into a floating-to-fixed interest rate swap agreement to hedge the variability in our LIBOR-based interest payments on approximately 70% of our Team Loan balance.
During this quarter we made a prepayment of $45.0 million, and subsequent to the end of the quarter we made an additional $55.0 million prepayment.
See Note 10 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements of this Report on Form 10-Q for additional information regarding the Credit Agreement.
In January 2016, our Board of Directors authorized an increase in the amount available under our share repurchase program from the previously remaining $75.0 million to $150.0 million.
As of March 31, 2019, $81.3 million remained available under our share repurchase program.
Share repurchases are made from time to time, depending on market and other conditions.
The timing, manner, price and amounts of repurchases are determined at the Company's discretion, and the share repurchase program may be suspended, terminated or modified at any time for any reason.
The repurchase program does not obligate the Company to acquire any specific number of shares.
Repurchases are subject to SEC regulations as well as certain conditions specified in the plan.
Our Board of Directors authorized the initiation of our regular quarterly cash dividend program in January 2016, and since that time has increased the dividend, to its current quarterly level of $0.42 per share.
The declaration and payment of future dividends is subject to the discretion and determination of the Board of Directors and management, based on a variety of factors, and the program may be suspended, terminated or modified at any time for any reason.
As of March 31, 2019, we had $192.3 million of cash and cash equivalents, $132.3 million of which was held in foreign subsidiaries.
See Part II, Item 1A entitled “Risk Factors” of this Report on Form 10-Q for additional discussion of our foreign operations.
 INDEX
We believe that our current balance of cash, cash generated by our operations, cash repatriation to the United States, and available borrowing capacity under our Credit Facilities will be sufficient to fund our operations, expected capital expenditures, dividend payments, and share repurchases for at least the next twelve months.
However, in pursuit of corporate development or other initiatives, we may need to raise additional funds in the future through equity or debt financing, or other arrangements.
Depending on future conditions in the capital and credit markets, we could encounter difficulty securing additional financing in the type or amount necessary to pursue these objectives.
 INDEX
OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS
At March 31, 2019 and September 30, 2018, we did not have any unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships, such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities, which might have been established for the purpose of facilitating off-balance sheet arrangements.
 INDEX
TABULAR DISCLOSURE OF CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS
The following summarizes our contractual obligations at March 31, 2019, and the effect such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flows in future periods.
We have been operating under a multi-year supply agreement with Cabot Corporation, which is not a related party and has not been one since 2002, for the purchase of fumed silica, the current term of which runs through December 31, 2019.
Purchase obligations include an aggregate amount of $11.1 million of contractual commitments related to our Cabot Corporation supply agreement for fumed silica.
Interest payments on long-term debt reflect interest rates in effect at December 31, 2018.
The interest payments reflect variable LIBOR-based rates currently in effect on $274 million of our outstanding debt, and fixed rates on $746 million of outstanding debt for which we have implemented an interest rate swap.
Commitment fees are based on our estimated consolidated leverage ratio in future periods.
See Note 10 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements of this Report on Form 10-Q for additional information regarding our long-term debt.
Refer to Item 7 “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” of Part II of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2018, for additional information regarding our contractual obligations.
 INDEX
SUPPLEMENTAL UNAUDITED PRO FORMA CONDENSED COMBINED FINANCIAL INFORMATION
The following Unaudited Pro Forma Condensed Combined Financial Information is presented to illustrate the estimated effects of the company’s acquisition of KMG (the “Acquisition”), which was consummated on November 15, 2018 (the “Acquisition Date”), based on the historical results of operations of Cabot Microelectronics and KMG.
See Note 1, Background and Basis of Presentation, and Note 4, Business Combination, to the consolidated financial statements for additional information on the Acquisition.
The following Unaudited Pro Forma Condensed Combined Statements of Income for the three and six months ended March 31, 2019 and March 31, 2018 are based on the historical financial statements of Cabot Microelectronics and KMG after giving effect to the Acquisition, and the assumptions and adjustments described in the accompanying notes to these Unaudited Pro Forma Condensed Combined Statements of Income.
The historical Cabot Microelectronics Consolidated Statements of Income for the three and six months ended March 31, 2019 and March 31, 2018 were derived from the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Form 10-Q.
The historical KMG Consolidated Statements of Income for the six months ended March 31, 2019, as well as the historical KMG Consolidated Statements of Income for the three and six months ended March 31, 2018 includes information derived from KMG’s books and records.
Prior to the Acquisition, KMG was on a July 31st fiscal year end reporting cycle.
These pro forma financials include actual KMG’s pre-acquisition results with the months aligned to Cabot Microelectronics’ fiscal periods, and therefore, they do not align with consolidated financial statements included in KMG’s Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q.
• Application of the acquisition method of accounting;
• Elimination of transaction costs incurred in connection with the Acquisition;
• Adjustments to reflect the new financing arrangements entered into and legacy financing arrangements retired in connection with the Acquisition;
• The exchange of 0.2000 share(s) of Cabot Microelectronics common stock for each share of KMG common stock; and
• Conformance of accounting policies.
The Unaudited Pro Forma Condensed Combined Financial Information was prepared using the acquisition method of accounting, which requires, among other things, that assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination be recognized at their fair values as of the completion of the acquisition.
We utilized estimated fair values at the Acquisition Date to allocate the total consideration exchanged to the net tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed.
This allocation was initially completed as of November 15, 2018.
The allocation may be adjusted for up to one-year post closing.
The Unaudited Pro Forma Condensed Combined financial information has been prepared on the basis of SEC Regulation S-X Article 11 and is not necessarily indicative of the results of operations that would have been realized had the transactions been completed as of the dates indicated, nor are they meant to be indicative of our anticipated combined future results.
In addition, the accompanying Unaudited Pro Forma Condensed Combined Statements of Income do not reflect any additional anticipated synergies, operating efficiencies, cost savings, or any integration costs that may result from the Acquisition.
The historical consolidated financial information has been adjusted in the accompanying Unaudited Pro Forma Condensed Combined Statements of Income to give effect to unaudited pro forma events that are (1) directly attributable to the transaction, (2) factually supportable and (3) are expected to have a continuing impact on the results of operations of the combined company.
As a result, under SEC Regulation S-X Article 11, certain non-recurring expenses such as deal costs and compensation expenses related to severance or accelerated stock compensation and certain recurring historical KMG expenses related to depreciation, amortization, financing costs and costs of sales have been adjusted as if the Acquisition had occurred on October 1, 2017.
Certain non-cash costs related to the fair value step-up of inventory are eliminated from pro forma results in the periods presented.
In contrast, under the ASC 805 presentation in Note 4, Business Combination, to the consolidated financial statements, these expenses are required to be included in prior year pro forma results.

Summary of Pro Forma Adjustments
We calculated the income tax effect of the pro forma adjustments using a 21.6% and 23.4% tax rate, which represent the weighted average statutory tax rate for six-month period ended March 31, 2019 and year-ended September 30, 2018, respectively.
Additionally, for the 2018 periods presented, we calculated the unaudited pro forma weighted average number of basic shares outstanding by adding the Cabot Microelectronics weighted average number of basic shares outstanding from the share amounts disclosed in the historical Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q to the amount of shares issued in connection with the Acquisition, as if the shares were held for the entire period.
We calculated the unaudited pro forma weighted average number of diluted shares outstanding by adding the number of shares issued in the Acquisition to the amount disclosed in the historical Cabot Microelectronics Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.
The basic and diluted EPS calculation takes pro forma net income divided by the applicable number of shares outstanding.

Reconciliation of Pro Forma and Non-GAAP Adjusted Pro Forma Information
•
Removal of amortization of acquisition related intangibles, since management believes that these costs are not indicative of the company’s core operating performance.
•
Removes the difference between reported GAAP interest expense and Article 11 pro forma interest expense, which is prepared as if the acquisition occurred on October 1, 2017.
This adjustment is made for periods when Cabot Microelectronics owned KMG for the full reporting period.
•
Removal of integration expenses, as they are non-recurring in nature.
•
Adjustment for U.S. Tax Reform, which represents a significant non-recurring item affecting comparability among periods.
Reconciliations for these items are provided in the tables below.
