ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 



The following "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations", as well as disclosures included elsewhere in this Form 10-Q, include "forward-looking statements" within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. This Act provides a safe harbor for forward-looking statements to encourage companies to provide prospective information about themselves so long as they identify these statements as forward-looking and provide meaningful cautionary statements identifying important factors that could cause actual results to differ from the projected results. All statements other than statements of historical fact we make in this Form 10-Q are forward-looking. In particular, the statements herein regarding future sales and operating results; growth or contraction of, and trends in, the industry and markets in which the Company participates; the Company's management; various economic or political factors and international or national events; regulatory or legislative activity, including the enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act ("Tax Act") in December 2017 in the United States; product performance; the generation, protection and acquisition of intellectual property, and litigation related to such intellectual property; new product introductions; development of new products, technologies and markets; the Company's supply chain; the financial conditions of the Company's customers; natural disasters; the acquisition of or investment in, or collaboration with other entities; uses and investment of the Company's cash balance, including dividends and share repurchases, which may be suspended, terminated or modified at any time for any reason, based on a variety of factors; financing facilities and related debt, payment of principal and interest, and compliance with covenants and other terms; the Company's capital structure; the Company's current or future tax rate, including the effects of Tax Act; the operation of facilities by the Company; and statements preceded by, followed by or that include the words "intends," "estimates," "plans," "believes," "expects," "anticipates," "should," "could" or similar expressions, are forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements reflect our current expectations and are inherently uncertain. Our actual results may differ significantly from our expectations. We assume no obligation to update this forward-looking information. The section entitled "Risk Factors" describes some, but not all, of the factors that could cause these differences. 





 FIRST QUARTER OF FISCAL 2018 OVERVIEW 



In our first quarter of fiscal 2018, we experienced continued solid demand for our products, particularly for memory and logic applications, as well as continued strength in China. Some semiconductor industry analysts continue to expect solid industry demand conditions throughout our fiscal year, especially for 3D memory technology. Over the longer term, we continue to believe that semiconductor demand will increase, driven by the continued transition in memory from 2D to 3D technology; in high end chips for high performance computing, virtual reality, augmented reality, and smart phones; through greater connectivity with the internet of things; and with expanding electronics in areas such as automotive applications. We believe we are well positioned to benefit from these long-term demand trends. However, there are many factors that make it difficult for us to predict future revenue trends for our business, including those discussed in Part II, Item 1A entitled "Risk Factors" in this Form 10-Q. 



Revenue for our first quarter of fiscal 2018 was $140.0 million, which represented an increase of 13.6% from the first quarter of fiscal 2017, and was a quarterly record for the Company. We achieved record quarterly revenue in our tungsten slurry and polishing pads product areas. Revenue from our tungsten, pads and dielectrics products increased 13.7%, 16.5% and 8.4%, respectively, from the same quarter last year. 



Gross profit for the first quarter of fiscal 2018 expressed as a percentage of revenue was 52.9%, compared to 49.9% for our first quarter of fiscal 2017, including 90 and 100-basis point adverse impacts of NexPlanar amortization expense, comparatively. Factors affecting our gross profit for the quarter compared to last year included higher sales volume and a higher-valued product mix, partially offset by higher fixed manufacturing costs, including higher incentive compensation expense. We continue to expect our gross profit percentage for full fiscal year 2018 to be between 50% and 52%. However, we may continue to experience fluctuations in our gross profit due to a number of factors, including changes in our product mix and the extent to which we utilize our manufacturing capacity, which may cause our quarterly gross profit to be above or below this annual guidance range. 





INDEX  



Operating expenses were $36.9 million in our first quarter of fiscal 2018 compared to $33.4 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2017, both periods of which included $0.5 million in NexPlanar amortization expense. The increase in operating expenses from the comparable quarter of fiscal 2017 was primarily due to higher staffing related expenses, including costs associated with the Chief Financial Officer ("CFO") transition described in Note 12 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statement of this Form 10-Q, and higher incentive compensation expense. We currently expect operating expenses for full fiscal year 2018 to be between $145.0 million and $150.0 million; previously, we had expected operating expenses to be within a range of $142.0 million to $147.0 million. 



The Company reported a diluted loss per share of $0.12 in the first quarter of fiscal 2018, compared to diluted earnings per share of $0.88 in the same quarter last year. The year-over-year decrease was primarily due to the impact of the enactment of the Tax Act in December 2017, which reduced diluted earnings per share by $1.26. 



CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES AND EFFECTS OF RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS 



We discuss our critical accounting estimates and effects of recent accounting pronouncements in "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" included in Item 7 of Part II of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2017. There have been no material changes in our critical accounting estimates during the first three months of fiscal 2018. See Note 2 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements of this Form 10-Q for our accounting policy regarding available-for-sale securities. See Note 17 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements of this Form 10-Q for a discussion of new accounting pronouncements.

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 



THREE MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2017, VERSUS THREE MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2016 



REVENUE 



Revenue was $140.0 million for the three months ended December 31, 2017, which represented a 13.6%, or $16.7 million, increase from the three months ended December 31, 2016. The increase in revenue was driven by a $12.9 million increase due to higher sales volume, a $5.8 million increase due to product mix, partially offset by a $1.9 million decrease due to price changes. The increase in sales volume was consistent with continued overall strong demand conditions in the global semiconductor industry. Revenue from our tungsten, pads and dielectrics products increased 13.7%, 16.5% and 8.4%, respectively, from the comparable period of fiscal 2017. 



COST OF GOODS SOLD 



Total cost of goods sold was $66.0 million for the three months ended December 31, 2017, which represented an increase of 6.8%, or $4.2 million, from the three months ended December 31, 2016. The increase in cost of goods sold was primarily due to a $3.0 million increase in fixed manufacturing costs, including higher incentive compensation expense and, a $2.9 million increase due to higher sales volume, partially offset by a $1.4 million decrease in other variable manufacturing costs, including material costs, and adverse foreign exchange effects of $0.5 million. Fixed manufacturing costs included $1.2 million of NexPlanar amortization in the first quarters of fiscal years 2018 and 2017. 



GROSS PROFIT 



Our gross profit as a percentage of revenue was 52.9% for the three months ended December 31, 2017, compared to 49.9% for the three months ended December 31, 2016. The increase in gross profit as a percentage of revenue was primarily due to higher sales volume and a higher-valued product mix, partially offset by higher fixed manufacturing costs, including costs associated with incentive compensation expense. 



RESEARCH, DEVELOPMENT AND TECHNICAL 



Total research, development and technical expenses were $12.1 million for the three months ended December 31, 2017, which represented a decrease of 9.3%, or $1.2 million, from the three months ended December 31, 2016. The decrease was primarily due to lower staffing related expenses of $0.5 million, lower professional expenses of $0.4 million, and lower depreciation and amortization expense of $0.3 million. 





  ·   Research related to fundamental CMP technology;     



  ·   Development of new and enhanced CMP consumable products, including collaboration on joint development projects with technology-leading customers and suppliers;     



  ·   Process development to support rapid and effective commercialization of new products;     



  ·   Technical support of CMP products in our customers' research, development and manufacturing facilities; and,     



  ·   Development of polishing and metrology applications outside of the semiconductor industry.     





INDEX  



SELLING AND MARKETING 



Selling and marketing expenses were $5.8 million for the three months ended December 31, 2017, which represented a decrease of 22.7%, or $1.7 million, from the three months ended December 31, 2016. The decrease was primarily due to the absence of severance expense of $0.7 million, and lower staffing related costs of $0.5 million. 



GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE 



General and administrative expenses were $18.9 million for the three months ended December 31, 2017, which represented an increase of 51.4%, or $6.4 million, from the three months ended December 31, 2016. The increase was primarily due to costs of $2.8 million associated with the CFO transition described above, higher staffing related expenses of $1.2 million, higher share-based compensation expense of $0.8 million, higher incentive compensation expenses of $0.6 million, higher legal and professional fees of $0.4 million and higher information and technology expenses of $0.4 million. 



INTEREST EXPENSE 



Interest expense was $1.1 million for the three months ended December 31, 2017, and was comparable to $1.2 million for the three months ended December 31, 2016. The interest rate on 50% of our outstanding debt continues to be fixed through interest rate swaps, while we maintain a variable interest rate on the rest of our outstanding debt. 



OTHER INCOME, NET 



Other income was $0.7 million for the three months ended December 31, 2017, and comparable to $1.0 million during the three months ended December 31, 2016. 



PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES 



The Company's effective tax rate for the first quarter of fiscal 2018 was 108.4 percent, compared to 20.3 percent in the same quarter last year. The significant increase is primarily driven by discrete adjustments related to the impact of the Tax Act. These adjustments increased the Company's income tax expense by approximately $32.9 million. The Company currently expects its effective tax rate for the remainder of the fiscal year to be within the range of 21 to 24 percent. Previously, before the impact of the Tax Act, the Company had estimated an effective tax rate of 24 to 27 percent for the full fiscal year. See Note 14 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements of this Form 10-Q for more information on our income taxes. 



NET INCOME (LOSS) 



Net loss was $3.1 million for the three months ended December 31, 2017, which represented a decrease of 113.9%, or $25.3 million, from the three months ended December 31, 2016. The significant decrease was primarily related to the impact of the Tax Act. One-time effects of the Tax Act increased the Company's income tax expense by approximately $32.9 million, and therefore decreased the Company's net income by the same amount. 





INDEX  



LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES 



We generated $30.6 million in cash flows from operating activities in the first three months of fiscal 2018, compared to $25.1 million in cash from operating activities in the first three months of fiscal 2017. Our cash provided by operating activities in the first three months of fiscal 2018 reflected a net loss of $3.1 million, $49.6 million in non-cash items, including $24.6 million related to the deemed repatriation transition tax of the Tax Act, and a $15.9 million net decrease in working capital. The increase in cash flows from operating activities compared to the first three months of fiscal 2017 was primarily due to higher revenue and gross margin, and also reflected the non-cash impacts of the Tax Act, and changes in the timing and amount of accrued expense payments, including payments related to our Short-Term Incentive Program ("STIP"), and a higher accounts receivable balance at December 31, 2017, due to an increase in revenue. We are still analyzing certain aspects of the Tax Act, which could potentially affect the measurement of these balances or give rise to new deferred tax amounts. Our accruals for incentive compensation under our STIP are higher in fiscal 2018 than in fiscal 2017. In addition, the STIP payment in the first quarter of fiscal 2018 related to our performance in fiscal 2017 was $14.1 million higher than the STIP payment related to our performance in fiscal 2016, which was paid in the first quarter of fiscal 2017. 



 In the first three months of fiscal 2018, cash flows used in investing activities were $52.5 million, representing $48.3 million in purchases of investments designated as available-for-sale securities, net of $1.9 million in sales proceeds, under a managed investment arrangement, and property, plant and equipment additions of $4.2 million. In the first three months of fiscal 2017, cash flows used in investing activities were $4.9 million for purchases of property, plant and equipment. We continue to expect our total capital expenditures in fiscal 2018 to be within the range of $18.0 million to $22.0 million. 



In the first three months of fiscal 2018, cash flows used in financing activities were $6.6 million. We used $5.1 million to pay dividends and dividend equivalents on our common stock, and $3.3 million to repay long-term debt. We also used $3.1 million to repurchase common stock pursuant to the terms of our 2012 Omnibus Incentive Plan (OIP) for shares withheld from award recipients to cover payroll taxes on the vesting of restricted stock and restricted stock units granted under the OIP, and used $1.6 million to repurchase common stock under our share repurchase program. We received $6.5 million from the issuance of common stock related to the exercise of stock options granted under our Cabot Microelectronics Corporation 2000 Equity Incentive Plan (EIP) and OIP, and for the sale of shares to employees under our ESPP. The tax benefit of $2.8 million in our first quarter of fiscal 2018 related to exercises of stock options under the EIP and OIP, and vesting of restricted stock and restricted stock units awarded under the OIP is now presented in the operating activities section of the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows pursuant to the adoption of ASU 2016-09. In the first three months of fiscal 2017, cash flows provided by financing activities were $7.6 million. We received $12.5 million from the issuance of common stock related to the exercise of stock options granted under the EIP and OIP, and we received $2.5 million in tax benefits related to exercises of stock options under the EIP and OIP, and vesting of restricted stock and restricted stock units awarded under the OIP. We paid $4.4 million in dividends and dividend equivalents on our common stock. We also used $1.1 million to repurchase common stock under our share repurchase program and $1.9 million to repurchase common stock pursuant to the terms of our OIP for shares withheld from award recipients to cover payroll taxes on the vesting of restricted stock and restricted stock units granted under the OIP, which we have continued to present as a financing activity under ASU 2016-09. 



In January 2016, our Board of Directors authorized an increase in the amount available under our share repurchase program from the previously remaining $75.0 million to $150.0 million. Under this program, we repurchased 17,250 shares for $1.6 million during the first three months of fiscal 2018 and we repurchased 18,724 shares for $1.1 million during the first three months of fiscal 2017. As of December 31, 2017, approximately $120.4 million remained outstanding under our share repurchase program. Share repurchases are made from time to time, depending on market conditions. The timing, manner, price and amounts of repurchases are determined at the Company's discretion, and the share repurchase program may be suspended, terminated or modified at any time for any reason. The repurchase program does not obligate the Company to acquire any specific number of shares. To date, we have funded share purchases under our share repurchase program from our available cash balance, and anticipate we will continue to do so. Periodically, we also continue the "10b5-1" stock purchase plan agreements with independent brokers to repurchase shares of our common stock in accordance with guidelines pursuant to Rule 10b5-1 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. A plan under Rule 10b5-1 allows a company to repurchase its shares at times when it otherwise might be prevented from doing so under insider trading laws or because of self-imposed trading blackout periods. Repurchases are subject to SEC regulations as well as certain conditions specified in the plan. 



In January 2016, we announced that our Board of Directors authorized the initiation of a regular dividend program under which the Company intends to pay quarterly cash dividends on our common stock. Pursuant to this announcement, our Board of Directors declared quarterly cash dividends of $0.18 per share, during the second, third, and fourth quarters of fiscal 2016, and during the first quarter of fiscal 2017. Starting in the second quarter of fiscal 2017, our Board of Directors declared quarterly cash dividends of $0.20 per share in the second, third and fourth quarters of fiscal 2017, the latest of which we paid in January 2018. The declaration and payment of future dividends is subject to the discretion and determination of the Company's Board of Directors and management, based on a variety of factors, and the program may be suspended, terminated or modified at any time for any reason. 





INDEX  





As of December 31, 2017, we had $377.2 million of cash and cash equivalents, $225.4 million of which was held in foreign subsidiaries in Japan, the Netherlands, Singapore, South Korea and Taiwan. In addition, we currently have a balance of $48.3 million in securities which are designated as available-for-sale securities. See Part II, Item 1A entitled "Risk Factors" in this Form 10-Q for additional discussion of our foreign operations. 



We believe that our current balance of cash, available-for-sale securities, cash generated by our operations, and available borrowing capacity under our Credit Facilities will be sufficient to fund our operations, expected capital expenditures, merger and acquisition activities, dividend payments, and share repurchases for at least the next twelve months. In addition, we expect the Tax Act will provide greater flexibility in repatriating cash to the U.S. However, in pursuit of corporate development initiatives, we may need to raise additional funds in the future through equity or debt financing, or other arrangements. Depending on future conditions in the capital and credit markets, we could encounter difficulty securing additional financing in the type or amount necessary to pursue these objectives. 



OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS 



At December 31, 2017 and September 30, 2017, we did not have any unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships, such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities, which might have been established for the purpose of facilitating off-balance sheet arrangements. 





INDEX  



TABULAR DISCLOSURE OF CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS 



The following summarizes our contractual obligations at December 31, 2017, and the effect such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flows in future periods. 







We have been operating under a multi-year supply agreement with Cabot Corporation, which is not a related party and has not been one since 2002, for the purchase of fumed silica, the current term of which runs through December 31, 2019. This agreement provides us the option to purchase fumed silica with no minimum purchase requirements as of 2017, for which we have paid a fee of $1.5 million in each of calendar years 2017 and 2018, and for which we will pay in 2019. The purchase obligation in the table above reflect management's expectation that we will meet our forecasted quantities in calendar 2018 and beyond. Purchase obligations include an aggregate amount of $9.7 million of contractual commitments related to our Cabot Corporation supply agreement for fumed silica. The $1.5 million payment for calendar 2019 is included in accrued liabilities on our Consolidated Balance Sheets as of December 31, 2017. 



Interest payments on long-term debt reflect interest rates in effect at December 31, 2017. The interest payments reflect variable LIBOR-based rates currently in effect on $70.5 million of our outstanding debt, and fixed interest rates on $70.5 million of outstanding debt for which we have implemented interest rate swaps. Commitment fees are based on our estimated consolidated leverage ratio in future periods. See Note 8 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements of this Form 10-Q for additional information regarding our long-term debt. 



Refer to Item 7 "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" of Part II of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2017, for additional information regarding our contractual obligations.

ITEM 2. UNREGISTERED SALES OF EQUITY SECURITIES AND USE OF PROCEEDS 



ISSUER PURCHASES OF EQUITY SECURITIES 





In January 2016, our Board of Directors authorized an increase in the amount available under our share repurchase program to $150.0 million. Under this program, we repurchased 17,250 shares for $1.6 million during the first quarter of fiscal 2018.
