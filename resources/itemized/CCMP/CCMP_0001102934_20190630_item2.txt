ITEM 2.
MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
The following "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations", as well as disclosures included elsewhere in this Report on Form 10-Q, include "forward-looking statements" within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.
This Act provides a safe harbor for forward-looking statements to encourage companies to provide prospective information about themselves so long as they identify these statements as forward-looking and provide meaningful cautionary statements identifying important factors that could cause actual results to differ from the projected results.
All statements other than statements of historical fact we make in this Report on Form 10-Q are forward-looking, which address a variety of subjects including, for example, future sales and operating results; growth or contraction, and trends in the industry and markets in which the Company participates; the acquisition of, investment in, or collaboration with other entities, including the Company’s acquisition of KMG Chemicals, Inc. (“KMG”), and the expected benefits and synergies of such acquisition; new product introductions; development of new products, technologies and markets; product performance; the financial conditions of the Company's customers; competitive landscape; the Company's supply chain; natural disasters; various economic or political factors and international or national events, including related to the enactment of trade sanctions, tariffs, or other similar matters; the generation, protection and acquisition of intellectual property, and litigation related to such intellectual property or third party intellectual property; environmental, health and safety laws and regulations, and related compliance; the operation of facilities by Cabot Microelectronics; the Company's management; foreign exchange fluctuation; the Company's current or future tax rate, including the effects of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act in the United States (“tax act”); cybersecurity threats; financing facilities and related debt, pay off or payment of principal and interest, and compliance with covenants and other terms; and, uses and investment of the Company's cash balance, including dividends and share repurchases, which may be suspended, terminated or modified at any time for any reason by the Company, based on a variety of factors.
Statements that are not historical facts, including statements about Cabot Microelectronics’ beliefs, plans and expectations, are forward-looking statements.
Such statements are based on current expectations of Cabot Microelectronics’ management and are subject to a number of factors and uncertainties, which could cause actual results to differ materially from those described in the forward-looking statements.

The section entitled "Risk Factors" describes some, but not all, of the factors that could cause these differences.
THIRD QUARTER OF FISCAL 2019 OVERVIEW
INDEX
In the Electronic Materials segment, we recorded lower CMP slurries revenue, which was partially offset by higher revenue in CMP pads and electronic chemicals.
Within the backdrop of an ongoing soft semiconductor industry environment, we believe these results are reflective of the resilience of our business, as well as the breadth of our product offerings, as the increased demand from advanced logic customers balanced weakness from memory customers.
CMP slurries have a high participation to memory, and were adversely impacted by the decrease in DRAM and NAND production at our customers this year.
In logic applications, the transition to advanced nodes by many of our top customers is driving increased demand for materials, particularly electronic chemicals.
Despite continued semiconductor industry uncertainty in the near term, as channel inventories are reduced and demand from multiple end markets improves, we have seen signs of stabilization in demand from memory customers and expect recovery to continue over the next several quarters.
In our Performance Materials segment, we continue to record strong revenue this quarter, primarily driven by higher demand for our drag-reducing agents.
These products enable pipeline operators to optimize the efficiency and throughput of oil transport in both U.S. and international oil production.
However, there are many factors that make it difficult for us to predict future revenue trends for our Company, including those discussed in Part II, Item 1A entitled “Risk Factors” of this Report on Form 10-Q.
Revenue for our third quarter of fiscal 2019 was $271.9 million, which represented an increase of 80.7% from the same quarter of fiscal 2018, primarily due to the Acquisition.
Net income was $18.9 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2019, which represented a decrease of 46.3% from the same quarter of fiscal 2018.
Results benefited from the Acquisition, but were more than offset by acquisition-related expenses, increased amortization and depreciation associated with re-valuing KMG assets to fair value, higher interest expenses resulting from the debt borrowing to finance the Acquisition, costs related to the KMG-Bernuth warehouse fire that occurred in May 2019, and increased tax expense related to newly issued final regulations related to US Tax Reform which impacted our reserves for uncertain tax positions.
For the same reasons, diluted earnings per share decrease from $1.34 in the third quarter of fiscal 2018 to $0.64 in the current quarter.
Adjusted EBITDA was $85.8 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2019.
This represents an increase of $36.9 million, or a 75.6% increase from the same quarter of fiscal 2018.
Adjusted EBITDA benefited from the addition of the KMG businesses, partially offset by the softer industry conditions that resulted in lower demand for Cabot Microelectronics’ heritage CMP products.
Refer to the “Use of certain GAAP and Non-GAAP Financial Information” section below for the definition of adjusted EBITDA and a reconciliation of adjusted EBITDA to net income, the most comparable GAAP financial measure.
Adjusted EBITDA margin, which represents adjusted EBITDA as a percentage of revenue, was 31.5% for the third quarter of fiscal 2019, compared to 32.5% for the same quarter of fiscal 2018.
CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES AND EFFECTS OF RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS
We discuss our critical accounting estimates and effects of recent accounting pronouncements in “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” included in Item 7 of Part II of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2018.
Except for the discussion on revenue recognition in Note 2 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements of this Report on Form 10-Q, no material changes have been made to the Company’s significant accounting policies during the first nine months of fiscal 2019.
See Note 2 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements of this Report on Form 10-Q for a discussion of new accounting pronouncements.
INDEX
RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
THREE MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2019, VERSUS THREE MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2018
REVENUE
Revenue was $271.9 million for the three months ended June 30, 2019, which represented an 80.7%, or $121.4 million, increase from the three months ended June 30, 2018, primarily due to the Acquisition.
Revenue from Cabot Microelectronics’ heritage businesses decreased by $10.1 million, or 6.7%, primarily due to lower sales volume, partially offset by a higher value product mix.
COST OF SALES
Total cost of sales was $156.5 million for the three months ended June 30, 2019, which represented an increase of 124.4%, or $86.8 million, from the three months ended June 30, 2018, primarily due to the Acquisition.
The cost of sales from Cabot Microelectronics’ heritage businesses decreased by $3.8 million, primarily driven by lower sales volume.
GROSS MARGIN
Our gross margin was 42.4% for the three months ended June 30, 2019, compared to 53.6% for the three months ended June 30, 2018.
The decrease in gross margin was primarily due to the inclusion of the KMG businesses, which reduced gross margin by 10.7%, of which 1.5% was due to the costs related to the KMG-Bernuth warehouse fire.
Within Cabot Microelectronics’ heritage businesses, gross margin decreased by 0.5%, which was primarily due to lower sales volume, partially offset by a higher value product mix.
RESEARCH, DEVELOPMENT AND TECHNICAL
Total research, development and technical expenses were $12.2 million for the three months ended June 30, 2019, which represented a decrease of 6.6%, or $0.9 million, from the three months ended June 30, 2018.
The decrease was primarily due to lower staffing-related costs of $1.1 million, including incentive compensation costs, offset by higher supplies used in research and development of $0.4 million.
Our research, development and technical efforts are focused on the areas of research related to fundamental CMP technology; development of new and enhanced CMP consumable products, including collaboration on joint development projects with technology-leading customers and suppliers; process development to support rapid and effective commercialization of new products; technical support of CMP products in our customers’ research, development and manufacturing facilities; and, development of polishing and metrology applications outside of the semiconductor industry.
SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE
Selling, general and administrative expenses were $51.0 million for the three months ended June 30, 2019, which represented an increase of 98.2%, or $25.2 million, from the three months ended June 30, 2018.
The increase was primarily due to $13.0 million of amortization expense related to the Acquisition, $11.2 million in incremental KMG-related costs, and $2.9 million of acquisition and integration related costs.
These items were partially offset by $1.6 million lower staffing-related costs, including incentive compensation costs.
INTEREST EXPENSE
Interest expense was $12.8 million for the three months ended June 30, 2019, which represented an increase of $12.2 million from the three months ended June 30, 2018.
The increase resulted from the debt borrowing to finance the Acquisition.
INTEREST INCOME
Interest income was $0.4 million for the three months ended June 30, 2019, which represented a decrease of 63.5%, or $0.7 million from the three months ended June 30, 2018 due to lower cash balances compared to the same period last year.
INDEX
OTHER INCOME (EXPENSE), NET
Other expense was $0.5 million for three months ended June 30, 2019, compared to other income of $0.5 million from the three months ended June 30, 2018.
The change was primarily due to higher loss on foreign exchange in the current quarter and the absence of the gain on termination of interest rate swap agreements of $0.5 million that had occurred in the third quarter of fiscal 2018.
PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES
The Company’s effective income tax rate for the third quarter of fiscal 2019 was 52.1%, compared to 18.3% in the same quarter last year.
The increase is primarily driven by a discrete charge of $9,128 related to newly issued final regulations related to U.S. Tax Reform which impacted the Company’s reserves for uncertain tax positions.
NET INCOME
Net income was $18.9 million for the three months ended June 30, 2019, which represented a decrease of 46.3%, or $16.3 million, from the three months ended June 30, 2018.
Net income benefited from the addition of the KMG businesses, and was partially offset by acquisition and integration-related expenses, increased amortization and depreciation associated with re-valuing KMG assets to fair value, higher interest expenses resulting from the debt borrowing to finance the Acquisition, KMG-Bernuth warehouse fire related costs, and discrete charge of $9,128 related to newly issued final regulations related to U.S. Tax Reform which impacted the Company’s reserves for uncertain tax positions.
INDEX
NINE MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2019, VERSUS NINE MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2018
REVENUE
Revenue was $759.1 million for the nine months ended June 30, 2019, which represented a 75.1%, or $325.7 million increase from the nine months ended June 30, 2018.
The increase in revenue was primarily due to the Acquisition.
Revenue from Cabot Microelectronics’ heritage businesses increased slightly by $9.0 million, or 2.1%.
This increase was primarily driven by a higher value product mix, selected price increases, partially offset by lower sales volume.
COST OF SALES
Total cost of sales was $429.5 million for the nine months ended June 30, 2019, which represented an increase of 110.9%, or $225.9 million, from the nine months ended June 30, 2018.
The increase in cost of sales was primarily due to the Acquisition.
Cost of sales of Cabot Microelectronics’ heritage businesses was relatively flat compared to the same period last year, as the lower costs associated with lower sales volume was offset by higher per unit costs.
GROSS MARGIN
Our gross margin was 43.4% for the nine months ended June 30, 2019, compared to 53.0% for the nine months ended June 30, 2018.
The gross margin was adversely impacted by the inclusion of the KMG businesses, which reduced gross margin by 11.2%, of which 2.0% was due to the impact of the fair value write-up of acquired inventory sold.
Excluding the KMG businesses, gross margin increased by 1.6%, which was primarily due to lower production cost and a higher value product mix, partially offset by lower sales volume.
RESEARCH, DEVELOPMENT AND TECHNICAL
Total research, development and technical expenses were $39.0 million for nine months ended June 30, 2019, which was relatively flat compared to the same period last year.
SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE
Selling, general and administrative expenses were $162.4 million for the nine months ended June 30, 2019, which represented an increase of 116.4%, or $87.4 million, from the nine months ended June 30, 2018.
The increase was primarily due to $33.1 million of acquisition and integration related costs, $32.5 million of amortization expense related to the Acquisition, and $27.1 million in incremental KMG-related costs associated with the post-Acquisition period during the nine months period.
These items were partially offset by the absence of executive officer transition costs of $4.2 million that occurred in the first quarter of fiscal 2018.
INTEREST EXPENSE
Interest expense was $33.0 million for the nine months ended June 30, 2019, which represented an increase of $30.2 million from the nine months ended June 30, 2018.
The increase resulted from the debt borrowing to finance the Acquisition.
INTEREST INCOME
Interest income was $2.0 million for the nine months ended June 30, 2019, which represented a decrease of 38.3%, or $1.2 million for the nine months ended June 30, 2018 due to lower cash balances.
OTHER INCOME (EXPENSE), NET
Other expense was $2.9 million for the nine months ended June 30, 2019, compared to other income of $0.1 million from the nine months ended June 30, 2018.
The change was primarily due to higher loss on foreign exchange, and the absence of the gain on sale of assets of $1.0 million and gain on the termination of interest rate swap agreements that occurred in the nine months ended June 30, 2018.
INDEX
PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES
The Company’s effective income tax rate was 36.9% for the nine months ended June 30, 2019, compared to 47.0% for the nine months ended June 30, 2018.
The decrease in our effective income tax rate for the nine months ended June 30, 2019 compared to the prior year is primarily attributable to the Tax Act enacted in December 2017 which reduced the corporate income tax rate to 21.0% effective January 1, 2018, resulting in a change in our blended tax rate of 24.5% in fiscal 2018 to 21.0% beginning with our fiscal 2019.
This is partially offset by the increased tax expense related to newly issued final regulations related to US Tax Reform which impacted our reserves for uncertain tax positions, unfavorable tax treatment of certain KMG acquisition-related costs, such as compensation deduction limitations, as well as non-deductibility of certain professional fees.
Additionally, we recorded incremental tax expense for the GILTI provision of the Tax Act, which was effective for the first time during our fiscal 2019.
See Note 15 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements of this Report on Form 10-Q for more information on our income taxes.
NET INCOME
Net income was $59.5 million for the nine months ended June 30, 2019, which represented a decrease of 3.8%, or $2.4 million, from the nine months ended June 30, 2018.
Net income benefited from the addition of the KMG businesses, and the absence of the adverse impact of the Tax Act in the first quarter of fiscal 2018.
Net income was partially offset by acquisition and integration-related expenses, a charge for fair value write-up of acquired inventory sold, increased amortization and depreciation associated with re-valuing KMG assets to fair value, higher interest expenses resulting from the debt borrowing to finance the Acquisition, and the increased tax expense related to newly issued final regulations related to US Tax Reform which impacted our reserves for uncertain tax positions.
INDEX
SEGMENT ANALYSIS
Segment data is presented for our two reportable segments for the three and nine months ended June 30, 2019 and 2018.
The segment data should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this Report on Form 10-Q.
INDEX
THREE MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2019, VERSUS THREE MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2018
ELECTRONIC MATERIALS
The $68.3 million increase in Electronic Materials revenue was driven by the addition of KMG’s electronic chemicals business in the quarter, partially offset by the decrease in the sale of Cabot Microelectronics’ heritage CMP slurries products primarily due to softer industry conditions that resulted in lower demand for the Company’s products.
The decrease in sales volume was partially offset by higher value product mix and price changes.
The increase in Electronic Materials adjusted EBITDA compared to prior year was driven by the addition of KMG’s electronic chemicals results.
The lower adjusted EBITDA margin was primarily due to change in mix of products, as a result of the Acquisition.
PERFORMANCE MATERIALS
The $53.1 million increase in Performance Materials revenue was primarily driven by the addition of KMG’s performance materials business in the quarter.
Performance Materials’ adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA margin expanded from the prior year due to the addition of KMG’s heritage performance materials business.
NINE MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2019, VERSUS NINE MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2018
ELECTRONIC MATERIALS
The $202.4 million increase in Electronic Materials revenue was driven by the addition of KMG’s electronic chemicals business since the Acquisition.
The remaining increase was driven by higher value product mix, strong organic demand for the Company’s heritage CMP polishing pads product line, which increased 11.1%, primarily on higher sales volume, partially offset by the decrease in Company's heritage CMP slurries products due to the softer industry conditions.
Electronic Materials adjusted EBITDA increased from the prior year driven by the addition of KMG’s electronic chemicals results, as well as stronger profitability, driven by the leverage achieved on higher sales volume of the Company’s heritage CMP polishing pads product line.
The lower adjusted EBITDA margin was primarily due to change in mix of products as a result of the Acquisition.
PERFORMANCE MATERIALS
The $123.3 million increase in Performance Materials revenue was primarily driven by the addition of KMG’s performance materials business post-Acquisition.
Performance Materials’ adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA margin expanded from the prior year due to the addition of KMG’s heritage performance materials business.
USE OF CERTAIN GAAP AND NON-GAAP FINANCIAL INFORMATION
Adjusted EBITDA margin is defined as adjusted EBITDA as a percentage of revenue.
Adjusted EBITDA is defined as earnings before interest, income taxes, depreciation and amortization, adjusted for certain items that affect comparability from period to period.
These adjustments include items related to our acquisition of KMG, such as expenses incurred to complete the acquisition, integration related expenses, and impact of fair value adjustments to inventory acquired from KMG.
The non-GAAP financial information provided is a supplement to, and not a substitute for, the Company’s financial results presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP.
Management strongly encourages investors to review the Company’s consolidated financial statements in their entirety and to not rely on any single financial measure.
These non-GAAP financial measures are provided to enhance the investor's understanding about the Company's ongoing operations.
Specifically, the Company believes the impact of KMG acquisition-related expenses and acquisition-related amortization expenses are not indicative of its core operating results, and thus presents these certain metrics excluding these effects.
The presentation of non-GAAP financial information is not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for results prepared and presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP.
A reconciliation table of GAAP to non-GAAP financial measures is contained below.
INDEX
Adjusted EBITDA for the Electronic Materials and Performance Materials segments is presented in conformity with Accounting Standards Codification Topic 280, Segment Reporting.
This measure is reported to the chief operating decision maker for purposes of making decisions about allocating resources to the segments and assessing their performance.
For these reasons, this measure is excluded from the definition of non-GAAP financial measures under the SEC Regulation G and Item 10(e) of Regulation S-K.
RECONCILIATION OF NET INCOME TO ADJUSTED EBITDA
The table below presents the reconciliation of net income to adjusted EBITDA.
Adjusted EBITDA is not a measurement of our financial performance under GAAP and should not be considered as an alternative to net income.
Adjusted EBITDA may have limitations as an analytical tool and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under GAAP.
LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES
We generated $117.0 million in cash flows from operating activities in the first nine months of fiscal 2019, compared to $104.0 million in cash from operating activities in the first nine months of fiscal 2018.
The increase in operating cash flows of $13.0 million was due to an increase of net income adjusted for non-cash reconciling items.
In the first nine months of fiscal 2019, cash flows used in investing activities were $1.2 billion, compared to $145.3 million in cash used in investing activities in the first nine months of fiscal 2018.
The increase was driven by the use of $1,182 million for the Acquisition.
The remainder of the purchase price was satisfied with the issuance of common stock.
Capital expenditures in the first nine months were $32.7 million, compared to $15.2 million in the prior year.
In the first nine months of fiscal 2019, cash flows provided by financing activities were $908.7 million, compared to $177.7 million used in financing activities in the first nine months of fiscal 2018.
During the first quarter of fiscal 2019, we received $1,044 million in debt proceeds, net of $21.4 million in debt issuance costs and original issue discount fees, which was used for the Acquisition.
In addition, our dividend payments increased by $13.6 million versus the prior year, driven by the doubling of our quarterly dividend, as announced in March 2018, and the new shares issued in connection with the Acquisition.
INDEX
On the Acquisition Date, we entered into a credit agreement by and among the Company, the lenders party thereto and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as administrative agent (the “Credit Agreement”), which provides for senior secured financing of up to $1,265.0 million, consisting of a term loan facility in an aggregate principal amount of $1,065.0 million (the “Term Loan Facility”) and a revolving credit facility in an aggregate principal amount of up to $200.0 million, including a letter of credit sub-facility of up to $50.0 million (the “Revolving Credit Facility”).
The Term Loan Facility and the Revolving Credit Facility are referred to as the “Credit Facilities.” The Company may generally prepay outstanding loans under the Credit Facilities at any time, without prepayment premium or penalty, subject to customary “breakage” costs with respect to LIBOR rate loans.
We made a prepayment of $55 million and a total prepayment of $100.0 million during the three and nine months ended June 30, 2019, respectively.
The Revolving Credit Facility requires that the Company maintain a maximum first lien secured net leverage ratio, as defined in the Credit Agreement, of 4.00 to 1.00 as of the last day of each fiscal quarter if any revolving loans are outstanding, commencing with the first full fiscal quarter after the Acquisition Date.
Additionally, the Credit Agreement contains certain affirmative and negative covenants that limit the ability of the Company, among other things and subject to certain significant exceptions, to incur debt or liens, make investments, enter into certain mergers, consolidations, asset sales and acquisitions, pay dividends and make other restricted payments and enter into transactions with affiliates.
The Credit Agreement also contains customary affirmative covenants and events of default.
We believe we are in compliance with these covenants.
In the second quarter of fiscal 2019, we entered into a floating-to-fixed interest rate swap agreement to hedge the variability in our LIBOR-based interest payments on approximately 70% of our Team Loan balance.
See Note 10 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements of this Report on Form 10-Q for additional information regarding the Credit Agreement.
In January 2016, our Board of Directors authorized an increase in the amount available under our share repurchase program from the previously remaining $75.0 million to $150.0 million.
As of June 30, 2019, $76.3 million remained available under our share repurchase program.
Share repurchases are made from time to time, depending on market and other conditions.
The timing, manner, price and amounts of repurchases are determined at the Company's discretion, and the share repurchase program may be suspended, terminated or modified at any time for any reason.
The repurchase program does not obligate the Company to acquire any specific number of shares.
Repurchases are subject to SEC regulations as well as certain conditions specified in the plan.
Our Board of Directors authorized the initiation of our regular quarterly cash dividend program in January 2016, and since that time has increased the dividend, to its current quarterly level of $0.42 per share.
The declaration and payment of future dividends is subject to the discretion and determination of the Board of Directors and management, based on a variety of factors, and the program may be suspended, terminated or modified at any time for any reason.
As of June 30, 2019, we had $168.7 million of cash and cash equivalents, $118.4 million of which was held in foreign subsidiaries.
See Part II, Item 1A entitled “Risk Factors” of this Report on Form 10-Q for additional discussion of our foreign operations.
We believe that our current balance of cash, cash generated by our operations, cash repatriation to the United States, and available borrowing capacity under our Credit Facilities will be sufficient to fund our operations, expected capital expenditures, dividend payments, and share repurchases for at least the next twelve months.
However, in pursuit of corporate development or other initiatives, we may need to raise additional funds in the future through equity or debt financing, or other arrangements.
Depending on future conditions in the capital and credit markets, we could encounter difficulty securing additional financing in the type or amount necessary to pursue these objectives.
OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS
At June 30, 2019 and September 30, 2018, we did not have any unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships, such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities, which might have been established for the purpose of facilitating off-balance sheet arrangements.
INDEX
TABULAR DISCLOSURE OF CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS
The following summarizes our contractual obligations at June 30, 2019, and the effect such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flows in future periods.

INDEX
SUPPLEMENTAL UNAUDITED PRO FORMA CONDENSED COMBINED FINANCIAL INFORMATION
The following Unaudited Pro Forma Condensed Combined Financial Information is presented to illustrate the estimated effects of the company’s acquisition of KMG (the “Acquisition”), which was consummated on November 15, 2018 (the “Acquisition Date”), based on the historical results of operations of Cabot Microelectronics and KMG.
See Note 1, Background and Basis of Presentation, and Note 4, Business Combination, to the consolidated financial statements for additional information on the Acquisition.
The following Unaudited Pro Forma Condensed Combined Statements of Income for the three and nine months ended June 30, 2019 and 2018 are based on the historical financial statements of Cabot Microelectronics and KMG after giving effect to the Acquisition, and the assumptions and adjustments described in the accompanying notes to these Unaudited Pro Forma Condensed Combined Statements of Income.
The historical Cabot Microelectronics Consolidated Statements of Income for the three and nine months ended June 30, 2019 and 2018 were derived from the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Form 10-Q.
The historical KMG Consolidated Statements of Income for the nine months ended June 30, 2019, as well as the historical KMG Consolidated Statements of Income for the three and nine months ended June 30, 2018 includes information derived from KMG’s books and records.
Prior to the Acquisition, KMG was on a July 31st fiscal year end reporting cycle.
These pro forma financials include actual KMG’s pre-Acquisition results with the months aligned to Cabot Microelectronics’ fiscal periods, and therefore, they do not align with consolidated financial statements included in KMG’s Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q.
• Application of the acquisition method of accounting;
• Elimination of transaction costs incurred in connection with the Acquisition;
• Adjustments to reflect the new financing arrangements entered into and legacy financing arrangements retired in connection with the Acquisition;
• The exchange of 0.2000 share(s) of Cabot Microelectronics common stock for each share of KMG common stock; and
• Conformance of accounting policies.
The Unaudited Pro Forma Condensed Combined Financial Information was prepared using the acquisition method of accounting, which requires, among other things, that assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination be recognized at their fair values as of the completion of the acquisition.
We utilized estimated fair values at the Acquisition Date to allocate the total consideration exchanged to the net tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed.
This allocation was initially completed as of November 15, 2018.
The allocation may be adjusted for up to one-year post closing.
The Unaudited Pro Forma Condensed Combined financial information has been prepared on the basis of SEC Regulation S-X Article 11 and is not necessarily indicative of the results of operations that would have been realized had the transactions been completed as of the dates indicated, nor are they meant to be indicative of our anticipated combined future results.
In addition, the accompanying Unaudited Pro Forma Condensed Combined Statements of Income do not reflect any additional anticipated synergies, operating efficiencies, cost savings, or any integration costs that may result from the Acquisition.
The historical consolidated financial information has been adjusted in the accompanying Unaudited Pro Forma Condensed Combined Statements of Income to give effect to unaudited pro forma events that are (1) directly attributable to the transaction, (2) factually supportable and (3) are expected to have a continuing impact on the results of operations of the combined company.
As a result, under SEC Regulation S-X Article 11, certain non-recurring expenses such as deal costs and compensation expenses related to severance or accelerated stock compensation and certain non-cash costs related to the fair value step-up of inventory are eliminated from pro forma results in the periods presented.
Certain recurring historical KMG expenses related to depreciation, amortization, financing costs and costs of sales have been adjusted as if the Acquisition had occurred on October 1, 2017.
In contrast, under the ASC 805 presentation in Note 4, Business Combination, to the consolidated financial statements, these expenses are required to be included in prior year pro forma results.

Summary of Pro Forma Adjustments
INDEX
We calculated the income tax effect of the pro forma adjustments using a 22.1% and 23.4% tax rate, which represent the weighted average statutory tax rate for nine-month period ended June 30, 2019 and year-ended September 30, 2018, respectively.
Additionally, for the 2018 periods presented, we calculated the unaudited pro forma weighted average number of basic shares outstanding by adding the Cabot Microelectronics weighted average number of basic shares outstanding from the share amounts disclosed in the historical Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q to the amount of shares issued in connection with the Acquisition, as if the shares were held for the entire period.
We calculated the unaudited pro forma weighted average number of diluted shares outstanding by adding the number of shares issued in the Acquisition to the amount disclosed in the historical Cabot Microelectronics Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.
The basic and diluted EPS calculation takes pro forma net income divided by the applicable number of shares outstanding.

•Removal of integration expenses, as they are non-recurring in nature.
•Adjustment for U.S. Tax Reform, which represents a significant non-recurring item affecting comparability among periods.
•Removal of certain costs related to a warehouse fire at KMG-Bernuth.
