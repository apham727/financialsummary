We assume no obligation to update this forward-looking information.
The section entitled "Risk Factors" describes some, but not all, of the factors that could cause these differences.
 SECOND QUARTER OF FISCAL 2018 OVERVIEW
 In our second quarter of fiscal 2018, we experienced continued strong demand for our products, particularly for memory applications.
This was driven in part by our memory customers' migration from 2D to 3D NAND.
Additionally, continued capacity expansions in 3D NAND are underway, primarily in Korea and China, which should also continue to provide growth opportunities for us in the future.
In the advanced logic and foundry segments, we believe that new applications in mobile, artificial intelligence (or AI), and blockchain will continue to drive demand for advanced logic semiconductors going forward.
In addition, the legacy logic and foundry area of the industry continues to benefit from growth in automotive, internet of things, and industrial automation applications and connectivity requirements, which in turn could drive increasing demand for our products.
We believe we remain well positioned to benefit from these long-term demand trends.
However, there are many factors that make it difficult for us to predict future revenue trends for our business, including those discussed in Part II, Item 1A entitled "Risk Factors" in this Report on Form 10-Q.
The enactment of the Tax Act in the United States in December 2017 facilitated the Company's repatriation of a substantial amount of its non-U.S. cash and available-for-sale securities during the second quarter of fiscal 2018 and following the end of the quarter in early April.
In April 2018, the Company paid off its existing Term Loan utilizing a portion of this repatriated cash.
Revenue for our second quarter of fiscal 2018 was $143.0 million, which represented an increase of 20.0% from the second quarter of fiscal 2017, with revenue in dielectrics slurries and polishing pads product areas increasing 24.0% and 22.6% from the same quarter last year, respectively.
Revenue from tungsten slurries increased 16.6% from the same quarter last year.
Revenue for the first six month of fiscal 2018 was $283.0 million, which represented an increase of 16.7% from the comparable period of fiscal 2017.
INDEX
Gross profit for the second quarter of fiscal 2018 expressed as a percentage of revenue was 52.5%, compared to 50.4% for our second quarter of fiscal 2017, including 90 and 100-basis point of adverse impact of NexPlanar amortization expense, comparatively.
Factors affecting our gross profit for the quarter compared to last year included higher sales volume and a higher-valued product mix, partially offset by higher fixed manufacturing costs, including higher incentive compensation expense.
Gross profit for the first six months of fiscal 2018 was 52.7% of revenue, compared to 50.1% during the same period last year, which includes 90 and 100-basis points of adverse impact of NexPlanar amortization expense, comparatively.
We currently expect our gross profit margin for the full fiscal year 2018 to be between 51% and 53%, an increase from our prior full year guidance range of 50% to 52%.
This includes approximately 100 basis points of NexPlanar amortization expense.
We may continue to experience fluctuations in our gross profit due to a number of factors, including changes in our product mix and the extent to which we utilize our manufacturing capacity, which may cause our quarterly gross profit to be above or below this annual guidance range.
Operating expenses were $38.0 million in our second quarter of fiscal 2018 compared to $36.1 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2017, both periods of which included $0.5 million in NexPlanar amortization expense.
The increase in operating expenses from the comparable quarter of fiscal 2017 was primarily due to higher incentive compensation and annual merit increases.
Operating expenses were $74.9 million in the first six months of fiscal 2018 compared to $69.5 million during the same period of fiscal 2017, both periods of which included $1.0 million in NexPlanar amortization expense.
We currently expect operating expenses for full fiscal year 2018 to be between $148.0 million and $153.0 million, an increase from our prior full year guidance range of $145.0 million to $150.0 million.
This includes approximately $1.9 million of NexPlanar amortization expense.
We may continue to experience fluctuations in our operating expenses due to a number of factors, including changes in staffing-related expenses, including Short-Term Incentive Program ("STIP") costs, which may cause our operating expenses for the full fiscal year 2018 to be above or below this guidance range.
The Company reported diluted earnings per share of $1.14 in the second quarter of fiscal 2018, compared to diluted earnings per share of $0.71 in the same quarter last year.
The increase was primarily due to higher revenue and a higher gross profit margin, partially offset by higher operating expenses.
Diluted earnings per share were $1.02 for the first six months of fiscal 2018, compared to $1.60 during the same period last year.
The year-over-year decrease was primarily due to the impact of the enactment of the Tax Act in December 2017, which reduced diluted earnings per share by $1.27.
CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES AND EFFECTS OF RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS
We discuss our critical accounting estimates and effects of recent accounting pronouncements in "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" included in Item 7 of Part II of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2017.
There have been no material changes in our critical accounting estimates during the first six months of fiscal 2018.
See Note 17 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements of this Report on Form 10-Q for a discussion of new accounting pronouncements.

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2018, VERSUS THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2017
REVENUE
Revenue was $143.0 million for the three months ended March 31, 2018, which represented a 20.0%, or $23.8 million, increase from the three months ended March 31, 2017.
The increase in revenue was primarily driven by a $14.3 million increase due to higher sales volume, a $8.3 million increase due to product mix, and a $2.4 million increase due to foreign exchange fluctuations, partially offset by a $1.3 million decrease due to price changes.
The increase in sales volume was consistent with continued overall strong demand conditions in the global semiconductor industry.
Revenue from our tungsten slurries, dielectrics slurries and polishing pads increased 16.6%, 24.0% and 22.6%, respectively, from the comparable period of fiscal 2017.
COST OF GOODS SOLD
Total cost of goods sold was $68.0 million for the three months ended March 31, 2018, which represented an increase of 14.8%, or $8.8 million, from the three months ended March 31, 2017.
The increase in cost of goods sold was primarily driven by a $3.4 million increase due to higher sales volume, a $2.3 million increase in fixed manufacturing costs, including higher incentive compensation expense, a $1.5 million increase due to foreign exchange fluctuations, and a $0.9 million increase in other variable manufacturing costs, including material costs.
Fixed manufacturing costs included $1.3 million of NexPlanar amortization expense compared to $1.2 million in same period of fiscal 2017.
GROSS PROFIT
Our gross profit as a percentage of revenue was 52.5% for the three months ended March 31, 2018, compared to 50.4% for the three months ended March 31, 2017.
The increase in gross profit as a percentage of revenue was primarily due to higher sales volume, a higher-valued product mix and lower variable production costs, partially offset by higher fixed manufacturing costs, including costs associated with incentive compensation expense.
RESEARCH, DEVELOPMENT AND TECHNICAL
Total research, development and technical expenses were $13.4 million for the three months ended March 31, 2018, which represented a decrease of 5.1%, or $0.7 million, from the three months ended March 31, 2017.
The decrease was primarily due to lower materials and supplies used in research and development of $0.5 million, lower professional expenses of $0.3 million, and lower depreciation and amortization expense of $0.2 million, partially offset by higher wafers costs of $0.3 million.
  ·   Research related to fundamental CMP technology;
  ·   Development of new and enhanced CMP consumable products, including collaboration on joint development projects with technology-leading customers and suppliers;
  ·   Process development to support rapid and effective commercialization of new products;
  ·   Technical support of CMP products in our customers' research, development and manufacturing facilities; and,
  ·   Development of polishing and metrology applications outside of the semiconductor industry.
SELLING AND MARKETING
Selling and marketing expenses were $6.8 million for the three months ended March 31, 2018, which represented a decrease of 6.6%, or $0.5 million, from the three months ended March 31, 2017.
The decrease was primarily due to lower staffing-related costs of $0.3 million.
INDEX
GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE
General and administrative expenses were $17.8 million for the three months ended March 31, 2018, which represented an increase of 21.1%, or $3.1 million, from the three months ended March 31, 2017.
The increase was primarily due to higher staffing-related expenses of $1.5 million, including STIP costs, higher long-term incentive compensation expenses of $0.7 million, and higher information technology expenses of $0.6 million.
INTEREST EXPENSE
Interest expense was $1.2 million for the three months ended March 31, 2018, and was comparable to $1.1 million for the three months ended March 31, 2017.
As of March 31, 2018, the interest rate on 50% of our outstanding debt continues to be fixed through interest rate swaps, while we maintain a variable interest rate on the rest of our outstanding debt.
This Term Loan was subsequently paid off in April 2018.
See Note 18 of this Report on Form 10-Q for more information.
OTHER INCOME, NET
Other income was $1.1 million for the three months ended March 31, 2018, which represented an increase of 353.8%, or $0.8 million, from the three months ended March 31, 2017.
The increase was primarily due to $1.0 million gain on the sale of certain ESF assets in the second quarter of fiscal 2018 and higher interest income of $0.6 million resulting from higher investment balances and higher average interest rates, partially offset by higher foreign exchange loss of $0.4 million in the three months ended March 31, 2018 compared to the same period of fiscal 2017.
PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES
The Company's effective tax rate for the second quarter of fiscal 2018 was 19.6 percent, compared to 20.8 percent in the same quarter last year.
The decrease is primarily driven by the decrease in our U.S. corporate income tax rate as a result of the Tax Act, and benefit from stock option exercises recorded in the income statement beginning October 2017, and partially offset by the absence of benefits of a tax holiday in South Korea, which expired as of October 2017.
The Company continues to expect its effective tax rate for the remainder quarters to be within the range of 21 to 24 percent.
Previously, before the impact of the Tax Act, the Company had estimated an effective tax rate of 24 to 27 percent for the full fiscal year.
See Note 14 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements of this Report on Form 10-Q for more information on our income taxes.
NET INCOME
Net income was $29.7 million for the three months ended March 31, 2018, which represented an increase of 62.7%, or $11.5 million, from the three months ended March 31, 2017.
The significant increase was primarily due to higher revenue and higher gross profit margin, partially offset by higher operating expenses.
SIX MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2018, VERSUS SIX MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2017
REVENUE
Revenue was $283.0 million for the six months ended March 31, 2018, which represented a 16.7%, or $40.5 million, increase from the six months ended March 31, 2017.
The increase in revenue was primarily driven by a $27.3 million increase due to higher sales volume, a $14.1 million increase due to product mix, and a $2.3 million increase due to exchange rate fluctuations, partially offset by a $3.2 million decrease due to price changes.
Revenue from tungsten slurries, dielectrics slurries and polishing pads increased 15.1%, 16.0%, and 19.6%, respectively, from the comparable period of fiscal 2017.

RESEARCH, DEVELOPMENT AND TECHNICAL
Total research, development and technical expenses were $25.5 million for the six months ended March 31, 2018, which represented a decrease of 7.2%, or $2.0 million, from the six months ended March 31, 2017.
The decrease was primarily due to lower professional expenses of $0.7 million, lower depreciation and amortization expense of $0.6 million, and lower materials and supplies used in research and development of $0.6 million.
SELLING AND MARKETING
Selling and marketing expenses were $12.6 million for the six months ended March 31, 2018, which represented a decrease of 14.8%, or $2.2 million, from the six months ended March 31, 2017.
The decrease was primarily due to lower staffing-related costs of $1.1 million, lower severance expense of $0.7 million, and lower information technology expenses of $0.4 million.
GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE
General and administrative expenses were $36.7 million for the six months ended March 31, 2018, which represented an increase of 35.0%, or $9.5 million, from the six months ended March 31, 2017.

Other income was $1.7 million for the six months ended March 31, 2018, which represented an increase of 41.0%, or $0.5 million, from the six months ended March 31, 2017.
The increase was primarily due to $1.0 million gain on the sale of certain ESF assets in the second quarter of fiscal 2018, and higher interest income of $1.2 million resulting from higher investment balances and higher average interest rates, partially offset by foreign exchange loss in the first six months ended March 31, 2018 compared to foreign exchange gain in the comparable period of fiscal 2017.
INDEX
PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES
Our effective income tax rate was 63.8% for the six months ended March 31, 2018 compared to 20.5% for the six months ended March 31, 2017.
The increase in the effective tax rate during the first six months of fiscal 2018 was primarily due to the one-time unfavorable impact of the Tax Act that occurred in the first quarter of fiscal 2018 and the absence of benefits of a tax holiday in South Korea, which expired as of October 2017, partially offset by the benefit from stock option exercises beginning October 2017.
NET INCOME
Net income was $26.7 million for the six months ended March 31, 2018, which represented a decrease of 34.2%, or $13.9 million, from the six months ended March 31, 2017.
The decrease was primarily due to the one-time effect of the Tax Act of $32.9 million that occurred in the first quarter of fiscal 2018, partially offset by higher revenue and a higher gross profit margin.
LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES
We generated $67.1 million in cash flows from operating activities in the first six months of fiscal 2018, compared to $57.9 million in cash from operating activities in the first six months of fiscal 2017.
Our cash provided by operating activities in the first six months of fiscal 2018 reflected net income of $26.7 million, $58.4 million in non-cash items, including $24.6 million related to the deemed repatriation transition tax of the Tax Act, and a $18.0 million decrease in cash flow due to a net increase in working capital.
The increase in cash flows from operating activities compared to the first six months of fiscal 2017 was primarily due to higher revenue and gross margin, and also reflected the non-cash impacts of the Tax Act, and changes in the timing and amount of accrued expense payments, including payments related to our STIP, and a higher accounts receivable balance at March 31, 2018, due to an increase in revenue.
We are still analyzing certain aspects of the Tax Act, which could potentially affect the measurement of these balances or give rise to new deferred tax amounts.
Our accruals for incentive compensation under our STIP are higher in fiscal 2018 than in fiscal 2017.
In addition, the STIP payment in the first quarter of fiscal 2018 related to our performance in fiscal 2017 was $14.1 million higher than the STIP payment related to our performance in fiscal 2016, which was paid in the first quarter of fiscal 2017.
 In the first six months of fiscal 2018, cash flows used in investing activities were $5.9 million, representing $50.7 million in purchases of investments designated as available-for-sale securities under a managed investment arrangement that were offset by $50.5 million in proceeds upon the subsequent sale of these investments, property, plant and equipment additions of $8.8 million, and the sale of certain ESF assets of $3.0 million.
In the first six months of fiscal 2017, cash flows used in investing activities were $11.6 million for purchases of property, plant and equipment.
We continue to expect our total capital expenditures in fiscal 2018 to be within the range of $18.0 million to $22.0 million.
In the first six months of fiscal 2018, cash flows used in financing activities were $8.6 million.
We used $10.2 million to pay dividends and dividend equivalents on our common stock, and $6.6 million to repay long-term debt.
We also used $3.4 million to repurchase common stock pursuant to the terms of our OIP for shares withheld from award recipients to cover payroll taxes on the vesting of restricted stock and restricted stock units granted under the OIP, and used $6.5 million to repurchase common stock under our share repurchase program.
We received $18.1 million from the issuance of common stock related to the exercise of stock options granted under our EIP and OIP, and for the sale of shares to employees under our ESPP.
The tax benefit of $6.0 million in the first six months of fiscal 2018 related to exercises of stock options under the EIP and OIP, and vesting of restricted stock and restricted stock units awarded under the OIP is now presented in the operating activities section of the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows pursuant to the adoption of ASU 2016-09.
In the first six months of fiscal 2017, cash flows provided by financing activities were $12.2 million.
We received $24.8 million from the issuance of common stock related to the exercise of stock options granted under our EIP and OIP, and for the sale of shares to employees under our ESPP, and we received $5.2 million in tax benefits related to exercises of stock options and vesting of restricted stock and restricted stock units granted under the EIP and OIP.
We used $2.3 million to repurchase common stock under our share repurchase program and $2.1 million to repurchase common stock pursuant to the terms of our OIP for shares withheld from award recipients to cover payroll taxes on the vesting of restricted stock and restricted stock units granted under these plans.
We also paid $8.9 million in dividends and dividend equivalents on our common stock, and $4.4 million to repay long-term debt.
INDEX
In January 2016, our Board of Directors authorized an increase in the amount available under our share repurchase program from the previously remaining $75.0 million to $150.0 million.
Under this program, we repurchased 65,978 shares for $6.6 million during the first six months of fiscal 2018 and we repurchased 36,978 shares for $2.3 million during the first six months of fiscal 2017.
As of March 31, 2018, approximately $115.4 million remained outstanding under our share repurchase program.
Share repurchases are made from time to time, depending on market and other conditions.
The timing, manner, price and amounts of repurchases are determined at the Company's discretion, and the share repurchase program may be suspended, terminated or modified at any time for any reason.
The repurchase program does not obligate the Company to acquire any specific number of shares.
To date, we have funded share purchases under our share repurchase program from our available cash balance, and anticipate we will continue to do so.
Periodically, we also continue the "10b5-1" stock purchase plan agreements with independent brokers to repurchase shares of our common stock in accordance with guidelines pursuant to Rule 10b5-1 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.
A plan under Rule 10b5-1 allows a company to repurchase its shares at times when it otherwise might be prevented from doing so under insider trading laws or because of self-imposed trading blackout periods.
Repurchases are subject to SEC regulations as well as certain conditions specified in the plan.
In January 2016, we announced that our Board of Directors authorized the initiation of a regular dividend program under which the Company intends to pay quarterly cash dividends on our common stock.
Pursuant to this announcement, our Board of Directors declared quarterly cash dividends of $0.18 per share, during the second, third, and fourth quarters of fiscal 2016, and during the first quarter of fiscal 2017.
Starting in the second quarter of fiscal 2017, our Board of Directors declared quarterly cash dividends of $0.20 per share in the second, third and fourth quarters of fiscal 2017.
Starting in the second quarter of fiscal 2018, our Board of Directors declared quarterly cash dividends of $0.40 per share, the latest of which we paid in April 2018.
The declaration and payment of future dividends is subject to the discretion and determination of the Company's Board of Directors and management, based on a variety of factors, and the program may be suspended, terminated or modified at any time for any reason.
As of March 31, 2018, we had $461.4 million of cash and cash equivalents, $296.3 million of which was held in foreign subsidiaries.
In April 2018, a significant portion of the non-U.S. cash was repatriated to the United States.
See Part II, Item 1A entitled "Risk Factors" in this Report on Form 10-Q for additional discussion of our foreign operations.
We believe that our current balance of cash, cash generated by our operations, cash repatriation to the United States enabled by the Tax Act, and available borrowing capacity under our Credit Facilities will be sufficient to fund our operations, expected capital expenditures, merger and acquisition activities, dividend payments, and share repurchases for at least the next twelve months.
However, in pursuit of corporate development or other initiatives, we may need to raise additional funds in the future through equity or debt financing, or other arrangements.
Depending on future conditions in the capital and credit markets, we could encounter difficulty securing additional financing in the type or amount necessary to pursue these objectives.
INDEX
OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS
At March 31, 2018 and September 30, 2017, we did not have any unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships, such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities, which might have been established for the purpose of facilitating off-balance sheet arrangements.
INDEX
TABULAR DISCLOSURE OF CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS
The following summarizes our contractual obligations at March 31, 2018, and the effect such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flows in future periods.
We have been operating under a multi-year supply agreement with Cabot Corporation, which is not a related party and has not been one since 2002, for the purchase of fumed silica, the current term of which runs through December 31, 2019.
This agreement provides us the option to purchase fumed silica with no minimum purchase requirements as of 2017, for which we have paid a fee of $1.5 million in each of calendar years 2017 and 2018, and for which we will pay the same in 2019.
The purchase obligation in the table above reflect management's expectation that we will meet our forecasted quantities in calendar 2018 and beyond.
Purchase obligations include an aggregate amount of $1.5 million of contractual commitments related to our Cabot Corporation supply agreement for fumed silica.
The $1.5 million payment for calendar 2019 is included in accrued liabilities on our Consolidated Balance Sheets as of March 31, 2018.
  Interest payments on long-term debt reflect interest rates in effect at March 31, 2018.
The interest payments reflect variable LIBOR-based rates currently in effect on $68.9 million of our outstanding debt, and fixed interest rates on $68.9 million of outstanding debt for which we have implemented interest rate swaps.
Commitment fees are based on our estimated consolidated leverage ratio in future periods.
On April 6, 2018, the Company paid off the remaining outstanding Term Loan balance.
