Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates
Net Revenues
•Advanced Products include our recent product offerings and include the UltraScale+, UltraScale and 7-series product families.
•Core Products include all other product families.
These product categories are modified on a periodic basis to better reflect the maturity of the products and advances in technology.
The most recent modification was made on April 3, 2016, which was the beginning of our fiscal year 2017, whereby we reclassified our product categories to be consistent with how these categories are analyzed and reviewed internally.
Specifically, we grouped the products manufactured at the 28nm, 20nm and 16nm nodes into a category named Advanced Products while all other products are included in a category named Core Products.
Net revenues of $631.2 million in the third quarter of fiscal year 2018 represented an 8% increase from the comparable prior year period of $585.7 million.
Net revenues from Advanced Products increased 30% in the third quarter of fiscal year 2018 versus the comparable prior year period, but the declines from our Core Products partially offset the increase.
No end customer accounted for more than 10% of our net revenues for the third quarter and the first nine months of fiscal years 2018 and 2017.
For the first nine months of fiscal year 2018, approximately 52% of our net revenues were from products sold to distributors for subsequent resale to original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) or their subcontract manufacturers.
As of December 30, 2017, we had $48.0 million of deferred revenue and $15.0 million of deferred cost of revenues recognized as a net $33.0 million of deferred income on shipments to distributors.
As of April 1, 2017, we had $74.2 million of deferred revenue and $19.6 million of deferred cost of revenues recognized as a net $54.6 million of deferred income on shipments to distributors.
The deferred income on shipments to distributors that will ultimately be recognized in our condensed consolidated statements of income will be different than the amount shown on the condensed consolidated balance sheets due to actual price adjustments issued to the distributors when the product is sold to their end customers.
Net Revenues by Product
Net revenues from Advanced Products increased significantly in both the third quarter and the first nine months of fiscal year 2018 compared to the comparable prior year periods.
The increases for both periods were a result of sales growth from our 20nm, 16nm and, to a lesser extent, our 28nm product families.
We expect sales of Advanced Products to continue to grow as more customer programs enter into volume production with our 28nm, 20nm and 16nm products.
Net revenues from Core Products decreased in both the third quarter and the first nine months of fiscal year 2018 from the comparable prior year periods.
For both the third quarter and the first nine months of fiscal year 2018, the decreases were largely due to decline in sales of our Virtex-5 and, to a lesser extent, our Spartan-3 and Virtex-6 product families.
Net Revenues by End Markets
Net Revenues by Geography
Net revenues in Asia Pacific increased in both the third quarter and the first nine months of fiscal year 2018 from the comparable prior year periods.
The increases were primarily due to higher sales from consumer, primarily in China.
Gross Margin
Gross margin was higher by 1.5 percentage points in the third quarter of fiscal year 2018 compared to the same period last year, but remained flat for the first nine months of fiscal year 2018.
The increase in the third quarter of fiscal year 2018 was due to favorable changes in end market mix, as the revenue mix shifted away from wireless, which generally has lower margin.
Gross margin may be affected in the future due to multiple factors, including but not limited to those set forth in "Item 1A.
Risk Factors" included in Part II of this Form 10-Q, shifts in the mix of customers and products, competitive-pricing pressure, manufacturing-yield issues and wafer pricing.
We expect to mitigate any adverse impacts from these factors by continuing to improve yields on our Advanced Products, improve manufacturing efficiencies, and improve average selling price management.
Advanced Products generally have lower gross margins than Core Products as they are in the early stages of their product life cycle and have higher unit costs associated with relatively lower volumes and early manufacturing maturity.
In order to compete effectively, we pass manufacturing cost reductions to our customers in the form of reduced prices to the extent that we can maintain acceptable margins.
Price erosion is common in the semiconductor industry, as advances in both product architecture and manufacturing process technology permit continual reductions in unit cost.
We have historically been able to offset much of this revenue decline in our Core Products with increased revenues from Advanced Products.
Research and Development
Selling, General and Administrative
Amortization of Acquisition-Related Intangibles
Amortization expense for both the third quarter and the first nine months of fiscal year 2018 decreased from the comparable prior year periods as certain intangibles were fully amortized by fiscal year 2018.
Stock-Based Compensation
Stock-based compensation expense increased in both the third quarter and the first nine months of fiscal year 2018 from the comparable prior year periods.
The increases were primarily related to higher expenses associated with RSUs granted in the recent quarters, as more RSUs were granted, and were granted at a higher fair value.
Interest and Other Income (Expense), Net
Our net interest and other income (expense) increased in both the third quarter and the first nine months of fiscal year 2018 from the comparable prior year periods.
The increases were primarily due to higher interest income from the investment portfolio, and to a lesser extent lower interest expenses from 2024 Notes and its related interest rate swap contracts as compared to the total interest expenses recognized from the 2017 Convertible Notes that matured in the first quarter of fiscal 2018.
Provision for Income Taxes
On December 22, 2017, the TCJA was enacted into law.
The TCJA provides for numerous significant tax law changes and modifications including the reduction of the U.S. federal corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21%, the requirement for companies to pay a one-time transition tax on earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries that were previously tax deferred and the creation of new taxes on certain foreign-sourced earnings.
As a fiscal year-end taxpayer, certain provisions of the TCJA began to impact us in our third quarter of fiscal year 2018, while other provisions will impact us beginning in fiscal year 2019.
The corporate tax rate reduction is effective as of January 1, 2018.
Since the Company has a fiscal year rather than a calendar year, it is subject to rules relating to transitional tax rates.
As a result, our fiscal year 2018 federal statutory rate will be a blended rate of 31.5%.
The change in the statutory tax rate from 35% to 31.5% for our fiscal year 2018 does not have a significant impact on the effective tax rate.
The difference between this blended U.S. federal statutory tax rate of 31.5% and our effective tax rate in all periods of fiscal year 2018 was primarily due to the one-time transition tax net of the reversal of the related deferred tax liabilities as discussed in “Note 14.
Income Taxes” to our condensed consolidated financial statements, included in “Part I.
Financial Information.”
The difference between the U.S. federal statutory tax rate of 35% and our effective tax rate in all periods of fiscal year 2017 was primarily due to income earned in lower tax rate jurisdictions for which no U.S. income tax had been provided, as we intended to permanently reinvest the earnings outside of the U.S.
The increases in the effective tax rates in the third quarter and first nine months of fiscal year 2018 from the comparable prior year periods were primarily due to the one-time transition tax of $582.8 million (including state liabilities), a remeasurement of certain deferred tax assets and liabilities as a result of the reduction in the corporate income tax rate to 21% in the amount of $26.2 million and a release of reserves for uncertain tax positions in fiscal year 2017.
The increases in the effective tax rate were partially offset by the reversal of deferred tax liabilities related to the portion of U.S. income tax on unremitted foreign earnings that had been accrued through the second quarter of fiscal year 2018 in the amount of $424.3 million.
As of December 30, 2017, we recognized provisional amounts for the tax effects of the TCJA which were included as components of income tax expense from continuing operations and reflected in the effective tax rates above.
We will continue to assess the impact of the recently enacted tax law on our business and our consolidated financial statements.
The final impact of the TCJA recorded by us may vary materially from the provisional impact recorded due to a number of uncertainties and factors, including information not available until the completion of our consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ending March 31, 2018, the need for further guidance and clarification of the new law by U.S. federal and state tax authorities and the need for further guidance on the income tax accounting.
In addition to the impacts of tax reform on fiscal year 2018 previously discussed, the TCJA also establishes new tax laws that will be effective for our fiscal year 2019 year, including, but not limited to, (1) a new provision designed to tax low-taxed income of foreign subsidiaries, which allows for the possibility of using foreign tax credits (FTCs) and a deduction of up to 50 percent to offset the income tax liability (subject to some limitations); (2) limitations on the deductibility of certain executive compensation; (3) limitations on the deductibility of entertainment expenses; and (4) limitations on the use of FTCs to reduce the U.S. income tax liability.
While each of these provisions is expected to have an impact on our tax expense for fiscal year 2019 and future periods, we expect the tax on low-taxed income of foreign subsidiaries to have the most significant impact.
Because of the complexity of the new tax on low-taxed income of foreign subsidiaries, we are continuing to evaluate this provision of the TCJA and the application of ASC 740.
Based on recent FASB deliberations, it appears we will be allowed to make an accounting policy choice of either (1) treating taxes due on future U.S. inclusions in taxable income as a current-period expense when incurred or (2) factoring such amounts into a company’s measurement of its deferred taxes.
Our selection of an accounting policy will depend, in part, on analyzing our facts to determine what the impact is expected to be under each method.
Financial Condition, Liquidity and Capital Resources
We have historically used a combination of cash flows from operations and equity as well as debt financing to support ongoing business activities, acquire or invest in critical or complementary technologies, purchase facilities and capital equipment, repurchase our common stock and debentures under our repurchase program, pay dividends and finance working capital.
Additionally, our investments in debt securities are liquid and available for future business needs.
The combination of cash, cash equivalents as well as short-term and long-term investments as of December 30, 2017 and April 1, 2017 totaled $3.64 billion and $3.44 billion, respectively.
As of December 30, 2017, we had cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments of $3.54 billion and working capital of $3.74 billion.
As of April 1, 2017, cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments were $3.32 billion and working capital was $2.98 billion.
As of December 30, 2017, $3.20 billion of our $3.54 billion of cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments was held by our non-U.S. jurisdictions.
The recent TCJA that was signed into law on December 22, 2017 subjects U.S. companies to a one-time transition tax on total post-1986 earnings and profits of their foreign subsidiaries.
The TCJA also generally allows companies to repatriate these accumulated foreign earnings without incurring additional U.S. federal taxes beginning after December 31, 2017.
Accordingly, substantially all $3.20 billion of cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments held by our non-U.S. jurisdictions will be available for use in the U.S. without incurring additional U.S. federal income taxes.
The one-time transition tax liability will be payable in eight annual installments, as outlined in "Contractual Obligations" below.
See “Note 14.
Income Taxes” to our condensed consolidated financial statements, included in “Part I.
Financial Information,” for additional information about the one-time transition tax.
Operating Activities —During the first nine months of fiscal year 2018, our operations generated net positive cash flow of $577.7 million, which was $50.1 million lower than the $627.8 million generated during the first nine months of fiscal year 2017.
The net cash provided by operations during the first nine months of fiscal year 2018 was primarily from net income as adjusted for non-cash related items, a decrease in inventory as well as an increase in other accrued liabilities and income tax payable.
These items were partially offset by increases in accounts receivable, prepaid expenses and other assets as well as decreases in accounts payable.
Accounts receivable increased by $104.5 million to $348.5 million at December 30, 2017 compared to $243.9 million at April 1, 2017.
Days sales outstanding increased to 51 days at December 30, 2017 from 38 days at April 1, 2017, primarily due to timing of shipments and collections.
Our inventory levels as of December 30, 2017 were slightly lower at $226.5 million compared to $227.0 million at April 1, 2017, and combined inventory days at Xilinx and distribution decreased to 118 days at December 30, 2017 from 127 days at April 1, 2017.
Investing Activities —Net cash used in investing activities was $318.9 million during the first nine months of fiscal year 2018, as compared to net cash provided by investing activities of $362.6 million in the first nine months of fiscal year 2017.
Net cash used in investing activities during the first nine months of fiscal year 2018 consisted primarily of $272.1 million of net cash used in purchases of available-for-sale securities, $28.9 million net cash used in purchases of property, plant and equipment and $17.8 million used in other investing activities.
Financing Activities —Net cash used in financing activities was $314.1 million in the first nine months of fiscal year 2018, as compared to $654.7 million in the first nine months of fiscal year 2017.
Net cash used in financing activities during the first nine months of fiscal year 2018 consisted of $457.9 million of cash repayment for the 2017 Convertible Notes, $310.8 million cash payment to repurchase common stock, $263.8 million dividend payments to stockholders and $44.4 million of payment for RSU withholdings, which were partially offset by $745.2 million of proceeds from issuance of the 2024 Notes and $19.6 million of proceeds from issuance of common stock under employee stock plans.
Contractual Obligations
We lease some of our facilities, office buildings and land under non-cancelable operating leases that expire at various dates through April 2029.
See "Note 15.
Commitments" to our condensed consolidated financial statements, included in "Part I.
Financial Information," for a schedule of our operating lease commitments as of December 30, 2017 and additional information about operating leases.
Due to the nature of our business, we depend upon subcontractors to manufacture our silicon wafers and provide assembly and test services.
The lengthy subcontractor lead times require us to order the materials and services in advance, and we are obligated to pay for the materials and services when completed.
As of December 30, 2017, we had $157.5 million of outstanding inventory and other non-cancelable purchase obligations to subcontractors.
We expect to receive and pay for these materials and services in the next three to six months, as the products meet delivery and quality specifications.
As of December 30, 2017, we also had $27.2
On May 30, 2017, we issued $750.0 million principal amount of 2024 Notes with a maturity date on June 1, 2024.
The 2024 Notes were offered to the public at a discounted price of 99.887% of par.
Interest on the 2024 Notes is payable semi-annually on June 1 and December 1.
As of December 30, 2017, we had $750.0 million of the 2024 Notes outstanding.
We also had $500.0 million of 2019 Notes and $500.0 million of 2021 Notes outstanding as of December 30, 2017.
The 2019 Notes and 2021 Notes require payment of interest semiannually on March 15 and September 15.
See "Note 10.
Debt and Credit Facility" to our condensed consolidated financial statements, included in Part 1.
"Financial Information," for additional information about our debentures.
As of December 30, 2017, we had $531.5 million of liabilities classified as long-term income taxes payable in the condensed consolidated balance sheets.
Of the $531.5 million, $520.9 million was the estimated long-term portion of the one-time transition tax that resulted from the enactment of the TCJA, which will be payable in eight annual installments.
The first installment is classified as a current income tax payable.
The installment amounts will be equal to 8% of the total liability, payable in fiscal years 2019 through 2023, 15% in fiscal year 2024, 20% in fiscal year 2025, and 25% in fiscal year 2026.
See “Note 14.
Income Taxes” to our condensed consolidated financial statements, included in “Part I.
Financial Information,” for additional information about the one-time transition tax.
The remaining $10.6 million of the long-term income taxes payable is for uncertain tax positions and related interest and penalties.
Due to the inherent uncertainty with respect to the timing of future cash outflows associated with such liabilities, we are unable to reliably estimate the timing of cash settlement with the respective taxing authorities.
Off-Balance-Sheet Arrangements
As of December 30, 2017, we did not have any significant off-balance-sheet arrangements, as defined in Item 303(a)(4)(ii) of Regulation S-K.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
Cash generated from operations is used as our primary source of liquidity and capital resources.
Our investment portfolio is also available for future cash requirements as is our $400.0 million revolving credit facility that, upon certain conditions, may be extended by an additional $150.0 million, and was entered into in December 2016 (expiring in December 2021).
We are not aware of any lack of access to the revolving credit facility; however, we can provide no assurance that access to the credit facility will not be impacted by adverse conditions in the financial markets.
Our credit facility is not reliant upon a single bank.
There have been no borrowings to date under our existing revolving credit facility.
We anticipate that existing sources of liquidity and cash flows from operations will be sufficient to satisfy our cash needs for the foreseeable future.
We will continue to evaluate opportunities for investments to obtain additional wafer capacity, to procure additional capital equipment and facilities, to develop new products, and to potentially acquire technologies or businesses that could complement our business.
However, the risk factors discussed in "Item 1A.
Risk Factors" included in Part II of this Form 10-Q and below could affect our cash positions adversely.
Item 2.Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds
On May 16, 2016, the Board authorized 2016 Repurchase Program to repurchase of up to $1.00 billion of shares of our common stock and debentures.
The 2016 Repurchase Program has no stated expiration date.
Through December 30, 2017, we have used $628.7 million of the $1.00 billion authorized under the 2016 Repurchase Program, leaving $371.3 million available for future purchases.
Item 6.Exhibits
Items 3, 4 and 5 are not applicable and have been omitted.
