Item 2.Unregistered Sale of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds

On May 16, 2016, the Board authorized the 2016 Repurchase Program to repurchase up to $1.00 billion of the Company's common stock and debentures.
On May 16, 2018, the Board authorized the 2018 Repurchase Program to repurchase the Company's common stock and debentures up to $500.0 million.
The 2016 and 2018 Repurchase Programs have no stated expiration date.
Through June 29, 2019, we have fully utilized the entire amount authorized under the 2016 Repurchase Program and $266.7 million out of the $500.0 million authorized under the 2018 Repurchase Program, leaving $233.3 million available for future purchases.
During the first quarter of fiscal 2020, the Company entered into a stock repurchase agreement with an independent financial institution to repurchase shares under the 2018 Repurchase Program.
Under the agreement, the Company provided the financial institution with an up-front payment totaling $300.0 million and the financial institution agreed to deliver to the Company a certain number of shares based upon the volume weighted-average price, during an averaging period, less a specified discount.
Under this arrangement, Company received an initial 1.6 million shares of common stock during the first quarter of fiscal 2020 for $168.1 million (estimated based on volume-weighted average price up to June 29, 2019).
The initial shares received by the Company were retired, accounted for as a reduction to stockholders' equity in the condensed consolidated balance sheets and treated as a repurchase of common stock for purposes of calculating earnings per share.
The Company expects to receive additional shares and a portion of the remaining estimated $131.9 million back during the next quarter.
