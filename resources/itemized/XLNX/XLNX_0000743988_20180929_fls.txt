Item 2.Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations

The statements in this Management's Discussion and Analysis that are forward-looking, within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, involve numerous risks and uncertainties and are based on current expectations.
The reader should not place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements.
Our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements for many reasons, including those risks discussed under "Risk Factors" and elsewhere in this document.
Often, forward-looking statements can be identified by the use of forward-looking words, such as "may," "will," "could," "should," "expect," "believe," "anticipate," "estimate," "continue," "plan," "intend," "project" and other similar terminology, or the negative of such terms.
We disclaim any responsibility to update or revise any forward-looking statement provided in this Management's Discussion and Analysis for any reason.
Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates


Due to the acquisition of Deephi Tech, we included business combinations as our critical accounting policy.
We use the acquisition method of accounting and allocate the fair value of purchase consideration to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed in the acquiree based on their respective fair values as of the acquisition date.
In addition, difficulty in forecasting revenues compromises our ability to provide forward-looking revenue and earnings guidance.
