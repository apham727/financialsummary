Item 1A.Risk Factors

In addition to the other information set forth in this Form 10-Q, you should carefully consider the factors discussed in Part I, Item 1A.
Risk Factors in our 2018 Annual Report for the year ended March 31, 2018, which could materially affect our business, financial condition or future results and the following relating to our recently announced agreement to acquire Alpha.
The regulatory approvals and any other required approvals in connection with the Transaction may not be obtained on the proposed terms or on the anticipated schedule.
The completion of the Transaction will depend upon a number of conditions being satisfied, including, among others, obtaining all regulatory approvals required to complete the Transaction, including the expiration or early termination of the waiting periods under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended (the “HSR Act”) and any required foreign regulatory approvals, and the absence of any injunction prohibiting the Transaction and absence of any legal requirements enacted by a court or other governmental entity since the date of the Purchase Agreement that remain in effect prohibiting consummation of the Transaction.
We can provide no assurance that all required approvals will be obtained on the anticipated schedule, or at all.
The waiting period with respect to the notifications filed under the HSR Act expires 30 calendar days after such filings, unless otherwise extended or terminated.
The Federal Trade Commission ("FTC") or Department of Justice ("DOJ") may effectively extend the statutory waiting period by requesting additional information regarding the Transaction and its potential effects on competition.
Also, at any time before or after completion of the Transaction, the FTC or the DOJ could act under the antitrust laws to prevent a substantial lessening of competition or the creation of a monopoly, including by seeking to enjoin completion of the Transaction or seeking divestiture of our or Alpha’s assets, businesses or product lines.
