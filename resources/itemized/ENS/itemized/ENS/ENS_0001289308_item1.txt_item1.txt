Item 1A.Risk Factors


Future changes in U.S. tax law could adversely affect us or our affiliates.
On December 22, 2017, the U.S. President signed into law a sweeping tax reform bill known as the “Tax Cuts and Jobs Act” (“Tax Act”).
The effects of the Tax Act are not yet entirely clear and will depend on, among other things, additional regulatory and administrative guidance, as well as any statutory technical corrections that are subsequently enacted.
While the Tax Act reduces the statutory U.S. federal income tax rate generally applicable to U.S. corporations, the Tax Act could nevertheless have a significant adverse effect on the U.S. federal income taxation of our and our subsidiaries’ operations, including by limiting or eliminating various deductions or credits (including interest expense deductions and deductions relating to employee compensation), imposing taxes with respect to certain accumulated earnings of non-U.S. entities on a current basis, changing the timing of the recognition of income or its character and imposing additional corporate taxes under certain circumstances to combat perceived base erosion issues, among other changes.
The Tax Act, or any related, similar or amended legislation or other changes in U.S. federal income tax laws, could adversely affect the U.S. federal income taxation of our and our affiliates’ ongoing operations and may also adversely affect the integration efforts relating to, and potential synergies from, past strategic transactions.
Any such changes and related consequences could have a material adverse impact on our financial results.
