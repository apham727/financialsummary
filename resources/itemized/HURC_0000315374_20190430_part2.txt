PART II - OTHER INFORMATION 



 Item 1.LEGAL PROCEEDINGS 



From time to time, we are involved in claims and lawsuits arising in the normal course of business. Pursuant to applicable accounting rules, we accrue the minimum liability for each known claim when the estimated outcome is a range of possible loss and no one amount within that range is more likely than another. We maintain insurance policies for such matters, and we record insurance recoveries when we determine such recovery to be probable. We do not expect any of these claims, individually or in the aggregate, to have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position or results of operations. We believe that the ultimate resolution of claims for any losses will not exceed our insurance policy coverages. 



 Item 1A.RISK FACTORS 



There have been no material changes from the risk factors disclosed in Part I, Item 1A â€“ Risk Factors in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended October 31, 2018.
