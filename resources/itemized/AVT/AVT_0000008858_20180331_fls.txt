You can find many of these statements by looking for words like “believes,” “plans,” “expects,” “anticipates,” “should,” “will,” “may,” “estimates” or similar expressions in this Quarterly Report or in documents incorporated by reference in this Quarterly Report.
These forward-looking statements are subject to numerous assumptions, risks and uncertainties.
You should understand that the following important factors, in addition to those discussed elsewhere in this Quarterly Report and in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended July 1, 2017, could affect the Company’s future results of operations, and could cause those results or other outcomes to differ materially from those expressed or implied in the forward-looking statements:
 Any forward-looking statement speaks only as of the date on which that statement is made.
Except as required by law, the Company assumes no obligation to update any forward-looking statement to reflect events or circumstances that occur after the date on which the statement is made.
