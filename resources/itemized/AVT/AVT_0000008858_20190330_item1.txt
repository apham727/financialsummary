NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  



 1. Basis of presentation and new accounting pronouncements  



 In the opinion of management, the accompanying unaudited interim consolidated financial statements contain all adjustments necessary to present fairly Avnet, Inc.’s and its consolidated subsidiaries’ (collectively, the “Company” or “Avnet”) financial position, results of operations, comprehensive income and cash flows. All such adjustments are of a normal recurring nature.  



 The preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (“GAAP”) requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements. Actual results may differ from these estimates.  



 Interim results of operations are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for the full fiscal year. The information included in this Form 10-Q should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes included in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2018.  



 Certain reclassifications have been made in prior periods to conform to the current period presentation including reclassifications as a result of recently adopted accounting pronouncements.  



 Recently adopted accounting pronouncements  



 In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (the “FASB”) issued Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606) (“ASU 2014-09”, and collectively with its related subsequent amendments, “Topic 606”). Topic 606 supersedes previous revenue recognition guidance and requires the Company to recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the Company expects to be entitled in exchange for such goods or services. The Company adopted Topic 606 on July 1, 2018 using the modified retrospective transition method applied to those contracts which were not completed as of July 1, 2018. Under this transition method, the Company’s results in the consolidated statements of operations for the third quarter and nine months ended March 30, 2019 are presented under Topic 606, while the comparative results for the third quarter and nine months ended March 31, 2018 were not retrospectively adjusted, as such results were recognized in accordance with the revenue recognition policy discussed under Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in Note 1 of the Company’s Fiscal 2018 Annual Report on Form 10-K.  



 The adoption of Topic 606 did not have a material impact on the Company’s consolidated financial statements as of the adoption date and as of and for the nine months ended March 30, 2019. Substantially all of the Company’s sales continue to be recognized when products are shipped from the Company’s facilities or delivered to customers, depending on the underlying contractual terms. For a nominal portion of the Company’s contracts where the accounting did change, the adoption of Topic 606 resulted in an increase to the opening balance of retained earnings of $2.0 million as of July 1, 2018. This impact was primarily due to the acceleration of recognition of net sales and associated gross profit related to certain uncompleted contracts for the manufacture of goods with no alternative use and for which the Company has an enforceable right to payment, including a reasonable profit margin, from the customer for performance completed to date. For these contracts, the Company recognizes revenue over time as control of the goods transfers through the manufacturing process, rather than when the goods are delivered, title has transferred, and the risks and rewards of ownership are passed to the customer, as under previous revenue recognition guidance.  



 Refer to Note 2 herein for further discussion regarding revenue recognition and related accounting policies.  



 In March 2017, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2017-07, Compensation - Retirement Benefits (Topic 715)- Improving the Presentation of Net Periodic Cost and Net Periodic Postretirement Benefit Cost ("ASU No. 2017-07"). ASU No. 2017-07 requires that the service cost component of net periodic pension costs be included in the same line item as other compensation costs arising from services rendered by employees during the period, with the other components of the net periodic pension costs reported separately from the service cost component and below operating

 NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (Continued)  



income. The Company adopted this standard effective the first quarter of fiscal year 2019, which required changes to the classification of net periodic pension costs in the consolidated statements of operations for all periods presented. The service cost component of the net periodic pension cost is now included in “Selling, general and administrative expenses” with all other components of net periodic pension costs within “Other income, net” in the consolidated statements of operations. The adoption of ASU No. 2017-07 did not have any impact on the Company’s reported amount of income from continuing operations before taxes.  







 Recently issued accounting pronouncements  







 In August 2017, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update 2017-12, Derivatives and Hedging (Topic 815) - Targeted Improvements to Accounting for Hedging Activities (“ASU 2017-12”), which improves the financial reporting of hedging relationships to better portray the economic results of an entity’s risk management activities in its financial statements and makes certain targeted improvements to simplify the qualification and application of hedge accounting compared to current GAAP. This update is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, with early adoption permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of the adoption of ASU 2017-12 on its consolidated financial statements.

 AVNET, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES  



 NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (Continued)  







 Prior to the adoption of Topic 606, the Company’s revenue recognition policy was in accordance with ASC Topic 605, Revenue Recognition. Effective July 1, 2018, the Company adopted Topic 606 using the modified retrospective transition method, resulting in accounting policy changes surrounding revenue recognition which replace revenue recognition policies discussed in the Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in Note 1 of the Company’s Fiscal 2018 Annual Report on Form 10-K. The adoption of Topic 606 did not have a material impact on the Company’s consolidated financial statements.  





 Revenue is recognized at the point at which control of the underlying products are transferred to the customer, which includes determining whether products are distinct and separate performance obligations. For electronic component and related product sales, this generally occurs upon shipment of the products, however, this may occur at a later date depending on the agreed upon sales terms, such as delivery at the customer's designated location, or when products that are consigned at customer locations are consumed. In limited instances, where products are not in stock and delivery times are critical, product is purchased from the supplier and drop-shipped to the customer. The Company typically takes control of the products when shipped by the manufacturer and then recognizes revenue when control of the product transfers to the customer. The Company does not have material product warranty obligations as the assurance type product warranties provided by the component manufacturers are passed through to the Company’s customers.  





 Table of Contents  



 AVNET, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES  



 NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (Continued)  



 For contracts related to the specialized manufacture of products for customers with no alternative use and for which the Company has an enforceable right to payment, including a reasonable profit margin, the Company recognizes revenue over time as control of the products transfer through the manufacturing process. The contract assets associated with such specialized manufacturing products are not material as these contracts represent less than 2% of the Company’s total sales.  



 Revenue is measured as the amount of consideration the Company expects to receive in exchange for transferring products. The Company estimates different forms of variable consideration at the time of sale based on historical experience, current conditions and contractual obligations. Revenue is recorded net of customer discounts and rebates. When the Company offers the right or has a history of accepting returns of product, historical experience is utilized to establish a liability for the estimate of expected returns and an asset for the right to recover the product expected to be returned. These adjustments are made in the same period as the underlying sales transactions.   





 Sales and other tax amounts collected from customers for remittance to governmental authorities are excluded from revenue. The Company has elected to treat shipping and handling of product as a fulfillment activity. The practical expedient not to disclose information about remaining performance obligations has also been elected as these contracts have an original duration of one year or less. The Company does not have any payment terms that exceed one year from the point it has satisfied the related performance obligations.   



 3. Acquisitions and Discontinued operations  



 Acquisition of Softweb Solutions  



 At the end of December 2018, the Company acquired Softweb Solutions (“Softweb”) a privately held software and artificial intelligence company that delivers software solutions for Internet of Things (IoT) applications and systems designed to increase efficiency, speed time to market, and help businesses transform. The impact of this acquisition was not material to the Company’s consolidated balance sheets or statements of operations and as a result, the Company has not disclosed the preliminary allocation of purchase price or the pro-forma impact of the acquisition.  



 Discontinued Operations  



 In February 2017, the Company completed the sale of its Technology Solutions business (“TS business”) to Tech Data Corporation (the “Buyer”). The TS business and the financial impacts of the divestiture are classified as discontinued operations in all periods presented. In August 2018, the Company executed a settlement agreement with the Buyer resulting in a final adjustment of $120.0 million and a final geographic allocation of the TS business sales price for tax reporting purposes. This incremental consideration received from the sale of the TS business as well as cash settlements from the resolution of indemnification claims and other cash reimbursements have been classified as cash flow from discontinued operations investing activities. Income tax payments related to the gain on sale of the TS business have been classified as cash flow from discontinued operations operating activities.  



 Under the contractual terms of the sale of the TS business, the Company has indemnified the Buyer for certain liabilities including tax related matters, which may result in future indemnification expenses and indemnification payments to the Buyer depending upon the outcome of those matters subject to indemnification.

 4. Goodwill and long-lived assets  



 Goodwill  



 The following table presents the change in goodwill by reportable segment for the nine months ended March 30, 2019.   





   (1) Includes accumulated impairment of $1,045,110 from fiscal 2009 and $181,440 from fiscal 2018 



 The Company evaluates each quarter if facts and circumstances indicate that it is more likely than not that the fair value of its reporting units is less than their carrying value, which would require the Company to perform an interim goodwill impairment test. Indicators the Company evaluates to determine whether an interim goodwill impairment test is necessary include, but are not limited to, (i) a sustained decrease in share price or market capitalization as of any fiscal quarter end, (ii) changes in the macroeconomic or industry environments, (iii) the results of and the amount of time passed since the last goodwill impairment test and (iv) the long-term expected financial performance of its reporting units. During the third quarter of fiscal 2019, the Company concluded that an interim goodwill impairment test was not required.  



 During the third quarter of fiscal 2018, the Company impaired all of the goodwill in the Americas reporting unit and recorded $181.4 million of goodwill impairment expense, which is classified within goodwill impairment expense in the Consolidated Statements of Operations.  



 Intangible Assets  



 The following table presents the Company’s acquired intangible assets at March 30, 2019, and June 30, 2018, respectively.

 AVNET, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES  



 NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (Continued)  



 The Company has an accounts receivable securitization program (the “Securitization Program”) in the United States with a group of financial institutions to allow the Company to transfer, on an ongoing revolving basis, an undivided interest in a designated pool of trade accounts receivable, to provide security or collateral for borrowings up to a maximum of $500 million. The Securitization Program does not qualify for off balance sheet accounting treatment and any borrowings under the Securitization Program are recorded as debt in the consolidated balance sheets. Under the Securitization Program, the Company legally sells and isolates certain U.S. trade accounts receivable into a wholly owned and consolidated bankruptcy remote special purpose entity. Such receivables, which are recorded within “Receivables” in the consolidated balance sheets, totaled $820.9 million and $790.5 million at March 30, 2019, and June 30, 2018, respectively. The Securitization Program contains certain covenants relating to the quality of the receivables sold. The Securitization Program also requires the Company to maintain certain minimum interest coverage and leverage ratios, which the Company was in compliance with as of March 30, 2019, and June 30, 2018. The Securitization Program expires in August 2020 and as a result the Company has classified outstanding balances as long-term debt as of March 30, 2019. Interest on borrowings is calculated using a one-month LIBOR rate plus a spread of 0.75%. The facility fee on the unused balance of the facility is up to 0.35%.  



 The Company has a five-year $1.25 billion senior unsecured revolving credit facility (the “Credit Facility”) with a syndicate of banks, consisting of revolving credit facilities and the issuance of up to $200.0 million of letters of credit and up to $300.0 million of loans in certain approved currencies, which expires in June 2023. Subject to certain conditions, the Credit Facility may be increased up to $1.50 billion. Under the Credit Facility, the Company may select from various interest rate options, currencies and maturities. The Credit Facility contains certain covenants including various limitations on debt incurrence, share repurchases, dividends, investments and capital expenditures. The Credit Facility also includes financial covenants requiring the Company to maintain minimum interest coverage and leverage ratios, which the Company was in compliance with as of March 30, 2019 and June 30, 2018. As of March 30, 2019 and June 30, 2018, there were $3.0 million and $2.0 million, respectively, in letters of credit issued under the Credit Facility.  



 As of March 30, 2019, the carrying value and fair value of the Company’s total debt was $2.07 billion and $2.12 billion, respectively. At June 30, 2018, the carrying value and fair value of the Company’s total debt was $1.65 billion and $1.67 billion, respectively. Fair value for the public notes was estimated based upon quoted market prices and for other forms of debt fair value approximates carrying value due to the market based variable nature of the interest rates on those debt facilities.  



 6. Derivative financial instruments  



 Many of the Company’s subsidiaries purchase and sell products in currencies other than their functional currencies. This subjects the Company to the risks associated with fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. The Company reduces this risk by utilizing natural hedging (e.g., offsetting receivables and payables in the same foreign currency) as well as by creating offsetting positions through the use of derivative financial instruments, primarily forward foreign exchange contracts typically with maturities of less than 60 days (“economic hedges”), but no longer than one year. The Company continues to have exposure to foreign currency risks to the extent they are not economically hedged. The Company adjusts any economic hedges to fair value through the consolidated statements of operations primarily within “other income, net.” The fair value of forward foreign exchange contracts, which are based upon Level 2 criteria under the ASC 820 fair value hierarchy, are classified in the captions “Prepaid and other current assets” or “Accrued expenses and other,” as applicable, in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets as of March 30, 2019 and June 30, 2018. The Company’s master netting and other similar arrangements with various financial institutions related to derivative financial instruments allow for the right of offset. The Company’s policy is to present derivative financial instruments with the same counterparty as either a net asset or liability when the right of offset exists.  



 The Company generally does not hedge its investments in its foreign operations. The Company does not enter into derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes and monitors the financial stability and credit standing of its counterparties.  





 Table of Contents  



 AVNET, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES  



 NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (Continued)  













 Under the Company’s economic hedging policies, gains and losses on the derivative financial instruments are classified within the same line item in the consolidated statements of operations and as the underlying assets or liabilities being economically hedged.  



 7. Commitments and contingencies  



 From time to time, the Company may become a party to, or be otherwise involved in various lawsuits, claims, investigations and other legal proceedings arising in the ordinary course of conducting its business. While litigation is subject to inherent uncertainties, management does not anticipate that any such matters will have a material adverse effect on the Company’s financial condition, liquidity or results of operations.   





 As of March 30, 2019 and June 30, 2018, the Company had aggregate estimated liabilities of $14.7 million and $14.2 million, respectively, classified within accrued expenses and other for such compliance-related matters that were reasonably estimable as of such dates.

 The Company’s effective tax rate on its income from continuing operations before taxes was 24.4% in the third quarter of fiscal 2019. During the third quarter of fiscal 2019, the Company’s effective tax rate was unfavorably impacted primarily by (i) an increase due to the impact from recently issued U.S. income tax regulations, partially offset by (ii) decreases in unrecognized tax benefits due to the expiration of the statute of limitations in various jurisdictions.  



 During the third quarter of fiscal 2018, the Company’s effective tax rate on its loss from continuing operations before taxes of 338.0% was unfavorably impacted primarily by (i) the one-time mandatory deemed repatriation tax liability expense (“the transition tax”) estimate recorded under the requirements of U.S. federal government enacted tax legislation (the “Act”) and (ii) the goodwill impairment discussed in Note 4, which was not tax deductible, partially offset primarily by (iii) the mix of income in lower tax jurisdictions and (iv) the release of reserves due to the expiration of the statute of limitations in various jurisdictions.  



 For the first nine months of fiscal 2019, the Company’s effective tax rate on its income from continuing operations before taxes was 29.5%. The effective tax rate for the first nine months of fiscal 2019 was unfavorably impacted primarily by (i) an adjustment to the transition tax recorded under the requirements of the Act, (ii) net increases in unrecognized tax benefits, and (iii) an increase due to the impact from recently issued U.S. income tax regulations, partially offset by (iv) an adjustment to the deferred tax impacts of the Act, (v) the mix of income in lower tax jurisdictions, and (vi) the release of valuation allowances against deferred tax assets that were deemed to be realizable.  



 During the first nine months of fiscal 2018, the Company’s effective tax rate on its income from continuing operations before taxes of 489.2% was unfavorably impacted primarily by (i) the transition tax expense recorded under the requirements of the Act, (ii) the goodwill impairment, which was not tax deductible, and (iii) the tax expense created from remeasuring net deferred tax assets as a result of applying the requirements of the Act, partially offset primarily by (iv) the mix of income in lower tax jurisdictions and (v) the release of reserves due to the expiration of the statute of limitations in various jurisdictions.   



 The Company’s effective tax rate in fiscal 2019 is based on the Company’s interpretation of tax regulations under the Act including the computation of Global Intangible Low Taxed Income (“GILTI”). The Company has made a policy election to account for any impacts of the GILTI tax as a period expense. The Company’s fiscal 2019 effective tax rate may change in future periods due to changes in U.S. tax regulations and the issuance of additional guidance related to the Act.  



 During the second quarter of fiscal 2019, which corresponds to the end of the measurement period allowed for under Staff Accounting Bulletin 118 (“SAB 118”), the Company finalized its estimate of the transition tax, resulting in an increase to the tax liability of $10.8 million due to additional analysis performed on foreign tax pools and earnings and profits computations. The total transition tax recorded as a result of the Act is estimated to be $257.5 million. The transition tax may change in the future due to changes in U.S. tax regulations, new guidance from federal and state regulators and related interpretations of the Act.   



 The Company continues to evaluate the impact of the Act including the Company’s historical assertion related to ASC 740 unremitted earnings. The Company has not changed its historical assertion as of March 30, 2019 that its ASC 740 unremitted earnings are permanently reinvested.

 In connection with the adoption of ASU No. 2017-07, the Company now classifies service cost as a component of selling, general and administrative expenses and other components of net periodic pension costs within other income, net. The Company contributed $8.0 million to the Plan during the first nine months of fiscal 2019 and expects to make an additional contribution to the Plan of $8.0 million in the remainder of fiscal 2019.  



 Amounts reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income, net of tax, to other income, net during the third quarters and first nine months of fiscal 2019 and fiscal 2018 were not material and substantially all related to net periodic pension costs including recognition of actuarial losses and amortization of prior service credits.  



 In connection with the sale of the TS business, a significant number of former employees became terminated vested employees under the Plan. During fiscal 2018, the aggregate amount of former employee withdrawals from the Plan exceeded the pension accounting settlement threshold for fiscal 2018, which required a settlement expense under ASC 715 pension accounting. As a result, the Company recorded a pension settlement expense of $4.9 million and $18.9 million in the third quarter and first nine months of fiscal 2018, respectively, which was classified as a component of loss from discontinued operations.

 Share repurchase program  



 In August 2018, the Company’s Board of Directors amended the Company’s existing share repurchase program to authorize the repurchase of up to $2.45 billion of common stock in the open market or through privately negotiated transactions. The timing and actual number of shares repurchased will depend on a variety of factors such as share price, corporate and regulatory requirements, and prevailing market conditions. During the third quarter and nine months ended March 30, 2019, the Company repurchased 2.8 million and 10.2 million shares, respectively, under this program for a total cost of $117.2 million and $449.2 million, respectively. As of March 30, 2019, the Company had $322.9 million remaining under its share repurchase authorization.  



 Common stock dividend  



 In February 2019, the Company’s Board of Directors approved a dividend of $0.20 per common share and dividend payments of $21.5 million were made in March 2019. During the nine months ended March 30, 2019, the Company paid dividends of $0.60 per common share and $66.2 million in total.  



 11. Earnings per share  





 For the three and nine months ended March 31, 2018, the diluted net loss per share is the same as basic net loss per share as the effects of all potential common shares would be anti-dilutive as the Company had net losses.

 Item 1.Legal Proceedings  



 As a result primarily of certain former manufacturing operations, the Company has incurred and may have future liability under various federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations, including those governing pollution and exposure to, and the handling, storage and disposal of, hazardous substances. For example, under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act of 1980, as amended, and similar state laws, the Company is and may be liable for the costs of cleaning up environmental contamination on or from certain of its current or former properties, and at off-site locations where the Company disposed of wastes in the past. Such laws may impose joint and several liability. Typically, however, the costs for clean up at such sites are allocated among potentially responsible parties based upon each party’s relative contribution to the contamination, and other factors.  



 Pursuant to SEC regulations, including but not limited to Item 103 of Regulation S-K, the Company regularly assesses the status of and developments in pending environmental and other compliance related legal proceedings to determine whether any such proceedings should be identified specifically in this discussion of legal proceedings, and has concluded that no particular pending legal proceeding requires public disclosure. Based on the information known to date, management believes that the Company has appropriately accrued in its consolidated financial statements for its share of the estimable costs of environmental and other compliance related matters.  





 Item 1A.Risk Factors
