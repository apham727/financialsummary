Item 2.
Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations
​
​
​
​
●Sales adjusted for certain items that impact the year-over-year analysis, which includes the impact of certain acquisitions by adjusting Avnet’s prior periods to include the sales of acquired businesses, as if the acquisitions had occurred at the beginning of the earliest period presented.
Sales taking into account these adjustments are referred to as “organic sales.”
​
​
​
​
Management believes that providing this additional information is useful to readers to better assess and understand operating performance, especially when comparing results with prior periods or forecasting performance for future periods, primarily because management typically monitors the business both including and excluding these adjustments to GAAP results.
Management also uses these non-GAAP measures to establish operational goals and, in many cases, for measuring performance for compensation purposes.
However, any analysis of results on a non-GAAP basis should be used as a complement to, and in conjunction with, results presented in accordance with GAAP.

​

​
​
Results of Operations
​
Executive Summary
​
Sales of $4.63 billion were down 9.0% year over year and 7.8% in constant currency as compared to prior year first quarter sales of $5.09 billion.
Both operating groups in all three regions contributed to the year-over-year decline in sales as the global industry-wide slowdown resulted in weaker year over year demand.
 ​
Gross profit margin of 11.7% decreased 76 basis points compared to 12.5% in the first quarter of fiscal 2019 primarily due to gross profit declines at both EC and Farnell.
​
Operating income of $62.7 million decreased $84.1 million or 57.3% as compared to the first quarter of fiscal 2019.
Operating income margin was 1.4% in the first quarter of fiscal 2020 as compared with a 2.9% in the first quarter of fiscal 2019.
Both periods included amortization and restructuring, integration and other expenses.
Excluding these expenses from both periods, adjusted operating income margin was 2.3% in the first quarter of fiscal 2020 as compared to 3.6% in the first quarter of fiscal 2019, a decline of 127 basis points.
The decrease in operating income and operating income margin is primarily due to the decrease in sales and gross profit margin, partially offset by reductions in operating expenses from the Company’s restructuring and integration efforts.
​
​
Sales
​
The following table presents reported and organic sales growth rates between fiscal 2020 and fiscal 2019 for the first quarter of fiscal 2020.
​
Sales for the first quarter of fiscal 2020 were down $459.9 million, or 9.0%, from the prior year first quarter sales of $5.09 billion.
Sales in constant currency decreased 7.8% over the prior year first quarter with all three regions of both operating groups contributing to the decline.
These decreases are primarily due to the current industry-wide economic downturn.
​
EC sales of $4.29 billion in the first quarter of fiscal 2020 decreased $416.6 million or 8.8% from the prior year first quarter sales of $4.71 billion.
EC sales in constant currency declined 7.7% in constant currency year over year.
Farnell sales for the first quarter of fiscal 2020 were $335.8 million, a decrease of $43.2 million or 11.4% from the prior year first quarter sales of $379.1 million.
Farnell sales in constant currency declined 9.0% year over year.
​
 On a regional basis, sales declined 4.4% in the Americas, 10.5% in EMEA in constant currency and 7.7% in Asia in constant currency.
All the regional declines are primarily due to the industry-wide economic downturn impacting the demand for electronic components.
​
As a result of the recent notification the Company received from Texas Instruments (“TI”) related to the termination of the Company’s distribution agreement, the Company may experience lower sales and gross profit in the future if the impact of the termination is not offset by sales growth, gross margin improvements or operating cost reductions from strategic initiatives designed to mitigate such impacts.
Sales from TI products represented approximately 10% of total sales in fiscal 2019.
​
Gross Profit and Gross Profit Margins
​
Gross profit for the first quarter of fiscal 2020 was $543.8 million, a decrease of $92.9 million, or 14.6%, from the first quarter of fiscal 2019 gross profit of $636.8 million driven primarily by the decline in sales.
Gross profit margin decreased 76 basis points to 11.7% from the first quarter of fiscal 2019 gross profit margin of 12.5% driven by declines in gross profit margin in both operating segments, most predominately in the Company’s Farnell segment.
The declines in gross profit margin in both operating groups are primarily due to a combination of product and customer mix, geographical market mix and overall declines in gross profit margin due to current market conditions.
​
Selling, General and Administrative Expenses
​
​
​
Restructuring, Integration and Other Expenses
​
As a result of management’s focus on improving operating efficiencies and further integrating the acquisition of Farnell, the Company has incurred certain restructuring costs.
These costs also related to the continued transformation of the Company’s information technology, distribution center footprint and business operations including the re-prioritization of its information technology initiatives and resources.
In addition, the Company incurred integration, accelerated depreciation and other costs.
Integration costs are primarily related to the integration of acquired businesses including Farnell, the integration of certain regional and global businesses, and incremental costs incurred as part of the consolidation, relocation, sale and closure of distribution centers and office facilities.
Accelerated depreciation relates to the incremental depreciation expense incurred related to the shortening of the estimated useful life for certain information technology assets.
Other costs consist primarily of any other miscellaneous costs that relate to restructuring, integration and other expenses including acquisition related costs.
​
The Company recorded restructuring, integration and other expenses of $24.6 million during the first quarter of fiscal 2020.
The Company recorded $18.3 million of restructuring costs in the first quarter of fiscal 2020, which are expected to provide approximately $20.0 million in annual operating expense savings once such restructuring actions are completed.
Included in the restructuring costs was severance costs of $11.6 million and a $6.7 million non-cash impairment expense related to information technology software.
During the first quarter of fiscal 2020, the Company also incurred integration costs of $1.7 million, accelerated depreciation expense of $2.7 million, other costs of $2.1 million and a reversal of $0.2 million for changes in estimates for costs associated with prior year restructuring actions.
The after-tax impact of restructuring, integration and other expenses were $18.4 million and $0.18 per share on a diluted basis.
​
Comparatively, in the first quarter of fiscal 2019, restructuring, integration and other expenses were $14.8 million.
The after-tax impact of restructuring, integration, and other expenses was $11.5 million and $0.10 per share on a diluted basis.
​
See Note 14 “Restructuring expenses” to the Company’s consolidated financial statements included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.
​
Operating Income
​
​
EC operating income margin decreased 83 basis points year over year to 2.6% and Farnell operating income margin decreased 427 basis points year over year to 6.5%.
​
Interest and Other Financing Expenses, Net and Other Income (Expense), Net
​
Interest and other financing expenses in the first quarter of fiscal 2020 was $33.6 million, an increase of $3.5 million or 11.8%, as compared with interest and other financing expenses of $30.1 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2019.
The increase in interest and other financing expenses in the first quarter of fiscal 2020 compared to the first quarter of fiscal 2019 was primarily related to increased expenses in foreign regions to finance working capital needs.
​
During the first quarter of fiscal 2020, the Company had $4.9 million of other income as compared with $1.9 million of other expense in the first quarter of fiscal 2019.
The increase in other income was primarily due to favorable foreign currency gains in the first quarter of fiscal 2020 as compared to foreign currency losses in the first quarter of fiscal 2019.
​
​
Income Tax Expense
​
The Company’s effective tax rate on its income from continuing operations before taxes was (22.7)% in the first quarter of fiscal 2020 as compared with 27.3% in the first quarter of fiscal 2019.
During the first quarter of fiscal 2020, the Company’s effective tax rate was favorably impacted primarily by (i) the release of unrecognized tax benefit reserves and (ii) the mix of income in lower tax jurisdictions.
During the first quarter of fiscal 2019, the Company’s effective tax rate was unfavorably impacted primarily by (i) an adjustment to the provisional estimate for the one-time mandatory deemed repatriation tax liability recorded under the requirements of recent tax law changes in the United States (the “Act”) and (ii) increases in unrecognized tax benefits, partially offset by (iii) an adjustment to the provisional deferred tax impacts of the Act and (iv) the mix of income in lower tax jurisdictions.
​
See Note 8 “Income taxes” to the Company’s consolidated financial statements included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.
​
Income from Discontinued Operations

Contractual Obligations
​
For a detailed description of the Company’s long-term debt and lease commitments for the next five years and thereafter, see Long-Term Contractual Obligations appearing in Item 7 of the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 29, 2019.
With the exception of the Company’s debt transactions discussed herein, there are no material changes to this information outside of normal borrowings and repayments of long-term debt and operating lease payments.
The Company does not currently have any material non-cancellable commitments for capital expenditures or inventory purchases.
​
Financing Transactions
​
See Note 4, “Debt” to the Company’s consolidated financial statements included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for additional information on financing transactions including the Credit Facility, the Securitization Program, and other outstanding debt as of September 28, 2019.
The Company was in compliance with all covenants under the Credit Facility and the Securitization Program as of September 28, 2019 and June 29, 2019.
​
The Company has various lines of credit, financing arrangements and other forms of bank debt in the U.S. and various foreign locations to fund the short-term working capital, foreign exchange, overdraft and letter of credit needs of its wholly owned subsidiaries.
Outstanding borrowings under such forms of debt at the end of first quarter of fiscal 2020 was $0.6 million.
​
As an alternative form of financing outside of the United States, the Company sells certain of its trade accounts receivable on a non-recourse basis to third-party financial institutions pursuant to factoring agreements.
The Company accounts for these transactions as sales of receivables and presents cash proceeds as cash provided by operating activities in the consolidated statements of cash flows.
Factoring fees for the sales of receivables are recorded within “Interest and other financing expenses, net” and were not material.
​
Liquidity
​
The Company held cash and cash equivalents of $664.1 million as of September 28, 2019, of which $592.6 million was held outside the United States.
As of June 29, 2019, the Company held cash and cash equivalents of $546.1 million, of which $476.6 million was held outside of the United States.
​
As of the end of the first quarter of fiscal 2020, the Company had a combined total borrowing capacity of $1.75 billion under the Credit Facility and the Securitization Program.
There were no borrowings outstanding and $4.2 million in letters of credit issued under the Credit Facility and $338.1 million in borrowings outstanding under the Securitization Program, resulting in approximately $1.41 billion of total availability as of September 28, 2019.
Availability under the Securitization Program is subject to the Company having sufficient eligible trade accounts receivable to support desired borrowings.
The Company expects to renew or replace the Securitization Program on similar terms, subject to market conditions, before its maturity in August 2020.
The Company expects to redeem the $300.0 million of Notes due June 2020 either through the issuance of new notes or from available borrowing capacity under the Credit Facility.
During the first quarter of fiscal 2020, the Company had an average daily balance outstanding of approximately $50.6 million under the Credit Facility and approximately $488.4 million under the Securitization Program.
During the first quarter of fiscal 2019, the Company had an average daily balance outstanding of approximately $65.0 million under the Securitization Program.
​
During periods of weakening demand in the electronic components industry, the Company typically generates cash from operating activities.
Conversely, the Company is more likely to use operating cash flows for working capital requirements during periods of higher growth.
The Company generated $871.7 million in cash flows from operating activities over the trailing four fiscal quarters ended September 28, 2019 from continuing operations.
​
Liquidity is subject to many factors, such as normal business operations as well as general economic, financial, competitive, legislative, and regulatory factors that are beyond the Company’s control.
To the extent the cash balances held in foreign locations cannot be remitted back to the U.S. in a tax efficient manner, those cash balances are generally used for ongoing working capital, capital expenditure needs and to support acquisitions.
In addition, local government regulations may restrict the Company’s ability to move funds among various locations under certain circumstances.
Management does not believe such restrictions would limit the Company’s ability to pursue its intended business strategy.
Management believes that Avnet’s available borrowing capacity including capacity for the non-recourse sale of accounts receivable and the Company’s expected ability to generate operating cash flows in the future will be sufficient to meet its future liquidity needs.
The Company also may issue debt or equity securities in the future and management believes the Company will have adequate access to the capital markets, if needed.
​
Historically the Company has made, and expects to continue to make, strategic investments through acquisition activity to the extent the investments strengthen Avnet’s competitive position, further its business strategies and meet management’s return on financial thresholds.
As the Company implements the operating cost savings restructuring plans, responds to current business environment challenges and pursues ways to become more efficient and cost effective, the Company expects to use cash for restructuring, integration and other expenses.
​
In addition to continuing to make investments in acquisitions, as of September 28, 2019, the Company may repurchase up to an aggregate of $593.3 million of shares of the Company’s common stock through a $2.95 billion share repurchase program approved by the Board of Directors.
The Company may repurchase stock from time to time at the discretion of management, subject to strategic considerations, market conditions and other factors.
The Company may terminate or limit the share repurchase program at any time without prior notice.
The timing and actual number of shares repurchased will depend on a variety of factors such as share price, corporate and regulatory requirements, and prevailing market conditions.
Additionally, the Company currently expects to pay quarterly cash dividends on shares of its common stock, subject to approval of the Board of Directors.
During the first quarter of fiscal 2020, the Board of Directors approved a dividend of $0.21 per share, which resulted in $21.5 million of dividend payments during the quarter.
