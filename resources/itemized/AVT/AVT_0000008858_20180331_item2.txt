 Item 2.Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations  









   ·    Sales adjusted for certain items that impact the year-over-year analysis, which includes the impact of certain acquisitions by adjusting Avnet’s prior periods to include the sales of acquired businesses, as if the acquisitions had occurred at the beginning of the earliest period presented. Sales taking into account these adjustments are referred to as “organic sales.” 









 Management believes that providing this additional information is useful to readers to better assess and understand operating performance, especially when comparing results with prior periods or forecasting performance for future periods, primarily because management typically monitors the business both including and excluding these adjustments to GAAP results. Management also uses these non-GAAP measures to establish operational goals and, in many cases, for measuring performance for compensation purposes. However, any analysis of results on a non-GAAP basis should be used as a complement to, and in conjunction with, results presented in accordance with GAAP.

 Results of Operations  



 Executive Summary  



 Sales for the third quarter of fiscal 2018 were $4.80 billion, an increase of 8.0% from sales for the third quarter of fiscal 2017 of $4.44 billion. The increase in sales was due to the increased sales in PF and the EMEA and Asia regions of EC, offset by sales declines in the EC Americas region. Sales in constant currency increased year over year by 2.4% with both EC and PF contributing to the increase.   



 Gross profit margin for the third quarter of fiscal 2018 decreased 55 basis points compared to the third quarter of fiscal 2017. EC gross profit margin decreased year over year primarily due to supplier program changes, and a higher percentage of sales coming from the lower-margin Asia region. PF gross profit margin decreased year over year primarily driven by changes in product mix and the impact of foreign currency exchange rates.  



 Avnet operating loss margin was (1.1)% in the third quarter of fiscal 2018 as compared with 2.6% of operating income margin in the third quarter of fiscal 2017. Both periods included amortization and restructuring, integration and other expenses. The third quarter of fiscal 2018 also includes goodwill impairment expense. Excluding these expenses from both periods, adjusted operating income margin was 3.7% in the third quarter of fiscal 2018 as compared to 3.9% in the third quarter of fiscal 2017.

 Sales  



 The following table presents reported and organic sales growth rates between fiscal 2018 and fiscal 2017 for the third quarters and first nine months of fiscal 2018.   





 The following table presents the reconciliation of reported sales to organic sales for the first nine months of fiscal 2017.  





   (1)    Includes PF acquired on October 17, 2016, which has operations in each Avnet region. 



 Sales for the third quarter of fiscal 2018 were $4.80 billion, an increase of 8.0%, or $353.2 million, from the prior year third quarter sales of $4.44 billion. Excluding the translation impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates, sales increased 2.4% over the prior year third quarter with both operating groups contributing to this increase.  



 EC sales of $4.40 billion in the third quarter of fiscal 2018 increased $313.2 million or 7.7% from the prior year third quarter sales of $4.09 billion. This increase was primarily driven by increased sales in Asia due to organic growth and in EMEA primarily due to the benefit from the weakening of the U.S. Dollar, partially offset by declines in the Americas region due to supplier channel and program changes. PF sales for the third quarter of fiscal 2018 were $391.0 million, an increase of $40.0 million or 11.4% from the prior year third quarter sales of $351.0 million driven by growth in all three regions including the benefit from the weakening U.S. Dollar.   





 Table of Contents  



 Sales for the first nine months of fiscal 2018 were $13.98 billion, an increase of 8.9%, or $1.14 billion, as compared to sales of $12.83 billion for the first nine months of fiscal 2017. This increase was primarily due to the acquisition of PF, which was acquired in the second quarter of fiscal 2017, and an overall increase in sales in EC as double-digit growth in the EMEA and Asia regions of EC offset a year to date decrease of 8.9% in the EC Americas region. Organic sales for the first nine months of 2018 increased $765.8 million, or 5.8%, compared to the first nine months of fiscal 2017 primarily due to double-digit sales growth in EMEA and Asia regions, offset by a decline of 7.9% in the Americas region.   



 Gross Profit and Gross Profit Margins  



 Gross profit for the third quarter of fiscal 2018 was $653.5 million, an increase of $23.6 million, or 3.7%, from the third quarter of fiscal 2017 gross profit of $630.0 million primarily driven by the increase in sales. Gross profit margin decreased 55 basis points to 13.6% from the third quarter of fiscal 2017, with both operating groups contributing to the decrease.  



 EC gross profit margin decreased year over year primarily due to supplier program changes and a sales mix shift to the lower-margin Asia region. Asia sales represented approximately 38% of the total EC sales in the third quarter of fiscal 2018 as compared with approximately 36% in the third quarter of fiscal 2017. PF gross profit margin decreased year over year primarily driven by customer mix and the impact of foreign currency exchange rates.   



 Gross profit and gross profit margins were $1.87 billion and 13.4%, respectively, for the first nine months of fiscal 2018 as compared with $1.74 billion and 13.5%, respectively, for the first nine months of fiscal 2017. Decreases in EC’s gross profit margin due to supplier program changes were partially offset by increases in gross profit margin due to the acquisition of PF, which occurred in the second quarter of fiscal 2017.  



 Selling, General and Administrative Expenses  









 Impairment Expenses  



 As of December 30, 2017, the $181.4 million in goodwill related to the Electronic Components Americas core reporting unit (the “Americas”) primarily represented goodwill allocated from the acquisitions of Bell Micro, G2 and Round 2, all of which occurred prior to fiscal 2011. The allocation of goodwill to the Americas represented the expected synergies the Americas would realize from these historical acquisitions. Once goodwill has been assigned to a reporting unit, for accounting purposes, the goodwill is no longer directly associated with the underlying acquisitions that the goodwill originated from, but rather the reporting unit to which it has been allocated.   





 Table of Contents  



 As a result of the interim impairment testing and related fair value estimate of the Americas as of the third quarter of fiscal 2018, the Company impaired all of the goodwill in the Americas and recorded $181.4 million of goodwill impairment expense in the third quarter of fiscal 2018. See Note 4 “Goodwill and long-lived assets” to the Company’s consolidated financial statements included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.  



 Restructuring, Integration and Other Expenses  





 The Company recorded restructuring, integration and other expenses of $25.1 million during the third quarter of fiscal 2018. The Company recorded $5.9 million of restructuring costs in the third quarter of fiscal 2018 in order to realize approximately $7.2 million in expected annualized operating cost savings once such restructuring actions initiated before the end of the third quarter of fiscal 2018 are completed. During the third quarter of fiscal 2018, the Company incurred integration costs of $2.5 million, accelerated depreciation of $13.1 million, other costs of $3.2 million and an expense of $0.4 million for changes in estimates for costs associated with prior year restructuring actions. The after tax impact of restructuring, integration and other expenses were $19.4 million and $0.16 per share on a diluted basis.  



 During the first nine months of fiscal 2018, the Company incurred restructuring costs of $40.1 million, integration costs of $18.8 million, accelerated depreciation of $46.4 million, other costs of $3.9 million and reversals of $0.9 million for changes in estimates for costs associated with prior year restructuring actions. The after tax impact of restructuring, integration and other expenses for the first nine months of fiscal 2018 was $76.7 million and $0.63 per share on a diluted basis.  



 Comparatively, in the third quarter of fiscal 2017, restructuring, integration and other expenses from continuing operations were $35.5 million. The after tax impact of restructuring, integration, and other expenses was $23.1 million and $0.18 per share on a diluted basis.   



 In the first nine months of fiscal 2017, restructuring, integration and other expenses from continuing operations was $95.4 million. The after tax impact of restructuring, integration and other expenses for the first nine months of fiscal 2017 was $66.3 million and $0.52 per share on a diluted basis.  



 See Note 14 “Restructuring expenses” to the Company’s consolidated financial statements included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.   



 Operating Income (Loss)  



 Operating loss for the third quarter of fiscal 2018 was $(54.4) million, a decrease of $168.7 million, or 147.6%, from the third quarter of fiscal 2017 operating income of $114.3 million. The year over year decrease in operating income was primarily driven by goodwill impairment expense, partially offset by improvements at PF and EC. Adjusted operating income for the third quarter of fiscal 2018 was $174.9 million, an increase of $2.6 million, or 1.5%, from the third quarter of fiscal 2017.  





 Table of Contents  



  EC operating income margin decreased 25 basis points year over year to 3.6% due primarily to supplier program changes partially offset by cost reductions from restructuring actions. PF operating income margin decreased 14 basis points year over year to 11.4% due primarily to a decline in gross profit margins partially offset by the realization of post-acquisition cost synergies.   



 Operating income for the first nine months of fiscal 2018 was $102.6 million, or 0.7% of consolidated sales, as compared with operating income of $368.0 million, or 2.9% in the first nine months of 2017 primarily driven by declines in EC partially offset by the acquisition of PF.   



 Interest Expense and Other Income (Expense), Net  



 Interest expense in the third quarter of fiscal 2018 was $26.0 million, a decrease of $1.5 million or 5.4%, as compared with interest expense of $27.5 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2017. Interest expense in the first nine months of fiscal 2018 was $75.7 million, a decrease of $5.8 million or 7.1%, as compared with interest expense of $81.5 million in the first nine months of fiscal 2017. The decrease in interest expense in the third quarter and first nine months of fiscal 2018 compared to the third quarter and first nine months of fiscal 2017 was primarily related to the impact of the Company’s repayment of its outstanding term loans and borrowings on its revolving credit facilities, which were used to help fund the PF acquisition.  



 During the third quarter of fiscal 2018, the Company had $8.4 million of other income, net, as compared with $19.4 million of other income, net, in the third quarter of fiscal 2017. During the first nine months of fiscal 2018, the Company had $24.7 million of other income, net, as compared with $30.8 million of other expense, net, in the first nine months of fiscal 2017. In the third quarter and first nine months of fiscal 2018, the Company had foreign currency gains primarily due to the weakening of the U.S. Dollar. In the third quarter of fiscal 2017, the Company had other income due to unrealized gains on marketable securities obtained through the sale of TS. In the first nine months of fiscal 2017, the Company incurred additional financing and economic foreign currency hedging costs associated with the PF acquisition, partially offset by unrealized gains on marketable securities.   



 Income Tax Expense  



 The Company’s effective tax rate on its loss before income taxes from continuing operations was (338.0)% in the third quarter of fiscal 2018. During the third quarter of fiscal 2018, the Company’s effective tax rate was unfavorably impacted primarily by (i) the provisional transition tax expense estimate recorded under the requirements of the Act discussed in Note 8 and (ii) the goodwill impairment discussed in Note 4, which was not tax deductible, partially offset primarily by (i) the mix of income in lower tax jurisdictions and (ii) the release of reserves due to the expiration of the statute of limitations in various jurisdictions.  



 During the third quarter of fiscal 2017, the Company’s effective tax rate of 15.3% was favorably impacted primarily by (i) the mix of income in lower tax jurisdictions and (ii) the release of reserves and other discrete tax benefits.  



 For the first nine months of fiscal 2018 the Company’s effective tax rate on its income before income taxes from continuing operations was 489.2%. The effective tax rate for the first nine months of fiscal 2018 was unfavorably impacted primarily by (i) the provisional transition tax expense recorded under the requirements of the Act, (ii) the goodwill impairment, which was not tax deductible, and (iii) the tax expense created from remeasuring net deferred tax assets as a result of applying the requirements of the Act, partially offset primarily by (i) the mix of income in lower tax jurisdictions and (ii) the release of reserves.  



 During the first nine months of fiscal 2017, the Company’s effective tax rate of 25.7% was favorably impacted primarily by (i) the mix of income in lower tax jurisdictions, partially offset by (ii) net increases to valuation allowances against deferred tax assets that were deemed unrealizable and (iii) the impact of non-deductible acquisition related expenses.

 Income (Loss) from Discontinued Operations  



 Loss from discontinued operations was $(4.5) million and $(14.4) million in the third quarter and the first nine months of fiscal 2018, respectively, primarily as a result of settlement losses associated with the Company’s pension plan due to former TS business employees requesting and receiving distributions from the Company’s pension plan during fiscal 2018. Refer to Note 9, “Pension Plan,” for further information on the pension settlement losses.  



 Income from discontinued operations was $181.9 million and $253.8 million in the third quarter and the first nine months of fiscal 2017, respectively, due to the operating results of the TS business, which was sold in the third quarter of fiscal 2017.

Additionally, with the sale of the TS business, the Company received $2.24 billion of proceeds from the sale of TS business, net of cash divested, which is reflected as an investing activity from discontinued operations.  



 During the first nine months of fiscal 2018, the Company generated $153.9 million of cash from investing activities – discontinued operations as a result of the sale of marketable securities obtained through the sale of the TS business.  



 Contractual Obligations  



 For a detailed description of the Company’s long-term debt and lease commitments for the next five years and thereafter, see Long-Term Contractual Obligations appearing in Item 7 of the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended July 1, 2017. With the exception of the Company’s debt transactions discussed herein, there are no material changes to this information outside of normal borrowings and repayments of long-term debt and operating lease payments. The Company does not currently have any material non-cancellable commitments for capital expenditures or inventory purchases.  



 Financing Transactions  



 See Note 5, “Debt” to the Company’s consolidated financial statements included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for additional information on financing transactions including the Credit Facility, the Program, and other outstanding debt as of March 31, 2018. The Company was in compliance with all covenants under the Credit Facility and the Program as of March 31, 2018.  



 The Company has various lines of credit and other forms of bank debt in the U.S. and various foreign locations to fund the short-term working capital, foreign exchange, overdraft and letter of credit needs of its wholly owned subsidiaries. Avnet generally guarantees its subsidiaries’ obligations under such debt facilities. Outstanding borrowings under such forms of debt at the end of third quarter of fiscal 2018 was $7.5 million.

 Liquidity  



 The Company held cash and cash equivalents of $430.1 million as of March 31, 2018, of which $396.3 million was held outside the United States. As of July 1, 2017, the Company held cash and cash equivalents of $836.4 million, of which $619.5 million was held outside of the United States.  



 As of the end of the third quarter of fiscal 2018, the Company had a combined total borrowing capacity of $1.65 billion under the Credit Facility and the Program. There were no borrowings outstanding and $2.0 million in letters of credit issued under the Credit Facility and $95.0 million in borrowings outstanding under the Program, resulting in approximately $1.55 billion of total availability as of March 31, 2018. Availability under the Program is subject to the Company having sufficient eligible trade accounts receivable to support desired borrowings. The Company currently expects to utilize availability under credit facilities to support working capital and other general corporate purposes to the extent such incremental borrowings do not impact the Company’s investment grade credit rating. During the third quarter and first nine months of fiscal 2018, the Company had an average daily balance outstanding of approximately $0.6 million and $3.0 million, respectively, under the Credit Facility and approximately $298.0 million and $230.0 million, respectively, under the Program. During the third quarter and first nine months of fiscal 2017, the Company had an average daily balance outstanding of approximately $516.0 million and $596.5 million, respectively, under the Credit Facility and approximately $437.0 million and $592.0 million, respectively, under the Program.  



 During periods of weakening demand in the electronic components industry, the Company typically generates cash from operating activities. Conversely, the Company is more likely to use operating cash flows for working capital requirements during periods of higher growth. The Company used $98.5 million in cash flows from operating activities over the trailing four fiscal quarters ended March 31, 2018 for continuing operations.   



 Liquidity is subject to many factors, such as normal business operations as well as general economic, financial, competitive, legislative, and regulatory factors that are beyond the Company’s control. As a result of tax law changes created from the Act, the Company repatriated approximately $248 million of foreign cash to the United States at the end of the third quarter of fiscal 2018, which was used to repay outstanding revolving debt facilities. To the extent the cash balances held in foreign locations cannot be remitted back to the U.S. in a tax efficient manner, those cash balances are generally used for ongoing working capital, capital expenditure needs and to support acquisitions, and are currently expected to be permanently reinvested outside the United States. The Company is still evaluating the impact of repatriating any additional foreign cash as a result of the Act. In addition, local government regulations may restrict the Company’s ability to move funds among various locations under certain circumstances. Management does not believe such restrictions would limit the Company’s ability to pursue its intended business strategy. Management believes that Avnet’s available borrowing capacity, its current cash on hand including the remaining proceeds and marketable securities from the sale of the TS business and the Company’s expected ability to generate operating cash flows in the future will be sufficient to meet its future liquidity needs. The Company also may issue debt or equity securities in the future and management believes the Company will have adequate access to the capital markets, if needed.  



 Historically the Company has made, and expects to continue to make, strategic investments through acquisition activity to the extent the investments strengthen Avnet’s competitive position, further its business strategies and meet management’s return on capital thresholds. The Company also expects to make capital expenditures, including expenditures for ERP systems. Additionally, as the Company integrates PF and restructures to transform Avnet into an electronic components focused business, the Company expects to use cash for restructuring, integration and other expenses.  





 Table of Contents  



 In addition to continuing to make investments in acquisitions, as of March 31, 2018, the Company may repurchase up to an aggregate of $389.6 million of shares of the Company’s common stock through a $1.95 billion share repurchase program approved by the Board of Directors. The Company may repurchase stock from time to time at the discretion of management, subject to strategic considerations, market conditions and other factors. The Company may terminate or limit the share repurchase program at any time without prior notice. The timing and actual number of shares repurchased will depend on a variety of factors such as share price, corporate and regulatory requirements, and prevailing market conditions. Additionally, the Company currently expects to pay quarterly cash dividends on shares of its common stock, subject to approval of the Board of Directors. During the third quarter of fiscal 2018, the Board of Directors approved a dividend of $0.19 per share, which resulted in $22.6 million of dividend payments during the quarter.
