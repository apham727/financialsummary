1.
Basis of presentation and new accounting pronouncements
​
In the opinion of management, the accompanying unaudited interim consolidated financial statements contain all adjustments necessary to present fairly Avnet, Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries’ (collectively, the “Company” or “Avnet”) financial position, results of operations, comprehensive income and cash flows.
All such adjustments are of a normal recurring nature.
​
The preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (“GAAP”) requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements.
Actual results may differ from these estimates.
​
Interim results of operations are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for the full fiscal year.
The information included in this Form 10-Q should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes included in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 29, 2019.
​
Certain reclassifications have been made in prior periods to conform to the current period presentation.
​
Recently adopted accounting pronouncements
​
The Company adopted Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) No.
2016-02, “Leases (Topic 842),” and its related amendments (collectively “ASC 842”) on June 30, 2019 (the first day of fiscal 2020) using the modified transition approach without restating the comparative period consolidated financial statements.
The standard requires lessees to recognize a right-of-use (“ROU”) asset and lease liability for all leases.
 ​
The adoption of ASC 842 did not have a material impact on the Company’s consolidated statements of operations or retained earnings.
The Company elected the package of practical expedients permitted under the transition guidance that allowed, among other things, the historical lease classification to be carried forward without reassessment and the hindsight practical expedient.
The Company elected to not separate lease and non-lease components for its real estate leases.
Refer to Note 5 for additional disclosures related to leases.
​
In August 2017, the FASB issued ASU 2017-12, Derivatives and Hedging (Topic 815) - Targeted Improvements to Accounting for Hedging Activities” and its related amendments (collectively “ASC 815”), which improves the financial reporting of hedging relationships to better portray the economic results of an entity’s risk management activities in its financial statements and makes certain targeted improvements to simplify the qualification and application of hedge accounting compared to current GAAP.
This update is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, with early adoption permitted.
The adoption of ASC 815 in the first quarter of fiscal 2020 did not have any impact on the Company’s consolidated financial statements.

​
In February 2017, the Company completed the sale of its Technology Solutions business (“TS business”) to Tech Data Corporation (the “Buyer”).
The TS business and the financial impacts of the divestiture are classified as discontinued operations in all periods presented.
In August 2018, the Company executed a settlement agreement with the Buyer resulting in a final adjustment of $120.0 million and a final geographic allocation of the TS business sales price for tax reporting purposes.
This incremental consideration received from the sale of the TS business as well as cash settlements from the resolution of indemnification claims and other cash reimbursements have been classified as cash flow from discontinued operations investing activities.
Income tax payments related to the gain on sale of the TS business have been classified as cash flow from discontinued operations operating activities.
​
Under the contractual terms of the sale of the TS business, the Company has indemnified the Buyer for certain liabilities including tax related matters, which may result in future indemnification expenses and indemnification payments to the Buyer depending upon the outcome of those matters subject to indemnification.

Goodwill and intangible assets
​
Goodwill
​
The following table presents the change in goodwill by reportable segment for the three months ended September 28, 2019.
​
The Company evaluates each quarter if facts and circumstances indicate that it is more likely than not that the fair value of its reporting units is less than their carrying value, which would require the Company to perform an interim goodwill impairment test.
Indicators the Company evaluates to determine whether an interim goodwill impairment test is necessary include, but are not limited to, (i) a sustained decrease in share price or market capitalization as of any fiscal quarter end, (ii) changes in the macroeconomic or industry environments, (iii) the results of and the amount of time passed since the last goodwill impairment test and (iv) the long-term expected financial performance of its reporting units.
During the first quarter of fiscal 2020, the Company concluded that an interim goodwill impairment test was not required.

The Company has an accounts receivable securitization program (the “Securitization Program”) in the United States with a group of financial institutions to allow the Company to transfer, on an ongoing revolving basis, an undivided interest in a designated pool of trade accounts receivable, to provide security or collateral for borrowings up to a maximum of $500 million.
The Securitization Program does not qualify for off balance sheet accounting treatment and any borrowings under the Securitization Program are recorded as debt in the consolidated balance sheets.
Under the Securitization Program, the Company legally sells and isolates certain U.S. trade accounts receivable into a wholly owned and consolidated bankruptcy remote special purpose entity.
Such receivables, which are recorded within “Receivables” in the consolidated balance sheets, totaled $839.6 million and $857.3 million at September 28, 2019, and June 29, 2019, respectively.
The Securitization Program contains certain covenants relating to the quality of the receivables sold.
The Securitization Program also requires the Company to maintain certain minimum interest coverage and leverage ratios, which the Company was in compliance with as of September 28, 2019, and June 29, 2019.
The Securitization Program expires in August 2020 and as a result the Company has classified outstanding balances as short-term debt as of September 28, 2019.
Interest on borrowings is calculated using a one-month LIBOR rate plus a spread of 0.75%.
The facility fee on the unused balance of the facility is up to 0.35%.
​
​
The Company has a five-year $1.25 billion senior unsecured revolving credit facility (the “Credit Facility”) with a syndicate of banks, consisting of revolving credit facilities and the issuance of up to $200.0 million of letters of credit and up to $300.0 million of loans in certain approved currencies, which expires in June 2023.
Subject to certain conditions, the Credit Facility may be increased up to $1.50 billion.
Under the Credit Facility, the Company may select from various interest rate options, currencies and maturities.
The Credit Facility contains certain covenants including various limitations on debt incurrence, share repurchases, dividends, investments and capital expenditures.
The Credit Facility also includes financial covenants requiring the Company to maintain minimum interest coverage and leverage ratios, which the Company was in compliance with as of September 28, 2019 and June 29, 2019.
As of September 28, 2019, and June 29, 2019, there were $4.2 million and $4.0 million, respectively, in letters of credit issued under the Credit Facility.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (Continued)
As of September 28, 2019, the carrying value and fair value of the Company’s total debt was $1.83 billion and $1.91 billion, respectively.
At June 29, 2019, the carrying value and fair value of the Company’s total debt was $1.72 billion and $1.78 billion, respectively.
Fair value for the public notes was estimated based upon quoted market prices and for other forms of debt fair value approximates carrying value due to the market based variable nature of the interest rates on those debt facilities.
​
​
Substantially all the Company’s leases are classified as operating leases and are predominately related to real property for distribution centers, office space and integration facilities with a remaining lease term of up to 19 years.
The Company’s equipment leases are primarily for automobiles and equipment and are not material to the consolidated financial statements.
​
The Company determines if an arrangement contains a lease at inception based on whether it conveys the right to control the use of an identified asset in exchange for consideration.
Lease right-of-use assets (“operating lease assets”) and associated liabilities (“operating lease liabilities”) are recognized at the commencement date of the lease based on the present value of lease payments over the lease term.
Certain lease agreements may include one or more options to extend or terminate a lease.
Lease terms are inclusive of these options if it is reasonably certain that the Company will exercise such options.
​
The Company’s leases generally do not provide a readily determinable implicit borrowing rate, as such, the discount rate used to calculate present value is the Company’s incremental secured borrowing rate.
The incremental secured borrowing rates used at the date of adoption for each lease varies in accordance with the remaining lease term and the currency of the lease payments.
Lease cost is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term and is included as a component of “Selling, general, and administrative expenses” in the consolidated statements of operations.
Lease payments are primarily fixed; however, certain lease agreements contain variable payments, which are expensed as incurred and not included in the measurement of operating lease assets and liabilities.

Derivative financial instruments
​
Many of the Company’s subsidiaries purchase and sell products in currencies other than their functional currencies.
This subjects the Company to the risks associated with fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates.
The Company reduces this risk by utilizing natural hedging (e.g., offsetting receivables and payables in the same foreign currency) as well as by creating offsetting positions through the use of derivative financial instruments, primarily forward foreign exchange contracts typically with maturities of less than 60 days (“economic hedges”), but no longer than one year.
The Company continues to have exposure to foreign currency risks to the extent they are not economically hedged.
The Company adjusts any economic hedges to fair value through the consolidated statements of operations primarily within “Other income (expense), net.” The fair value of forward foreign exchange contracts, which are based upon Level 2 criteria under the ASC 820 fair value hierarchy, are classified in the captions “Prepaid and other current assets” or “Accrued expenses and other,” as applicable, in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets as of September 28, 2019 and June 29, 2019.
The Company’s master netting and other similar arrangements with various financial institutions related to derivative financial instruments allow for the right of offset.
The Company’s policy is to present derivative financial instruments with the same counterparty as either a net asset or liability when the right of offset exists.
​
The Company generally does not hedge its investments in its foreign operations.
The Company does not enter into derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes and monitors the financial stability and credit standing of its counterparties.
​
AVNET, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (Continued)
​
​
​
Under the Company’s economic hedging policies, gains and losses on the derivative financial instruments are classified within the same line item in the consolidated statements of operations as the underlying assets or liabilities being economically hedged.
​

Commitments and contingencies
​
From time to time, the Company may become a party to, or be otherwise involved in various lawsuits, claims, investigations and other legal proceedings arising in the ordinary course of conducting its business.
While litigation is subject to inherent uncertainties, management does not anticipate that any such matters will have a material adverse effect on the Company’s financial condition, liquidity or results of operations.
​
​
As of September 28, 2019, and June 29, 2019, the Company had aggregate estimated liabilities of $14.7 million classified within accrued expenses and other for such compliance-related matters that were reasonably estimable as of such dates.

​
The Company’s effective tax rate on its income from continuing operations before taxes was (22.7)% in the first quarter of fiscal 2020 as compared with 27.3% in the first quarter of fiscal 2019.
During the first quarter of fiscal 2020, the Company’s effective tax rate was favorably impacted primarily by (i) the release of unrecognized tax benefit reserves and (ii) the mix of income in lower tax jurisdictions.
During the first quarter of fiscal 2019, the Company’s effective tax rate was unfavorably impacted primarily by (i) an adjustment to the provisional estimate for the one-time mandatory deemed repatriation tax liability recorded under the requirements of recent tax law changes in the United States (the “Act”) and (ii) increases in unrecognized tax benefits, partially offset by (iii) an adjustment to the provisional deferred tax impacts of the Act and (iv) the mix of income in lower tax jurisdictions.
​
The Company’s effective tax rates in fiscal years 2019 and 2020 are based on the Company’s interpretation of tax regulations under the Act including the computation of Global Intangible Low Taxed Income (“GILTI”).
The Company has made a policy election to account for any impacts of the GILTI tax as a period expense.
The Company’s effective tax rate may change in future periods due to changes in U.S. tax regulations and the issuance of additional guidance related to the Act.
​
