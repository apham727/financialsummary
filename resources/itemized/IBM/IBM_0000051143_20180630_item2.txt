MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS
 OF RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION
 FOR THE THREE AND SIX MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2018
Snapshot
nm - not meaningful
Effective January 1, 2018, the company adopted the FASB guidance on presentation of net periodic pension and nonpension postretirement benefit costs (net benefit cost).
The guidance is primarily a change in financial statement presentation, but it did impact the consolidated and reportable segment gross profit margins and expense and other income.
As a result, the company aligned its presentation of operating (non-GAAP) earnings to conform to the FASB presentation of these costs in the Consolidated Statement of Earnings.
The periods presented in this Form 10-Q are reported on a comparable basis.
The company filed a Form 8-K on March 29, 2018 to recast its historical consolidated and segment information to reflect the change.
The references to adjusted for currency or at constant currency in the Management Discussion do not include operational impacts that could result from fluctuations in foreign currency rates.
When the company refers to growth rates at constant currency or adjusts such growth rates for currency, it is done so that certain financial results can be viewed without the impact of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, thereby facilitating period-to-period comparisons of its business performance.
Financial results adjusted for currency are calculated by translating current period activity in local currency using the comparable prior year periods currency conversion rate.
This approach is used for countries where the functional currency is the local currency.
Generally, when the dollar either strengthens or weakens against other currencies, the growth at constant currency rates or adjusting for currency will be higher or lower than growth reported at actual exchange rates.
Refer to Currency Rate Fluctuations on pages 85 and 86 for additional information.

Management Discussion  (continued)
Overall, the company believes that providing investors with a view of operating earnings as described above provides increased transparency and clarity into both the operational results of the business and the performance of the companys pension plans; improves visibility to management decisions and their impacts on operational performance; enables better comparison to peer companies; and allows the company to provide a long-term strategic view of the business going forward.
The companys reportable segment financial results reflect operating earnings from continuing operations, consistent with the companys management and measurement system.
The following table provides the companys (non-GAAP) operating earnings for the second quarter of 2018 and 2017.

Total consolidated revenue increased 3.7 percent as reported and 1.6 percent adjusted for currency, reflecting the companys highest constant currency growth in seven years.
There was continued momentum in revenue across the strategic imperatives in the second quarter, led by cloud and security.
Strategic imperatives revenue of $10.1 billion increased 15 percent as reported and 13 percent adjusted for currency in the second quarter, led by cloud and security.
Cloud revenue of $4.7 billion increased 20 percent (18 percent adjusted for currency) driven by as-a-Service revenue which grew 26 percent as reported and 24 percent adjusted for currency.
The annual exit run rate for as-a-Service revenue increased to $11.1 billion in the second quarter of 2018 compared to $8.8 billion in the second quarter of 2017.
Security grew 81 percent as reported (79 percent adjusted for currency) driven by strong demand for the pervasive encryption of IBM Z and growth in integrated software and services.
Analytics revenue of $5.4 billion increased 7 percent as reported and 5 percent adjusted for currency.
Mobile revenue increased 5 percent as reported and 3 percent adjusted for currency.
The consolidated gross margin of 46.0 percent decreased 0.5 points year to year.
The operating (non-GAAP) gross margin of 46.5 percent decreased 0.6 points year to year with approximately half of this impact driven by revenue mix and half driven by continued investments to build out the IBM Cloud.
Productivity had minimal benefit to the year-to-year gross margin dynamics this quarter with actions taken in the first quarter expected to yield savings in the second half of 2018.
Total expense and other (income) decreased 1.6 percent in the second quarter of 2018.
The year-to-year decrease was due to lower spending (5 points) as the company continues to realize acquisition synergies and drives operational efficiencies by streamlining its management system, scaling agile and implementing new ways of working.
This benefit was partially offset by the effects of currency (2 points) and a lower level of intellectual property (IP) income (2 points).
Total operating (non-GAAP) expense and other (income) decreased 2.1 percent year to year, driven primarily by the same factors.
Pre-tax income from continuing operations of $2.8 billion increased 13.6 percent and the pre-tax margin was 13.9 percent, an increase of 1.2 points year to year.

Operating (non-GAAP) diluted earnings per share of $3.08 increased 4.8 percent versus the second quarter of 2017.
The company generated $2.3 billion in cash flow provided by operating activities, a decrease of $1.2 billion compared to the second quarter of 2017, driven primarily by a decrease in cash provided by receivables and an increase in cash income tax payments.
Net cash used in investing activities of $0.6 billion in the second quarter of 2018 was $1.0 billion lower than the prior year, primarily driven by net non-operating financing receivables ($1.3 billion).
Net cash used in financing activities of $2.5 billion increased $1.9 billion compared to the second quarter of 2017, driven primarily by an increase in net cash used for debt transactions ($2.3 billion) driven by a lower level of debt issuances; partially offset by a decrease in cash used for gross common share repurchases ($0.4 billion).
The company expects GAAP earnings per share from continuing operations of at least $11.60, and continues to expect operating (non-GAAP) earnings of at least $13.80 per diluted share for 2018.
The company continues to expect free cash flow to be approximately $12 billion in 2018.
Free cash flow realization is expected to be in excess of 100 percent of GAAP net income.

industry verticals and grow its Software-as-a-Service offerings.
There was growth in key areas, such as analytics, Watson platforms and industry-specific solutions, which continue to scale.
This was offset by transition in other areas, including talent, collaboration and commerce, as the company continues to modernize these offerings in response to secular market shifts.
Within Solutions Software, analytics grew year-to-year as reported and adjusted for currency driven by growth in the DB2 portfolio, data science offerings and the new IBM Cloud Private for Data offering, which makes data ready for AI.
Within industry solutions, strong growth was led by Watson Financial Services, which leverages businesses expertise to help clients manage increasing regulatory requirements and Watson IoT, as the business continues to embed AI across the IoT portfolio.

Management Discussion  (continued)
In the second quarter, Infrastructure Services revenue of $5,768 million increased 4.0 percent as reported (1 percent adjusted for currency) compared to the prior year, driven primarily by improved realization of revenue from backlog as the company shifts clients to the cloud.
During the second-quarter 2018, the company announced the expansion of IBM Cloud capabilities to 18 availability zones across the world.
This global expansion is important for clients to have the ability to better manage and control their data cloud journey as they implement hybrid cloud especially given increased data regulations.
Technical Support Services second-quarter revenue of $1,750 million decreased 2.5 percent as reported (4 percent adjusted for currency) due in part to the dynamics of the IBM Z product cycle as clients move from maintenance to warranty for the first year, partially offset by continued growth in core multi-vendor support services.

decreased 20.9 percent and pre-tax margin decreased 2.3 points to 7.5 percent.
The year-to-year pre-tax margin in the first six months of 2018 compared to the prior year included an impact of 1.4 points from a higher level of workforce rebalancing charges in the first quarter which are expected to yield productivity benefits in the second half of 2018.
Services Backlog and Signings
The estimated total services backlog at June 30, 2018 was $116 billion, a decrease of 1.6 percent as reported (1 percent adjusted for currency).
Global Technology Services (GTS) backlog was essentially flat as reported and adjusted for currency year to year and GBS backlog declined year to year both as reported and adjusted for currency.
Total services backlog includes Infrastructure Services, Consulting, Global Process Services, Application Management and Technical Support Services.
Total backlog is intended to be a statement of overall work under contract which is either non-cancellable, or which historically has very low likelihood of termination, given the criticality of certain services to the companys clients.
Total backlog does not include as-a-Service arrangements that allow for termination under contractual commitment terms.
Backlog estimates are subject to change and are affected by several factors, including terminations, changes in the scope of contracts, periodic revalidations, adjustments for revenue not materialized and adjustments for currency.
Services signings are managements initial estimate of the value of a clients commitment under a services contract.
There are no third-party standards or requirements governing the calculation of signings.
The calculation used by management involves estimates and judgments to gauge the extent of a clients commitment, including the type and duration of the agreement, and the presence of termination charges or wind-down costs.
Signings include Infrastructure Services, Consulting, Global Process Services and Application Management contracts.
Contract extensions and increases in scope are treated as signings only to the extent of the incremental new value.
Technical Support Services (TSS) are generally not included in signings as maintenance contracts tend to be more steady state, where revenues equal renewals.
Certain longer-term TSS contracts that have characteristics similar to outsourcing contracts are included in signings.
Contract portfolios purchased in an acquisition are treated as positive backlog adjustments provided those contracts meet the companys requirements for initial signings.
A new signing will be recognized if a new services agreement is signed incidental or coincidental to an acquisition or divestiture.

The z14 adoption remained broad based, across most geographies and industries, with new clients added to the platform and existing clients growing and expanding workloads on the platform.
The company continues to address emerging workloads across the IBM Z platform including blockchain, machine learning, dev ops and payments.
The newly announced single-frame z14 designed specifically for cloud environments had good acceptance by clients during the second quarter.
Power Systems grew revenue 5.0 percent as reported (4 percent adjusted for currency) year to year, driven by the new POWER9 entry-level portfolio and continued growth in Linux.

Systems gross profit margin decreased 2.1 points to 50.6 percent in the second quarter of 2018 compared to the prior year, however, there was sequential improvement compared to the first quarter of 2018 (which declined 3.8 percent).
The overall decrease year-to-year was driven by margin declines in Operating System Software, partially mitigated by an increase in Systems Hardware margins primarily due to mix toward high margin IBM Z.
For the first six months of the year, Systems gross profit margin decreased 2.6 points to 47.8 percent compared to the prior year, driven by margin declines in Operating Systems Software.
Systems Hardware gross profit margin was flat year to year, with declines in IBM Z and Storage Systems offset by margin improvement in Power Systems.
In the second quarter of 2018, pre-tax income of $346 million grew 376.8 percent and pre-tax margin increased 10.5 points year to year to 14.3 percent driven primarily by the IBM Z product cycle.
For the first six months of the year, pre-tax income of $143 million increased $258 million and pre-tax margin increased 6.8 points year to year to 3.5 percent also due to the IBM Z product cycle, partially offset by actions taken in the first quarter to better position the systems cost structure over the longer term, which impacted the pre-tax margin by 2.7 points.
Global Financing
Global Financing is a reportable segment that is measured as a stand-alone entity.
Global Financing facilitates IBM clients acquisition of information technology systems, software and services by providing financing solutions in the areas where the company has the expertise, while generating strong returns on equity.
Global Financing also optimizes the recovery of residual values by selling assets sourced from end of lease, leasing used equipment to new clients, or extending lease arrangements with current clients.
Sales of equipment include equipment returned at the end of a lease, surplus internal equipment and used equipment purchased externally.
Residual value is a risk unique to the financing business and management of this risk is dependent upon the ability to accurately project future equipment values at lease inception.
Global Financing has insight into product plans and cycles for the IBM products under lease.
Based upon this product information, Global Financing continually monitors projections of future equipment values and compares them with the residual values reflected in the portfolio.

Results of Operations
In the second quarter of 2018, Global Financing total revenue of $867 million increased 23.0 percent compared to the prior year.
Internal revenue increased 62.9 percent, driven by an increase in internal used equipment sales (up 77.6 percent to $373 million), and an increase in internal financing (up 24.2 percent to $100 million).
External revenue decreased 4.9 percent as reported (6 percent adjusted for currency), due to a decrease in external used equipment sales (down 21.2 percent to $95 million), partially offset by an increase in external financing (up 1.8 percent to $299 million).
The increase in total revenue of $228 million in the first six months of 2018 compared to the same period in 2017 was due to an increase in internal revenue of 38.0 percent, driven by an increase in internal used equipment sales (up 46.2 percent to $698 million) and an increase in internal financing (up 16.0 percent to $204 million).
External revenue decreased 2.5 percent (5 percent adjusted for currency), driven by a decline in external used equipment sales (down 18.3 percent to $187 million), partially offset by an increase in external financing (up 3.7 percent to $612 million).
The year-to-year increases in internal financing revenue in the three and six months ended June 30, 2018 were due to higher asset yields and higher average asset balances.
The increases in external financing revenue in the second quarter and first six months of 2018, compared to the same periods in 2017, respectively, were due to higher average asset balances, partially offset by lower asset yields.
Total sales of used equipment represented 54.0 percent and 52.0 percent of Global Financings revenue in the second quarter and first six months of 2018, respectively, compared to 46.9 percent and 48.0 percent in the second quarter and first six months of 2017, respectively.
The increases in both periods were due to a higher volume of used equipment sales for internal transactions.
The gross profit margin on used sales was 58.3 percent and 50.5 percent in the second quarter of 2018 and 2017, respectively, and 58.6 percent and 51.0 percent in the first six months of 2018 and 2017, respectively.
The increase in the gross profit margin was driven by a shift towards higher margin internal equipment sales.
Global Financing pre-tax income increased 26.8 percent to $357 million in the second quarter of 2018, compared to the same period in 2017, due to higher gross profit of $95 million, partially offset by an increase in expense of $19 million.
Pre-tax income increased 23.9 percent to $734 million in the first six months of 2018, compared to the same period in 2017, due to higher gross profit of $154 million, partially offset by an increase in expense of $12 million.
The increase in expense for the three and six months ended June 30, 2018 was primarily driven by an increase in financing receivables provisions due to higher reserve requirements in the current year.
Global Financing return on equity was 31.2 percent and 31.9 percent for the three and six months ended June 30, 2018, respectively, compared to 26.0 percent and 25.1 percent for the three and six months ended June 30, 2017, respectively.
The increase in return on equity in the second quarter and first six months of 2018, compared to the same periods of 2017, was due to the increase in net income, partially offset by an increase in equity.
See page 88 for the details of the after-tax income and return on equity calculation.
Total unguaranteed residual value of leases, including operating leases, was $686 million as of June 30, 2018.
In addition to the unguaranteed residual value, on a limited basis, Global Financing will obtain guarantees of the future value of the equipment to be returned at end of lease.
Third-party residual value guarantees increase the minimum lease payments as provided for by accounting standards that are utilized in determining the classification of a lease as a sales-type lease, direct financing lease or operating lease.
The aggregate asset values associated with the guarantees of sales-type leases were $134 million and $63 million for the financing transactions originated during the quarters ended June 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively and $156 million and $106 million for the six months ended June 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively.

Interest Expense
Interest expense increased $26 million and $56 million year to year in the second quarter and first six months of 2018, respectively.
Interest expense is presented in cost of financing in the Consolidated Statement of Earnings if the related external borrowings are to support the Global Financing external business.
Overall interest expense (excluding capitalized interest) for the second quarter and first six months of 2018 was $367 million and $713 million, respectively, an increase of $47 million and $101 million versus the comparable prior year periods, primarily driven by a higher average debt balance and higher average interest rates.
Retirement-Related Plans
Table of Contents
Management Discussion  (continued)
In the second quarter of 2018, total pre-tax retirement-related plan cost increased by $39 million compared to the second quarter of 2017, primarily driven by lower expected return on plan assets ($66 million) and an increase in recognized actuarial losses ($26 million); partially offset by lower interest costs ($52 million).
Total cost for the first six months of 2018 increased by $102 million versus the first six months of 2017, primarily driven by lower expected return on plan assets ($114 million) and an increase in recognized actuarial losses ($67 million), partially offset by lower interest costs ($93 million).
As discussed in the Operating (non-GAAP) Earnings section on page 56, the company characterizes certain retirement-related costs as operating and others as non-operating.
Utilizing this characterization, operating retirement-related costs in the second quarter of 2018 were $364 million, a decrease of $7 million compared to the second quarter of 2017, primarily driven by lower defined contribution plans cost ($7 million).
Non-operating costs of $394 million in the second quarter of 2018 increased $45 million year to year, driven primarily by lower expected return on plan assets ($66 million) and an increase in recognized actuarial losses ($26 million), partially offset by lower interest costs ($52 million).
For the first six months of 2018, operating retirement-related costs were $750 million, an increase of $2 million compared to the first six months of 2017.
Non-operating costs of $796 million increased $100 million in the first six months of 2018 compared to the prior year, driven primarily by lower expected return on plan assets ($114 million) and an increase in recognized actuarial losses ($67 million); partially offset by lower interest costs ($93 million).
Taxes
The continuing operations effective tax rate for the second quarter of 2018 was 13.5 percent, an increase of 8.9 points compared to the second quarter of 2017.
The continuing operations effective tax rate for the first six months of 2018 was (4.3) percent, an increase of 1.4 points compared to the first six months of 2017.
The operating (non-GAAP) tax rate for the second quarter was 16.0 percent, an increase of 6.7 points compared to the second quarter of 2017.
The operating (non-GAAP) tax rate for the first six months of 2018 was 0.2 percent, a decrease of 1.6 points compared to the first six months of 2017.
The increase in the continuing operations effective tax rate in the second quarter of 2018 was primarily driven by a discrete tax benefit in the second quarter of 2017 attributable to foreign audit activity (7.0 points) and a decrease in foreign tax credits (3.7 points).
These impacts were partially offset by a more favorable mix of geographic income year to year (1.2 points) and a provisional benefit due to IRS guidance related to U.S. tax reform enactment issued in April 2018 (0.5 points).
The higher operating (non-GAAP) tax rate for the second quarter of 2018 was driven by the same factors, except for the impact of the provisional tax benefit related to U.S. tax reform.
The change in the continuing operations effective tax rate for the first six months of 2018 compared to 2017 was primarily driven by the year to year impacts above, as well as a discrete tax benefit in the first quarter of 2018 from the resolution of certain tax matters related to the ongoing U.S. federal audit of the companys 2013 and 2014 tax returns and the completion of the U.S. federal audit of amended tax returns of prior years in the first quarter of 2018.
These benefits were

partially offset by the prior-year tax benefit related to the intercompany transfer of IP recognized in the first quarter of 2017, and a first-quarter 2018 provisional tax charge due to the January 2018 IRS guidance related to U.S. tax reform enactment.
The change in the operating (non-GAAP) tax rate was primarily driven by the same factors, except for the impact of the provisional net tax charge in the first six months of 2018 related to U.S. tax reform enactment.
Earnings Per Share
Basic earnings per share is computed on the basis of the weighted-average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period.
Diluted earnings per share is computed on the basis of the weighted-average number of shares of common stock outstanding plus the effect of dilutive potential common shares outstanding during the period using the treasury stock method.
Dilutive potential common shares include outstanding stock options and stock awards.
Actual shares outstanding at June 30, 2018 were 912.8 million.
The weighted-average number of common shares outstanding assuming dilution during the second quarter and first six months of 2018 were 20.2 million and 21.3 million shares lower than the same periods of 2017.
The decreases were primarily the result of the common stock repurchase program.
Financial Position
Dynamics
At June 30, 2018, the balance sheet remained strong and the company continues to have the financial flexibility to support the business for the long term.
Cash, restricted cash and marketable securities at quarter end were $11,926 million.
The company continues to manage the investment portfolio to meet its capital preservation and liquidity objectives.
Total debt of $45,497 million decreased $1,326 million from December 31, 2017, driven by debt maturities of $3,652 million; partially offset by new debt issuances of $2,535 million.
Within total debt, $31,056 million, or approximately 68 percent, is in support of the Global Financing business.
In the first six months of 2018, the company generated $6,896 million in cash from operations, compared to $7,421 million in the first six months of 2017.
The company has consistently generated strong cash flows from operations and continues to have access to additional sources of liquidity through the capital markets and its credit facilities.

The assets and debt associated with the Global Financing business are a significant part of the companys financial position.
The financial position amounts appearing on pages 5 and 6 are the consolidated amounts including Global Financing.
At June 30, 2018, substantially all client and commercial financing assets were IT related assets, and approximately 54 percent of the total external portfolio was with investment grade clients with no direct exposure to consumers.
The increase in investment grade year to year (2 points) was driven primarily by rating changes within the existing portfolio, not by changing the companys approach to the market.
This investment grade percentage is based on the credit ratings of the companies in the portfolio.
The company has a long-standing practice of taking mitigating actions, in certain circumstances, to transfer credit risk to third parties, including credit insurance, financial guarantees, non-recourse borrowings, transfers of receivables recorded as true sales in accordance with accounting guidance or sales of equipment under operating lease.
Adjusting for the mitigation actions, the investment grade content would increase by 15 points to 70 percent, an increase of 2 points year to year.

Receivables and Allowances
Roll Forward of Total IBM Receivables Allowance for Credit Losses (included in Total IBM)
The total IBM receivables provision coverage was 1.8 percent at June 30, 2018, an increase of 20 basis points compared to December 31, 2017.
The majority of the write-offs during the six months ended June 30, 2018 related to Global Financing receivables, which had been previously reserved.
Global Financing Receivables and Allowances
The following table presents external Global Financing receivables excluding residual values, the allowance for credit losses and immaterial miscellaneous receivables.
The percentage of Global Financing receivables reserved increased from 1.1 percent at December 31, 2017, to 1.2 percent at June 30, 2018.
The increase was driven by the overall decline in gross receivables.
Specific reserves decreased 1 percent from $258 million at December 31, 2017, to $255 million at June 30, 2018.
Unallocated reserves increased 7 percent from $78 million at December 31, 2017, to $84 million at June 30, 2018.

Global Financings bad debt expense was $20 million for the three months ended June 30, 2018, compared to $6 million for the same period in 2017 due to higher specific reserve requirements in 2018.
Global Financings bad debt expense was $24 million for the six months ended June 30, 3018 compared to $16 million for the same period in 2017, primarily as a result of the same factor.
Noncurrent Assets and Liabilities
· A decrease of $768 million in long-term financing receivables ($645 million adjusted for currency) reflecting seasonal reductions from higher year-end balances; and
· A decrease in intangibles and goodwill of $705 million ($365 million adjusted for currency) resulting from intangibles amortization and currency impacts; partially offset by
· An increase in retirement plan assets of $732 million ($811 million adjusted for currency) driven by the expected returns on plan assets, partially offset by interest costs.
· Reclassifications to short-term debt of $3,774 million to reflect upcoming maturities; partially offset by
· Issuances of $2,396 million.
· A decrease in retirement and nonpension postretirement liabilities of $758 million driven by a currency impact of $308 million.
Debt
The companys funding requirements are continually monitored and strategies are executed to manage the overall asset and liability profile.
Additionally, the company maintains sufficient flexibility to access global funding sources as needed.

Total debt of $45,497 million decreased $1,326 million from December 31, 2017, driven by debt maturities of $3,652 million; partially offset by new debt issuances of $2,535 million.
Non-Global Financing debt of $14,441 million was down $949 million from December 31, 2017 and down $2,186 million from June 30, 2017.
Global Financing debt-to-equity ratio
The debt used to fund Global Financing assets is composed of intercompany loans and external debt.
Total debt changes generally correspond with the level of client and commercial financing receivables, the level of cash and cash equivalents, the change in intercompany and external payables and the change in intercompany investment from IBM.
The terms of the intercompany loans are set by the company to substantially match the term, currency and interest rate variability underlying the financing receivable and are based on arms-length pricing.
Global Financing provides financing predominantly for the companys external client assets, as well as for assets under contract by other IBM units.
As previously stated, the company measures Global Financing as a stand-alone entity, and accordingly, interest expense relating to debt supporting Global Financings external client and internal business is included in the Global Financing Results of Operations on page 70 and in note 7, Segments, on pages 36 and 37.
In the companys Consolidated Statement of Earnings, the external debt-related interest expense supporting Global Financings internal financing to the company is reclassified from cost of financing to interest expense.
Equity
Total equity increased by $923 million from December 31, 2017 primarily due to increases from net income ($4,083 million), an increase in retirement-related amounts ($1,121 million) and transition adjustments related to the adoption of the new revenue standard ($524 million); partially offset by decreases from dividends ($2,819 million) and an increase in treasury stock ($1,859 million) primarily due to share repurchases.
Cash Flow
The companys cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities, as reflected in the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows on page 7, are summarized in the following table.
These amounts include the cash flows associated with the Global Financing business.

· A decrease in cash used for gross common share repurchases of $959 million.
Looking Forward
The companys strategies, investments and actions are all made with an objective of optimizing long-term performance.
A long-term perspective ensures that the company is well-positioned to take advantage of the major shifts in technology, business and the global economy.
As part of its strategic model, the company expects to continue to allocate capital efficiently and effectively to investments, and to return value to shareholders through a combination of dividends and share repurchases.
Over the long term, in consideration of the opportunities it will continue to develop, the company expects to have the ability to generate low single-digit revenue growth, and with a higher-value business mix, mid single-digit profit growth, high single-digit operating (non-GAAP) earnings per share growth, with free cash flow realization of GAAP net income over 90 percent.
Over the last several years, the company has been making investments and shifting resources, embedding AI and cloud into its offerings while building new solutions and modernizing its existing platforms.
These investments not only drive current performance, but will extend the companys innovation leadership into the future.
The companys key differentiators are built around three pillars - innovative technology, industry expertise and trust and security, uniquely delivered through an integrated model.
The companys results in the second quarter and first six months of 2018 reflect the work that has been done to reposition the business through investment, shifting skills and reallocating capital.
These shifts reflect the companys vision of what clients value in a rapidly re-ordering IT industry, driven by cloud, data and AI.
In the second quarter, the company delivered revenue growth, as reported and adjusted for currency, pre-tax income growth (GAAP and operating (non-GAAP))
Table of Contents
Management Discussion  (continued)
and earnings per share growth.
The company expects typical seasonality for the third quarter with respect to sequential revenue performance and year-to-date earnings per share attainment.
Since April 2018 expectations, currency markets experienced significant volatility and the company now expects currency to be a 1 point tailwind for full-year 2018 revenue growth, which includes a 1 to 2 point headwind in the second half of the year.
Even with this change, the company continues to expect full-year revenue growth at mid-July spot rates, and the companys expectations of pre-tax profit remain unchanged.
Consistent with the long-term model, the company also expects, over the course of 2018, to continue to acquire key capabilities, remix skills, invest in areas of growth and return value to shareholders.
A high level of investment is important as the company continues to build its capabilities in AI, cloud, security and blockchain, among others.
The actions taken in the first-quarter 2018 to reposition the business are aligned with this strategy.
While there was some benefit in the second quarter, the majority of the benefit from first-quarter workforce rebalancing actions is expected in the second-half 2018.
In the second half of 2018, the company will continue to invest in Cloud but will also continue to realize scale efficiencies partially driven by as-a-Service revenue.
The company continues to expect expansion of total services margins in the second half.
Overall, the company expects GAAP earnings per share from continuing operations for 2018 to be at least $11.60; excluding acquisition-related charges of $0.78 per share, non-operating retirement-related items of $1.32 per share and U.S. tax reform related one-time charges of $0.10 per share, operating (non-GAAP) earnings per share is expected to be at least $13.80.
Free cash flow realization, which is defined as free cash flow to income from continuing operations (GAAP), is expected to be over 100%.
The company continues to expect free cash flow to be approximately $12 billion in 2018.
Free cash flow expectations for the year include a year-to-year headwind from strong receivables performance in 2017, a year-to-year headwind from cash tax payments, which has been fully realized by the end of the second quarter, and a full year expected increase in capital expenditures.
For 2018, the company expects the GAAP tax rate to be approximately 2 points lower than the operating (non-GAAP) tax rate expectation.
The company expects its operating (non-GAAP) tax rate for 2018 to be 16 percent, plus or minus 2 points (excluding discrete items), which is a headwind year to year.
The tax rates reflect U.S. tax reform, which includes a lower U.S. corporate tax rate, offset by the broader tax base and reduced foreign tax credit utilization.
The rate will change year to year based on discrete tax events, such as the settlement of income tax audits and changes in tax laws, as well as recurring factors including the geographic mix of income before taxes, state and local taxes and the effects of various global income tax strategies.
The GAAP tax rate could also be affected by any change to the net provisional charge recorded by the company for U.S. tax reform enactment.
The company expects 2018 pre-tax retirement-related plan cost to be approximately $3.1 billion, an increase of approximately $200 million compared to 2017.
This estimate reflects current pension plan assumptions at December 31, 2017.
Consistent with the new FASB guidance for the presentation of net periodic pension and postretirement benefit costs, within total retirement-related plan cost, operating retirement-related plan cost is expected to be approximately $1.5 billion, approximately flat versus 2017.
Non-operating retirement-related plan cost is expected to be approximately $1.6 billion, an increase of approximately $200 million compared to 2017, driven by lower income from expected return on assets and a year-to-year impact due to the pension obligation adjustment resulting from the successful resolution of the UK pension litigation matter in 2017.
Contributions for all retirement-related plans are expected to be approximately $2.4 billion in 2018, approximately flat compared to 2017.
Currency Rate Fluctuations
Changes in the relative values of non-U.S. currencies to the U.S. dollar (USD) affect the companys financial results and financial position.
At June 30, 2018, currency changes resulted in assets and liabilities denominated in local currencies being translated into fewer dollars than at year-end 2017.
The company uses financial hedging instruments to limit specific currency risks related to financing transactions and other foreign currency-based transactions.
During periods of sustained movements in currency, the marketplace and competition adjust to the changing rates.
For example, when pricing offerings in the marketplace, the company may use some of the advantage from a weakening U.S. dollar to improve its position competitively, and price more aggressively to win the business, essentially passing on a portion of the currency advantage to its customers.
Competition will frequently take the same action.
Consequently, the company believes that some of the currency-based changes in cost impact the prices charged to clients.
The company also maintains
Table of Contents
Management Discussion  (continued)
currency hedging programs for cash management purposes which temporarily mitigate, but do not eliminate, the volatility of currency impacts on the companys financial results.
The company translates revenue, cost and expense in its non-U.S. operations at current exchange rates in the reported period.
References to adjusted for currency or constant currency reflect adjustments based upon a simple mathematical formula.
However, this constant currency methodology that the company utilizes to disclose this information does not incorporate any operational actions that management could take to mitigate fluctuating currency rates.
Currency movements impacted the companys year-to-year revenue and earnings per share growth in the first six months of 2018.
Based on the currency rate movements in the first six months of 2018, total revenue increased 4.4 percent as reported and 0.8 percent at constant currency versus the first six months of 2017.
On an income from continuing operations before income tax basis, these translation impacts offset by the net impact of hedging activities resulted in a theoretical maximum (assuming no pricing or sourcing actions) increase of approximately $175 million in the first six months of 2018 on an as-reported basis and an increase of approximately $200 million on an operating (non-GAAP) basis.
The same mathematical exercise resulted in no impact as reported and a decrease of approximately $10 million in the first six months of 2017 on an operating (non-GAAP) basis.
The company views these amounts as a theoretical maximum impact to its as-reported financial results.
Considering the operational responses mentioned above, movements of exchange rates, and the nature and timing of hedging instruments, it is difficult to predict future currency impacts on any particular period, but the company believes it could be substantially less than the theoretical maximum given the competitive pressure in the marketplace.
For non-U.S. subsidiaries and branches that operate in U.S. dollars or whose economic environment is highly inflationary, translation adjustments are reflected in results of operations.
Generally, the company manages currency risk in these entities by linking prices and contracts to U.S. dollars.
In the recent months there have been reported economic events impacting the Argentinean economy, such as significant depreciation of the Argentine peso, increases in interest rates and the Argentine government requesting financial assistance from the International Monetary Fund.
The three-year cumulative inflation rates, using a combination of monthly indices, exceeds the 100% threshold for hyperinflation.
As a result, effective July 1, 2018, the company changed the functional currency from local currency to U.S. dollar functional for Argentina.
The impact from the change is not expected to be material given the size of the companys operations in the country (less than 1 percent of total 2017 revenue).
Liquidity and Capital Resources
In the companys 2017 Annual Report, on pages 67 to 70, there is a discussion of the companys liquidity including two tables that present five years of data.
The table presented on page 67 includes net cash from operating activities, cash and marketable securities and the size of the companys global credit facilities for each of the past five years.
For the six months ended, or as of, as applicable, June 30, 2018, those amounts are $6.9 billion for net cash from operating activities, $11.9 billion of cash, restricted cash and marketable securities and $15.3 billion in global credit facilities, respectively.
The major rating agencies ratings on the companys debt securities at June 30, 2018 appear in the table below.
The ratings remain unchanged from December 31, 2017.
The company does not have ratings trigger provisions in its debt covenants or documentation, which would allow the holders to declare an event of default and seek to accelerate payments thereunder in the event of a change in credit rating.
The companys contractual agreements governing derivative instruments contain standard market clauses which can trigger the termination of the agreement if the companys credit rating were to fall below investment grade.
At June 30, 2018, the fair value of those instruments that were in a liability position was $256 million, before any applicable netting, and this position is subject to fluctuations in fair value period to period based on the level of the companys outstanding instruments and market conditions.
The company has no other contractual arrangements that, in the event of a change in credit rating, would result in a material adverse effect on its financial position or liquidity.
The company prepares its Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows in accordance with applicable accounting standards for cash flow presentation on page 7 of this Form 10-Q and highlights causes and events underlying sources and uses of cash in that format on page 84.
For the purpose of running its business, the company manages, monitors and analyzes cash flows in a different manner.

Management Discussion  (continued)
Management uses free cash flow as a measure to evaluate its operating results, plan share repurchase levels, strategic investments and assess its ability and need to incur and service debt.
The entire free cash flow amount is not necessarily available for discretionary expenditures.
The company defines free cash flow as net cash from operating activities less the change in Global Financing receivables and net capital expenditures, including the investment in software.
A key objective of the Global Financing business is to generate strong returns on equity, and increasing receivables is the basis for growth.
Accordingly, management considers Global Financing receivables as a profit-generating investment, not as working capital that should be minimized for efficiency.
Therefore, management includes presentations of both free cash flow and net cash from operating activities that exclude the effect of Global Financing receivables.
Free cash flow guidance is derived using an estimate of profit, working capital and operational cash outflows.
As previously noted, the company views Global Financing receivables as a profit-generating investment which it seeks to maximize and therefore it is not considered when formulating guidance for free cash flow.
As a result the company does not estimate a GAAP Net Cash from Operations expectation metric.
The following is managements view of cash flows for the first six months of 2018 and 2017 prepared in a manner consistent with the description above.
In the first six months of 2018, the company generated free cash flow of $3.2 billion, a decrease of $0.4 billion versus the prior year driven by higher cash taxes and higher capital expenditures, partially offset by working capital performance.
Net capital expenditures of $1.9 billion increased $0.3 billion year to year reflecting increased investments to build out global cloud datacenters.
In the first six months of 2018, the company continued to focus its cash utilization on returning value to shareholders including $2.8 billion in dividends and $1.8 billion in gross common stock repurchases (11.7 million shares).
Events that could temporarily change the historical cash flow dynamics discussed previously and in the companys 2017 Annual Report include significant changes in operating results, material changes in geographic sources of cash, unexpected adverse impacts from litigation, future pension funding requirements during periods of severe downturn in the capital markets or the timing of tax payments.
Whether any litigation has such an adverse impact will depend on a number of variables, which are more completely described in note 13, Contingencies, in this Form 10-Q.
With respect to pension funding, the company expects to make legally mandated pension plan contributions to certain non-U.S. defined benefit plans of approximately $400 million in 2018.
Contributions related to all retirement-related plans are expected to be approximately $2.4 billion in 2018.
Financial market performance could increase the legally mandated minimum contributions in certain non-U.S. countries that require more frequent remeasurement of the funded status.
The company is not quantifying any further impact from pension funding because it is not possible to predict future movements in the capital markets or pension plan funding regulations.
In 2018, the company is not legally required to make any contributions to the U.S. defined benefit plans.
The companys U.S. cash flows continue to be sufficient to fund its current domestic operations and obligations, including investing and financing activities such as dividends and debt service.
The companys U.S. operations generate

substantial cash flows, and, in those circumstances where the company has additional cash requirements in the U.S., the company has several liquidity options available.
These options may include the ability to borrow additional funds at reasonable interest rates, utilizing its committed global credit facility, repatriating certain foreign earnings and utilizing intercompany loans with certain foreign subsidiaries.
