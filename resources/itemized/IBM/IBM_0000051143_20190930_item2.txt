FOR THE THREE AND NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2019
Snapshot
nm - not meaningful
Effective with the first quarter of 2019, the company made a number of changes to its organizational structure and management system.
As a result of these changes, the company revised its reportable segments.
There was no change to the company’s Consolidated Financial Statements.
Refer to note 8, “Segments” for additional information on the company’s reportable segments.
The periods presented in this Form 10-Q are reported on a comparable basis.
The company provided recast historical segment information reflecting these changes in a Form 8-K dated April 4, 2019.
The references to “adjusted for currency” or “at constant currency” in the Management Discussion do not include operational impacts that could result from fluctuations in foreign currency rates.
When the company refers to growth rates at constant currency or adjusts such growth rates for currency, it is done so that certain financial results can be viewed without the impact of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, thereby facilitating period-to-period comparisons of its business performance.
Financial results adjusted for currency are calculated by translating current period activity in local currency using the comparable prior year period’s currency conversion rate.
This approach is
Management Discussion – (continued)
used for countries where the functional currency is the local currency.
Generally, when the dollar either strengthens or weakens against other currencies, the growth at constant currency rates or adjusting for currency will be higher or lower than growth reported at actual exchange rates.
Refer to “Currency Rate Fluctuations” for additional information.
​
 To provide better transparency on the recurring performance of the ongoing business, the company provides revenue growth rates excluding divested businesses and at constant currency.
These divested businesses are included in the company’s Other segment.
​
Overall, the company believes that supplementally providing investors with a view of operating earnings as described above provides increased transparency and clarity into both the operational results of the business and the performance of the company’s pension plans; improves visibility to management decisions and their impacts on operational performance; enables better comparison to peer companies; and allows the company to provide a long-term strategic view of the business going forward.
The company’s reportable segment financial results reflect pre-tax operating earnings from continuing operations, consistent with the company’s management and measurement system.
In addition, these non-GAAP measures provide a perspective consistent with areas of interest the company routinely receives from investors and analysts.

​
 Total cloud revenue of $5.0 billion in the third quarter of 2019 grew 11 percent as reported and 12 percent adjusted for currency.
Over the trailing 12 months, total cloud revenue was $20.0 billion, up 5 percent (8 percent adjusted for currency) year to year.
​
Management Discussion – (continued)
 Total consolidated gross margin of 46.2 percent decreased 0.7 points year to year, primarily due to acquisition- related activity for Red Hat (including the deferred revenue adjustment, amortization of intangibles and retention costs) and from the businesses divested in the second quarter, partially offset by improvements in operating leverage.
Operating (non-GAAP) gross margin of 47.4 percent was flat versus the prior year, primarily driven by the same factors as above, excluding the amortization of intangibles.
 ​
 Total expense and other (income) increased 17.3 percent in the third quarter of 2019 versus the prior year primarily driven by higher spending including Red Hat, investments in software and systems innovation, and lower intellectual income (IP) income, partially offset by lower non-operating retirement-related costs and divested businesses.
Total operating (non-GAAP) expense and other (income) increased 15.9 percent year to year, driven primarily by the higher spending described above.
​
 Pre-tax income from continuing operations of $1.5 billion decreased 49.2 percent and the pre-tax margin was 8.4 percent, a decrease of 7.5 points versus the prior-year period.
This decline was primarily driven by the purchase accounting deferred revenue adjustment (lower revenue without an equivalent adjustment to cost and expense) and the acquisition-related activity.
The continuing operations effective tax rate for the third quarter of 2019 was (9.9) percent, a decrease of 20.1 points compared to the third quarter of 2018.
The year-to-year decrease was primarily driven by a benefit from the realization of a tax only capital loss in a subsidiary (10.7 points), an increase in tax benefits attributable to audit activity (4.3 points), as well as a benefit due to the mix of geographic income year to year (5.0 points), primarily driven by Red Hat.
Net income of $1.7 billion decreased 37.9 percent and the net income margin was 9.3 percent, a decrease of 5.1 points year to year.
 ​
 Operating (non-GAAP) pre-tax income from continuing operations of $2.4 billion decreased 33.4 percent year to year and the operating (non-GAAP) pre-tax margin from continuing operations decreased 5.9 points to 13.3 percent.
The operating (non-GAAP) tax rate for the third quarter of 2019 was 0.1 percent, a decrease of 12.7 points compared to the third quarter of 2018.
The change in the operating (non-GAAP) tax rate was primarily driven by the same factors mentioned above.
Operating (non-GAAP) income from continuing operations of $2.4 billion decreased 23.6 percent with an operating (non-GAAP) income margin from continuing operations of 13.3 percent, down 3.4 points year to year.
​
 Diluted earnings per share from continuing operations of $1.87 in the third quarter of 2019 decreased 36.4 percent and operating (non-GAAP) diluted earnings per share of $2.68 decreased 21.6 percent versus the third quarter of 2018.
In the third quarter of 2019, the company repurchased 0.8 million shares of its common stock at a cost of $0.1 billion and had $2.0 billion remaining in the current share repurchase authorization at September 30, 2019.
The company suspended its share repurchase program at the time of the Red Hat closing.
 The company generated $3.6 billion in cash flow provided by operating activities, a decrease of $0.6 billion compared to the third quarter of 2018.
In the third quarter of 2019, investing activities were a net use of cash of $30.4 billion compared to $3.0 billion in the prior year, primarily driven by cash used for the Red Hat acquisition.
Financing activities were a use of cash of $8.2 billion in the third quarter of 2019 compared to $0.4 billion in the prior year.
The $7.7 billion increase in financing cash outflows year to year was driven by net cash related to debt transactions.
In the third quarter of 2019, there was a net payment of debt of $6.6 billion versus $1.6 billion of net issuances in the prior year.
​
 The company expects GAAP earnings per share from continuing operations of at least $10.58 and continues to expect operating (non-GAAP) earnings of at least $12.80 per diluted share for 2019.
The company continues to expect free cash flow to be approximately $12 billion in 2019.
Refer to the Liquidity and Capital Resources section for additional information on this non-GAAP measure.
Refer to the Looking Forward section for additional information on the company’s expectations.

 2019 results were impacted by Red Hat purchase accounting and acquisition-related activity.
nm - not meaningful
 In the first nine months of 2019, the company reported $55.4 billion in revenue, $5.8 billion in income from continuing operations and operating (non-GAAP) earnings of $7.2 billion, resulting in diluted earnings per share from continuing operations of $6.46 as reported and $8.10 on an operating (non-GAAP) basis.
The company also generated $11.3 billion in cash from operations, $5.9 billion in free cash flow and delivered shareholder returns of $5.6 billion in dividends and gross common stock repurchases.
​
Management Discussion – (continued)
​
 The consolidated gross margin of 45.9 percent increased 0.5 points year to year, and the operating (non-GAAP) gross margin of 46.5 percent increased 0.6 points versus the prior year.
The improved margins in the first nine months of 2019 reflect the actions the company has taken to focus on higher value and portfolio optimization while also driving productivity and operational efficiency, partially offset by impacts from the Red Hat acquisition.
​
 Total expense and other (income) decreased 0.7 percent in the first nine months of 2019 compared to the prior year.
The year-to-year performance was driven by lower non-operating retirement-related costs (4 points), the impact of currency (4 points) and gains from divestitures (3 points), partially offset by higher spending including Red Hat (6 points), amortization of acquired intangible assets and other non-operating activity related to the Red Hat acquisition (3 points) and a decrease in IP income (2 points).
Total operating (non-GAAP) expense and other (income) increased 0.7 percent year to year, driven primarily by the same factors excluding the non-operating retirement-related costs and the amortization of acquired intangible assets and other non-operating activity related to the Red Hat acquisition.
​
 Pre-tax income from continuing operations of $6.2 billion decreased 10.6 percent and the pre-tax margin was 11.1 percent, a decrease of 0.8 points versus 2018.
Similar to the three months ended September 30, 2019, the nine month period was also impacted by the deferred revenue purchase accounting adjustment and Red Hat acquisition-related activity.
The continuing operations effective tax rate for the first nine months of 2019 was 6.6 percent, an increase of 4.6 points compared to the first nine months of 2018.
The year-to-year change was primarily driven by a reduced benefit related to audit activity compared to the prior year.
Net income of $5.8 billion decreased 15.0 percent and the net income margin was 10.4 percent, down 1.3 points year to year.
Operating (non-GAAP) pre-tax income from continuing operations of $7.8 billion decreased 10.4 percent year to year and the operating (non-GAAP) pre-tax margin from continuing operations decreased 1.0 point to 14.1 percent.
The operating (non-GAAP) tax rate for the first nine months of 2019 was 7.4 percent, an increase of 2.0 points compared to the first nine months of 2018.
The change in the operating (non-GAAP) tax rate was primarily driven by the same factors mentioned above.
Operating (non-GAAP) income from continuing operations of $7.2 billion decreased 12.3 percent with an operating (non-GAAP) income margin from continuing operations of 13.1 percent, down 1.2 points year to year.
​
 Diluted earnings per share from continuing operations of $6.46 in the first nine months of 2019 decreased 12.2 percent and operating (non-GAAP) diluted earnings per share of $8.10 decreased 9.6 percent versus the first nine months of 2018.

​
●Decreases from dividends of $4.3 billion and gross share repurchases of $1.3 billion.
​
 The company generated $11.3 billion in cash flow provided by operating activities, an increase of $0.2 billion compared to the first nine months of 2018, driven primarily by an increase in cash provided by financing receivables ($0.8 billion).
In the first nine months of 2019, investing activities were a net use of cash of $27.1 billion compared to $5.4 billion in the prior year.
The year-to-year increase was driven by an increase in cash used for acquisitions ($32.5 billion); partially offset by an increase in cash provided by non-operating finance receivables ($5.7 billion) and a decrease in cash used for net purchases of marketable securities and other investments ($3.1 billion).
In the first nine months of 2019, financing activities were a source of cash of $14.7 billion compared to a use of cash of $5.9 billion in the first nine months of 2018.

​
Cognitive Applications includes software that addresses vertical and domain-specific solutions, increasingly infused with AI.
This includes areas such as health, financial services, Internet of Things (IoT) solutions, The Weather Company and security software and services.
In the third quarter, Cognitive Applications revenue of $1,383 million grew 4.5 percent as reported (6 percent adjusted for currency) compared to the prior year, driven by double-digit growth in Security software and services, and in industry verticals such as the Internet of Things (IoT).
The Security performance included continued strong results in threat management software and services offerings.
Within IoT, there was good performance across the portfolio as the business continued to invest in new offerings and industry-specifc solutions.
​
Transaction Processing Platforms includes software that supports client mission critical on-premise workloads, including transaction processing software as well as analytics and integration software running on IBM operating systems.
In the third quarter, Transaction Processing Platforms revenue of $1,589 million decreased 4.8 percent as reported (4 percent adjusted for currency) compared to the prior year.
Although much of this business is annuity-based, the year-to-year decline in the third quarter revenue reflects the timing of larger transactions that are tied to client buying cycles.
 Recast to reflect segment changes.

​
In the third quarter, pre-tax income of $1,283 million decreased 37.4 percent compared to the prior year.
The pre-tax margin decreased 14.2 points to 21.5 percent in the third quarter, driven primarily by the purchase accounting impacts from the Red Hat acquisition.
For the first nine months of the year, pre-tax income of $5,052 million decreased 12.3 percent compared to the prior year and the pre-tax margin decreased 4.0 points to 27.9 percent.
The year-to-year margin decline in the first nine months of 2019 as compared to the same period in 2018 reflects the acquisition of Red Hat, ongoing investments in key strategic areas and a lower impact of IP partnership agreements in the first nine months of 2019.
Global Business Services revenue of $4,117 million increased 1.0 percent as reported and 2 percent adjusted for currency in the third quarter of 2019 compared to the prior year, driven primarily by strong performance in Consulting.
For the first nine months of the year, Global Business Services revenue of $12,391 million increased 0.5 percent as reported and 3 percent adjusted for currency.
This growth demonstrates GBS’ ability to bring together deep industry
Management Discussion – (continued)
expertise and technology to provide clients a holistic approach to de-risk and orchestrate their digital transformation journey.
​
Application Management revenue of $1,897 million declined 1.0 percent as reported, but was flat adjusted for currency compared to the third-quarter 2018, driven primarily by growth in application modernization offerings.
Cloud application offerings help clients to implement cloud-centric architectures to modernize and automate their application portfolio.
As the company has been standardizing on Red Hat OpenShift as the preferred development platform, there was early progress in synergies in the quarter.
​
Global Process Services third-quarter revenue of $247 million decreased 5.1 percent as reported and 3 percent adjusted for currency.
​
GBS third-quarter gross profit margin of 31.1 percent grew 1.1 points on a year-to-year basis, driven by the continued mix shift to higher-value offerings, the yield from delivery improvement, productivity, and utilization initiatives and a currency benefit from leveraging the global delivery resource model.
Pre-tax income increased to $573 million and pre-tax margin of 13.7 percent was flat year to year in the third quarter of 2019 compared to the prior year.
For the first nine months of the year, pre-tax income of $1,188 million increased 11.7 percent and the pre-tax margin increased 1.0 points to 9.4 percent.
The pre-tax margin for the first nine months of 2019 included a lower level of workforce rebalancing charges year to year.
Management Discussion – (continued)
 Global Technology Services revenue of $6,700 million declined 5.6 percent as reported (4 percent adjusted for currency) in the third quarter of 2019 compared to the prior year.
There was continued growth in services that help clients move and manage workloads.
However, performance in the segment reflects lower in-period revenue from client business volumes in certain markets and some multi-national clients.
Although these lower volumes impact near-term revenue and profit, the business had good long-term signings and a solid pipeline of future deals that will deliver productivity to clients.
For the first nine months of the year, Global Technology Services revenue of $20,412 million declined 6.6 percent as reported (4 percent adjusted for currency).
Management Discussion – (continued)
Global Technology Services gross profit margin decreased 1.2 points to 35.8 percent in the third quarter of 2019.
Margin decline was primarily driven by the lower in-period client business volumes in the quarter.
The business has not yet realized the cost benefits of workforce actions taken in the second-quarter 2019, but continues to scale its Agile services delivery model and is accelerating its use of AI and automation in delivery operations, including leveraging Red Hat’s Ansible platform, which is expected to increase delivery productivity.
Third-quarter pre-tax income decreased to $490 million and pre-tax margin decreased 1.2 points to 7.0 percent, reflecting the decline in gross profit margin.
For the first nine months of the year, pre-tax income of $1,000 million decreased 11.0 percent and pre-tax margin of 4.7 percent declined 0.3 points year to year, reflecting a higher level of workforce rebalancing charges year to year.

and are affected by several factors, including terminations, changes in the scope of contracts, periodic revalidations, adjustments for revenue not materialized and adjustments for currency.
Services signings are management’s initial estimate of the value of a client’s commitment under a services contract.
There are no third-party standards or requirements governing the calculation of signings.
The calculation used by management involves estimates and judgments to gauge the extent of a client’s commitment, including the type and duration of the agreement, and the presence of termination charges or wind-down costs.

Systems revenue of $1,481 million decreased 14.7 percent as reported (14 percent adjusted for currency) in the third quarter of 2019 compared to the prior year.
Systems Hardware revenue of $1,117 million decreased 16.6 percent as reported (16 percent adjusted for currency).
The decline was across the product portfolio, but primarily reflects the back end of the z14 mainframe product cycle.
The business continues to invest to bring new innovation across the platforms, and introduced the next generation of IBM Z and high-end storage in mid-September.
Operating Systems Software revenue of $364 million decreased 8.1 percent as reported (7 percent adjusted for currency) compared to the prior year.
For the first nine months of 2019, Systems revenue of $4,562 million decreased 15.7 percent as reported (14 percent adjusted for currency) compared to the first nine months of 2018, driven primarily by IBM Z and Storage Systems.
Operating Systems Software revenue decreased 1.7 percent as reported, but increased 1 percent adjusted for currency.
IBM Z revenue declined 20.6 percent as reported (20 percent adjusted for currency) year to year, reflecting the end of the z14 product cycle in the current period compared to solid growth in the third-quarter 2018.
The new z15 mainframe began to ship in the last week of the quarter with a good start to the cycle.
The z15 mainframe’s capabilities extend the platform’s differentiation with encryption everywhere, cloud native (with the introduction of Red Hat OpenShift) and instant recovery.
The z15 will offer clients improved productivity, security and efficiency.
​
Power Systems revenue decreased 27.5 percent as reported (27 percent adjusted for currency) year to year, as a result of strong performance in the third-quarter 2018 due to the introduction of mid-range and high-end POWER9 products and the roll-out of supercomputers to the U.S. Department of Energy labs.
​
Storage Systems revenue decreased 5.5 percent as reported (4 percent adjusted for currency), reflecting improvement in year-to-year performance compared to recent quarters, driven by the high-end products and growth in All Flash Array.
In mid-September 2019, the company introduced the next generation, high-end storage system DS8900 which delivers comprehensive next-level cyber security, data availability and system resiliency, specifically designed for mission-critical hybrid multicloud environments.
In the third quarter, Operating Systems Software revenue of $364 million decreased 8.1 percent as reported (7 percent adjusted for currency) compared to the prior year.
The decline was driven by a decrease in Power Systems and IBM Z operating system software.

​
Systems gross profit margin of 52.6 percent was flat in the third quarter of 2019 compared to the prior year, with margin expansion in Power Systems and Storage Systems.
Systems Hardware margin of 42.8 percent was flat year to year.
For the first nine months of 2019, Systems gross profit margin increased 1.7 points to 51.1 percent compared to the prior year, driven by actions taken in 2018 to better position the systems cost structure over the longer term.
Systems Hardware gross profit margin was flat year to year, with margin improvement in Storage Systems, offset by declines in IBM Z and Power Systems.
​
In the third quarter of 2019, pre-tax income of $39 million declined 81.3 percent and pre-tax margin decreased 8.6 points year to year to 2.3 percent.
The pre-tax margin was impacted by portfolio mix, the z14 product cycle and investments made to bring new hardware innovation to market.
For the first nine months of 2019, Systems had a pre-tax loss of $101 million compared to pre-tax income of $352 million in the first nine months of the prior year.
Pre-tax margin decreased 7.9 points year to year to (2.0) percent, primarily due to the same factors as the third quarter.
Global Financing
Global Financing is a reportable segment that is measured as a stand-alone entity.
Global Financing facilitates IBM clients’ acquisition of information technology systems, software and services by providing financing solutions in the areas where the company has the expertise, while generating strong returns on equity.
Global Financing also optimizes the recovery of residual values by selling assets sourced from end of lease, leasing used equipment to new clients, or extending lease arrangements with current clients.
Sales of equipment include equipment returned at the end of a lease,
Management Discussion – (continued)
surplus internal equipment and used equipment purchased externally.
Residual value is a risk unique to the financing business and management of this risk is dependent upon the ability to accurately project future equipment values at lease inception.
Global Financing has insight into product plans and cycles for the IBM products under lease.
Based upon this product information, Global Financing continually monitors projections of future equipment values and compares them with the residual values reflected in the portfolio.
​
In the third quarter, Global Financing total revenue of $645 million declined 11.2 percent compared to the prior year.
Internal revenue decreased 10.6 percent, driven by a decrease in internal financing (down 21.7 percent to $86 million) and internal used equipment sales (down 5.2 percent to $216 million).
External revenue decreased 11.7 percent (11 percent adjusted for currency), due to a decrease in external financing (down 14.6 percent to $261 million) and external used equipment sales (down 1.0 percent to $81 million).
The decrease in total revenue in the first nine months of 2019 compared to the same period of 2018 was due to a decrease in internal revenue of 28.7 percent, driven by a decrease in internal used equipment sales (down 36.0 percent to $593 million) and internal financing (down 7.4 percent to $291 million).
External revenue decreased 7.4 percent (5 percent adjusted for currency), driven by a decline in external used equipment sales (down 19.9 percent to $216 million) and external financing (down 3.7 percent to $884 million).
The decrease in internal financing revenue in the third quarter and the first nine months of 2019 compared to the same periods in 2018 was primarily due to lower average asset balances, partially offset by higher asset yields.
The decrease in external financing revenue in the third quarter and the first nine months of 2019 compared to the same periods in 2018 reflects the company’s wind down of the OEM IT commercial financing operations.
Total sales of used equipment represented 46.1 percent of Global Financing’s revenue in the third quarter of 2019 compared to 42.7 percent in the third quarter of 2018.
The increase was due to declines in internal and external financing revenue.
Total sales of used equipment represented 40.8 percent of Global Financing’s revenue in the first nine months of 2019 compared to 49.2 percent in the first nine months of 2018.
The decrease was due to lower volumes of both internal and external used equipment sales.
The gross profit margin on used sales was 56.6 percent and 50.9 percent in the third quarter of 2019 and 2018, respectively, and 54.4 percent and 56.6 percent in the first nine months of 2019 and 2018, respectively.
Global Financing pre-tax income decreased 10.8 percent to $275 million in the third quarter of 2019 compared to the same period in 2018, due to lower gross profit of $45 million, partially offset by a decrease in expense of $12

million.
Pre-tax income decreased 23.0 percent to $803 million in the first nine months of 2019, compared to the same period in 2018, due to lower gross profit of $344 million, partially offset by a decrease in expense of $104 million, which was driven by a decline in IBM shared expenses in line with the segment’s performance, a lower provision for credit losses and a gain from the sale of certain commercial financing capabilities in the first quarter of 2019.
Global Financing return on equity was 32.4 percent for the three months ended September 30, 2019, compared to 27.5 percent for the three months ended September 30, 2018.
The increase was due to a lower average equity balance.
Return on equity was 23.0 percent for the nine months ended September 30, 2019, compared to 30.5 percent for the nine months ended September 30, 2018.
The decrease was driven by a decline in net income, which included higher tax expense in the first quarter of 2019 due to additional guidance issued by the U.S. Treasury regarding the U.S. tax reform repatriation tax.
Refer to page 101 for the details of the after-tax income and return on equity calculation.

​
 Total expense and other (income) increased 17.3 percent in the third quarter of 2019 versus the prior year primarily driven by higher spending including Red Hat, investments in software and systems innovation, and lower IP income, partially offset by lower non-operating retirement-related costs and divested businesses.
Total operating (non-GAAP) expense and other (income) increased 15.9 percent year to year, driven primarily by the higher spending described above.

 Licensing of intellectual property including royalty-based fees decreased 53.6 percent and 54.5 percent year to year in the third quarter and first nine months of 2019, respectively.
This was primarily due to a decline in new partnership agreements compared to the third quarter and first nine months of 2018.
The timing and amount of licensing, sales or other transfers of IP may vary significantly from period to period depending upon the timing of licensing agreements, economic conditions, industry consolidation and the timing of new patents and know-how development.

Interest expense increased $241 million and $460 million year to year in the third quarter and first nine months of 2019, respectively.
Interest expense is presented in cost of financing in the Consolidated Statement of Earnings if the related external borrowings are to support the Global Financing external business.
Overall interest expense (excluding capitalized interest) for the third quarter and first nine months of 2019 was $572 million and $1,473 million, respectively, an increase of $188 million and $376 million versus the comparable prior-year periods, primarily driven by a higher average debt balance and higher average interest rates in the current year as the company issued debt to finance the Red Hat acquisition.
Operating (non-GAAP) interest expense increased $217 million and $232 million year to year in the third quarter and first nine months of 2019, respectively, and excludes the Red Hat pre-closing debt financing costs.
Interest expense, post-Red Hat closing is included in operating (non-GAAP) interest expense.

Retirement-Related Plans
​
​
 Total pre-tax retirement-related plan cost decreased by $242 million compared to the third quarter of 2018, driven by a decrease in recognized actuarial losses ($276 million), primarily due to the change in the amortization period in the U.S.
Qualified Personal Pension Plan and higher expected return on plan assets ($35 million), partially offset by higher interest costs ($44 million).
Total cost for the first nine months of 2019 decreased $803 million versus the first nine months of 2018, driven by a decrease in recognized actuarial losses ($846 million) primarily due to the amortization period change and higher expected return on plan assets ($92 million); partially offset by higher interest costs ($120 million).
​
 As described in the “Operating (non-GAAP) Earnings” section, the company characterizes certain retirement-related costs as operating and others as non-operating.
Utilizing this characterization, operating retirement-related costs in the
Management Discussion – (continued)
third quarter of 2019 were $367 million, an increase of $2 million compared to the third quarter of 2018.
Non-operating costs of $145 million in the third quarter of 2019 decreased $244 million year to year, driven primarily by lower recognized actuarial losses ($276 million) and a higher expected return on plan assets ($35 million), partially offset by higher interest costs ($44 million).
For the first nine months of 2019, operating retirement-related costs were $1,078 million, a decrease of $38 million and non-operating costs were $419 million, a decrease of $766 million compared to the prior year, driven primarily by the same factors as above.
​
Taxes
The continuing operations effective tax rate for the third quarter of 2019 was (9.9) percent, a decrease of 20.1 points compared to the third quarter of 2018.
The continuing operations effective tax rate for the first nine months of 2019 was 6.6 percent, an increase of 4.6 points compared to the first nine months of 2018.
The operating (non-GAAP) tax rate for the third quarter of 2019 was 0.1 percent, a decrease of 12.7 points compared to the third quarter of 2018.
The operating (non-GAAP) tax rate for the first nine months of 2019 was 7.4 percent, an increase of 2.0 points compared to the first nine months of 2018.
The decrease in the continuing operations effective tax rate in the third quarter of 2019 was primarily driven by a benefit from the realization of a tax only capital loss in a subsidiary (10.7 points), an increase in tax benefits attributable to audit activity (4.3 points), as well as a benefit due to the mix of geographic income year to year (5.0 points), primarily driven by Red Hat.
The change in the continuing operations tax rate for the first nine months of 2019 compared to 2018 was primarily driven by reduced benefit related to audit activity (4.6 points).
The change in the operating (non-GAAP) tax rate was primarily driven by the same factors.
The amount of unrecognized tax benefits at September 30, 2019 is $6,899 million which can be reduced by $600 million of offsetting tax benefits associated with timing adjustments, U.S. tax credits, potential transfer pricing adjustments, and state income taxes.
The net amount of $6,299 million, if recognized, would favorably affect the company’s effective tax rate.
Earnings Per Share
Basic earnings per share is computed on the basis of the weighted-average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period.
Diluted earnings per share is computed on the basis of the weighted-average number of shares of common stock outstanding plus the effect of dilutive potential common shares outstanding during the period using the treasury stock method.
Dilutive potential common shares include outstanding stock options and stock awards.
Management Discussion – (continued)
​
Actual shares outstanding at September 30, 2019 were 885.6 million.
The weighted-average number of common shares outstanding assuming dilution during the third quarter and first nine months of 2019 were 22.4 million (2.4 percent) and 27.5 million (3.0 percent) shares lower than the same periods of 2018.
The decreases were primarily the result of the common stock repurchase program.
Financial Position
Dynamics
At September 30, 2019, the balance sheet remained strong with flexibility to support the business.
Cash, restricted cash and marketable securities at quarter end were $10,957 million.
The company continues to manage the investment portfolio to meet its capital preservation and liquidity objectives.
Total debt of $66,327 million at September 30, 2019 increased $20,515 million from December 31, 2018, driven by new debt issuances of $26,263 million to primarily fund the Red Hat acquisition; partially offset by debt maturities of $5,376 million.
Within total debt, $23,078 million is in support of the Global Financing business.
In the first nine months of 2019, the company generated $11,319 million in net cash from operations, compared to $11,128 million in the first nine months of 2018.
The company has consistently generated strong cash flows from operations and continues to have access to additional sources of liquidity through the capital markets and its credit facilities.
The strong free cash flow generated by the company, portfolio actions taken and the suspension of share repurchases position IBM to return to its target leverage ratios within a couple of years.
Through disciplined financial management, the company reduced debt by $6,712 million since June 30, 2019.
The assets and debt associated with the Global Financing business are a significant part of the company’s financial position.
At September 30, 2019 those balances reflect the wind down of its OEM IT commercial financing operations.
The financial position amounts appearing on pages 5 and 6 are the consolidated amounts including Global Financing.
Management Discussion – (continued)
At September 30, 2019, substantially all client and commercial financing assets were IT related assets, and approximately 60 percent of the total external portfolio was with investment grade clients with no direct exposure to consumers, an increase of 6 points year to year.
This investment grade percentage is based on the credit ratings of the companies in the portfolio.
The company has a long-standing practice of taking mitigating actions, in certain circumstances, to transfer credit risk to third parties, including credit insurance, financial guarantees, non-recourse borrowings, transfers of receivables recorded as true sales in accordance with accounting guidance or sales of equipment under operating lease.
Adjusting for the mitigation actions, the investment grade content would increase to 67 percent, a decrease of 3 points year to year.

Receivables and Allowances
The total IBM receivables provision coverage was 1.9 percent at September 30, 2019, an increase of 30 basis points compared to December 31, 2018.
The increase was primarily driven by the overall decline in gross financing receivables.
The majority of the write-offs during the nine months ended September 30, 2019 related to receivables which had been previously reserved.
Global Financing Receivables and Allowances
The percentage of Global Financing receivables reserved increased from 0.9 percent at December 31, 2018, to 1.3 percent at September 30, 2019.
The increase was primarily driven by the overall decline in gross receivables.
Unallocated reserves decreased 30 percent from $72 million at December 31, 2018, to $50 million at September 30, 2019.
Specific reserves decreased 6 percent from $220 million at December 31, 2018, to $207 million at September 30, 2019.

Debt
​
Total debt of $66,327 million increased $20,515 million from December 31, 2018, driven by new debt issuances of $26,263 million; partially offset by debt maturities of $5,376 million.
Non-Global Financing debt of $43,249 million increased $28,664 million from December 31, 2018 primarily driven by issuances to fund the Red Hat acquisition.
Global Financing debt of $23,078 million decreased $8,148 million from December 31, 2018, primarily due to the wind down of OEM IT commercial financing operations.
 Global Financing provides financing predominantly for the company’s external client assets, as well as for assets under contract by other IBM units.
These assets, primarily for Global Technology Services, generate long-term, stable revenue streams similar to the Global Financing asset portfolio.
Based on their attributes, these Global Technology Services assets are leveraged with the balance of the Global Financing asset base.
The debt used to fund Global Financing assets is composed of intercompany loans and external debt.
Total debt changes generally correspond with the level of client and commercial financing receivables, the level of cash and cash equivalents, the change in intercompany and external payables and the change in intercompany investment from IBM.
The terms of the intercompany loans are set by the company to substantially match the term, currency and interest rate variability underlying the financing receivable and are based on arm’s-length pricing.
The Global Financing debt-to-equity ratio remained at 9.0 to 1 at September 30, 2019.
As previously stated, the company measures Global Financing as a stand-alone entity, and accordingly, interest expense relating to debt supporting Global Financing’s external client and internal business is included in the “Global Financing Results of Operations” and in note 8, “Segments.” In the company’s Consolidated Statement of Earnings, the external debt-related interest expense supporting Global Financing’s internal financing to the company is reclassified from cost of financing to interest expense.
Equity
Total equity increased $1,166 million from December 31, 2018, primarily due to increases from net income ($5,761 million) and retirement-related plans ($1,095 million); partially offset by decreases from dividends paid ($4,269 million) and an increase in treasury stock ($1,404 million) primarily due to share repurchases.

●An increase in net cash used for acquisitions of $32,507 million; partially offset by
●An increase of $5,719 million in cash provided by net non-operating finance receivables primarily driven by the wind down of OEM IT commercial financing operations; and
●A decrease in cash used for net purchases of marketable securities and other investments of $3,051 million; and
●A decrease in cash used for net capital expenditures of $1,114 million; and
●An increase in cash provided by divestitures of $927 million.
●An increase in net cash sourced from debt transactions of $19,620 million primarily driven by net issuances used to fund the Red Hat acquisition; and
●A decrease in cash used for gross common share repurchases of $1,032 million.
Looking Forward
The company is focused on chapter 2 of cloud, which will shift mission-critical work to the cloud and optimize everything from supply chains to core banking systems.
To address this opportunity, enterprises need to be able to move and manage data, services, and workflows across multiple clouds and on-premises.
They also need to be able to address security concerns, data protection and protocols, availability, and cloud management.
This requires a hybrid, multi-cloud, open approach.
On July 9, 2019, IBM closed the acquisition of Red Hat, which will significantly change the cloud
Management Discussion – (continued)
landscape and accelerate the company’s high value business model.
Together, IBM and Red Hat will drive innovation and shift clients’ mission-critical workloads to the cloud by offering a next-generation hybrid, multi-cloud platform built on open source technologies.
The acquisition of Red Hat positions IBM to be the leading hybrid cloud provider.
Consistent with the acquisition of a highly profitable software business, non-cash purchase accounting adjustments will result in the Red Hat acquisition being dilutive to full-year 2019 earnings per share expectations.
In an acquisition, U.S. GAAP requires the company to record all assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the acquisition date fair value.
This includes the acquired deferred revenue balance.
This resulted in a non-cash adjustment of $2.2 billion to the acquired deferred revenue balance and will result in a reduction to reported revenue post-closing.
The level of adjustment reflects the high margin profile of Red Hat’s business, and deferred revenue is expected to be replenished over the subsequent two to three years, given Red Hat’s high renewal rates and a stable and growing client base.
Red Hat is expected to be free cash flow accretive to IBM in the first twelve months, with nominal dilution in second-half 2019.
The company also remains on track to achieve free cash flow of approximately $12 billion in 2019.
Combined with the additional software and services profits, and net of incremental interest to finance the transaction and other acquisition-related charges, Red Hat is expected to add $0.5 billion and $1 billion to IBM’s free cash flow in 2020 and 2021, respectively.
​
 For full-year 2019, the company expects the GAAP effective tax rate to be approximately 8 to 9 percent, including an estimate for potential discrete tax events (discretes).
The company updated its operating (non-GAAP) tax rate expectations at the August 2nd investor briefing.
The company expects its operating (non-GAAP) tax rate for 2019 to be approximately 9 to 10 percent, including an estimate of potential discretes.
Discretes by their nature are difficult to estimate and the actual impacts will be recorded as the discrete events occur.
The rates will change year to year based on discrete tax events, such as the settlement of income tax audits and changes in tax laws, as well as recurring factors including the geographic mix of income before taxes, state and local taxes and the effects of various global income tax strategies.
The GAAP effective tax rate could also be affected by adjustments to the previously recorded charges for U.S. tax reform attributable to any changes in law, new regulations and guidance, audit adjustments, among others.
​
The Red Hat acquisition was funded through a combination of cash and debt, with the incremental debt issued in the first half of 2019.
The company will continue with a disciplined financial policy and is committed to maintaining strong investment grade credit ratings.
The company is targeting a leverage profile consistent with a mid to high single A credit rating within a couple years, while maintaining its solid and growing dividend.
IBM suspended its share repurchase
Management Discussion – (continued)
program at the close of the acquisition to direct its free cash flow towards reducing debt levels.
The combination of these actions provides the company with the flexibility to invest in the business going forward.
Beginning in the second quarter of 2019 and continuing throughout the year, IBM’s Global Financing business is winding down the portion of its commercial financing operations, which provides short-term working capital solutions for OEM information technology suppliers, distributors and resellers.
This is consistent with IBM’s capital allocation strategy and high-value focus.
IBM Global Financing will continue to provide differentiated end-to-end financing solutions, including commercial financing in support of IBM partner relationships.
The wind down of this activity is expected to reduce IBM’s revenue, with a nominal impact to profit, however it does not change the company’s earnings per share and free cash flow expectations for 2019.
Beginning in 2019, within the IBM U.S.
Qualified Personal Pension Plan, substantially all the plan participants are now considered inactive, which, as required by U.S. GAAP, resulted in a change in the amortization period of unrecognized actuarial losses, from the average remaining service period of active plan participants to the average remaining life expectancy of inactive plan participants.
These periods are approximately 6 years and 18 years, respectively.
As a result of this change, there will be a reduction to 2019 amortization expense of approximately $900 million.
Actuarial loss amortization is reported within non-operating pension costs.
There will be no impact to 2019 operating (non-GAAP) retirement-related costs, funded status, retiree benefit payments or funding requirements of the U.S.
Qualified Personal Pension Plan.
However, there will be an impact to free cash flow realization.
The company expects 2019 pre-tax retirement-related plan cost to be approximately $2.0 billion, a decrease of approximately $1 billion compared to 2018.
This estimate reflects current pension plan assumptions at December 31, 2018.
Within total retirement-related plan cost, operating retirement-related plan cost is expected to be approximately $1.5 billion, approximately flat versus 2018.
Non-operating retirement-related plan cost is expected to be approximately $0.6 billion, a decrease of approximately $1 billion compared to 2018, primarily driven by lower actuarial loss amortization resulting from the change in amortization period for the U.S. plan.
Contributions for all retirement-related plans are expected to be approximately $2.2 billion in 2019, a decrease of approximately $100 million compared to 2018.
Currency Rate Fluctuations
Changes in the relative values of non-U.S. currencies to the U.S. dollar (USD) affect the company’s financial results and financial position.
At September 30, 2019, currency changes resulted in assets and liabilities denominated in local currencies being translated into fewer dollars than at year-end 2018.
The company uses financial hedging instruments to limit specific currency risks related to financing transactions and other foreign currency-based transactions.
During periods of sustained movements in currency, the marketplace and competition adjust to the changing rates.
For example, when pricing offerings in the marketplace, the company may use some of the advantage from a weakening U.S. dollar to improve its position competitively, and price more aggressively to win the business, essentially passing on a portion of the currency advantage to its customers.
Competition will frequently take the same action.
Consequently, the company believes that some of the currency-based changes in cost impact the prices charged to clients.
The company also maintains currency hedging programs for cash management purposes which temporarily mitigate, but do not eliminate, the volatility of currency impacts on the company’s financial results.
The company translates revenue, cost and expense in its non-U.S. operations at current exchange rates in the reported period.
References to “adjusted for currency” or “constant currency” reflect adjustments based upon a simple mathematical formula.
However, this constant currency methodology that the company utilizes to disclose this information does not incorporate any operational actions that management could take to mitigate fluctuating currency rates.
Currency movements impacted the company’s year-to-year revenue and earnings per share growth in the first nine months of 2019.
Based on the currency rate movements in the first nine months of 2019, total revenue decreased 4.3 percent as reported and 1.7 percent at constant currency versus the first nine months of 2018.
On an income from continuing operations before income tax basis, these translation impacts mitigated by the net impact of hedging activities
Management Discussion – (continued)
resulted in a theoretical maximum (assuming no pricing or sourcing actions) increase of approximately $240 million in the first nine months of 2019 on an as-reported basis and an increase of approximately $210 million on an operating (non-GAAP) basis.
The same mathematical exercise resulted in an increase of approximately $200 million in the first nine months of 2018 on an as-reported basis and an increase of approximately $225 million on an operating (non-GAAP) basis.
The company views these amounts as a theoretical maximum impact to its as-reported financial results.
Considering the operational responses mentioned above, movements of exchange rates, and the nature and timing of hedging instruments, it is difficult to predict future currency impacts on any particular period, but the company believes it could be substantially less than the theoretical maximum given the competitive pressure in the marketplace.
For non-U.S. subsidiaries and branches that operate in U.S. dollars or whose economic environment is highly inflationary, translation adjustments are reflected in results of operations.
Generally, the company manages currency risk in these entities by linking prices and contracts to U.S. dollars.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
In the company’s 2018 Annual Report, on pages 60 to 62, there is a discussion of the company’s liquidity including two tables that present three years of data.
The table presented on page 60 includes net cash from operating activities, cash, restricted cash and short-term marketable securities, and the size of the company’s global credit facilities for each of the past three years.
For the nine months ended, or as of, as applicable, September 30, 2019, those amounts are $11.3 billion of net cash from operating activities, $11.0 billion of cash, restricted cash and short-term marketable securities and $15.3 billion in global credit facilities, respectively.
​
On July 9, 2019, the company closed the acquisition of Red Hat for cash consideration of $34.8 billion.
The transaction was funded through a combination of cash on hand and proceeds from debt issuances.
In order to reduce this debt and return to target leverage ratios within a couple of years, the company suspended its share repurchase program at the time of the Red Hat acquisition closing.
Refer to note 13, “Borrowings,” for additional details of financing this transaction.
In the third-quarter 2019, the company reduced debt by $6.7 billion.
 After closing the transaction, Moody’s, as expected, downgraded IBM and IBM Credit LLC’s long-term debt rating from A1 to A2 and improved its outlook to stable.
The commercial paper rating from Moody’s remains unchanged.
Standard and Poor’s ratings remain unchanged.
Additionally, Fitch affirmed its rating before withdrawing coverage on IBM for commercial reasons.
​
IBM will continue with a disciplined financial policy and is committed to maintaining strong investment grade credit ratings.
The company does not have “ratings trigger” provisions in its debt covenants or documentation, which would allow the holders to declare an event of default and seek to accelerate payments thereunder in the event of a change in credit rating.
The company’s contractual agreements governing derivative instruments contain standard market clauses which can trigger the termination of the agreement if the company’s credit rating were to fall below investment grade.
At September 30, 2019, the fair value of those instruments that were in a liability position was $1,074 million, before any applicable netting, and this position is subject to fluctuations in fair value period to period based on the level of the company’s outstanding instruments and market conditions.
The company has no other contractual arrangements

that, in the event of a change in credit rating, would result in a material adverse effect on its financial position or liquidity.
In July 2017, the UK's Financial Conduct Authority, which regulates the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR), announced that it intends to phase out LIBOR by the end of 2021.
Various central bank committees and working groups continue to discuss replacement of benchmark rates, the process for amending existing LIBOR-based contracts, and the potential economic impacts of different alternatives.
The Alternative Reference Rates Committee has identified the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR) as its preferred alternative rate for USD LIBOR.
SOFR is a measure of the cost of borrowing cash overnight, collateralized by U.S. Treasury securities, and is based on directly observable U.S. Treasury-backed repurchase transactions.
The company is evaluating the potential impact of the replacement of the LIBOR benchmark interest rate, including risk management, internal operational readiness and monitoring the FASB standard-setting process to address financial reporting issues that might arise in connection with transition from LIBOR to a new benchmark rate.
The company prepares its Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows in accordance with applicable accounting standards for cash flow presentation on page 7 of this Form 10-Q and highlights causes and events underlying sources and uses of cash in that format on page 96.
For the purpose of running its business, the company manages, monitors and analyzes cash flows in a different manner.
Management uses free cash flow as a measure to evaluate its operating results, plan share repurchase levels, strategic investments and assess its ability and need to incur and service debt.
The entire free cash flow amount is not necessarily available for discretionary expenditures.
The company defines free cash flow as net cash from operating activities less the change in Global Financing receivables and net capital expenditures, including the investment in software.
A key objective of the Global Financing business is to generate strong returns on equity, and increasing receivables is the basis for growth.
Accordingly, management considers Global Financing receivables as a profit-generating investment, not as working capital that should be minimized for efficiency.
Therefore, management includes presentations of both free cash flow and net cash from operating activities that exclude the effect of Global Financing receivables.
Free cash flow guidance is derived using an estimate of profit, working capital and operational cash outflows.
As previously noted, the company views Global Financing receivables as a profit-generating investment which it seeks to maximize and therefore it is not considered when formulating guidance for free cash flow.
As a result the company does not estimate a GAAP Net Cash from Operations expectation metric.

Management Discussion – (continued)
In the first nine months of 2019, the company generated free cash flow of $5.9 billion, an increase of $0.5 billion versus the prior year.
The company made cash payments net of cash received of $32.6 billion to acquire Red Hat while also continuing to return value to shareholders including $4.3 billion in dividends and $1.4 billion in gross common stock repurchases.
Events that could temporarily change the historical cash flow dynamics discussed previously and in the company’s 2018 Annual Report include significant changes in operating results, material changes in geographic sources of cash, unexpected adverse impacts from litigation, future pension funding requirements, periods of severe downturn in the capital markets or the timing of tax payments.
Whether any litigation has such an adverse impact will depend on a number of variables, which are more completely described in note 14, “Contingencies,” in this Form 10-Q.
With respect to pension funding, the company expects to make legally mandated pension plan contributions to certain non-U.S. defined benefit plans of approximately $300 million in 2019.
Contributions related to all retirement-related plans are expected to be approximately $2.2 billion in 2019.
Financial market performance could increase the legally mandated minimum contributions in certain non-U.S. countries that require more frequent remeasurement of the funded status.
The company is not quantifying any further impact from pension funding because it is not possible to predict future movements in the capital markets or pension plan funding regulations.
In 2019, the company is not legally required to make any contributions to the U.S. defined benefit pension plans.
The company’s cash flows are sufficient to fund its current operations and obligations, including investing and financing activities such as dividends and debt service.
When additional requirements arise, the company has several liquidity options available.
These options may include the ability to borrow additional funds at reasonable interest rates and utilizing its committed global credit facilities.
