In the first quarter of 2019, the company made a number of changes to its organizational structure and management system. These changes impacted the companys reportable segments, but did not impact the companys Consolidated Financial Statements. Refer to note 8, Segments, for additional information on the changes in reportable segments. The periods presented in this Form 10-Q are reported on a comparable basis. The company provided recast historical segment information reflecting these changes in a Form 8-K dated April 4, 2019. 



For the three months ended March 31, 2019, the company recorded a provision for income taxes of $289 million and its effective tax rate was 15.4 percent. The rate was primarily driven by the geographical mix of income and foreign and domestic audit activity, partially offset by a discrete tax charge of $129 million related to the January 2019 additional tax reform guidance issued by the U.S. Treasury. In the first quarter of 2018, the company reported a benefit from income taxes of $540 million and its effective tax rate was (47.5) percent. This benefit was primarily driven by audit resolutions partially offset by a discrete provisional charge related to U.S. tax reform guidance. 



Noncontrolling interest amounts of $7.0 million and $7.8 million, net of tax, for the three months ended March 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively, are included as a reduction within other (income) and expense in the Consolidated Statement of Earnings. 



Interim results are not necessarily indicative of financial results for a full year. The information included in this Form 10-Q should be read in conjunction with the companys 2018 Annual Report. 



Within the financial statements and tables presented, certain columns and rows may not add due to the use of rounded numbers for disclosure purposes. Percentages presented are calculated from the underlying whole-dollar amounts. Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current year presentation. This is annotated where applicable. 





New Standards to be Implemented 





In January 2017, the FASB issued guidance that simplifies the goodwill impairment test by removing Step 2. The guidance also changes the requirements for reporting units with zero or negative carrying amounts and requires additional disclosures for these reporting units. The guidance is effective January 1, 2020 and early adoption is permitted. The company expects to adopt the guidance on a prospective basis on the effective date. The company is evaluating the impact of the guidance. 



In June 2016, with amendments in 2018, the FASB issued guidance for credit impairment based on an expected loss model rather than an incurred loss model. The guidance requires the consideration of all available relevant information when estimating expected credit losses, including past events, current conditions and forecasts and their implications for expected

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements  (continued) 



credit losses. A cross-functional team was established that is evaluating the financial instruments portfolio and the system, process and policy change requirements and continues to make substantial progress. The new guidance expands the scope of financial instruments subject to impairment, including off-balance sheet commitments and residual value. The guidance is effective January 1, 2020 with one-year early adoption permitted. The company will adopt the guidance as of the effective date and is continuing to evaluate the impact. 



Standards Implemented 



The FASB issued guidance in February 2016, with amendments in 2018 and 2019, which changed the accounting for leases. The guidance requires lessees to recognize right-of-use assets and lease liabilities for most leases in the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position. The guidance also made some changes to lessor accounting, including elimination of the use of third-party residual value guarantee insurance in the lease classification test, and overall aligns with the new revenue recognition guidance. The guidance requires qualitative and quantitative disclosures to assess the amount, timing and uncertainty of cash flows arising from leases. The company adopted the guidance effective January 1, 2019, using the transition option whereby prior comparative periods were not retrospectively presented in the Consolidated Financial Statements. The company elected the package of practical expedients not to reassess prior conclusions related to contracts containing leases, lease classification and initial direct costs and the lessee practical expedient to combine lease and nonlease components for all asset classes. The company made a policy election to not recognize right-of-use assets and lease liabilities for short-term leases for all asset classes. The guidance had a material impact on the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position as of the effective date. As a lessee, at adoption, the company recognized operating and financing right-of-use (ROU) assets of $4.8 billion and $0.2 billion, respectively, and operating and financing lease liabilities of $5.1 billion and $0.2 billion, respectively. The transition adjustment recognized in retained earnings at January 1, 2019 was not material. From a lessor perspective, the changes in lease termination guidance and removal of third-party residual value guarantee insurance in the lease classification test did not have a material impact in the consolidated financial results. Refer to note 5, Leases, for additional information, including further discussion on the impact of adoption. 



In August 2018, the FASB issued guidance on a customers accounting for implementation costs incurred in cloud-computing arrangements that are hosted by a vendor. Certain types of implementation costs should be capitalized and amortized over the term of the hosting arrangement. The guidance is effective January 1, 2020 and early adoption is permitted. The company adopted the guidance on January 1, 2019 on a prospective basis. The guidance did not have a material impact in the consolidated financial results. 





In August 2017, the FASB issued guidance to simplify the application of hedge accounting in certain areas, better portray the economic results of an entitys risk management activities in its financial statements and make targeted improvements to presentation and disclosure requirements. The guidance was effective January 1, 2019 with early adoption permitted. The company adopted the guidance as of January 1, 2018, and it did not have a material impact in the consolidated financial results.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements  (continued) 



In January 2016, the FASB issued guidance which addresses aspects of recognition, measurement, presentation and disclosure of financial instruments. The guidance was effective January 1, 2018 and early adoption was not permitted except for limited provisions. The company adopted the guidance on the effective date. The guidance required certain equity investments to be measured at fair value with changes recognized in net income. The amendment also simplified the impairment test of equity investments that lack readily determinable fair value. The guidance did not have a material impact in the consolidated financial results. 



The FASB issued guidance on the recognition of revenue from contracts with customers in May 2014 with amendments in 2015 and 2016. Revenue recognition depicts the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. The guidance also requires specific disclosures relating to revenue recognition. The company adopted the guidance effective January 1, 2018 using the modified retrospective transition method. At adoption, $557 million was reclassified from notes and accounts receivabletrade and deferred incomecurrent to prepaid expenses and other current assets to establish the opening balance for net contract assets. In-scope sales commission costs previously recorded in the Consolidated Statement of Earnings were capitalized in deferred costs in accordance with the transition guidance, in the amount of $737 million. Deferred income of $29 million was recorded for certain software licenses that will be recognized over time versus at point in time under previous guidance. Additionally, net deferred taxes were reduced by $184 million in the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position, resulting in a cumulative-effect net increase to retained earnings of $524 million. In the fourth quarter of 2018, the company recognized an additional impact to net deferred taxes and retained earnings of $56 million, resulting in a total net increase to retained earnings of $580 million. The decrease to net deferred taxes was the result of the companys election to include Global Intangible Low-Taxed Income (GILTI) in measuring deferred taxes. The revenue guidance did not have a material impact in the companys consolidated financial results. Refer to note 3, Revenue Recognition, for additional information. 



In March 2016, the FASB issued guidance which changed the accounting for share-based payment transactions, including the income tax consequences, classification of awards as either equity or liabilities and classification in the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows. The guidance was effective and adopted by the company on January 1, 2017, and it did not have a material impact in the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position. The ongoing impact of the guidance could result in increased volatility in the provision for income taxes and earnings per share in the Consolidated Statement of Earnings, depending on the companys share price at exercise or vesting of share-based awards compared to grant date, however these impacts are not expected to be material. These impacts are recorded on a prospective basis. The company continues to estimate forfeitures in conjunction with measuring stock-based compensation cost. The guidance also requires cash payments on behalf of employees for shares directly withheld for taxes to be presented as financing outflows in the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows. The FASB also issued guidance in May 2017 and June 2018, which relates to the accounting for modifications of share-based payment awards and accounting for share-based payments issued to non-employees, respectively. The company adopted the guidance for modifications in the second quarter of 2017, and guidance for non-employees payments in the second quarter of 2018. The guidance had no impact in the consolidated financial results.

Remaining Performance Obligations 



The remaining performance obligation (RPO) disclosure provides the aggregate amount of the transaction price yet to be recognized as of the end of the reporting period and an explanation as to when the company expects to recognize these amounts in revenue. It is intended to be a statement of overall work under contract that has not yet been performed and does not include contracts in which the customer is not committed, such as certain as-a-Service, governmental, term software license and services offerings. The customer is not considered committed when they are able to terminate for convenience without payment of a substantive penalty. The disclosure includes estimates of variable consideration, except when the variable consideration is a sales-based or usage-based royalty promised in exchange for a license of intellectual property. Additionally, as a practical expedient, the company does not include contracts that have an original duration of one year or less. Remaining performance obligation estimates are subject to change and are affected by several factors, including terminations, changes in the scope of contracts, periodic revalidations, adjustment for revenue that has not materialized and adjustments for currency.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements  (continued) 





Revenue Recognized for Performance Obligations Satisfied (or Partially Satisfied) in Prior Periods 



For the three months ending March 31, 2019, the impact to revenue from performance obligations satisfied (or partially satisfied) in previous periods was immaterial. For the three months ending March 31, 2018, revenue was reduced by $22 million for performance obligations satisfied (or partially satisfied) in previous periods, mainly due to changes in estimates on percentage-of-completion based contracts. Refer to note A, Significant Accounting Policies, in the companys 2018 Annual Report for additional information on percentage-of-completion contracts and estimates of costs to complete. 



Reconciliation of Contract Balances 









The amount of revenue recognized during the three months ended March 31, 2019 that was included within the deferred income balance at December 31, 2018 was $3.5 billion and primarily related to services and software. The amount of revenue recognized during the three months ended March 31, 2018 that was included within the deferred income balance at January 1, 2018 was $3.5 billion and was also primarily related to services and software. 





Fair Value Measurements 





· Level 1Quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that can be accessed at the measurement date; 



· Level 2Inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly; and 



· Level 3Unobservable inputs for the asset or liability. 



The guidance requires the use of observable market data if such data is available without undue cost and effort. 



When available, the company uses unadjusted quoted market prices in active markets to measure the fair value and classifies such items as Level 1. If quoted market prices are not available, fair value is based upon internally developed models that use current market-based or independently sourced market parameters such as interest rates and currency rates. Items valued using internally generated models are classified according to the lowest level input or value driver that is significant to the valuation. 



The determination of fair value considers various factors including interest rate yield curves and time value underlying the financial instruments. For derivatives and debt securities, the company uses a discounted cash flow analysis using discount rates commensurate with the duration of the instrument. 





Table of Contents 



Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements  (continued) 





· Counterparty credit risk adjustments are applied to financial instruments, taking into account the actual credit risk of a counterparty as observed in the credit default swap market to determine the true fair value of such an instrument. 



· Credit risk adjustments are applied to reflect the companys own credit risk when valuing all liabilities measured at fair value. The methodology is consistent with that applied in developing counterparty credit risk adjustments, but incorporates the companys own credit risk as observed in the credit default swap market. 



As an example, the fair value of derivatives is derived utilizing a discounted cash flow model that uses observable market inputs such as known notional value amounts, yield curves, spot and forward exchange rates as well as discount rates. These inputs relate to liquid, heavily traded currencies with active markets which are available for the full term of the derivative. 



Certain assets that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis can be subject to nonrecurring fair value measurements. These assets include available-for-sale debt securities that are deemed to be other-than-temporarily impaired. In the event of an other-than-temporary impairment of a debt security, fair value is measured using a model described above. 



Certain non-financial assets such as property, plant and equipment, operating right-of-use assets, land, goodwill and intangible assets are also subject to nonrecurring fair value measurements if they are deemed to be impaired. The impairment models used for non-financial assets depend on the type of asset. There were no material impairments of non-financial assets for the three months ended March 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. 



Accounting guidance permits the measurement of eligible financial assets, financial liabilities and firm commitments at fair value, on an instrument-by-instrument basis, that are otherwise not permitted to be accounted for at fair value under other accounting standards. This election is irrevocable. The company has not applied the fair value option to any eligible assets or liabilities. 



Effective January 1, 2018, the company adopted the new FASB guidance on recognition, measurement, presentation and disclosure of financial instruments using the cumulative catch-up transition method. Since adoption, the company measures equity investments at fair value with changes recognized in net income. Refer to note 2, Accounting Changes, for further information. 



The following tables present the companys financial assets and financial liabilities that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis at March 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018.

Financial Assets and Liabilities Not Measured at Fair Value 



Short-Term Receivables and Payables 



Notes and other accounts receivable and other investments are financial assets with carrying values that approximate fair value. Accounts payable, other accrued expenses and short-term debt (excluding the current portion of long-term debt and including short-term finance lease liabilities) are financial liabilities with carrying values that approximate fair value. If measured at fair value in the financial statements, these financial instruments would be classified as Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy, except for short-term debt which would be classified as Level 2. 



Loans and Long-Term Receivables 



Fair values are based on discounted future cash flows using current interest rates offered for similar loans to clients with similar credit ratings for the same remaining maturities. At March 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018, the difference between the carrying amount and estimated fair value for loans and long-term receivables was immaterial. If measured at fair value in the financial statements, these financial instruments would be classified as Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy. 



Long-Term Debt 



Fair value of publicly-traded long-term debt is based on quoted market prices for the identical liability when traded as an asset in an active market. For other long-term debt (including long-term finance lease liabilities) for which a quoted market price is not available, an expected present value technique that uses rates currently available to the company for debt with similar terms and remaining maturities is used to estimate fair value. The carrying amount of long-term debt was $39,727 million and $35,605 million, and the estimated fair value was $41,675 million and $36,599 million at March 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018, respectively. If measured at fair value in the financial statements, long-term debt (including the current portion) would be classified as Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy. 



Available-for-Sale Securities 





The contractual maturities of substantially all available-for-sale debt securities are less than one year at March 31, 2019. 



Derivative Financial Instruments 



The company operates in multiple functional currencies and is a significant lender and borrower in the global markets. In the normal course of business, the company is exposed to the impact of interest rate changes and foreign currency fluctuations, and to a lesser extent equity and commodity price changes and client credit risk. The company limits these risks by following established risk management policies and procedures, including the use of derivatives, and, where cost effective, financing with debt in the currencies in which assets are denominated. For interest rate exposures, derivatives are used to better align rate movements between the interest rates associated with the companys lease and other financial assets and the interest rates associated with its financing debt. Derivatives are also used to manage the related cost of debt. For foreign currency exposures, derivatives are used to better manage the cash flow volatility arising from foreign exchange rate fluctuations. 



As a result of the use of derivative instruments, the company is exposed to the risk that counterparties to derivative contracts will fail to meet their contractual obligations. To mitigate the counterparty credit risk, the company has a policy of only entering into contracts with carefully selected major financial institutions based upon their overall credit profile. The companys established policies and procedures for mitigating credit risk on principal transactions include reviewing and establishing limits for credit exposure and continually assessing the creditworthiness of counterparties. The right of set-off that exists under certain of these arrangements enables the legal entities of the company subject to the arrangement to net amounts due to and from the counterparty reducing the maximum loss from credit risk in the event of counterparty default. 



The company is also a party to collateral security arrangements with most of its major derivative counterparties. These arrangements require the company to hold or post collateral (cash or U.S. Treasury securities) when the derivative fair values exceed contractually established thresholds. Posting thresholds can be fixed or can vary based on credit default swap pricing or credit ratings received from the major credit agencies. The aggregate fair value of all derivative instruments under these 





Table of Contents 



Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements  (continued) 



collateralized arrangements that were in a liability position at March 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018 was $359 million and $74 million, respectively, for which $14 million of collateral was posted and reduced the position at March 31, 2019 and no collateral was posted at December 31, 2018. Full collateralization of these agreements would be required in the event that the companys credit rating falls below investment grade or if its credit default swap spread exceeds 250 basis points, as applicable, pursuant to the terms of the collateral security arrangements. The aggregate fair value of derivative instruments in asset positions at March 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018 was $694 million and $731 million, respectively. This amount represents the maximum exposure to loss at the reporting date if the counterparties failed to perform as contracted. This exposure was reduced by $353 million and $267 million at March 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018, respectively, of liabilities included in master netting arrangements with those counterparties. Additionally, at March 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018, this exposure was reduced by $20 million and $70 million of cash collateral, respectively. There were no non-cash collateral balances in U.S. Treasury securities at March 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018. At March 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018, the net exposure related to derivative assets recorded in the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position was $321 million and $395 million, respectively. At March 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018, the net position related to derivative liabilities recorded in the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position was $338 million and $116 million, respectively. 



In the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position, the company does not offset derivative assets against liabilities in master netting arrangements nor does it offset receivables or payables recognized upon payment or receipt of cash collateral against the fair values of the related derivative instruments. The amount recognized in other receivables for the right to reclaim cash collateral was $14 million at March 31, 2019. No amount was recognized in other receivables at December 31, 2018 for the right to reclaim cash collateral. The amount recognized in accounts payable for the obligation to return cash collateral was $20 million and $70 million at March 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018, respectively. The company restricts the use of cash collateral received to rehypothecation, and therefore reports it in restricted cash in the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position. The company rehypothecated $14 million of cash collateral received at March 31, 2019 and no amount was rehypothecated at December 31, 2018. 



The company may employ derivative instruments to hedge the volatility in stockholders equity resulting from changes in currency exchange rates of significant foreign subsidiaries of the company with respect to the U.S. dollar. These instruments, designated as net investment hedges, expose the company to liquidity risk as the derivatives have an immediate cash flow impact upon maturity which is not offset by a cash flow from the translation of the underlying hedged equity. The company monitors this cash loss potential on an ongoing basis and may discontinue some of these hedging relationships by de-designating or terminating the derivative instrument in order to manage the liquidity risk. Although not designated as accounting hedges, the company may utilize derivatives to offset the changes in the fair value of the de-designated instruments from the date of de-designation until maturity. 



In its hedging programs, the company may use forward contracts, futures contracts, interest-rate swaps, cross-currency swaps, equity swaps, and options depending upon the underlying exposure. The company is not a party to leveraged derivative instruments. 



A brief description of the major hedging programs, categorized by underlying risk, follows. 



Interest Rate Risk 



Fixed and Variable Rate Borrowings 



The company issues debt in the global capital markets to fund its operations and financing business. Access to cost-effective financing can result in interest rate mismatches with the underlying assets. To manage these mismatches and to reduce overall interest cost, the company may use interest-rate swaps to convert specific fixed-rate debt issuances into variable-rate debt (i.e., fair value hedges) and to convert specific variable-rate debt issuances into fixed-rate debt (i.e., cash flow hedges). At March 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018, the total notional amount of the companys interest-rate swaps was $6.8 billion and $7.6 billion, respectively. The weighted-average remaining maturity of these instruments at March 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018 was approximately 3.6 years and 3.5 years, respectively. These interest-rate contracts were accounted for as fair value hedges. The company did not have any cash flow hedges relating to this program outstanding at March 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018. 



Forecasted Debt Issuance 



The company is exposed to interest rate volatility on future debt issuances. To manage this risk, the company may use instruments such as forward starting interest-rate swaps to lock in the rate on the interest payments related to the forecasted debt issuances. At March 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018, the total notional amount of forward starting interest-rate swaps 





Table of Contents 



Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements  (continued) 



outstanding was $5.5 billion at both periods. These swaps are linked to future interest payments on anticipated U.S. dollar debt issuances forecasted to occur throughout 2019 and 2020. The maximum length of time over which the company has hedged its exposure to the variability in future cash flows is 30 years. These swaps are accounted for as cash flow hedges. 



In connection with cash flow hedges of forecasted interest payments related to the companys borrowings, the company recorded net losses of $206 million and net losses of $35 million (before taxes) at March 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018, respectively, in AOCI. The company estimates that $11 million (before taxes) of the deferred net losses on derivatives in AOCI at March 31, 2019 will be reclassified to net income within the next 12 months, providing an offsetting economic impact against the underlying anticipated transactions. 



Foreign Exchange Risk 



Long-Term Investments in Foreign Subsidiaries (Net Investment) 



A large portion of the companys foreign currency denominated debt portfolio is designated as a hedge of net investment in foreign subsidiaries to reduce the volatility in stockholders equity caused by changes in foreign currency exchange rates in the functional currency of major foreign subsidiaries with respect to the U.S. dollar. The company also uses cross-currency swaps and foreign exchange forward contracts for this risk management purpose. At March 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018, the total notional amount of derivative instruments designated as net investment hedges was $6.0 billion and $6.4 billion, respectively. At March 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018, the weighted-average remaining maturity of these instruments was approximately 0.2 years at both periods. 



Anticipated Royalties and Cost Transactions 



The companys operations generate significant nonfunctional currency, third-party vendor payments and intercompany payments for royalties and goods and services among the companys non-U.S. subsidiaries and with the company. In anticipation of these foreign currency cash flows and in view of the volatility of the currency markets, the company selectively employs foreign exchange forward contracts to manage its currency risk. These forward contracts are accounted for as cash flow hedges. The maximum length of time over which the company has hedged its exposure to the variability in future cash flows is four years. At March 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018, the total notional amount of forward contracts designated as cash flow hedges of forecasted royalty and cost transactions was $10.0 billion and $9.8 billion, respectively. At March 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018, the weighted-average remaining maturity of these instruments was approximately 0.8 years at both periods. 



At March 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018, in connection with cash flow hedges of anticipated royalties and cost transactions, the company recorded net gains of $356 million and net gains of $342 million (before taxes), respectively, in AOCI. The company estimates that $256 million (before taxes) of deferred net gains on derivatives in AOCI at March 31, 2019 will be reclassified to net income within the next 12 months, providing an offsetting economic impact against the underlying anticipated transactions. 



Foreign Currency Denominated Borrowings 



The company is exposed to exchange rate volatility on foreign currency denominated debt. To manage this risk, the company employs cross-currency swaps to convert fixed-rate foreign currency denominated debt to fixed-rate debt denominated in the functional currency of the borrowing entity. These swaps are accounted for as cash flow hedges. The maximum length of time over which the company has hedged its exposure to the variability in future cash flows is approximately 12 years. At March 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018, the total notional amount of cross-currency swaps designated as cash flow hedges of foreign currency denominated debt was $12.2 billion and $6.5 billion, respectively. 



At March 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018, in connection with cash flow hedges of foreign currency denominated borrowings, the company recorded net losses of $21 million and net gains of $75 million (before taxes), respectively, in AOCI. The company estimates that $346 million (before taxes) of deferred net gains on derivatives in AOCI at March 31, 2019 will be reclassified to net income within the next 12 months, providing an offsetting economic impact against the underlying exposure. 





The company uses its Global Treasury Centers to manage the cash of its subsidiaries. These centers principally use currency swaps to convert cash flows in a cost-effective manner. In addition, the company uses foreign exchange forward 





Table of Contents 



Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements  (continued) 



contracts to economically hedge, on a net basis, the foreign currency exposure of a portion of the companys nonfunctional currency assets and liabilities. The terms of these forward and swap contracts are generally less than one year. The changes in the fair values of these contracts and of the underlying hedged exposures are generally offsetting and are recorded in other (income) and expense in the Consolidated Statement of Earnings. At March 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018, the total notional amount of derivative instruments in economic hedges of foreign currency exposure was $5.0 billion and $5.2 billion, respectively. 



Equity Risk Management 





Other Risks 



The company may hold warrants to purchase shares of common stock in connection with various investments that are deemed derivatives because they contain net share or net cash settlement provisions. The company records the changes in the fair value of these warrants in other (income) and expense in the Consolidated Statement of Earnings. The company did not have any warrants qualifying as derivatives outstanding at March 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018. 



The company is exposed to a potential loss if a client fails to pay amounts due under contractual terms. The company may utilize credit default swaps to economically hedge its credit exposures. The swaps are recorded at fair value with gains and losses reported in other (income) and expense in the Consolidated Statement of Earnings. The company did not have any derivative instruments relating to this program outstanding at March 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018. 



The company is exposed to market volatility on certain investment securities. The company may utilize options or forwards to economically hedge its market exposure. The derivatives are recorded at fair value with gains and losses reported in other (income) and expense in the Consolidated Statement of Earnings. At March 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018, the company did not have any derivative instruments relating to this program outstanding. 



The following tables provide a quantitative summary of the derivative and non-derivative instrument-related risk management activity at March 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018, as well as for the three months ended March 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively.

When procuring goods or services, or upon entering into a contract with its clients, the company determines whether an arrangement contains a lease at its inception. As part of that evaluation, the company considers whether there is an implicitly or explicitly identified asset in the arrangement and whether the company, as the lessee, or the client, if the company is the lessor, has the right to control that asset. 



The company determines whether there is a right to control the use of the asset by assessing its rights, as the lessee, or the clients rights, if the company is the lessor, to obtain substantially all of the economic benefits from the use of the identified asset and the rights to direct the use of the identified asset. If there is either an explicit or embedded lease within a contract, the company determines the classification of the lease (e.g., finance, operating, sales-type lease) at the lease commencement date. 



Accounting for leases as a lessee 



Effective January 1, 2019, when the company is the lessee, all leases with a term of more than 12 months are recognized as right-of-use (ROU) assets and associated lease liabilities in the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position. The lease liabilities are measured at the lease commencement date and determined using the present value of the minimum lease payments not yet paid and the companys incremental borrowing rate, which approximates the rate at which the company would borrow, on a secured basis, in the country where the lease was executed. The interest rate implicit in the lease is generally not determinable in transactions where the company is the lessee. The ROU asset equals the lease liability adjusted for any initial direct costs (IDCs), prepaid rent, and lease incentives. Fixed and in-substance fixed payments are included in the recognition of ROU assets and lease liabilities, however, variable lease payments, other than those based on a rate or index, are recognized in the Consolidated Statement of Earnings in the period in which the obligation for those payments is incurred. The companys variable lease payments generally relate to payments tied to various indexes, non-lease components and payments above a contractual minimum fixed payment. 



ROU assets represent the companys right to control the underlying assets under lease, and the lease liability is the obligation to make the lease payments related to the underlying assets under lease. Operating leases are included in operating right-of-use assets  net, current operating lease liabilities and operating lease liabilities in the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position. Finance leases are included in property, plant and equipment, short-term debt and long-term debt in the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position. At March 31, 2019, the total amount of ROU assets and lease liabilities for finance leases recognized in the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position in property, plant and equipment, short-term debt and long-term debt was $149 million, $13 million, and $144 million, respectively. 



Finance lease ROU assets are generally amortized on a straight-line basis over the lease term with the interest expense on the lease liability recorded using the interest method. The amortization and interest expense are recorded separately in the Consolidated Statement of Earnings. For operating leases, the amortization of the ROU asset and the interest expense on the lease liability are not separately recorded; rather, the lease cost is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term as a single-line item in the Consolidated Statement of Earnings, unless the ROU asset is impaired. The company has elected to not recognize leases with a lease term of less than 12 months in the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position, including those acquired in a business combination, and lease costs for those short-term leases are recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term in the Consolidated Statement of Earnings.

The following maturity analysis presents expected undiscounted cash out flows for operating and finance leases on an annual basis for the next five years, with the exception of 2019, which presents the expected undiscounted cash out flows for operating and finance leases for the remaining nine months of the year. 







Prior to the adoption of the new lease guidance on January 1, 2019, ROU assets and lease liabilities for operating leases were not recognized in the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position. The company has elected the practical expedient to not provide comparable presentation in the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position for periods prior to adoption. Rental expense, including amounts charged to inventories and fixed assets, and excluding amounts previously reserved, was $1,944 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. Rental expense in agreements with rent holidays and scheduled rent increases was previously recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term. Contingent rentals were included in the determination of rental expense as accruable. 



The following table, which was included in the companys 2018 Annual Report, depicts gross minimum rental commitments under noncancelable leases, amounts related to vacant space associated with workforce transformation, sublease income commitments and capital lease commitments at December 31, 2018.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements  (continued) 





The difference between the companys total lease commitments as reported at December 31, 2018 compared to the January 1, 2019 ROU asset balance in the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position is primarily due to the required use of a discount factor (imputed interest) under the new lease guidance and certain amounts that are not included in the ROU asset under the new lease guidance (e.g., tenant incentives and vacant space). 



Accounting for leases as a lessor 



The company typically enters into leases as an alternative means of realizing value from equipment that it would otherwise sell. Assets under lease include new and used IBM equipment and certain OEM products. Equipment generally consists of IBM Z, Power Systems and Storage Systems. 



Lease payments due to IBM are typically fixed and paid in equal installments over the lease term. The majority of the companys leases do not contain variable payments that are dependent on an index or a rate. Variable lease payments that do not depend on an index or a rate (e.g., property taxes), that are paid directly by the company and are reimbursed by the client, are recorded as revenue, along with the related cost, in the period in which collection of these payments is probable. Payments that are made directly by the client to a third party, including certain property taxes and insurance, are not considered part of variable payments and therefore are not recorded by the company. The company has made a policy election to exclude from consideration in contracts all collections from sales and other similar taxes. 



The companys payment terms for leases are typically unconditional. Therefore, while the client could terminate the lease prior to the end of the lease term, the client would be required to pay the remaining lease payments in full. At the end of the lease term, the company allows the client to either return the equipment, purchase the equipment or renew the lease based on mutually agreed upon terms. With respect to a client purchase of leased assets, the lease agreement would include an option to purchase the equipment at either a stated price or at the then-current fair market value of the equipment at the end of the lease. 



When lease arrangements include multiple performance obligations, the company allocates the consideration in the contract between the lease components and the non-lease components on a relative standalone selling price basis.

Sales-Type and Direct Financing Leases 



If a lease is classified as a sales-type or direct financing lease, the carrying amount of the asset is derecognized from inventory and a net investment in the lease is recorded. For a sales-type lease, the net investment in the lease is measured at commencement date as the sum of the lease receivable, the estimated guaranteed and unguaranteed residual value of the equipment less unearned income and allowance for credit losses. At March 31, 2019, the unguaranteed residual value of sales-type and direct financing leases was $566 million. For further information on the companys net investment in leases, including guaranteed and unguaranteed residual values, refer to note 6, Financing Receivables. Any selling profit or loss arising from a sales-type lease is recorded at lease commencement. Selling profit or loss is presented on a gross basis when the company enters into a lease to realize value from a product that it would otherwise sell in its ordinary course of business, whereas in transactions where the company enters into a lease for the purpose of generating revenue by providing financing, the selling profit or loss is presented on a net basis. Under a sales-type lease, initial direct costs are expensed at lease commencement. The company recognizes finance income over the term of a sales-type lease on the net investment in the lease and any variable lease payments, which are not included in the net investment in the lease. 



For a direct financing lease, the investment in the lease is measured similarly to a sales-type lease, however, the net investment in the lease is reduced by any selling profit. In a direct financing lease, the selling profit and initial direct costs are deferred at commencement and recognized over the lease term. The company rarely enters into direct financing leases. 



The estimated residual value represents the estimated fair value of the equipment under lease at the end of the lease. Estimating residual value is a risk unique to financing activities, and management of this risk is dependent upon the ability to accurately project future equipment values at lease inception. The company has insight into product plans and cycles for the IBM products under lease. The company estimates the future fair value of leased equipment by using historical models, analyzing the current market for new and used equipment and obtaining forward-looking product information such as marketing plans and technology innovations. 



The company optimizes the recovery of residual values by extending lease arrangements with existing clients. The company has historically managed residual value risk both through insight into its own product cycles and monitoring of OEM IT product announcements. The company periodically reassesses the realizable value of its lease residual values. Anticipated decreases in specific future residual values that are considered to be other-than-temporary are recognized immediately upon identification and are recorded as an adjustment to the residual value estimate. For sales-type and direct financing leases, this reduction lowers the recorded net investment and is recognized as a loss charged to finance income in the period in which the estimate is changed, as well as an adjustment to unearned income to reduce future-period financing activities. For the three months ended March 31, 2019, impairment of residual values was immaterial.

Operating Leases 



Equipment provided to clients under an operating lease is carried at cost within property, plant and equipment in the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position and depreciated over the lease term using the straight-line method, generally ranging from one to six years. The depreciable basis is the original cost of the equipment less the estimated residual value of the equipment at the end of the lease term. At March 31, 2019, the unguaranteed residual value of operating leases was $103 million. 



At commencement of an operating lease, initial direct costs are deferred. As lease payments are made, the company records sales revenue over the lease term. Initial direct costs are expensed over the lease term on the same basis as lease income is recorded. 







Assets under operating leases are tested for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. The impairment test is based on undiscounted cash flows, and, if impaired, the asset is written down to fair value based on either discounted cash flows or appraised values. There were no material impairment losses incurred during the period for assets under operating leases. These assets are included in Property, plant and equipment  net in the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position.

The company utilizes certain of its financing receivables as collateral for nonrecourse borrowings. Financing receivables pledged as collateral for borrowings were $868 million and $710 million at March 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018, respectively. 



The company did not have any financing receivables held for sale as of March 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018.

Financing Receivables by Portfolio Segment 









Write-offs of lease receivables and loan receivables were $3 million and $5 million, respectively, for the three months ended March 31, 2019. Provisions for credit losses recorded for lease receivables and loan receivables were immaterial, for the three months ended March 31, 2019. 



The average recorded investment of impaired leases and loans for Americas, EMEA and Asia Pacific was $147 million, $50 million and $51 million, respectively, for the three months ended March 31, 2019 and $130 million, $55 million and $81 million, respectively, for the three months ended March 31, 2018. Both interest income recognized and interest income recognized on a cash basis on impaired leases and loans were immaterial for the three months ended March 31, 2019 and 2018. 





Table of Contents 



Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements  (continued) 







Write-offs of lease receivables and loan receivables were $15 million and $20 million, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2018. Provisions for credit losses recorded for lease receivables and loan receivables were $14 million and $2 million, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2018. 



When determining the allowances, financing receivables are evaluated either on an individual or a collective basis. For individually evaluated receivables, the company determines the expected cash flow for the receivable and calculates an estimate of the potential loss and the probability of loss. For those accounts in which the loss is probable, the company records a specific reserve. The company considers any receivable with an individually evaluated reserve as an impaired receivable. 





Past Due Financing Receivables 



The company considers a clients financing receivable balance past due when any installment is aged over 90 days. The following table summarizes information about the recorded investment in lease and loan financing receivables, including recorded investments aged over 90 days and still accruing, billed invoices aged over 90 days and still accruing, and recorded investment not accruing.

Credit Quality Indicators 



The companys credit quality indicators, which are based on rating agency data, publicly available information and information provided by customers, are reviewed periodically based on the relative level of risk. The resulting indicators are a numerical rating system that maps to Moodys Investors Service credit ratings as shown below. The company uses information provided by Moodys, where available, as one of many inputs in its determination of customer credit ratings. 



The following tables present the recorded investment net of allowance for credit losses for each class of receivables, by credit quality indicator, at March 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018. Receivables with a credit quality indicator ranging from Aaa to Baa3 are considered investment grade. All others are considered non-investment grade. The credit quality indicators do not reflect mitigation actions that the company takes to transfer credit risk to third parties.

Troubled Debt Restructurings 



The company did not have any significant troubled debt restructurings during the three months ended March 31, 2019 or for the year ended December 31, 2018. 







Pre-tax stock-based compensation cost for the three months ended March 31, 2019 decreased $3 million compared to the corresponding period in the prior year. This was due to decreases related to performance share units, the conversion of stock-based compensation previously issued by acquired entities and stock options, partially offset by an increase in restricted stock units. All changes were immaterial. 



As of March 31, 2019, the total unrecognized compensation cost of $671 million related to non-vested awards was expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of approximately 2.5 years. 



There was no significant capitalized stock-based compensation cost at March 31, 2019 and 2018.

As of 2019, substantially all the plan participants in the U.S. Qualified IBM Personal Pension Plan (PPP) are considered inactive. As required by U.S. GAAP, this resulted in a change in the amortization period of unrecognized actuarial losses to the average remaining life expectancy of inactive plan participants, which was 18 years as of December 31, 2018. Recognized actuarial losses decreased by approximately $240 million for the three months ended March 31, 2019, compared to the corresponding period in the prior year, primarily driven by the change in amortization period. There was no impact to funded status, retiree benefit payments or funding requirements of the U.S. Qualified PPP as a result of this change. 



In 2019, the company expects to contribute approximately $400 million to its non-U.S. defined benefit and multi-employer plans, the largest of which will be contributed to the defined benefit pension plans in Japan, Spain and Belgium. This amount generally represents the legally mandated minimum contribution. Total net contributions to the non-U.S. plans in the first three months of 2019 were $94 million, of which $33 million was in cash and $61 million in U.S. Treasury securities. Total contributions to the non-U.S. plans in the first three months of 2018 were $191 million, of which $44 million was in cash and $147 million in U.S. Treasury securities. The contribution of U.S. Treasury securities is considered a non-cash transaction in the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows. 



The following table provides the components of the cost for the companys nonpension postretirement plans. 



Cost of Nonpension Postretirement Plans 







The company contributed $194 million in U.S. Treasury securities to the U.S. nonpension postretirement benefit plan during the three months ended March 31, 2019, and $120 million in U.S. Treasury securities during the three months ended March 31, 2018. The contribution of U.S. Treasury securities is considered a non-cash transaction in the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows.

Intangible Assets 



The following table details the companys intangible asset balances by major asset class. 











The net carrying amount of intangible assets decreased $131 million during the first quarter of 2019, primarily due to intangible asset amortization, partially offset by additions resulting from capitalized software. The aggregate intangible amortization expense was $303 million and $340 million for the quarters ended March 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. In addition, in the first three months of 2019, the company retired $273 million of fully amortized intangible assets, impacting both the gross carrying amount and accumulated amortization by this amount.

Goodwill 















In the first quarter of 2019, the company made a number of changes to its organizational structure and management system. With these changes, the company revised its reportable segments. Goodwill was reallocated to the new reporting segments, and as a result, an impairment assessment was performed. There were no goodwill impairment losses recorded during the first three months of 2019 or the full year of 2018 and the company has no accumulated impairment losses. For further information regarding the segment change, refer to note 8, Segments. 



Purchase price adjustments recorded in the first three months of 2019 and full year 2018 were related to acquisitions that were still subject to the measurement period that ends at the earlier of 12 months from the acquisition date or when information becomes available. Net purchase price adjustments recorded during the first three months of 2019 and full year 2018 were not material. 





Short-Term Debt 





The weighted-average interest rate for commercial paper at March 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018 was 2.5 percent at both periods. The weighted-average interest rate for short-term loans was 5.8 percent and 4.3 percent at March 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018, respectively.

Long-Term Debt 



Pre-Swap Borrowing 









There are no debt securities issued and outstanding by IBM International Group Capital LLC, which is an indirect, 100 percent owned finance subsidiary of IBM, the parent. Any debt securities issued by IBM International Group Capital LLC, would be fully and unconditionally guaranteed by the parent. 



The companys indenture governing its debt securities and its various credit facilities each contain significant covenants which obligate the company to promptly pay principal and interest, limit the aggregate amount of secured indebtedness and sale and leaseback transactions to 10 percent of the companys consolidated net tangible assets, and restrict the companys ability to merge or consolidate unless certain conditions are met. The credit facilities also include a covenant on the companys consolidated net interest expense ratio, which cannot be less than 2.20 to 1.0, as well as a cross default provision with respect to other defaulted indebtedness of at least $500 million. 



The company is in compliance with all of its significant debt covenants and provides periodic certifications to its lenders. The failure to comply with its debt covenants could constitute an event of default with respect to the debt to which such provisions apply. If certain events of default were to occur, the principal and interest on the debt to which such event of default applied would become immediately due and payable.

proceedings discussed in this note, except as specifically discussed herein, the company is unable to provide estimates of reasonably possible losses or range of losses, including losses in excess of amounts accrued, if any, for the following reasons. 







The following is a summary of the more significant legal matters involving the company. 





On May 13, 2010, IBM and the State of Indiana (acting on behalf of the Indiana Family and Social Services Administration) sued one another in a dispute over a 2006 contract regarding the modernization of social service program processing in Indiana. After six weeks of trial, on July 18, 2012, the Indiana Superior Court in Marion County rejected the States claims in their entirety and awarded IBM $52 million plus interest and costs. On February 13, 2014, the Indiana Court of Appeals reversed portions of the trial judges findings, found IBM in material breach, and ordered the case remanded to the trial judge to determine the States damages, if any. The Indiana Court of Appeals also affirmed approximately $50 million of the trial courts award of damages to IBM. On March 22, 2016, the Indiana Supreme Court affirmed the outcome of the Indiana Court of Appeals and remanded the case to the Indiana Superior Court. On August 7, 2017, the Indiana Superior Court awarded the State $128 million, which it then offset against IBMs previously affirmed award of $50 million, resulting in a $78 million award to the State, plus interest. On September 28, 2018, the Indiana Court of Appeals affirmed the Superior Courts $78 million award to the State, but reversed the Superior Court by awarding IBM prejudgment interest on its previously affirmed $50 million award. In February 2019, the Indiana Supreme Court heard both parties appeals. The matter remains pending. 



On March 9, 2017, the Commonwealth of Pennsylvanias Department of Labor and Industry sued IBM in Pennsylvania state court regarding a 2006 contract for the development of a custom software system to manage the Commonwealths unemployment insurance benefits programs. The matter is pending in a Pennsylvania court. 



Following the 2017 final judgment of the Appeal Court in London holding that IBM UK acted lawfully in 2010 in closing its UK defined benefit plans to future accruals for most participants and in implementing a new retirement policy, the Employment Tribunal in Southampton UK is expected to address approximately 290 individual actions alleging constructive 





Table of Contents 



Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements  (continued) 



dismissal and age discrimination brought against IBM UK in 2010 by employees who left the company at that time. The individual actions were previously stayed. 



In May 2015, a putative class action was commenced in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York related to the companys October 2014 announcement that it was divesting its global commercial semiconductor technology business, alleging violations of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA). Managements Retirement Plans Committee and three current or former IBM executives are named as defendants. On September 29, 2017, the Court granted the defendants motion to dismiss the first amended complaint. On December 10, 2018, the Second Circuit Court of Appeals reversed the District Court order and the matter remains pending. 



The company is party to, or otherwise involved in, proceedings brought by U.S. federal or state environmental agencies under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (CERCLA), known as Superfund, or laws similar to CERCLA. Such statutes require potentially responsible parties to participate in remediation activities regardless of fault or ownership of sites. The company is also conducting environmental investigations, assessments or remediations at or in the vicinity of several current or former operating sites globally pursuant to permits, administrative orders or agreements with country, state or local environmental agencies, and is involved in lawsuits and claims concerning certain current or former operating sites. 



The company is also subject to ongoing tax examinations and governmental assessments in various jurisdictions. Along with many other U.S. companies doing business in Brazil, the company is involved in various challenges with Brazilian tax authorities regarding non-income tax assessments and non-income tax litigation matters. The total potential amount related to all these matters for all applicable years is approximately $900 million. The company believes it will prevail on these matters and that this amount is not a meaningful indicator of liability. 





The company has applied the guidance requiring a guarantor to disclose certain types of guarantees, even if the likelihood of requiring the guarantors performance is remote. The following is a description of arrangements in which the company is the guarantor. 





It is not possible to predict the maximum potential amount of future payments under these or similar agreements due to the conditional nature of the companys obligations and the unique facts and circumstances involved in each particular agreement. Historically, payments made by the company under these agreements have not had a material effect on the companys business, financial condition or results of operations. 



In addition, the company guarantees certain loans and financial commitments. The maximum potential future payment under these financial guarantees was $24 million and $26 million at March 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018, respectively. The fair value of the guarantees recognized in the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position is not material.
