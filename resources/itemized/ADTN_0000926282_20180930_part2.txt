PART II. OTHER INFORMATION 



ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS 



A list of factors that could materially affect our business, financial condition or operating results is described in Part I, Item 1A, “Risk Factors” in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2017. There have been no material changes to our risk factors since our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2017, other than the following risk factor: 



Increased tariffs caused by changes in trade policies of the United States or other countries in which we do business, which could trigger retaliatory actions by affected countries resulting in “trade wars”, may increase costs for material imported into the United States and other countries. This in turn may increase our cost of goods and result in reduced profit margins or customer demand for some of our products or in trading partners limiting their trade with the United States.
