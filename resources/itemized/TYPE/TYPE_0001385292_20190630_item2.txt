Sources of Revenue  


Some of our revenue streams, particularly project-related and custom font design service revenue where spending is largely discretionary in nature, have historically been, and we expect them to continue to be in the future, susceptible to weakening economic conditions.
Table of Contents  


For the three months ended June 30, 2019 and 2018, revenue from customers outside the United States comprised 45.6% and 55.4%, respectively, of our total revenue.
For the six months ended June 30, 2019 and 2018, revenue from customers outside the United States comprised 49.7% and 55.7%, respectively, of our total revenue.
We expect that sales to international customers will continue to represent a substantial portion of our revenue for the foreseeable future.
Future international revenue will depend on the continued use and expansion of our products worldwide.
We derive a significant portion of OEM revenue from a limited number of customers, in particular manufacturers of laser printers and consumer electronic devices.
For the three months ended June 30, 2019 and 2018, our top ten licensees by revenue, most of which are OEM customers, accounted for approximately 34.9% and 23.8% of total revenue, respectively.
One customer accounted for 14.9% of total revenue for the three months ended June 30, 2019.
No one customer accounted for more than 10% of total revenue for the three months ended June 30, 2018.
For the six months ended June 30, 2019 and 2018, our top ten licensees by revenue accounted for approximately 28.6% and 22.2% of total revenue, respectively.
No one customer accounted for more than 10% of revenue for the six months ended June 30, 2019 or 2018.
If we are unable to maintain relationships with major customers or establish relationships with new customers, our licensing revenue will be adversely affected.
Cost of Revenue  

Our cost of revenue consists of font license fees that we pay on certain fonts that are owned by third parties, personnel and allocated internal engineering expense and overhead costs related to custom font design services and SaaS based offerings and cloud-based web service costs.
License fees that we pay to third parties are typically based on a percentage of our Creative Professional and OEM revenue and do not involve minimum fees.
Cost of revenue also includes amortization of acquired technology, which we amortize over 7 to 15 years.
For purposes of amortizing acquired technology, we estimate the remaining useful life of the technology based upon various considerations, including our knowledge of the technology and the way our customers use it.
We use the straight-line method to amortize acquired technology.
There is no reliable evidence to suggest that we should expect any other pattern of amortization than an even pattern, and we believe this best reflects the expected pattern of economic usage.
Gross Profit  

Our gross profit percentage is influenced by a number of factors including product mix, pricing and volume at any particular time.
However, cost of OEM revenue is typically lower than cost of Creative Professional revenue because we own a higher percentage of the fonts licensed to OEM customers, provide value-added technology and have negotiated lower royalty rates on the fonts we license from third parties because of volume.
In addition, within our Creative Professional business, the cost of custom font design and SaaS based service revenue is substantially higher than the cost of other revenue.
The relative cost of Creative Professional revenue has decreased in recent periods, as efforts to sell license rights to more fonts that we own have been successful, and because we have recently experienced success in our effort to sell certain license rights that carry lower royalty rates to Creative Professional  


Table of Contents  

customers.
Creative Professional revenue is growing at a faster rate than OEM revenue.
We expect these trends to continue.
Our gross profit is subject to variability from 

period-to-period, depending on the product mix and the level of custom font design and SaaS based service revenue.
Critical Accounting Policies  

The preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with GAAP and our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations requires us to make judgments, assumptions and estimates that affect the amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes.
We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities.
Actual results may differ from these estimates.
Information about our critical accounting policies may be found in “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,” under the heading “Critical Accounting Policies,” included in our Annual Report on Form 

10-K  for the year ended December 31, 2018.
Results of Operations for the Three Months Ended June 30, 2019 Compared to Three Months Ended June 30, 2018  


License revenue increased primarily due to a large multi-year agreement with one of our display imaging customers signed in the second quarter of 2019.
This was partially offset by a decline in printer revenue.
Service revenue decreased in the three months ended June 30, 2019, as compared to the same period in 2018, mainly due to increased customer churn in the last half of 2018.
Gross profit from license revenue, before amortization of acquired technology, was consistent at 84.8% and 84.9% in the three months ended June 30, 2019 and 2018, respectively.
Gross profit from service revenue, before amortization of acquired technology, decreased to 69.7% in the second quarter of 2019, as compared to 78.8% in the same period in 2018.
See further discussion below for additional information regarding our period over period revenue and cost of revenue.
While revenue from services has grown to a level of significance requiring separate disclosure, we continue to operate our business based on our two principal markets, Creative Professional and OEM, which is the basis for the following discussion of operating results.

The following discussion compares the three months ended June 30, 2019 with the three months ended June 30, 2018.
Revenue by Market  


Revenue  

Revenue was $63.2 million and $60.7 million for the three months ended June 30, 2019 and 2018, respectively, an increase of $2.5 million, or 4.2%.
Creative Professional revenue was $35.2 million and $38.4 million for the three months ended June 30, 2019 and 2018, respectively, a decrease of $3.2 million, or 8.3%, due to a decline in certain SAAS-based revenue and 

web-based sales mainly due to increased customer churn in the last half of 2018, partially offset by growth in sales to enterprise customers.
OEM revenue increased $5.8 million, or 25.8%, to $28.0 million for the three months ended June 30, 2019, from $22.2 million for the three months ended June 30, 2018.
Revenue from our display imaging customers increased as a result of earning a fixed fee upon a delivery of a large multi-year license customer agreement.
This increase was partially offset by a decline in printer revenue.
Revenue from our printer imaging OEM customers decreased period over period partially due to lower fixed fee contract revenue.
We expect there to be continued volatility in periodic revenue based on the timing and duration of fixed-fee term licenses with our customers.

Cost of Revenue and Gross Profit  

Cost of revenue, excluding amortization of acquired technology, was $11.0 million and $10.0 million for the three months ended June 30, 2019 and 2018, respectively, an increase of $1.0 million, or 10.4%.
As a percentage of sales, cost of revenue, excluding amortization of acquired technology, was 17.4% and 16.4% of total revenue in the three months ended June 30, 2019 and 2018, respectively.
The increase in cost of revenue, excluding amortization of acquired technology, is mainly due to higher associated costs with certain of our OEM product mix and partially due to an increase in revenue, period over period.
The portion of cost of revenue consisting of amortization of acquired technology was $0.8 million and $0.9 million for the three months ended June 30, 2019 and 2018, respectively, a decrease of $0.1 million, or 2.0%.
Gross profit in the three months ended June 30, 2019 decreased 0.9% to 81.3% of sales, as compared to 82.2% of sales in the same period in 2019, mainly due lower margins on OEM revenue, as described above.

Targeted marketing spending decreased in the second quarter of 2019, as compared to the same period in 2018, due to portfolio decisions around discretionary programs, which was offset by higher rent expense stemming from headcount changes, period over period.
Research and Development.
Research and development expense decreased $1.7 million, or 20.0%, to $6.8 million in the three months ended June 30, 2019, as compared to $8.5 million in the three months ended June 30, 2018, mainly due to lower personnel expenses.

Restructuring.
Restructuring expense decreased $6.3 million, or 99.5%, to $32 thousand in the three months ended June 30, 2019, as compared to $6.4 million in the three months ended June 30, 2018, a result of the restructuring action announced June 2018.
See Note 14 for further details.
Amortization of Other Intangible Assets.
Amortization of other intangible assets was $0.8 million and $1.0 million for the three months ended June 30, 2019 and 2018, respectively, a decrease of $0.2 million, or 14.1%, mainly due to the write off intangible assets associated with the Swyft business in the second quarter of 2018.
Interest Expense, Net  

Interest expense, net of interest income was $0.7 million and $0.8 million for the three months ended June 30, 2019 and 2018, respectively, a decrease of $0.1 million, or 12.6%, mainly due to a reduction in the balance outstanding under our revolving line of credit and partially due to a decrease in interest rates.
Other  

Other was an expense of $0.2 million and income of $0.6 million for the three months ended June 30, 2019 and 2018, respectively, a decrease of $0.8 million, or 137.8%, mainly due to currency fluctuations on our foreign denominated receivables and payables.
Provision for (Benefit from) Income Taxes  



Table of Contents  

   • 

The impact of foreign earnings increased our effective tax rate by 3.2% in the second quarter of 2019, as compared to 40.1% in the same period in 2018, due to our ability to better utilize foreign tax credits and to limit the amount of U.S. tax related to income subject to the Global Intangible Low Taxed Income (“GILTI”) provisions.
In the prior period, these provisions of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (“The Act”) resulted in a significantly higher effective tax rate on foreign earnings due to limitations on the Company’s ability to utilize foreign tax credits.
• 

The Company has reflected a reduction in its valuation allowance for foreign tax credits, resulting in a benefit of 10.2%, related to the amount of foreign tax credit carryforwards that the Company is estimating that it will be able to utilize based on 2019 taxable income.
In the same period in 2018, there was no change to the valuation allowance.

Provision for Income Taxes  


   • 

The impact of foreign earnings increased our effective tax rate by 3.3% in the six months ended June 30, 2019, as compared to 26.4% in the same period in 2018, due to our ability to better utilize foreign tax credits and to limit the amount of U.S. federal tax related to income subject to the GILTI provisions.
In the prior period, these provisions of The Act resulted in a significantly higher effective tax rate on foreign earnings due to limitations on the Company’s ability to utilize foreign tax credits.
• 

The Company has reflected a reduction in its valuation allowance for foreign tax credits, resulting in a benefit of 10.2%, related to the amount of foreign tax credit carryforwards that the Company is estimating that it will be able to utilize based on 2019 taxable income.
There was no such reduction in the prior period.
• 

Non-deductible expenses added 2.2% to the effective tax rate for the six months ended June 30, 2019, as compared to 14.2% for the same period in 2018, a result of the acceleration of the final payment of deferred compensation to the founders of Swyft in June 2018 and to two of the founders of Olapic in December 2018.
As a result of those payments, the total amount of 

non-deductible compensation in the current period is reduced.
In addition, the impact of these items as a percentage of pre-tax income is lower due to higher pre-tax income.

Liquidity and Capital Resources  

Cash Flows for the Six Months Ended June 30, 2019 and 2018  

Since our inception, we have financed our operations primarily through cash from operations, private and public stock sales and long-term debt arrangements, as described below.
We believe our existing cash and cash equivalents, cash flow from operating activities and available bank borrowings will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash needs for at least one year from the issuance of these financial statements.
At June 30, 2019, our principal sources of liquidity were cash and cash equivalents totaling $47.8 million and a $200.0 million revolving credit facility, of which there was $65.0 million of outstanding borrowings.
On May 3, 2018, our Board of Directors approved a share repurchase program of up to $25.0 million of our outstanding common stock, which permitted purchases through June 7, 2019.
In the six months ended June 30, 2019, we used $7.7 million in cash to purchase the remaining shares outstanding under the plan.
Our future working capital requirements will depend on many factors, including the operations of our existing business, our potential strategic expansion and future acquisitions we might undertake.
Operating Activities  

We generated $17.1 million in cash from operations during the six months ended June 30, 2019.
Net income, after adjusting for non-cash items such as depreciation and amortization, loss on extinguishment of debt, loss on retirement of assets, amortization of deferred financing costs, accreted interest, stock based compensation, provision for doubtful accounts, deferred income taxes, and unrealized currency gain on foreign denominated intercompany transactions, generated $29.6 million in cash.
Decreased accrued expenses used $9.7 million in cash, primarily a result of the payment of 2018 accrued variable compensation.
Increased deferred revenue and decreased accounts receivable generated $9.1 million in cash as a result of customer payments received.
Prepaid expenses and other assets used $7.3 million in cash, mainly due to an increase in long-term unbilled receivables from a large multi-year customer agreement, in   


Table of Contents  

addition to $0.2 million of prepaid software license renewals and $0.9 million of capitalized financing costs in connection with the new Credit Facility.
Increased tax refunds receivable combined with decreased accrued income taxes used $4.6 million during the six months ended June 30, 2019.
Variations in operating cash flows occur from 

time-to-time, because our enterprise customers make upfront payments on subscription revenue or conversely may enter into multi-year license agreements with future billing installments of the earned consideration.
These payments are required under the terms of our license agreements and can cause large fluctuations in accounts receivable, other assets and deferred revenue.
The timing and extent of such payments may significantly impact our cash balances.
We generated $3.3 million in cash from operations during the six months ended June 30, 2018.
Net loss, after adjusting for depreciation and amortization, amortization of deferred financing costs and accretion of interest, loss on retirement of fixed assets, stock based compensation, provision for doubtful accounts, deferred income taxes and unrealized currency loss on foreign denominated intercompany transactions generated $9.3 million in cash.
The 

non-cash impairment of Swyft related intangible assets added back $3.2 million.
Accrued expenses and accounts payable used $9.9 million, inclusive of large 

non-recurring payments of deferred compensation of $7.0 million, additional royalty payments resulting from the adoption of ASC 606 of $2.1 million and payment of investor relations advisor fees of $2.2 million.
In addition we paid 2017 accrued variable compensation, offset by additional restructuring accruals.
Decreased deferred revenue and increased accounts receivable generated $5.6 million in cash, primarily a result of customer payments received, net of an increase in unbilled receivables due to the adoption of ASC 606.
Increased prepaid expense and other assets used $4.0 million in cash, mainly due to an increase in long term unbilled receivables and capitalized contract costs related to the adoption of ASC 606.
Accrued income taxes used $1.0 million during the six months ended June 30, 2018.
Investing Activities  

During the six months ended June 30, 2019, we used $0.8 million in investing activities mainly for the purchase of property and equipment.

The record date was July 1, 2019 and the dividend was paid to shareholders of record on July 19, 2019.  

Credit Facility  

On March 22, 2019, the Company entered into a new credit agreement (the “New Credit Agreement”) by and among the Company, the Company’s subsidiary, Monotype Imaging Inc., (“the Borrower”), any financial institution that becomes a Lender and Bank of America, N.A., as administrative agent.
Pursuant to the New Credit Agreement the Lenders have agreed to provide the Borrower with a five-year $200.0 million senior secured revolving credit facility (the “Credit Facility”).
The Credit Facility permits the Company to request that the Lenders, at their election, increase the secured credit facility to a maximum of $300.0 million.
The Credit Facility provides more flexibility in addition to an increased borrowing capacity and extended terms, as defined above.
The New Credit Agreement replaced the Company’s existing $150.0 million revolving credit facility (the “Original Credit Agreement”) by and between the Company and Silicon Valley Bank.
The Original Credit Agreement was terminated effective March 22, 2019 and was scheduled to expire on September 15, 2020.
The Company had $75.0 million outstanding under the Original Credit Agreement at December 31, 2018.
Available borrowings under the Original Credit Agreement were reduced by approximately $0.5 million for one standby letter of credit issued in connection with a facility lease agreement, leaving $74.5 million available for borrowings at December 31, 2018.
At June 30, 2019, the Company had $65.0 million outstanding under the Credit Facility.
Available borrowings under the Credit Facility have been reduced by approximately $0.5 million for one standby letter of credit issued in connection with a facility lease agreement, leaving $134.5 million available for borrowings at June 30, 2019.
Table of Contents  

Borrowings under the Credit Facility bear interest through March 21, 2024 at a variable rate per annum equal to LIBOR plus between 1.0% and 1.625%, or at the Borrower’s option, the higher of (i) the prime rate as announced by Bank of America and (ii) 0.5% plus the overnight federal funds rate, plus in each case, between 0.0% and 0.625%, with the exact interest rate margin determined based on the consolidated leverage ratio.
At June 30, 2019, our rate, inclusive of applicable margins, was 3.3% for LIBOR.
At December 31, 2018, our rate under the Original Credit Agreement, inclusive of applicable margins, was 4.3% for LIBOR.
The Company is required to pay a commitment fee, based on the consolidated leverage ratio, equal to 0.175%, 0.20%, 0.225% or 0.25% per annum on the undrawn portion available under the revolving credit facility and variable per annum fees in respect of outstanding letters of credit.
In connection with the New Credit Agreement, the Company incurred closing and legal fees of approximately $0.9 million, which have been accounted for as deferred financing costs and will be amortized to interest expense over the term of the New Credit Agreement.
In addition, $34.0 thousand of unamortized deferred financing costs associated with the 

pro-rata share of prior loan syndicate lenders that did not participate in the new facility were written off and charged to other expense in the first quarter of 2019.
The New Credit Agreement includes financial covenants which require the Company to maintain (i) a consolidated leverage ratio of no greater than 3.25 to 1.0 or, upon a qualified acquisition subject to certain conditions, 3.75 to 1.0 and (ii) a minimum consolidated interest coverage ratio of 3.00 to 1.0.
At June 30, 2019, our consolidated leverage ratio was 0.59 to 1.0 and our consolidated interest coverage ratio was 21.38 to 1.0.
The New Credit Agreement also contains customary affirmative and negative covenants for transactions of this type and other affirmative and negative covenants agreed to by the parties, including, among others, limits on the Company and its subsidiaries’ ability to incur debt or liens, engage in sale-leaseback transactions, make loans, investments and acquisitions, incur additional indebtedness, engage in mergers, enter into asset sales, transact with affiliates and alter its business.
Adjusted EBITDA, under the Credit Facility, is defined as consolidated net earnings (or loss), plus net interest expense, income taxes, depreciation and amortization, and share based compensation expense, plus acquisition expenses not to exceed $2.0 million, minus capitalized research and development expense, plus restructuring, issuance costs, cash 

non-operating costs and other expenses or losses minus cash 

non-operating gains and other 

non-cash gains; provided, however that the aggregate of all cash 

non-operating expense shall not exceed 10% of Consolidated EBITDA.
The New Credit Agreement also provides for a number of customary events of default, including, among others, payment, bankruptcy, covenant, representation and warranty, change of control and judgment defaults.
Failure to comply with these covenants, or the occurrence of an event of default, could permit the Lenders under the New Credit Agreement to declare all amounts borrowed under the New Credit Agreement, together with accrued interest and fees, to be immediately due and payable.
The obligations of the Borrower under the Credit Facilities are unconditionally guaranteed by the Company and certain subsidiaries and secured by a lien on substantially all of the present and future property and assets of the Company and such subsidiaries, in each case, subject to limited exceptions and exclusions.
The Credit Facility also contains provisions for an increased interest rate during periods of default.
We do not believe that these covenants will affect our ability to operate our business, and we were in compliance with all covenants under our Credit Facility as of June 30, 2019.
Non-GAAP Measures  

In our quarterly earnings press releases and conference calls, in addition to Adjusted EBITDA as discussed above, we discuss a key measure that is not calculated according to GAAP.
This 

non-GAAP measure is net adjusted EBITDA, which is defined as income (loss) from operations before depreciation, amortization of acquired intangible assets, stock based compensation expense, acquisition-related compensation and 

one-time 

non-recurring expenses.
We use net adjusted EBITDA as a principal indicator of the operating performance of our business.
We use net adjusted EBITDA in internal forecasts and models when establishing internal operating budgets, supplementing the financial results and forecasts reported to our board of directors, determining bonus compensation for our employees based on operating performance and evaluating short-term and long-term operating trends in our operations.
We believe that net adjusted EBITDA permits a comparative assessment of our operating performance, relative to our performance based on our GAAP results, while isolating the effects of charges that may vary from 

period-to-period without direct correlation to underlying operating performance.
We believe that these 

non-GAAP financial adjustments are useful to investors because they allow investors to evaluate the effectiveness of the methodology and information used by management in our financial and operational decision-making.
We believe that trends in our net adjusted EBITDA may be valuable indicators of our operating performance.
In our quarterly earnings press releases and conference calls, in addition to Adjusted EBITDA and net adjusted EBITDA as discussed above, we discuss another key measure that is not calculated according to GAAP.
This 

non-GAAP measure is 

non-GAAP  earnings per diluted share, which is defined as earnings per diluted share before amortization of acquired intangible assets, stock based compensation expenses, acquisition-related compensation and 

one-time 

non-recurring expenses.
We use 

non-GAAP earnings per diluted share as one of our principal indicators of the operating performance of our business.

The following table presents a reconciliation from net income (loss) per diluted share, which is the most directly comparable GAAP measure, to 



For the three and six months ended June 30, 2018, $1.4 million, or $0.03 per share, of stock based compensation expense was reversed as a result of forfeitures of awards by employees included in the restructuring plan.
This non-recurring amount has been included in restructuring expenses.
For the three months ended June 30, 2019, the amount includes $0.2 million, or $0.00 per share, of expense associated with the deferred compensation arrangement resulting from the Olapic acquisition.
For the three months ended June 30, 2018, the amount includes $0.9 million, or $0.02 per share, of expense associated with the deferred compensation arrangement resulting from the Olapic acquisition and $0.2 million, or $0.01 per share, of expense associated with the deferred compensation arrangement resulting from the Amendment to the Swyft Merger Agreement.
For the six months ended June 30, 2019, the amount includes $0.3 million, or $0.01 per share, of expense associated with the deferred compensation arrangement resulting from the Olapic acquisition.
For the six months ended June 30, 2018, the amount includes $1.8 million, or $0.04 per share, of expense associated with the deferred compensation arrangement resulting from the Olapic acquisition and $0.5 million, or $0.01 per share, of expense associated with the deferred compensation arrangement resulting from the Amendment to the Swyft Merger Agreement.
For the three months ended June 30, 2019, the amount primarily includes $0.7 million of certain advisor fees related to shareholder activities.
For the three months ended June 30, 2018, the amount includes $6.4 million of restructuring expenses.
For the six months ended June 30, 2019, the amount primarily includes $0.7 million of certain advisor fees related to shareholder activities.
For the six months ended June 30, 2018, the amount includes $2.7 million of certain advisor fees related to shareholder activities, $2.2 million of royalty expenses, recorded in cost of sales, associated with revenue that was not recognized under ASC 606 and $6.6 million of restructuring expenses.

For the three months ended June 30, 2019, the amount primarily includes $0.5 million, or $0.01 per share, net of tax, of certain advisor fees related to shareholder activities.
For the three months ended June 30, 2018, the amount includes $4.9 million, or $0.12 per share, net of tax, of restructuring expenses.
For the six months ended June 30, 2019, the amount primarily includes $0.5 million, or $0.01 per share, net of tax, of certain advisor fees related to shareholder activities.
For the six months ended June 30, 2018, the amount includes $2.1 million, or $0.06 per share, net of tax, of certain advisor fees related to shareholder activities, $1.7 million, or $0.04 per share, net of tax, of royalty expenses, recorded in cost of sales, associated with revenue that was not recognized under ASC 606 and $5.0 million, or $0.12 per share, net of tax, of restructuring expenses.
Net adjusted EBITDA is not a measure of operating performance under GAAP and should not be considered as an alternative or substitute for GAAP profitability measures such as income (loss) from operations and net income (loss).
Net adjusted EBITDA as an operating performance measure has material limitations since it excludes the statement of income impact of depreciation and amortization expense and stock based compensation and therefore does not represent an accurate measure of profitability.
We have significant intangible assets and amortization expense is a meaningful element in our financial statements and therefore its exclusion from net adjusted EBITDA is a material limitation.
Stock based compensation and the associated expense has a meaningful impact on our financial statements and therefore its exclusion from net adjusted EBITDA is a material limitation.
Non-recurring expenses, such as certain advisor fees, royalty expenses and restructuring expenses, have a meaningful impact on our financial statements and therefore its exclusion from net adjusted EBITDA is a material limitation.
As a result, net adjusted EBITDA should be evaluated in conjunction with net income (loss) for complete analysis of our profitability, as net income (loss) includes the financial statement impact of these items and is the most directly comparable GAAP performance measure to net adjusted EBITDA.
As net adjusted EBITDA is not defined by GAAP, our definition of net adjusted EBITDA may differ from and therefore may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies, thereby limiting its usefulness as a comparative measure.
Because of the limitations that net adjusted EBITDA has as an analytical tool, investors should not consider it in isolation, or as a substitute for analysis of our operating results as reported under GAAP.

Contractual Obligations  

The table below summarizes our operating lease contractual obligations at June 30, 2019 and the effects of such obligations on liquidity and cash flow in future years (in thousands).
There is no change in our other contractual obligations from those disclosed in Part II, Item 7 of our Annual Report on Form 


Item 3.
Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk  

We are exposed to financial market risk, including interest rate risk and foreign currency exchange risk.
Concentration of Revenue and Credit Risk   

Financial instruments that potentially subject us to concentrations of credit risk consist principally of cash and cash equivalents and trade receivables.
Cash equivalents consist primarily of bank deposits.
Deposits of cash held outside the United States totaled approximately $19.1 million and $21.1 million at June 30, 2019 and December 31, 2018, respectively.
We grant credit to customers in the ordinary course of business.
Credit evaluations are performed on an ongoing basis to reduce credit risk, and no collateral is required from our customers.
An allowance for uncollectible accounts is provided for those accounts receivable considered to be uncollectible based upon historical experience and credit evaluation.
As of June 30, 2019 and December 31, 2018, one customer individually accounted for 12.5% and 10.8% of our gross accounts receivable, respectively.
Due to the nature of our quarterly revenue streams derived from royalty revenue, it is not unusual for our accounts receivable balances to include a few customers with large balances.
Historically, we have not recorded material losses due to customers’ nonpayment.
Our Creative Professional business consists of a higher volume of lower dollar value transactions.
Accordingly, as the percent of Creative Professional revenue increases in relation to total revenue, we expect the average time to collect our accounts receivables, and our overall accounts receivables balances, to increase.
One customer accounted for 14.9% of total revenue for the three months ended June 30, 2019.
No one customer accounted for more than 10% of total revenue for the three months ended June 30, 2018 or for the six months ended June 30, 2019 or 2018.
Interest Rate Risk  

Our exposure to market risk associated with changes in interest rates relates primarily to our long-term debt.
At June 30, 2019 and December 31, 2018, the Company had borrowings under our revolving Credit Facility of $65.0 million and $75.0 million, respectively.
The interest rate on our Credit Facility fluctuates with either the prime rate or the LIBOR interest rate and at June 30, 2019, our rate, inclusive of applicable margins, was 3.3% for LIBOR.
For the six months ended June 30, 2019, a 10% increase in the rate would have increased our annual interest expense by $0.2 million.
Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Risk  

In accordance with ASC Topic No.
830, 

Foreign Currency Matters, or ASC 830, all assets and liabilities of our foreign subsidiaries whose functional currency is a currency other than U.S. dollars are translated into U.S. dollars at an exchange rate as of the balance sheet date or historical rates, as appropriate.
Revenue and expenses of these subsidiaries are translated at the average monthly exchange rates.
The resulting translation adjustments as calculated from the translation of our foreign subsidiaries to U.S. dollars are recorded as a separate component of comprehensive income.
non-U.S. dollar denominated revenue and expenses to U.S. dollar denominated revenue and expenses does not change from current levels.
Table of Contents  

We incur foreign currency exchange gains and losses related to certain customers that are invoiced in U.S. dollars, but who have the option to make an equivalent payment in their own functional currencies at a specified exchange rate as of a specified date.
In the period from that date until payment in the customer’s functional currency is received and converted into U.S. dollars, we can incur realized gains and losses.
We also incur foreign currency exchange gains and losses on certain intercompany assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies.
We are currently utilizing 

30-day forward contracts to mitigate our exposure on these currency fluctuations.
Any increase or decrease in the fair value of the forward contracts is offset by the change in the value of the hedged assets of our consolidated foreign affiliate.
At June 30, 2019, we had one 

30-day forward contract to sell 2.7 million British pound sterling and to purchase $3.4 million that together, had an immaterial fair value.
At December 31, 2018, we had one 

30-day forward contract to sell 2.7 million British pound sterling and to purchase $3.4 million that together, had an immaterial fair value.
Item 4.
Controls and Procedures  

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures  

Our management, with the participation of our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of June 30, 2019.
The term “disclosure controls and procedures,” as defined in Rules


15d-15(e) under the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the Exchange Act, means controls and other procedures of a company that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms.
Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to the company’s management, including its principal executive and principal financial officers, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.
Management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives, and management necessarily applies its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures.
Our disclosure controls and procedures are designed to provide a reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives.
Based on the evaluation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of June 30, 2019, our principal executive officer and principal financial officer concluded that, as of such date, the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures were effective at the reasonable assurance level.
Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting  

There was no change in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 


15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) that occurred during and as of the fiscal quarter ended June 30, 2019 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
Part I.
Legal Proceedings  

From time to time, we may be a party to various claims, suits and complaints.
We do not believe that there are claims or legal proceedings that, if determined adversely to us, would have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition.
Item 1A.
