Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations  

Forward Looking Statements and Projections  

This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q contains forward looking statements.
Forward looking statements relate to future events or our future financial performance.
We generally identify forward looking statements by terminology such as may, will, should, expects, plans, anticipates, could, intends, target, projects, contemplates, believes, estimates, predicts, potential or continue or the negative of these terms or other similar words.
These statements are only predictions.
We have based these forward looking statements largely on our current expectations and projections about future events and financial trends that we believe may affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.
The outcome of the events described in these forward looking statements is subject to risks, uncertainties and other factors described in Risks Factors in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2017, as well as those described in Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, Risk Factors and elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.
Accordingly, you should not rely upon forward looking statements as predictions of future events.
We cannot assure you that the events and circumstances reflected in the forward looking statements will be achieved or occur, and actual results could differ materially from those projected in the forward looking statements.
The forward looking statements made in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q relate only to events as of the date on which the statements are made.
We undertake no obligation to update any forward looking statement to reflect events or circumstances after the date on which the statement is made or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events.

Sources of Revenue  


Some of our revenue streams, particularly project-related and custom font design service revenue where spending is largely discretionary in nature, have historically been, and we expect them to continue to be in the future, susceptible to weakening economic conditions.
For the three months ended March 31, 2018 and 2017, revenue from customers outside the United States comprised 56.2% and 55.0%, respectively, of our total revenue.
We expect that sales by our international subsidiaries will continue to represent a substantial portion of our revenue for the foreseeable future.
Future international revenue will depend on the continued use and expansion of our design assets and technology worldwide.
We derive a significant portion of our OEM revenue from a limited number of customers, in particular manufacturers of laser printers and consumer electronic devices.
For the three months ended March 31, 2018 and 2017, our top ten licensees by revenue, most of which are OEM customers, accounted for approximately 23.0% and 31.3% of our total revenue, respectively.
No one customer accounted for more than 10% of our total revenue for the three months ended March 31, 2018 or 2017.
Creative Professional Revenue  

For a description of our Creative Professional revenue and related accounting policy, see Note 4.
OEM Revenue  

For a description of our OEM revenue and related accounting policy, see Note 4.
Cost of Revenue  

Our cost of revenue consists of font license fees that we pay on certain fonts that are owned by third parties, personnel and allocated internal engineering expense and overhead costs related to custom font design services and our SaaS based offerings and cloud-based web service costs.
License fees that we pay to third parties are typically based on a percentage of our Creative Professional and OEM revenue and do not involve minimum fees.
Cost of revenue also includes amortization of acquired technology, which we amortize over 7 to 15 years.
For purposes of amortizing acquired technology, we estimate the remaining useful life of the technology based upon various considerations, including our knowledge of the technology and the way our customers use it.
We use the straight-line method to amortize our acquired technology.
There is no reliable evidence to suggest that we should expect any other pattern of amortization than an even pattern, and we believe this best reflects the expected pattern of economic usage.
Table of Contents 

Gross Profit  

Our gross profit percentage is influenced by a number of factors including product mix, pricing and volume at any particular time.
However, our cost of OEM revenue is typically lower than our cost of Creative Professional revenue because we own a higher percentage of the fonts licensed to our OEM customers, provide value-added technology and have negotiated lower royalty rates on the fonts we license from third parties because of volume.
In addition, within our Creative Professional business, the cost of our custom font design and SaaS based service revenue is substantially higher than the cost of our other revenue.
The relative cost of our Creative Professional revenue has decreased in recent periods, as efforts to sell license rights to more fonts that we own have been successful, and because we have recently experienced success in our effort to sell certain license rights that carry lower royalty rates to Creative Professional customers.
Our Creative Professional revenue is growing at a faster rate than our OEM revenue.
We expect these trends to continue.
Our gross profit is subject to variability from period-to-period, depending on the product mix and the level of custom font design and SaaS based service revenue.
Critical Accounting Policies  

The preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with GAAP and our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations requires us to make judgments, assumptions and estimates that affect the amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes.
We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities.
Actual results may differ from these estimates.
Information about our critical accounting policies may be found in Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, under the heading Critical Accounting Policies, included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2017, except for the adoption as of January 1, 2018, of guidance in ASC 606 as more fully described in Note 3 to the accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated quarterly statements.
Results of Operations for the Three Months Ended March 31, 2018 Compared to Three Months Ended March 31, 2017  



License revenue increased primarily due to the growth in sales of revenue from our enterprise customers, including the launch of our Mosaic product offering, partially offset by decreases due to certain one-time printer revenue recognized in the first quarter of 2017 as a result of conversion of customers to fixed fee contracts from royalty bearing contracts.
There was no corresponding item in the current period.
Additionally, we recorded lower royalty based revenue as a result of the adoption of ASC 606.
We now estimate and accrue our royalty-based revenue in the quarter when the royalty-based units are shipped, as opposed to when those shipments were reported to us by the licensee under legacy GAAP.
This change had the effect of shifting traditional holiday seasonality revenue for consumer electronics from the first quarter to the fourth quarter.
Service revenue has increased as a percentage of total revenue due primarily to the growth of our SaaS-based product offerings.
Gross profit from license revenue, before amortization of acquired technology, decreased from 84.5% to 79.0%.
These decreases are primarily due to additional non-recurring royalty expense for which there was no corresponding revenue in the period in accordance with ASC 606.
Gross profit from service revenue, before amortization of acquired technology, decreased from 76.7% to 73.9%.
See further discussion below for additional information regarding our period over period revenue and cost of revenue.
While revenue from services has grown to a level of significance requiring separate disclosure, we continue to operate our business based on our two principal markets, Creative Professional and OEM, which is the basis for the following discussion of operating results.
Table of Contents 

The following discussion compares the three months ended March 31, 2018 with the three months ended March 31, 2017.
Revenue by Market  



Revenue  

Revenue was $56.7 million and $52.5 million for the three months ended March 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively, an increase of $4.2 million, or 8.0%.
Creative Professional revenue increased $7.9 million, or 29.3%, to $35.0 million for the three months ended March 31, 2018, as compared to $27.1 million for the three months ended March 31, 2017, mainly due to growth in sales of revenue from our enterprise customers, including the launch of our Mosaic solution and higher service revenue as SaaS offerings continue to become a larger part of our offering portfolio.
OEM revenue decreased $3.7 million, or 14.6%, to $21.7 million in the first quarter of 2018, as compared to $25.4 million in the first quarter of 2017.
Revenue from our printer imaging electronic OEM customers decreased period over period largely due to certain one-time printer revenue recognized in the first quarter of 2017 as a result of conversion of customers to fixed fee contracts from royalty bearing contracts.
There was no corresponding item in the current period.
Additionally, we recorded lower royalty based revenue as a result of the adoption of ASC 606.
We now estimate and accrue our royalty-based revenue in the quarter when the royalty-based units are shipped, as opposed to when those shipments were reported to us by the licensee under legacy GAAP.
This change had the effect of shifting traditional holiday seasonality revenue for consumer electronics from the first quarter to the fourth quarter.
Cost of Revenue and Gross Profit  

Cost of revenue, excluding amortization of acquired technology, was $12.4 million and $8.8 million in the three months ended March 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively.
The increase in cost of revenue in the first quarter of 2018 is partially a result of the increase in revenue and partially due to $2.2 million of additional non-recurring royalty expense for which there was no corresponding revenue item in the period in accordance with ASC 606.
As a percentage of sales, cost of revenue, excluding amortization of acquired technology, was 22.0% and 16.7% of total revenue in the three months ended March 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively.
The portion of cost of revenue consisting of amortization of acquired technology was unchanged at $0.9 million for the three months ended March 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively.
Gross profit decreased 5.1% to 76.5% in the three months ended March 31, 2018, as compared to 81.6% in the three months ended March 31, 2017.
The decrease in gross profit in the three months ended March 31, 2018, as compared to the same period in 2017, was primarily due to the additional non-recurring royalty expense as described above.

Operating Expenses  

Marketing and Selling.
Marketing and selling expense was $20.1 million and $21.2 million in the three months ended March 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively, a decrease of $1.1 million, or 5.5%, mainly due to lower personnel expenses.
Personnel and personnel related expenses decreased $1.3 million in the first quarter of 2018, as compared to the same period in 2017, partially due to the Olapic restructuring in the fall of 2017 and other decreases in headcount, which were partially offset by increased variable compensation and annual salary increases.
A net increase in infrastructure expenses, such as software and facilities, provided a $0.2 million increase period over period.
Research and Development.
Research and development expense was $9.4 million and $9.5 million in the three months ended March 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively, a decrease of $0.1 million, or 1.2%.
General and Administrative.
General and administrative expense increased $4.8 million, or 43.6%, to $15.7 million in the three months ended March 31, 2018, as compared to $10.9 million in the three months ended March 31, 2017.
Outside consulting and legal expenses increased $3.2 million in the first quarter of 2018, as compared to the same period in 2017, primarily due to additional expenses incurred related to shareholder activities.
Personnel and personnel related expenses increased $1.1 million in the three months ended March 31, 2018, as compared to the same period in 2017, the result of increased headcount mainly from key hiring during the second half of 2017 and annual salary increases.
Increased infrastructure expenses, such as software expenses and depreciation, together contributed $0.5 million to the overall increase in general and administrative expenses, period over period.
Amortization of Other Intangible Assets.
Amortization of other intangible assets was unchanged at $1.0 million for the three months ended March 31, 2018 and 2017.
Interest Expense, Net  

Interest expense, net of interest income was $0.7 million and $0.6 million for the three months ended March 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively, an increase of $0.1 million, or 15.4%, mainly due to borrowings under our revolving line of credit.
Loss on Derivatives  

Loss on derivatives was a loss of $0.1 million in the first quarter of 2018, as compared to a loss of $54 thousand in the three months ended March 31, 2017, the net result of changes in the market value of our 30-day forward currency derivative contracts.
Benefit from Income Taxes  


      The statutory tax rate in the three months ended March 31, 2018 is 21.0%, as compared to the U.S. statutory tax rate of 35.0% in the same period in 2017.
   Foreign rate differential increased our effective rate 33.8% in the three months ended March 31, 2018, as compared to a decrease of 3.8% in the same period in 2017, due to changes in tax treatment of foreign earnings under The Act.
These changes include significant new limitations on the ability to utilize foreign tax credits, and the effects of the new Global Intangible Low Taxed Income (GILTI) provisions.
These provisions have resulted in a significantly higher effective tax rate on foreign earnings.
   Non-deductible expenses added 8.2% to the effective tax rate for the three months ended March 31, 2018, as compared to 20.9% for the three months ended March 31, 2017, primarily due to changes in the deductibility of officers compensation under The Act, partially offset by the reduction in the statutory rate and a decrease in non-deductible acquisition-related compensation expense for the period.
Table of Contents 

In addition, a net windfall on stock based compensation resulted in a 3.2% increase in the effective rate for the first quarter of 2018, as compared to a shortfall rate in the same period in 2017 that resulted in a 40.1% reduction in the effective rate.
Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements  

Information concerning recently issued accounting pronouncements may be found in Note 3 to our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.
Liquidity and Capital Resources  

Cash Flows for the Three Months Ended March 31, 2018 and 2017.
Since our inception, we have financed our operations primarily through cash from operations, private and public stock sales and long-term debt arrangements, as described below.
We believe our existing cash and cash equivalents, our cash flow from operating activities and available bank borrowings will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash needs for at least one year from the issuance of these financial statements.
At March 31, 2018, our principal sources of liquidity were cash and cash equivalents totaling $85.4 million and a $150.0 million revolving credit facility, of which there was $90.0 million of outstanding borrowings.
Our liquidity and cash flows in the three months ended March 31, 2017, included share purchases made under a share repurchase program, which ended on December 31, 2017.
Our future working capital requirements will depend on many factors, including the operations of our existing business, our potential strategic expansion and future acquisitions we might undertake.
Operating Activities  

Variations in operating cash flows occur from time-to-time, because our enterprise customers make upfront payments on subscription revenue.
These payments are required under the terms of our license agreements and can cause large fluctuations in accounts receivable and deferred revenue.
The timing and extent of such payments may significantly impact our cash balances.
We generated $7.5 million in cash from operations during the three months ended March 31, 2018.
Net loss, after adjusting for depreciation and amortization, loss on retirement of assets, amortization of deferred financing costs, accreted interest, stock based compensation, provision for doubtful accounts, deferred income taxes, and unrealized currency gain on foreign denominated intercompany transactions generated $1.4 million in cash.
Decreased accrued expenses offset by increased accounts payable used $2.7 million in cash, primarily a result of the payment of 2017 accrued variable compensation.
Increased deferred revenue and decreased accounts receivable generated $10.8 million in cash as a result of customer payments received in Q1, net of an increase in unbilled receivables due to the adoption of ASC 606.
Prepaid expenses and other assets used $1.3 million in cash, mainly due to an increase in capitalized contract costs related to the adoption of ASC 606.
Accrued income taxes used $0.7 million during the quarter ended March 31, 2018.
We generated $5.6 million in cash from operations during the three months ended March 31, 2017.
Net loss, after adjusting for depreciation and amortization, amortization of deferred financing costs, accreted interest, stock based compensation, provision for doubtful accounts, deferred income taxes, and unrealized currency gain on foreign denominated intercompany transactions generated $5.4 million in cash.
Decreased accrued expenses and accounts payable used $4.5 million in cash, primarily a result of the payment of 2016 accrued variable compensation.
Increased deferred revenue and decreased accounts receivable, offset by increased prepaid expenses generated $5.3 million in cash, mainly due to timing.
Accrued income taxes used $0.6 million during the quarter ended March 31, 2017.

Dividends  

On February 14, 2018, our Board of Directors approved an $0.116 per share, or $4.9 million, quarterly cash dividend on our outstanding common stock.
The record date was April 2, 2018 and the dividend was paid to shareholders on April 20, 2018.
We anticipate this to be a recurring quarterly dividend with future payments and record dates, subject to board approval.
On April 2, 2018, our Board of Directors approved a $0.116 per share quarterly cash dividend on our outstanding common stock.
The record date is set for July 2, 2018 and the dividend is payable to shareholders of record on July 20, 2018.  

Credit Facility  

On September 15, 2015, the Company entered into a new credit agreement (the New Credit Agreement) by and among the Company, the Companys subsidiary, Monotype Imaging Inc., any financial institution that becomes a Lender (as defined therein) and Silicon Valley Bank, as agent which provides for a five-year $150.0 million secured revolving credit facility (the Credit Facility).
The Credit Facility permits the Company to request that the Lenders, at their election, increase the secured credit facility to a maximum of $200.0 million.
The Credit Facility is available to the Company on a revolving basis through September 15, 2020.
Repayment of any amounts borrowed is not required until maturity of the Credit Facility; however, the Company may repay any amounts borrowed at any time, without premium or penalty.
Borrowings under the Credit Facility bear a variable rate not less than zero based upon, at the Companys option, either LIBOR or the higher of (i) the prime rate as published in the Wall Street Journal, and (ii) 0.5% plus the overnight federal funds rate, plus in each case, an applicable margin.
The applicable margin for LIBOR loans, based on the applicable leverage ratio, is 1.25%, 1.50% or 1.75% per annum, and the applicable margin for base rate loans, based on the applicable leverage ratio, is either 0.25%, 0.50% or 0.75%% per annum.
At March 31, 2018, our rate, inclusive of applicable margins, was 3.6% for LIBOR, and at December 31, 2017, our rate, inclusive of applicable margins, was 3.1% for LIBOR.
The Company had outstanding borrowings under the Credit Facility of $90.0 million at March 31, 2018, and $93.0 million at December 31, 2017.
The Credit Facility has $0.5 million reserved for one stand-by letter of credit in connection with a facility lease agreement, leaving $59.5 million and $56.5 million available for borrowing at March 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017, respectively.
Table of Contents 




The Credit Facility also contains provisions for an increased interest rate during periods of default.
We do not believe that these covenants will affect our ability to operate our business, and we were in compliance with all covenants under our Credit Facility as of March 31, 2018.
Non-GAAP Measures  

In our quarterly earnings press releases and conference calls, in addition to Adjusted EBITDA as discussed above, we discuss a key measure that is not calculated according to GAAP.
This non-GAAP measure is net adjusted EBITDA, which is defined as income (loss) from operations before depreciation, amortization of acquired intangible assets, stock based compensation expense and acquisition-related compensation.
We use net adjusted EBITDA as a principal indicator of the operating performance of our business.
We use net adjusted EBITDA in internal forecasts and models when establishing internal operating budgets, supplementing the financial results and forecasts reported to our board of directors, determining bonus compensation for our employees based on operating performance and evaluating short-term and long-term operating trends in our operations.
We believe that net adjusted EBITDA permits a comparative assessment of our operating performance, relative to our performance based on our GAAP results, while isolating the effects of charges that may vary from period-to-period without direct correlation to underlying operating performance.
We believe that these non-GAAP financial adjustments are useful to investors because they allow investors to evaluate the effectiveness of the methodology and information used by management in our financial and operational decision-making.
We believe that trends in our net adjusted EBITDA may be valuable indicators of our operating performance.
Table of Contents 

In our quarterly earnings press releases and conference calls, in addition to Adjusted EBITDA and net adjusted EBITDA as discussed above, we discuss another key measure that is not calculated according to GAAP.
This non-GAAP measure is non-GAAP earnings per diluted share, which is defined as earnings per diluted share before amortization of acquired intangible assets, stock based compensation expenses and acquisition-related compensation.
We use non-GAAP earnings per diluted share as one of our principal indicators of the operating performance of our business.
We use non-GAAP earnings per diluted shares in internal forecasts, supplementing the financial results and forecasts reported to our board of directors and evaluating short-term and long-term operating trends in our operations.
We believe that non-GAAP earnings per diluted share permits a comparative assessment of our operating performance, relative to our performance based on our GAAP results, while isolating the effects of charges that may vary from period-to-period without direct correlation to underlying operating performance.
We believe that these non-GAAP financial adjustments are useful to investors because they allow investors to evaluate the effectiveness of the methodology and information used by management in our financial and operational decision-making.
We believe that trends in our non-GAAP earnings per diluted share may be valuable indicators of our operating performance.
In March 2018, we revised our definition of non-GAAP net adjusted EBITDA and non-GAAP earnings per share to exclude the impact of one-time non-recurring expenses, such as certain advisor fees, royalty expenses and restructuring expenses.
This change more accurately reflects managements view of the Companys business and financial performance.
For the three months ended March 31, 2017, the amount includes $0.9 million, or $0.02 per share, of expense associated with the deferred compensation arrangement resulting from the Olapic acquisition and $0.5 million, or $0.02 per share, of expense associated with the deferred compensation arrangement resulting from the Amendment to the Swyft Merger Agreement.

 Item 3.
Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk  

We are exposed to financial market risk, including interest rate risk and foreign currency exchange risk.
Concentration of Revenue and Credit Risk  

Financial instruments that potentially subject us to concentrations of credit risk consist principally of cash and cash equivalents and trade receivables.
Cash equivalents consist primarily of bank deposits and certain investments, such as commercial paper, corporate debt and municipal securities, with maturities less than 90 days.
Deposits of cash held outside the United States totaled approximately $26.1 million and $24.3 million at March 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017, respectively.
We grant credit to customers in the ordinary course of business.
Credit evaluations are performed on an ongoing basis to reduce credit risk, and no collateral is required from our customers.
An allowance for uncollectible accounts is provided for those accounts receivable considered to be uncollectible based upon historical experience and credit evaluation.
As of March 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017, no customers individually accounted for 10% or more of our gross accounts receivable.
Due to the nature of our quarterly revenue streams derived from royalty revenue, it is not unusual for our accounts receivable balances to include a few customers with large balances.
Historically, we have not recorded material losses due to customers nonpayment.
Our Creative Professional business consists of a higher volume of lower dollar value transactions.
Accordingly, as the percent of Creative Professional revenue increases in relation to total revenue, we expect the average time to collect our accounts receivables, and our overall accounts receivables balances, to increase.
For the three months ended March 31, 2018 and 2017, no customer accounted for more than 10% of our revenue.
Interest Rate Risk  

Our exposure to market risk associated with changes in interest rates relates primarily to our long-term debt.
At March 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017, the Company had borrowings under our revolving Credit Facility of $90.0 million and $93.0 million, respectively.
The interest rate on our Credit Facility fluctuates with either the prime rate or the LIBOR interest rate and at March 31, 2018, our rate was 3.6% for LIBOR.
A 10% increase in the rate would have increased our interest expense by $0.9 million.
Table of Contents 

Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Risk  

In accordance with ASC Topic No.
830, Foreign Currency Matters, or ASC 830, all assets and liabilities of our foreign subsidiaries whose functional currency is a currency other than U.S. dollars are translated into U.S. dollars at an exchange rate as of the balance sheet date.
Revenue and expenses of these subsidiaries are translated at the average monthly exchange rates.
The resulting translation adjustments as calculated from the translation of our foreign subsidiaries to U.S. dollars are recorded as a separate component of stockholders equity.
For the three months ended March 31, 2018 and 2017, revenue from customers outside the United States, particularly EMEA and Japan, comprised 56.2% and 55.0%, respectively, of our total revenue.
An effect of a 10% strengthening of the British pound sterling, the Euro Japanese yen and the Argentine peso, relative to the U.S. dollar, would have decreased our revenues by $2.0 million, decreased expenses by $2.4 million and increased operating income by $0.5 million for the three months ended March 31, 2018.
The sensitivity analysis assumes that all currencies move in the same direction at the same time and the ratio of non-U.S. dollar denominated revenue and expenses to U.S. dollar denominated revenue and expenses does not change from current levels.
We incur foreign currency exchange gains and losses related to certain customers that are invoiced in U.S. dollars, but who have the option to make an equivalent payment in their own functional currencies at a specified exchange rate as of a specified date.
In the period from that date until payment in the customers functional currency is received and converted into U.S. dollars, we can incur realized gains and losses.
We also incur foreign currency exchange gains and losses on certain intercompany assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies.
We are currently utilizing 30-day forward contracts to mitigate our exposure on these currency fluctuations.
Any increase or decrease in the fair value of the forward contracts is offset by the change in the value of the hedged assets of our consolidated foreign affiliate.
At March 31, 2018, we had one 30-day forward contract to sell 2.4 million British pound sterling and to purchase $3.4 million that together, had an immaterial fair value, and at December 31, 2017, we had one 30-day forward contract to sell 2.5 million British pound sterling and to purchase $3.4 million that together, had an immaterial fair value.
Item 4.
Controls and Procedures  

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures  

Our management, with the participation of our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of March 31, 2018.
The term disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the Exchange Act, means controls and other procedures of a company that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the SECs rules and forms.
Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to the companys management, including its principal executive and principal financial officers, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.
Management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives, and management necessarily applies its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures.
Our disclosure controls and procedures are designed to provide a reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives.
