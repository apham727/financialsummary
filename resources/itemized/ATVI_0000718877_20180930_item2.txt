Item 2. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 



Business Overview 



Activision Blizzard, Inc. is a leading global developer and publisher of interactive entertainment content and services. We develop and distribute content and services on video game consoles, personal computers (PC), and mobile devices. We also operate esports events and leagues and create film and television content based on our intellectual property. The terms Activision Blizzard, the Company, we, us, and our are used to refer collectively to Activision Blizzard, Inc. and its subsidiaries. 



The Company was originally incorporated in California in 1979 and was reincorporated in Delaware in December 1992. In connection with the 2008 business combination by and among the Company (then known as Activision, Inc.), Vivendi S.A. (Vivendi), and Vivendi Games, Inc., then an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of Vivendi, we were renamed Activision Blizzard, Inc. 



The common stock of Activision Blizzard is traded on The Nasdaq Stock Market under the ticker symbol ATVI. 



Our Segments 



Based on our organizational structure, we conduct our business through three reportable segments, as follows:

Business Results and Highlights 



Financial Results 



The Companys financial results for 2018 are presented in accordance with a new revenue accounting standard that was adopted in the first quarter of 2018. Prior period results have not been restated to reflect this change in accounting standards. Further information about our adoption of the new standard is provided in Notes 2 and 3 of the notes to condensed consolidated financial statements included in Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.

Table of Contents 



· revenues from digital online channels were $1.28 billion, or 84% of consolidated net revenues, as compared to $1.35 billion, or 84% of consolidated net revenues, for the three months ended September 30, 2017; 



· operating margin was 17.5%, as compared to 15.9% for the three months ended September 30, 2017; 



· consolidated net income increased 38% to $260 million, as compared to $188 million for the three months ended September 30, 2017; net income for the 2018 period included $72 million of net tax benefits from discrete tax items primarily related to updates to our accounting for the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (U.S. Tax Reform Act) (see Consolidated Results discussion below for additional details); and 



· diluted earnings per common share increased 36% to $0.34, as compared to $0.25 for the three months ended September 30, 2017. 



During the nine months ended September 30, 2018: 



· consolidated net revenues increased 3% to $5.12 billion, and consolidated operating income increased 19% to $1.29 billion, as compared to consolidated net revenues of $4.97 billion and consolidated operating income of $1.09 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2017; 



· revenues from digital online channels were $4.00 billion, or 78% of consolidated net revenues, as compared to $4.05 billion, or 81% of consolidated net revenues, for the nine months ended September 30, 2017; 



· operating margin was 25.3%, as compared to 21.9% for the nine months ended September 30, 2017;

· diluted earnings per common share increased 35% to $1.51, as compared to $1.12 for the nine months ended September 30, 2017. 



Since certain of our games are hosted online or include significant online functionality that represents a separate performance obligation, we defer the transaction price allocable to the online functionality from the sale of these games and recognize the attributable revenues over the relevant estimated service periods, which are generally less than a year. Net revenues and operating income for the three months ended September 30, 2018, include a net effect of $146 million and $89 million, respectively, from the deferral of net revenues and related cost of revenues. Net revenues and operating income for the nine months ended September 30, 2018, include a net effect of $692 million and $468 million, respectively, from the recognition of deferred net revenues and related cost of revenues. 



Content Release and Event Highlights 



Games and downloadable content that were released during the three months ended September 30, 2018, include: 



· Activisions United Front, the third downloadable content pack for Call of Duty: WWII, on Xbox One and PC;

· Activisions Forsaken, the third expansion to Destiny 2; 



· Blizzards latest expansion to HearthstoneBoomsday; and 



· Blizzards World of Warcraft: Battle for Azeroth, the seventh expansion to World of Warcraft. 



Operating Metrics 



The following operating metrics are key performance indicators that we use to evaluate our business. 



Net Bookings 



We monitor net bookings as a key operating metric in evaluating the performance of our business. Net bookings is defined as the net amount of products and services sold digitally or sold-in physically in the period, and includes license fees, merchandise, and publisher incentives, among others. Net bookings is equal to net revenues excluding the impact from deferrals. 



Net bookings were as follows (amounts in millions): 



  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 



Q3 2018 vs. Q3 2017 



The decrease in net bookings for the three months ended September 30, 2018, as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2017, was primarily due to: 



· lower net bookings from the Destiny franchise, primarily due to lower net bookings from Forsaken, the third expansion to Destiny 2, which was released in September 2018, as compared to the full game release of Destiny 2 in September 2017; 



· lower net bookings from Call of Duty: Infinite WarfareTM (which, when referred to herein, is inclusive of Call of Duty: Modern Warfare® Remastered), which was released in November 2016, in its second year after release, as compared to Call of Duty: Black Ops III, which was released in November 2015, in its second year after release; and 



· lower net bookings from Crash Bandicoot N. Sane Trilogy, which was released in June 2017 on the PlayStation 4 platform, and in June 2018 on the Xbox One, PC, and Nintendo Switch platforms. 



The decrease was partially offset by higher net bookings from World of Warcraft, driven by World of Warcraft: Battle for Azeroth, which was released in August 2018, with no comparable release in 2017. 



YTD Q3 2018 vs. YTD Q3 2017 



The decrease in net bookings for the nine months ended September 30, 2018, as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2017, was primarily due to: 



· lower net bookings from Call of Duty: Infinite Warfare in its second year after release, as compared to Call of Duty: Black Ops III in its second year after release; 



44 



Table of Contents 



· lower net bookings from Overwatch, which was released in May 2016, and Hearthstone; 



· lower net bookings from the Destiny franchise, primarily due to lower net bookings from the Forsaken expansion, as compared to the full-game release of Destiny 2; and 



· lower net bookings due to fewer content releases in 2018 from our Diablo and Bubble Witch franchises as compared to 2017. 



The decrease was partially offset by: 



· higher net bookings from World of Warcraft, driven by World of Warcraft: Battle for Azeroth; 



· higher net bookings from Call of Duty: WWII, which was released in November 2017, as compared to Call of Duty: Infinite Warfare, which was released in November 2016; 



· higher net bookings from the Candy Crush franchise due to increased monetization, primarily through in-game features and events; and 



· net bookings from the Overwatch League, which started its inaugural regular season in January 2018. 



Monthly Active Users 



We monitor monthly active users (MAUs) as a key measure of the overall size of our user base. MAUs are the number of individuals who accessed a particular game in a given month. We calculate average MAUs in a period by adding the total number of MAUs in each of the months in a given period and dividing that total by the number of months in the period. An individual who accesses two of our games would be counted as two users. In addition, due to technical limitations, for Activision and King, an individual who accesses the same game on two platforms or devices in the relevant period would be counted as two users. For Blizzard, an individual who accesses the same game on two platforms or devices in the relevant period would generally be counted as a single user. 



The number of MAUs for a given period can be significantly impacted by the timing of new content releases, since new releases may cause a temporary surge in MAUs. Accordingly, although we believe that overall trending in the number of MAUs can be a meaningful performance metric, period-to-period fluctuations may not be indicative of longer-term trends. The following table details our average MAUs on a sequential quarterly basis for each of our reportable segments (amounts in millions): 



  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 



Average MAUs decreased by 7 million, or 2%, for the three months ended September 30, 2018, as compared to the three months ended June 30, 2018. The sequential decrease in Kings average MAUs is due to minor decreases across franchises from less engaged users leaving the network. 



Average MAUs decreased by 39 million, or 10%, for the three months ended September 30, 2018, as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2017. The year-over-year decrease in Kings average MAUs is due to decreases across Kings franchises from less engaged users leaving the network. King MAUs were also negatively impacted by technical system changes in the prior quarter made by some third-party partners in response to data initiatives, which inadvertently impacted some users ability to play and spend money in King games. The year-over-year decrease in Blizzards average MAUs is due to lower MAUs for Hearthstone and Overwatch.

Managements Overview of Business Trends 



Interactive Entertainment and Mobile Gaming Growth 



Our business participates in the global interactive entertainment industry. Games have become an increasingly popular form of entertainment, and we estimate the total industry grew, on average, 18% from 2014 to 2017. The industry continues to benefit from additional players entering the market as interactive entertainment becomes more commonplace across age groups and as more developing regions gain access to this form of entertainment. 



Further, the wide adoption of smart phones globally and the free-to-play business model on the mobile platform has increased the total addressable market for gaming significantly by introducing gaming to new age groups and new regions and allowing gaming to occur more widely outside the home. Mobile gaming is estimated to be larger than both console and PC gaming and continues to grow at a significant rate. King is a leading developer of mobile and free-to-play games and our other business units have mobile efforts underway that present the opportunity for us to expand the reach of, and drive additional player investment from, our franchises. 



Opportunities to Expand Franchises Outside of Games 



Our fans spend significant time investing in our franchises through purchases of our game content, whether through purchases of full games or downloadable content or via microtransactions. Given the passion our players have for our franchises, we believe there are emerging opportunities to drive additional engagement and investment in our franchises outside of games. These opportunities include esports, film and television, and consumer products. Our efforts to build these adjacent opportunities are still relatively nascent, but we view them as potentially significant sources of future revenues. 



As part of our efforts to take advantage of the esports opportunity, during 2017 we completed the sale of 12 teams for the Overwatch League, the first major global professional esports league with city-based teams, which completed its inaugural season in July 2018. During 2018, we have completed the sale of eight additional teams, which are expected to compete in the leagues second season. 



Concentration of Sales Among the Most Popular Franchises 



The concentration of retail revenues among key titles has continued as a trend in the overall interactive entertainment industry. According to The NPD Group, the top 10 titles accounted for 36% of the retail sales in the U.S. interactive entertainment industry in 2017. Similarly, a significant portion of our revenues has historically been derived from video games based on a few popular franchises and these video games were responsible for a disproportionately high percentage of our profits. For example, the Call of Duty, Candy Crush, World of Warcraft, and Overwatch franchises, collectively, accounted for 66% of our consolidated net revenuesand a significantly higher percentage of our operating incomefor 2017. 



The top titles in the industry are also becoming more consistent as players and revenues concentrate more heavily in established franchises. The top 10 console franchises in 2017 were all established franchises. Similarly, according to U.S. rankings for the Apple App Store and Google Play store per App Annie Intelligence, as of December 2017, the top 10 mobile games have an average tenure of 22 months. 



In addition to investing in, and developing sequels and content for, our top franchises, we are continually exploring additional ways to expand those franchises. Further, while there is no guarantee of success, we invest in new properties in an effort to develop future top franchises. In 2014, we released Hearthstone and Destiny; in 2015, we released Heroes of the Storm; and in 2016, we released Overwatch. Additionally, to diversify our portfolio of key franchises and increase our presence in the mobile market, in 2016 we acquired King. 



Overall, we do expect that a limited number of popular franchises will continue to produce a disproportionately high percentage of our, and the industrys, revenues and profits in the near future. Accordingly, our ability to maintain our top franchises and our ability to successfully compete against our competitors top franchises can significantly impact our performance. 



Recurring Revenue Business Models 



Increased consumer online connectivity has allowed us to offer players new investment opportunities and to shift our business further towards a more consistently recurring and year-round model. Offering downloadable content and microtransactions, in addition to full games, allows our players to access and invest in new content throughout the year. This incremental content not only provides additional high-margin revenues, it can also increase player engagement. Also, mobile games, and free-to-play games more broadly, are generally less seasonal than games developed primarily for the console or PC platforms.

Consolidated Net Revenues 



Q3 2018 vs. Q3 2017 



The decrease in consolidated net revenues for the three months ended September 30, 2018, as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2017, was primarily due to a decrease of $133 million in revenues recognized from Activision, primarily due to lower revenues recognized from Call of Duty: Infinite Warfare, which was released in November 2016, in its second year after release, as compared to Call of Duty: Black Ops III, which was released in November 2015, in its second year after release, and lower revenues from Crash Bandicoot N. Sane Trilogy, which was released in June 2017 on the PlayStation 4 platform, and in June 2018 on the Xbox One, PC, and Nintendo Switch platforms. 



The decrease was partially offset by a $20 million increase in revenues recognized from Blizzard, primarily due to higher revenues recognized from World of Warcraft, driven by World of Warcraft: Battle for Azeroth, which was released in August 2018, with no comparable release in 2017, partially offset by lower revenues recognized from Overwatch, which was released in May 2016. 



YTD Q3 2018 vs. YTD Q3 2017 



The increase in consolidated net revenues for the nine months ended September 30, 2018, as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2017, was primarily due to: 



· an increase of $226 million in revenues recognized from Activision, primarily due to (1) higher revenues recognized from Call of Duty: WWII, which was released in November 2017, as compared to Call of Duty: Infinite Warfare, which was released in November 2016, and (2) higher revenues recognized from the Destiny franchise, driven by Destiny 2, which was released in September 2017, partially offset by lower revenues recognized from Call of Duty: Infinite Warfare in its second year after release, as compared to Call of Duty: Black Ops III in its second year after release; and 



· an increase of $81 million in revenues from King, primarily driven by the Candy Crush franchises increased monetization, primarily through in-game features and events. 



The increase was partially offset by a decrease of $164 million in revenues recognized from Blizzard, primarily due to lower revenues recognized from Overwatch, partially offset by revenues from the Overwatch League, which started its inaugural regular season in January 2018. 



Change in Deferred Revenues Recognized 



Q3 2018 vs. Q3 2017 



The increase in net deferred revenues recognized for the three months ended September 30, 2018, as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2017, was primarily due to an increase of $229 million in net deferred revenues recognized from Activision, primarily due to lower net deferrals of revenues from the Destiny franchise, as a result of lower net deferrals for Forsaken, the third expansion to Destiny 2, which was released in September 2018, as compared to net deferrals for the full game release of Destiny 2 in September 2017. 



48 



Table of Contents 



The increase was partially offset by a decrease of $84 million in net deferred revenues recognized from Blizzard, primarily due to a higher net deferral of revenues for World of Warcraft, driven by World of Warcraft: Battle for Azeroth, which was released in August 2018, with no comparable release in 2017. 



YTD Q3 2018 vs. YTD Q3 2017 



The increase in net deferred revenues recognized for the nine months ended September 30, 2018, as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2017, was primarily due to an increase of $470 million in net deferred revenues recognized from Activision, primarily due to higher net deferred revenues recognized from the Destiny franchise, driven by Destiny 2, and its associated in-game content, with no comparable release in 2016. 



The increase was partially offset by a decrease of $231 million in net deferred revenues from Blizzard, primarily due to a net deferral of revenues for World of Warcraft, driven by World of Warcraft: Battle for Azeroth, which was released in August 2018, with no comparable release in 2017. 



Foreign Exchange Impact 



Changes in foreign exchange rates had a negative impact of $14 million and a positive impact of $146 million on our consolidated net revenues for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2018, respectively, as compared to the same periods in the previous year. The changes are primarily due to changes in the value of the U.S. dollar relative to the euro and the British pound. 



Operating Segment Results 



Currently, we have three reportable segments. Our operating segments are consistent with the manner in which our operations are reviewed and managed by our Chief Executive Officer, who is our chief operating decision maker (CODM). The CODM reviews segment performance exclusive of: the impact of the change in deferred revenues and related cost of revenues with respect to certain of our online-enabled games; share-based compensation expense; amortization of intangible assets as a result of purchase price accounting; fees and other expenses (including legal fees, expenses, and accruals) related to acquisitions, associated integration activities, and financings; certain restructuring costs; and certain other non-cash charges. The CODM does not review any information regarding total assets on an operating segment basis, and accordingly, no disclosure is made with respect thereto. 



Our operating segments are also consistent with our internal organizational structure, the way we assess operating performance and allocate resources, and the availability of separate financial information. We do not aggregate operating segments.

The increase in Blizzards operating income for the three months ended September 30, 2018, as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2017, was primarily due to higher revenues, as discussed above. The increase was partially offset by: 



· higher costs to operate and support Blizzards existing business and adjacent areas of opportunity; and 



· higher software royalties, amortization, and intellectual property licenses and higher sales and marketing costs, both primarily driven by World of Warcraft: Battle for Azeroth, which was released in August 2018, with no comparable release in 2017. 



YTD Q3 2018 vs. YTD Q3 2017 



The decrease in Blizzards operating income for the nine months ended September 30, 2018, as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2017, was primarily due to: 



· higher costs to operate and support Blizzards existing business and adjacent areas of opportunity; and 



· higher software royalties, amortization, and intellectual property licenses, and higher sales and marketing costs, both primarily driven by World of Warcraft: Battle for Azeroth. 



The decrease was partially offset by higher revenues, as discussed above, and higher capitalization of software development costs due to the timing of the game development cycle. 



King 



Q3 2018 vs. Q3 2017 



The decrease in Kings operating income for the three months ended September 30, 2018, as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2017, was primarily due to lower revenues, as discussed above, partially offset by lower digital storefront fees (e.g. fees retained by Apple and Google for our sales on their platforms) due to those lower revenues. 



YTD Q3 2018 vs. YTD Q3 2017 



Kings operating income for the nine months ended September 30, 2018, was comparable to the nine months ended September 30, 2017, primarily due to higher revenues, as discussed above, offset by higher marketing and product development costs for King franchises. 



Foreign Exchange Impact 



Changes in foreign exchange rates had a negative impact of $16 million and a positive impact of $92 million on reportable segment net revenues for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2018, respectively, as compared to the same periods in the previous year. The changes are primarily due to changes in the value of the U.S. dollar relative to the euro and the British pound.

The decrease in product costs for the three months ended September 30, 2018, as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2017, was in-line with the decrease in product sales, partially offset by higher product sales from our lower margin distribution business. 



The decrease in software royalties, amortization, and intellectual property licenses related to product sales for the three months ended September 30, 2018, as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2017, was primarily due to a decrease of $19 million in software amortization and royalties from Activision, driven by the Destiny franchise. 



YTD Q3 2018 vs. YTD Q3 2017 



The decrease in product costs for the nine months ended September 30, 2018, as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2017, was primarily due to a decrease of $11 million in product costs from Activision, primarily related to there being no title releases for the Guitar Hero and Skylanders franchises, largely offset by higher product costs from our lower margin distribution business driven by increased product sales. 



The increase in software royalties, amortization, and intellectual property licenses related to product sales for the nine months ended September 30, 2018, as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2017, was primarily due to an increase of $37 million in software amortization and royalties from Activision, primarily due to the Destiny franchise, driven by the release of Destiny 2, which was released in September 2017, with no comparable release in 2016, partially offset by lower software amortization and royalties from Call of Duty: WWII, which was released in November 2017, as compared to Call of Duty: Infinite Warfare, which was released in November 2016. The increase from Activision was partially offset by a decrease of $22 million in software amortization and royalties from Blizzard, driven by World of Warcraft, due to World of Warcraft: Legion, which was released in August 2016, with no comparable release in 2017.

Q3 2018 vs. Q3 2017 



The increase in game operations and distribution costs for the three months ended September 30, 2018, as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2017, was primarily due to an increase of $20 million in personnel, facilities, and equipment costs associated with our online games and broadcasting operations, partially offset by a decrease of $14 million in digital storefront fees (e.g. fees retained by Apple and Google for our sales on their platforms), primarily associated with the decrease in our mobile game revenues. 



The decrease in software royalties, amortization, and intellectual property licenses related to subscription, licensing, and other revenues for the three months ended September 30, 2018, as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2017, was primarily due to a decrease of $30 million in amortization of internally-developed franchise intangible assets acquired as part of our acquisition of King. 



The decrease was partially offset by: 



· amortization of capitalized film costs associated with the third season of the animated TV series, Skylanders Academy, which was released in September 2018, as compared to the second season, which was released in October 2017; and 



· an $8 million increase in software amortization and royalties from Activision, primarily due to higher software amortization and royalties from expansion releases to Destiny 2, with no comparable releases in 2017.

The decrease was partially offset by a $30 million increase in marketing spending and personnel costs, primarily associated with the Candy Crush franchise, World of Warcraft, and the Overwatch League, the last of which started its inaugural regular season in January 2018, partially offset by (1) reduced marketing costs for the Destiny franchise, due to lower marketing for Forsaken, the third expansion to Destiny 2, which was released in September 2018, as compared to marketing for the full game release of Destiny 2 in September 2017, and (2) reduced marketing costs for the Bubble Witch franchise, as Bubble Witch 3 SagaTM was released during the first quarter of 2017, with no comparable release in 2018.

The decrease in interest and other expense (income), net, for the nine months ended September 30, 2018, as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2017, was primarily due to a $35 million increase in interest income from our cash and cash equivalents and higher interest rates as compared to the prior-year period. 



Income Tax Expense (amounts in millions) 



  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 



The income tax benefit of $48 million for the three months ended September 30, 2018, reflects an effective tax rate of (23)%, which is lower than the effective tax rate of 15% for the three months ended September 30, 2017. The decrease is due to a discrete tax benefit resulting from adjustments made to the provisional amount initially recorded for the U.S. Tax Reform Act described below and the benefit from the lower U.S. corporate income tax rate in the current year. This decrease was partially offset by lower excess tax benefits from share-based payments. 



The income tax expense of $25 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2018, reflects an effective tax rate of 2%, which is lower than the effective tax rate of 11% for the nine months ended September 30, 2017. The decrease is due to a discrete net tax benefit resulting from a closing agreement the Company entered into with the IRS to resolve certain intercompany transfer pricing arrangements for tax periods starting in 2009 (the Closing Agreement), a discrete tax benefit resulting from adjustments made to the provisional amount initially recorded for the U.S. Tax Reform Act and the benefit from the lower U.S. corporate income tax rate in the current year, net of the impact of global intangible low-taxed income of foreign subsidiaries (GILTI). This decrease was partially offset by the valuation allowance recorded with regard to California research and development credit carryforwards (CA R&D Credits) and lower excess tax benefits from share-based payments. 



63 



Table of Contents 



The effective tax rates of (23)% and 2% for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2018, respectively, are lower than the U.S. statutory rate of 21%, primarily due to a discrete net tax benefit resulting from the Closing Agreement, a discrete tax benefit resulting from adjustments made to the provisional amount initially recorded for U.S. Tax Reform Act, foreign earnings taxed at relatively lower statutory rates, the recognition of excess tax benefits from share-based payments, and recognition of federal research and development credits, partially offset by the valuation allowance recorded with regard to CA R&D Credits. 



On June 27, 2018, the Company entered into the Closing Agreement. The primary adjustments related to the Closing Agreement that were recognized in the second quarter of 2018 were a tax expense of $70 million and a reduction in unrecognized tax benefits of $437 million. In addition, we recognized $185 million of tax benefits related to other tax adjustments resulting from the changes in U.S. tax attributes and taxable income caused by the primary adjustments. The Closing Agreement results in federal and state cash tax payments totaling approximately $345 million, of which we made federal tax payments of $334 million in October 2018. 



We evaluate deferred tax assets each period for recoverability. We record a valuation allowance for assets that do not meet the threshold of more likely than not to be realized in the future. To make that determination, the Company evaluates the likelihood of realization based on the weight of all positive and negative evidence available. As of December 31, 2017, the Company had a deferred tax asset for CA R&D Credits, which can be carried forward indefinitely. The Closing Agreement impacts historical and prospective filings in certain states, including California, and after considering the impact of the Closing Agreement on its prospective California taxable income, the Company determined that its remaining CA R&D Credits no longer met the threshold of more likely than not of being realized in the future. Accordingly, during the three months ended June 30, 2018, we recorded a full valuation allowance of $57 million. Additionally, the Company has not recognized a tax benefit for current-year CA R&D Credits in its year-to-date tax expense. We will reassess this determination quarterly and record a tax benefit if future evidence allows for a partial or full release of this valuation allowance. 



On December 22, 2017, the U.S. Tax Reform Act was enacted. The U.S. Tax Reform Act, among other things, reduced the U.S. corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21% beginning in 2018 and implemented a modified territorial tax system that imposed a one-time tax on deemed repatriated earnings of foreign subsidiaries (the Transition Tax). 



On December 22, 2017, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) staff issued Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 118 (SAB 118), which provides guidance on how to account for the effects of the U.S. Tax Reform Act under Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 740. SAB 118 enables companies to record a provisional amount for the effects of the U.S. Tax Reform Act based on a reasonable estimate, subject to adjustment during a measurement period of up to one year, until accounting is complete. During the fourth quarter of 2017, we recorded provisional amounts for the effects of the U.S. Tax Reform Act in accordance with SAB 118. In addition, as of December 31. 2017, we no longer considered the available cash balances related to undistributed earnings held outside of the U.S. by our foreign subsidiaries to be indefinitely reinvested. We continue to analyze the effects of the U.S. Tax Reform Act on our condensed consolidated financial statements. Accounting for the income tax effects of the U.S. Tax Reform Act requires complex new calculations and significant judgments in interpreting the legislation. Additional guidance may be issued on how the provisions of the U.S. Tax Reform Act will be applied or otherwise administered that is different from our interpretation. We may make adjustments to the provisional amounts as we collect and prepare the data necessary to finalize our calculations, interpret the U.S. Tax Reform Act and any additional guidance issued, and consider the effects of any additional actions we may take as a result of the U.S. Tax Reform Act. 



During the three months ended June 30, 2018, the Company obtained additional information, including adjustments related to the Closing Agreement, and the evaluation of the impact of changing our indefinite reinvestment assertion, which affected the provisional amount initially recorded for the U.S. Tax Reform Act in the fourth quarter of 2017. As a result, the Company recorded an additional tax expense of $34 million in the three months ended June 30, 2018, reflecting the effects of the U.S. Tax Reform Act. 



In conjunction with the filing of our 2017 federal tax return, during the three months ended September 30, 2018, the Company prepared and analyzed additional information, which affected the provisional amounts initially recorded for the U.S. Tax Reform Act in the fourth quarter of 2017. As result, the Company recorded a tax benefit of $80 million related to the Transition Tax and remeasurement of deferred taxes in the three months September 30, 2018, reflecting the effects of the U.S. Tax Reform Act.

Table of Contents 



We continue to evaluate the ongoing impacts of the U.S. Tax Reform Act, including provisions impacting certain foreign income, such as a tax on GILTI and a deduction for foreign derived intangible income. These provisions are complex and subject to continuing regulatory interpretation by the IRS. While we have included an estimate of GILTI in our estimated effective tax rate for 2018, we may make adjustments as we interpret the U.S. Tax Reform Act and any additional guidance issued and consider the effects of any additional actions we may take as a result of the U.S. Tax Reform Act. 



Our effective tax rate differs from the statutory U.S. income tax rate due to the effect of state and local income taxes, tax rates that apply to our foreign income (including U.S. tax on foreign income), research and development credits, and certain nondeductible expenses. Our effective tax rate could fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter based on recurring and nonrecurring factors including, but not limited to: variations in the estimated and actual level of pre-tax income or loss by jurisdiction (including changes in the mix of income by tax jurisdiction); changes in enacted tax laws and regulations, and interpretations thereof, including with respect to tax credits and state and local income taxes; developments in tax audits and other matters; recognition of excess tax benefits and tax deficiencies from share-based payments; and certain nondeductible expenses. Changes in judgment from the evaluation of new information resulting in the recognition, derecognition, or remeasurement of a tax position taken in a prior annual period are recognized separately in the quarter of the change. 



Further information about our income taxes is provided in Note 13 of the notes to condensed consolidated financial statements included in Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.

In the near term, we expect our business and financial condition to remain strong and to continue to generate significant operating cash flows, which, we believe, in combination with our existing balance of cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments of $3.4 billion, our access to capital, and the availability of our $1.5 billion revolving credit facility, will be sufficient to finance our operational and financing requirements for the next 12 months. Our primary sources of liquidity, which are available to us to fund cash outflows such as our anticipated dividend payments, share repurchases, and scheduled debt maturities, include our cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments, and cash flows provided by operating activities. 



As of September 30, 2018, the amount of cash and cash equivalents held outside of the U.S. by our foreign subsidiaries was $1.1 billion, as compared to $3.0 billion as of December 31, 2017. Following the enactment of the U.S. Tax Reform Act and the current period expense on unrepatriated earnings, we no longer consider these available cash balances, which primarily relate to undistributed earnings of our most significant foreign subsidiaries, to be indefinitely reinvested. 



Our cash provided from operating activities is somewhat impacted by seasonality. Working capital needs are impacted by weekly sales, which are generally highest in the fourth quarter due to seasonal and holiday-related sales patterns. We consider, on a continuing basis, various transactions to increase shareholder value and enhance our business results, including acquisitions, divestitures, joint ventures, share repurchases, and other structural changes. These transactions may result in future cash proceeds or payments.

Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities 



The primary driver of net cash flows associated with our operating activities is the collection of customer receivables generated from the sale of our products and services. These collections are typically partially offset by: payments to vendors for the manufacturing, distribution, and marketing of our products; payments for customer service support for our consumers; payments to third-party developers and intellectual property holders; payments for interest on our debt; payments for software development; payments for tax liabilities; and payments to our workforce. 



Net cash provided by operating activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2018, was $791 million, as compared to $1.06 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2017. The decrease was primarily due to changes in our working capital resulting from the timing of collections and payments. The decrease was partially offset by higher net income for the nine months ended September 30, 2018, as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2017. 



Net Cash Used in Investing Activities 



The primary drivers of net cash flows associated with investing activities typically include capital expenditures, purchases and sales of investments, changes in restricted cash balances, and cash used for acquisitions. 



Net cash used in investing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2018, was $160 million, as compared to net cash used in investing activities of $163 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2017. The decrease in the cash used in investing activities was primarily due to lower purchases of available-for-sale investments of $59 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2018, as compared to $80 million in the prior-year period, partially offset by higher capital expenditures of $97 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2018, as compared to $86 million in the prior-year period. 



Net Cash (Used in) Provided by Financing Activities 



The primary drivers of net cash flows associated with financing activities typically include the proceeds from, and repayments of, our long-term debt and transactions involving our common stock, including the issuance of shares of common stock to employees upon the exercise of stock options, as well as the payment of dividends.

Net cash used in financing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2018, was $2.0 billion, as compared to net cash used in financing activities of $640 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2017. The change was primarily attributed to our debt financing activities. For the nine months ended September 30, 2018, we had debt repayments, inclusive of premium payments, of $1.8 billion as compared to net debt repayments of $500 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2017. The increase in cash used in financing activities was further impacted by: 



· lower proceeds from stock option exercises of $91 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2018, as compared to $150 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2017; 



· higher tax payments made for net share settlements on restricted stock units of $85 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2018, as compared to $44 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2017; and 



· higher dividends paid of $259 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2018, as compared to $226 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2017. 



Effect of Foreign Exchange Rate Changes 



Changes in foreign exchange rates had a negative impact of $15 million on our cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash for the nine months ended September 30, 2018, as compared to a positive impact of $72 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2017. The change was primarily due to changes in the value of the U.S. dollar relative to the euro and the British pound. 



Debt 



As of September 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017, our total outstanding debt was $2.7 billion and $4.4 billion, respectively, bearing interest at a weighted average rate of 3.18% and 3.58%, respectively. During the nine months ended September 30, 2018, we had the following significant activity associated with our debt instruments: 



· on August 16, 2018, using available cash on hand, we redeemed the 2023 Notes in full at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the 2023 Notes plus a make-whole premium calculated as set forth in the indenture governing the 2023 Notes and accrued and unpaid interest to the redemption date, resulting in a Loss on extinguishment of debt recorded in the condensed consolidated statement of operations of $33 million, comprised of premium payments of $25 million and a write-off of unamortized discount and financing costs of $8 million; 



· on August 24, 2018, using available cash on hand, we made a voluntary prepayment of $990 million to fully repay and extinguish the 2017 TLA resulting in a write-off of unamortized discount and deferred financing costs of $7 million, which is included in Loss on extinguishment of debt in the condensed consolidated statement of operations; and 



· on August 24, 2018, we also entered a Seventh Amendment (the Amendment) to our Credit Agreement for which the Amendment, among other things replaced our prior revolving credit facility of $250 million with a new revolving credit facility with commitments in an aggregate principal amount of $1.5 billion, which is scheduled to mature on August 24, 2023.

Dividends 



On February 1, 2018, our Board of Directors approved a cash dividend of $0.34 per common share. On May 9, 2018, we made an aggregate cash dividend payment of $259 million to shareholders of record at the close of business on March 30, 2018. 



Capital Expenditures 



For the year ending December 31, 2018, we anticipate total capital expenditures of approximately $125 million, primarily for leasehold improvements, computer hardware, and software purchases. During the nine months ended September 30, 2018, capital expenditures were $97 million. 



Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 



At each of September 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017, Activision Blizzard had no significant relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial parties, often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities, established for the purpose of facilitating off-balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes, that have or are reasonably likely to have a material current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures, or capital resources.

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 



Our condensed consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (U.S. GAAP). These accounting principles require us to make certain estimates, judgments, and assumptions. We believe that the estimates, judgments, and assumptions upon which we rely are reasonable based upon information available to us at the time that they are made. These estimates, judgments, and assumptions can affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, as well as the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the periods presented. To the extent there are material differences between these estimates, judgments, or assumptions and actual results, our financial statements will be affected. The accounting policies that reflect our more significant estimates, judgments, and assumptions, and which we believe are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our reported financial results, include the following: 



· Revenue Recognition; 



· Allowances for Returns and Price Protection; 



· Software Development Costs; 



· Income Taxes; 



· Fair Value Estimates (including Business Combinations and Assessment of Impairment of Assets); and 



· Share-Based Payments. 



During the nine months ended September 30, 2018, there were no significant changes to the above critical accounting policies and estimates, with the exception of our adoption of ASC 606: Revenue from Contracts with Customers. Refer to Note 2 of the notes to condensed consolidated financial statements included in Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for disclosures regarding our updated revenue recognition accounting policies and see Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements below for the financial statement impact as a result of our adoption of the new standard. Refer to Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations contained in Part II, Item 7 of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2017, for a more complete discussion of our other critical accounting policies and estimates. 



Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements 



Below are recently issued accounting pronouncements that were most significant to our accounting policy activities. For a detailed discussion of all relevant recently issued accounting pronouncements, see Note 3 of the notes to condensed consolidated financial statements included in Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. 



Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements 



Revenue Recognition 



As discussed in Note 2 of the notes to condensed consolidated financial statements included in Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, in May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued new accounting guidance related to revenue recognition and on January 1, 2018, we adopted the new accounting standard and related amendments (collectively, the new revenue accounting standard), utilizing the modified retrospective method. Additionally, we elected to apply the new revenue accounting standard only to contracts not completed as of the adoption date. For contracts that were modified before the period of adoption, we elected to reflect the aggregate effect of all modifications when (1) identifying the satisfied and unsatisfied performance obligations, (2) determining the transaction price, and (3) allocating the transaction price to the satisfied and unsatisfied performance obligations. We recognized the cumulative effect of initially applying the new revenue accounting standard as an adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings. The comparative information has not been restated and continues to be reported under the accounting standards in effect for those periods. The cumulative effect adjustment recorded to our retained earnings at January 1, 2018 was $88 million. 



The most significant impacts of the new revenue accounting standard for us are: 



· The accounting for our sales of our games with significant online functionality for which we do not have vendor-specific objective evidence (VSOE) for unspecified future updates and ongoing online services provided. Under the prior accounting standards, VSOE for undelivered elements was required. This requirement was eliminated

under the new revenue accounting standard. Accordingly, we are required to recognize as revenue a portion of the sales price upon delivery of this software, as compared to recognizing the entire sales price ratably over an estimated service period, as previously required. This difference in accounting primarily impacts revenues from our Call of Duty franchise, where approximately 20% of the sales price is now recognized as revenue upon delivery of the games to our customers. The amount of revenue recognized upon delivery of games to our customers is analyzed on a title-by-title basis and may change in the future. For example, we expect the entire sales price from our Call of Duty: Black Ops 4 release to be recognized ratably over an estimated service period, as the gameplay has an increased focus towards the online competitive and cooperative game modes with no single-player campaign mode. Many of our other franchises, such as Destiny, Overwatch, World of Warcraft, and Candy Crush, are online hosted arrangements, and the accounting for our sales of these games under the new standard is relatively unchanged; and 



· The accounting for certain of our software licensing arrangements. While the impact of the new revenue accounting standard may differ on a contract-by-contract basis (as the actual revenue recognition treatment required under the standard will depend on contract-specific terms), the new revenue accounting standard generally results in earlier revenue recognition for these arrangements. 



For additional discussion regarding the impact of our adoption of the new revenue accounting standard, including the impacts to our condensed consolidated balance sheet and statement of operations, see Note 3 of the notes to condensed consolidated financial statements included in Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. 



Statement of Cash Flows-Restricted Cash 



In November 2016, the FASB issued new guidance related to the classification of restricted cash in the statement of cash flows. The new standard requires that a statement of cash flows explain any change during the period in total cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash. Therefore, restricted cash will be included with Cash and cash equivalents when reconciling the beginning-of-period and end-of-period total amounts shown on the statement of cash flows. The new standard is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, and should be applied retrospectively. 



We adopted the new standard during the first quarter of 2018 and applied the standard retrospectively for all periods presented. The application of this new standard did not have a material impact on our condensed consolidated statements of cash flows for the nine months ended September 30, 2018 and 2017. 



In our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ending December 31, 2018, there will be a significant impact to the consolidated statements of cash flows for 2016, as this period includes, as an investing activity, the $3.6 billion movement in restricted cash resulting from the transfer of cash into escrow at December 31, 2015 to facilitate the acquisition of King, and the subsequent release of that cash in 2016 to complete the acquisition. Under this new standard, the restricted cash balance will be included in the beginning and ending total cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash balances and, hence, will not be included as an investing activity in the statement of cash flows. 



Derivatives and Hedging 



In August 2017, the FASB issued new guidance related to the accounting for derivatives and hedging. The new guidance expands and refines hedge accounting for both financial and non-financial risk components, aligns the recognition and presentation of the effects of hedging instruments and hedged items in the financial statements, and includes certain targeted improvements to ease the application of current guidance related to the assessment of a hedges effectiveness. The new standard is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018. Early adoption is permitted. We adopted the standard during the first quarter of 2018. The adoption of the standard did not have a material impact to our condensed consolidated financial statements.

Leases 



In February 2016, the FASB issued new guidance related to the accounting for leases. The new standard will replace all current U.S. GAAP guidance on this topic. The new standard, among other things, requires a lessee to classify a lease as either an operating or financing lease, and to recognize a lease liability and a right-of-use asset for its leases. Classification will be based on criteria that are largely similar to those applied in current lease accounting. The lease liability will be equal to the present value of lease payments. The asset will be based on the lease liability, subject to adjustment for initial direct costs, lease incentives received, and any prepaid lease payments. Operating leases will result in a straight-line expense pattern, while finance leases will result in a front-loaded expense pattern. The standard is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2018. Early adoption is permitted. When the new standard was initially issued, it was required to be adopted using a modified retrospective transition that required application of the new guidance at the beginning of the earliest comparative period presented, subject to certain transition practical expedients available to provide relief in connection with the adoption. In July 2018, the FASB issued guidance to provide for an optional adoption method that allows companies to use the effective date of the new lease standard as the initial date of application on transition, and therefore does not require prior periods to be restated. 



Although we continue to evaluate the impact of this new accounting guidance on our financial statements, we expect it to have a significant impact on our consolidated balance sheet as a result of establishing lease liabilities and right-of-use assets for our operating leases. As part of our evaluation process, we have established a project implementation team that is evaluating our lease portfolio and system solutions, as well as identifying required process and policy changes, which include consideration of internal controls. We have made progress in gathering the necessary data elements for our lease population, have selected a system provider, and system configuration and implementation is underway. We do not plan to early adopt this new standard but do expect to elect and apply the available transition practical expedients, including the optional adoption method discussed above.
