Note 1. Basis of Presentation 



Basis of Presentation



The unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements of Juniper Networks, Inc. (the “Company” or “Juniper”) have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“U.S. GAAP”) for interim financial information. Accordingly, they do not include all information and footnotes required by U.S. GAAP for complete financial statements. The Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet as of December 31, 2018 has been derived from the audited Consolidated Financial Statements at that date. In the opinion of management, all adjustments, including normal recurring accruals, considered necessary for a fair presentation have been included. The results of operations for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2019 are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for the year ending December 31, 2019, or any future period. 



The information included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q (“Report”) should be read in conjunction with the “Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,” “Risk Factors,” “Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk,” and the Consolidated Financial Statements and footnotes thereto included in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018 (the "Form 10-K"). 



The preparation of the financial statements and related disclosures in accordance with U.S. GAAP requires the Company to make judgments, assumptions, and estimates that affect the amounts reported in the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements and the accompanying notes. Actual results could differ materially from those estimates under different assumptions or conditions.

Note 2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies 



Except for the change in certain policies upon adoption of the accounting standards described below, there have been no material changes to the Company's significant accounting policies, compared to the accounting policies described in Note 2, Significant Accounting Policies, in Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of Part II of the Form 10-K.



Recently Adopted Accounting Standards



Cloud Computing Arrangement: On January 1, 2019, the Company early adopted FASB ASU No. 2018-15 (Subtopic 350-40) Intangibles — Goodwill and Other-Internal-Use Software: Customer's Accounting for Implementation Costs Incurred in a Cloud Computing Arrangement That Is a Service Contract, which provides guidance on a customer's accounting for implementation, set-up, and other upfront costs incurred in a cloud computing arrangement that is hosted by a service contract. The Company has adopted the standard prospectively, and the adoption did not have a material impact on all applicable implementation costs incurred after the adoption date.



Derivatives and Hedging: On January 1, 2019, the Company adopted FASB ASU No. 2017-12 (Topic 815) Derivatives and Hedging — Targeted Improvements to Accounting for Hedging Activities, and an amendment thereafter, which expands an entity's ability to hedge financial and nonfinancial risk components and amends how companies assess effectiveness as well as changes to the presentation and disclosure requirements. The Company adopted the standard under the modified retrospective approach, and its amendment and presentation and disclosure requirements on a prospective basis. The adoption did not have a material impact on the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. See Note 6, Derivative Instruments for additional disclosures required upon adopting the standard.



Amortization on Purchased Callable Debt Securities: On January 1, 2019, the Company adopted FASB ASU No. 2017-08 Receivables—Nonrefundable Fees and Other Costs (Subtopic 310-20): Premium Amortization on Purchased Callable Debt Securities, which shortens the amortization period for the premium on certain purchased callable debt securities to the earliest call date. The standard will not impact debt securities held at a discount. The Company adopted the standard under the modified retrospective approach. The adoption did not have a material impact on the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements.



Leases: On January 1, 2019, the Company adopted FASB ASU No. 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842), and the related subsequent amendments ("ASC 842"), which require recognition by the lessees of right-of-use ("ROU") assets and lease liabilities for most leases on the Company's Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. The Company adopted the new standard under the modified retrospective approach and recorded a cumulative-effect adjustment to the opening balance of accumulated deficit as of the effective date. Under the modified retrospective method, financial results reported in periods prior to 2019 are unchanged. The Company elected the package of practical expedients, which did not require the reassessment of existing leases under the new guidance. The Company also elected not to separate non-lease components from lease components and to not recognize ROU assets and lease liabilities for short-term leases.

The cumulative effect of the adjustments made to the Company's Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet as of the adoption date is detailed as follows (in millions):



[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]



The adoption of the standard had no impact on the Company's Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations and Condensed Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows or debt-covenant compliance under its current agreements. See Note 15, Commitments and Contingencies, for additional disclosures required upon adopting the standard.



Leases



The Company determines if an arrangement is a lease at inception. The Company evaluates classification of leases at commencement and, as necessary, at modification. As of September 30, 2019, the Company did not have any finance leases. Operating leases are included in operating lease ROU assets, other accrued liabilities, and operating lease liabilities on the Company's Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. ROU assets represent the Company's right to use an underlying asset for the lease term and lease liabilities represent its obligation to make lease payments arising from the lease. 



Operating lease ROU assets and liabilities are recognized on the commencement date based on the present value of lease payments over the lease term. The operating lease ROU asset also includes any lease payments made prior to lease commencement and excludes lease incentives. Variable lease payments not dependent on an index or a rate, are expensed as incurred and are not included within the ROU asset and lease liability calculation. Variable lease payments primarily include reimbursements of costs incurred by lessors for common area maintenance and utilities. The Company's lease terms are the noncancelable period, including any rent-free periods provided by the lessor, and include options to extend or terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain that it will exercise that option. At lease inception, and in subsequent periods as necessary, the Company estimates the lease term based on its assessment of extension and termination options that are reasonably certain to be exercised. Lease costs are recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term.



The Company does not separate non-lease components from lease components for all underlying classes of assets. In addition, the Company does not recognize ROU assets and lease liabilities for short-term leases, which have a lease term of twelve months or less and do not include an option to purchase the underlying asset that the Company is reasonably certain to exercise. Lease cost for short-term leases is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term.

Recent Accounting Standards Not Yet Adopted



Fair Value Measurement: In August 2018, the FASB issued ASU No. 2018-13 (Topic 820) Disclosure Framework — Changes to the Disclosure Requirements for Fair Value Measurement, which eliminates, adds, and modifies certain disclosure requirements for fair value measurements under ASC 820. This ASU is to be applied on a prospective basis for certain modified or new disclosure requirements, and all other amendments in the standard are to be applied on a retrospective basis. The new standard is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2019, with early adoption permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of adoption on the Consolidated Financial Statements.



Simplifying the Test for Goodwill Impairment: In January 2017, the FASB issued ASU No. 2017-04 (Topic 350) Intangibles—Goodwill and Other: Simplifying the Test for Goodwill Impairment, which removes Step 2 of the goodwill impairment test, which requires a hypothetical purchase price allocation. Under the amended guidance, a goodwill impairment charge will now be recognized for the amount by which the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, not to exceed the carrying amount of goodwill. This ASU will be applied on a prospective basis and is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2019, with early adoption permitted for any impairment tests performed after January 1, 2017. The Company does not expect the adoption to have a material impact on the Consolidated Financial Statements.



Credit Losses on Financial Instruments: In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-13 (Topic 326) Financial Instruments—Credit Losses: Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments, which provides more decision-useful information about the expected credit losses on financial instruments and changes the loss impairment methodology. An amendment issued by the FASB in November 2018 clarifies that receivables arising from operating leases are not within the scope of Topic 326 and should be accounted for in accordance with Topic 842. This pronouncement and its amendments are effective for reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2019, and interim periods within those fiscal years, using a modified retrospective adoption method. Early adoption is permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of adoption on the Consolidated Financial Statements.

Note 3. Business Combinations 



On April 1, 2019, the Company acquired 100% ownership of Mist Systems, Inc. (“Mist”) for $359.2 million. The purchase consideration consisted of cash of $354.5 million and $4.7 million in share-based awards attributable to services prior to the acquisition. The acquisition of Mist, a company that provides cloud-managed wireless networks powered by artificial intelligence, is expected to enhance Juniper's enterprise networking portfolio by combining Mist’s next-generation Wireless LAN platform with Juniper's wired LAN, SD-WAN, and security solutions to deliver integrated end-to-end user and IT experiences. 



The following table summarizes the estimated fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the acquisition date (in millions):



[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]



The goodwill recognized in connection with the acquisition is primarily attributable to anticipated synergies from future growth and will not be deductible for income tax purposes.



The following table summarizes the fair value of the separately identifiable intangible assets at the time of acquisition (in millions):

 ________________________________



(*) Estimated useful life of each of the assets is 5 years.



Acquisition-related costs were not material during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2019 and were expensed in the period incurred within general and administrative expense in the Company's Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations.



The Company's Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements include the operating results of this business combination from the date of acquisition. Pro forma results of operations for this acquisition have not been presented, as the financial impact to the Company's consolidated results of operations is not material. The primary areas of the preliminary purchase price allocation that are subject to change relate to certain legal and income tax matters.

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]



[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]



For available-for-sale debt securities that have unrealized losses, the Company assesses impairment by evaluating various factors, including whether (i) it has the intention to sell any of these investments and (ii) whether it is more likely than not that it will be required to sell any of these investments before recovery of the entire amortized cost basis. As of September 30, 2019, the Company had 290 investments in unrealized loss positions. The gross unrealized losses related to these investments were primarily due to changes in market interest rates. The Company anticipates that it will recover the entire amortized cost basis of such available-for-sale debt securities and has determined that no other-than-temporary impairments associated with credit losses were required to be recognized during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2019 and September 30, 2018.



During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2019 and September 30, 2018, there were no material gross realized gains or losses from available-for-sale debt securities.

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]



The Company's Level 2 available-for-sale debt securities are priced using quoted market prices for similar instruments or non-binding market prices that are corroborated by observable market data. The Company uses inputs such as actual trade data, benchmark yields, broker/dealer quotes, or alternative pricing sources with reasonable levels of price transparency which are obtained from quoted market prices, independent pricing vendors, or other sources, to determine the ultimate fair value of these assets. The Company's derivative instruments are classified as Level 2, as they are not actively traded and are valued using pricing models that use observable market inputs. The Company's policy is to recognize asset or liability transfers among Level 1, Level 2, and Level 3 at the beginning of the quarter in which a change in circumstances resulted in a transfer. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2019, the Company had no transfers between levels of the fair value hierarchy of its assets or liabilities measured at fair value.



The Company's privately-held debt and redeemable preferred stock securities are classified as Level 3 assets due to the lack of observable inputs to determine fair value. The Company estimates the fair value of its privately-held debt and redeemable preferred stock securities on a recurring basis using an analysis of the financial condition and near-term prospects of the investee, including recent valuations at the time of financing activities and the investee's capital structure. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2019, there were no significant activities related to privately-held debt and redeemable preferred stock securities. 



Assets and Liabilities Measured at Fair Value on a Nonrecurring Basis



Certain of the Company's assets, including intangible assets and goodwill, are measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis, when they are deemed to be other-than temporarily impaired. There were no impairment charges recognized during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2019.



Equity investments without readily determinable fair value are measured at fair value, when they are deemed to be impaired or when there is an adjustment from observable price changes. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2019, there were no material impairment charges or adjustments resulting from observable price changes for equity investments without readily determinable fair value. 



As of September 30, 2019 and December 31, 2018, the Company had no liabilities required to be measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis.



Assets and Liabilities Not Measured at Fair Value



The carrying amounts of the Company's accounts receivable, accounts payable, and other accrued liabilities approximate fair value due to their short maturities. As of September 30, 2019 and December 31, 2018, the estimated fair value of the Company's total outstanding debt in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets was $1,807.3 million and $2,158.7 million, respectively, based on observable market inputs (Level 2). The carrying value of the promissory note issued to the Company in connection with the previously completed sale of Junos Pulse, along with the accumulated interest paid in kind, of $73.7 million and $69.0 million approximates its fair value as of September 30, 2019 and December 31, 2018, respectively. Notes receivable are generally classified as Level 3 asset due to the lack of observable inputs to determine fair value. The carrying value of a contract manufacturer deposit of $36.9 million, reported within other long-term assets, in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets approximates its fair value as of September 30, 2019. See Note 7, Other Financial Information, for further information on the contract manufacturer deposit.

Note 6. Derivative Instruments 



The Company uses derivative instruments to manage a variety of risks, including risks related to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates on debt instruments. We do not use derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes.



The notional amount of the Company's derivatives is summarized as follows (in millions): 



[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]



Designated Derivatives 



The Company uses foreign currency forward contracts to hedge the Company's planned cost of revenues and operating expenses denominated in foreign currencies. These derivatives are designated as cash flow hedges. Execution of cash flow hedge derivatives typically occurs every month with maturities of eighteen months or less. As of September 30, 2019, an estimated $8.8 million of unrealized net loss within accumulated other comprehensive loss is expected to be reclassified into earnings within the next twelve months.



The Company recognized an unrealized loss of $12.4 million and $11.1 million in accumulated other comprehensive income for the effective portion of its derivative instruments for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2019, respectively; and an unrealized loss of $6.1 million and $8.6 million for the comparable periods in fiscal 2018, respectively. The Company reclassified a loss of $0.8 million and $1.5 million out of accumulated other comprehensive income to cost of revenues and operating expenses in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2019, respectively, and a loss of $3.1 million and a gain of $5.8 million for the comparable periods in fiscal 2018, respectively.



In September 2019, the Company entered into interest rate swaps with an aggregate notional amount of $300.0 million designated as fair value hedges of our fixed-rate 2041 Notes. These swaps convert the fixed interest rates of the notes to floating interest rates based on the London InterBank Offered Rate (LIBOR). Most of the interest rate swaps will expire within ten years or less. The Company recognizes the change in fair value of the derivative instrument, as well as the offsetting change in the fair value of the hedged item, in Other expense, net in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations in the period of change. These derivatives are classified in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows in the same section as the underlying item.



See Note 5, Fair Value Measurements, for the fair values of the Company's derivative instruments in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets.



Non-Designated Derivatives 



The Company also uses foreign currency forward contracts to mitigate variability in gains and losses generated from the remeasurement of certain monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies. These foreign exchange forward contracts typically have maturities of approximately one to four months. The outstanding non-designated derivative instruments are carried at fair value. Changes in the fair value of these derivatives recorded in other expense, net within the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations were not material during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2019 and September 30, 2018.

The Company has a non-interest bearing deposit balance of $36.9 million, net of an unamortized discount balance of $1.9 million, to a contract manufacturer per the terms of the agreement. The discount is calculated based on an imputed interest rate of 5.0% at September 30, 2019. The imputed interest will be amortized over the term of the deposit to interest income along with a corresponding charge to cost of revenues. The deposit is due in the third quarter of 2020 and has been classified as other long-term assets on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets.

Note 8. Restructuring Charges



During the first quarter of 2019, the Company initiated a restructuring plan (the "2019 Restructuring Plan") designed to realign its workforce with the Company's sales strategy, improve productivity, and enhance cost efficiencies. During the second quarter of 2019, the Company amended the 2019 Restructuring Plan and undertook certain further actions that resulted in additional severance, additional facility consolidation, and contract termination costs.



During the three months ended September 30, 2019, the Company recorded $0.3 million and $0.8 million for changes in previous estimates associated with severance and contract termination costs, respectively. During the nine months ended September 30, 2019, the Company recorded $21.8 million of severance costs related to workforce reductions, $2.1 million of facility consolidations, and $11.7 million of contract termination costs, respectively, to restructuring charges in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations.

The following table summarizes the Company's total debt (in millions, except percentages): 



[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]



________________________________



(1) 2024 Notes issued in March 2014 and February 2016 form a single series and are fully fungible.[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]



In August 2019, the Company issued $500.0 million aggregate principal amount of 3.75% senior notes due 2029. The net proceeds from the issuance of the 2029 Notes, together with cash on hand, were used for the repayment of $600.0 million aggregate principal amount of the Company's 3.30% senior notes due 2020 and 4.60% senior notes due 2021. The repayments were made in August and September 2019. The repayments resulted in a loss on extinguishment of debt of $15.3 million, which was recorded under other expense, net within the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations.



The Notes above are the Company’s senior unsecured and unsubordinated obligations, ranking equally in right of payment to all of the Company’s existing and future senior unsecured and unsubordinated indebtedness, and senior in right of payment to any of the Company’s future indebtedness that is expressly subordinated to the Notes.



The Company may redeem the 2025 Notes and the 2029 Notes, either in whole or in part, at any time three months prior to the maturity date of the 2025 Notes, and three months prior to the maturity date of the 2029 Notes, respectively, at a redemption price equal to the greater of (i) 100% of the aggregate principal amount of the 2025 Notes and the 2029 Notes to be redeemed or (ii) the sum of the present values of the remaining scheduled payments discounted at the Treasury rate plus 37.5 basis points for the 2025 Notes, or the Treasury rate plus 35.0 basis points for the 2029 Notes, plus, in the case of each of the clauses (i) and (ii) above, accrued and unpaid interest, if any. At any time on or after March 15, 2025, in the case of the 2025 Notes, and at any time on or after March 15, 2029, in the case of the 2029 Notes, the Company may redeem Notes of such series, in whole or in part, at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the 2025 Notes and the 2029 Notes to be redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any. The Company may redeem the other Notes, either in whole or in part, at any time at a redemption price equal to the greater of (i) 100% of the aggregate principal amount of the Notes to be redeemed or (ii) the sum of the present values of the remaining scheduled payments discounted to the redemption date, plus, in either case, accrued and unpaid interest, if any. 



In the event of a change of control repurchase event, the holders of the Notes may require the Company to repurchase for cash all or part of the Notes at a purchase price equal to 101% of the aggregate principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any.



Interest on the Notes is payable in cash semiannually. The effective interest rates for the Notes include the interest on the Notes, accretion of the discount, and amortization of issuance costs. The indentures that govern the Notes also contain various covenants, including limitations on the Company's ability to incur liens or enter into sale-leaseback transactions over certain dollar thresholds.

As of September 30, 2019, the Company was in compliance with all covenants in the indentures governing the Notes. 



Revolving Credit Facility



In April 2019, the Company entered into a new credit agreement with certain institutional lenders that provides for a five-year $500.0 million unsecured revolving credit facility (the "Revolving Credit Facility"), with an option to increase the Revolving Credit Facility by up to an additional $200.0 million, subject to the lenders' approval. Proceeds of loans made under the Revolving Credit Facility may be used by the Company for working capital and general corporate purposes. The Revolving Credit Facility will terminate in April 2024, subject to two one-year maturity extension options, on the terms and conditions as set forth in the credit agreement. As of September 30, 2019, there were no amounts outstanding under the Revolving Credit Facility.



Borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility will bear interest, at either (i) a floating rate per annum equal to the base rate plus a margin of between 0.00% and 0.375%, depending on the Company's public debt rating or (ii) a per annum rate equal to the reserve adjusted Eurocurrency rate, plus a margin of between 0.910% and 1.375%, depending on the Company's public debt rating. Base rate is defined as the greatest of (A) Citibank's base rate, (B) the federal funds rate plus 0.500% or (C) the ICE Benchmark Administration Settlement Rate applicable to dollars for a period of one month plus 1.00%. The Eurocurrency rate is determined for U.S. dollars and Pounds Sterling as the rate at which deposits in such currency are offered in the London interbank market for the applicable interest period and for Euro as the rate specified for deposits in Euro with a maturity comparable to the applicable interest period.



The Revolving Credit Facility requires the Company to maintain a leverage ratio no greater than 3.0x (provided that if a material acquisition has been consummated, the Company is permitted to maintain a leverage ratio no greater than 3.5x for up to four quarters) and an interest coverage ratio no less than 3.0x during the term of the credit facility. As of September 30, 2019, the Company was in compliance with all covenants in the Credit Agreement.

During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2019, the Company declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.19 per share of common stock on January 29, 2019, April 25, 2019 and July 25, 2019, respectively, which was paid on March 22, 2019, June 24, 2019 and September 25, 2019, respectively, to stockholders of record on March 1, 2019, June 3, 2019 and September 4, 2019, respectively. Any future dividends, and the establishment of record and payment dates, are subject to approval by the Board of Directors (the “Board”) of Juniper or an authorized committee thereof. See Note 16, Subsequent Events, for discussion of the Company's dividend declaration subsequent to September 30, 2019. 



Stock Repurchase Activities 



In January 2018, the Board approved a $2.0 billion share repurchase program ("2018 Stock Repurchase Program"). As part of the 2018 Stock Repurchase Program, in February 2018, the Company entered into an ASR to repurchase $750.0 million of its common stock. The Company made an up-front payment of $750.0 million pursuant to the ASR to repurchase its common stock. The aggregate number of shares ultimately repurchased of 29.3 million shares of common stock was determined based on a volume weighted average repurchase price, less an agreed upon discount, of $25.62 per share.



On April 29, 2019, the Company entered into an ASR, to repurchase an aggregate of approximately $300.0 million of the Company’s outstanding common stock. During the three months ended June 30, 2019, the Company made an up-front payment of $300.0 million pursuant to the ASR and received and retired an initial 8.6 million shares of the Company’s common stock for an aggregate price of $240.0 million, based on the market price of $27.94 per share of the Company’s common stock on the date of the transaction. During the three months ended September 30, 2019, the ASR was completed and an additional 3.0 million shares were received for a total repurchase of 11.6 million shares of the Company's common stock at a volume weighted average repurchase price, less an agreed upon discount, of $25.79 per share. The shares received by the Company were retired, accounted for as a reduction to stockholder’s equity in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets, and treated as a repurchase of common stock for purposes of calculating earnings per share. 



During the three months ended September 30, 2019, the Company also repurchased 2.1 million shares of its common stock in the open market for an aggregate purchase price of $50.0 million at an average price of $23.63 per share, under the 2018 Stock Repurchase Program.



As of September 30, 2019, there was approximately $900.0 million of authorized funds remaining under the 2018 Stock Repurchase Program. The 2018 Stock Repurchase Program does not have a specified termination date. See Note 16, Subsequent Events, for discussion of the Company's stock repurchase activity, increased repurchase authorization and ASR subsequent to September 30, 2019.

Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)



(Unaudited)



Future share repurchases under the 2018 Stock Repurchase Program will be subject to a review of the circumstances at that time and will be made from time to time in private transactions or open market purchases as permitted by securities laws and other legal requirements. The Company's 2018 Stock Repurchase Program may be discontinued at any time.



In addition to repurchases under the 2018 Stock Repurchase Program, the Company also withholds shares of common stock from certain employees in connection with the vesting of stock awards issued to such employees to satisfy applicable tax withholding requirements. Such withheld shares are treated as common stock repurchases in our financial statements as they reduce the number of shares that would have been issued upon vesting. Repurchases associated with tax withholdings were not material during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2019 and September 30, 2018.

Note 13. Income Taxes 



The following table provides details of income taxes (in millions, except percentages):



[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]



The Company’s effective tax rate differs from the statutory rate of 21%, primarily due to the tax impact of state taxes, geographic mix of earnings including foreign-derived intangible income deductions and global intangible low-taxed income, research and development (“R&D") tax credits, tax audit settlements, nondeductible compensation, international realignments, and transfer pricing adjustments.



The Company's effective tax rate during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2019 reflects a benefit of discrete items, including the recognition of $8.3 million in previously unrecognized tax benefits, including interest, due to a lapse in statutes of limitations partially offset by the impact of an international realignment including the write-down of certain deferred tax assets and the inability to fully benefit certain discrete charges recorded in prior quarters. 



The Company’s effective tax rate during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2018 included a $67.6 million in previously unrecognized tax benefits, including interest, due to a lapse in statutes of limitations and a $33.2 million benefit as a result of filing a change in accounting method for the tax recognition of deferred product revenue.



As of September 30, 2019, the total amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits was $174.9 million, of which $171.9 million, if recognized, would affect the effective tax rate.



The Company engages in continuous discussions and negotiations with tax authorities regarding tax matters in various jurisdictions. It is reasonably possible that the balance of unrecognized tax benefits could decrease by up to $32.6 million within the next twelve months due to lapses of applicable statutes of limitations and the completion of tax review cycles in various tax jurisdictions.

Purchase Commitments with Contract Manufacturers and Suppliers 



In order to reduce manufacturing lead times and in the interest of having access to adequate component supply, the Company enters into agreements with contract manufacturers and certain suppliers to procure inventory based on the Company's requirements. A significant portion of the Company's purchase commitments arising from these agreements consists of firm and non-cancelable commitments. These purchase commitments totaled $1,370.5 million as of September 30, 2019. 



The Company establishes a liability in connection with purchase commitments related to quantities in excess of its demand forecasts or obsolete materials charges for components purchased by the contract manufacturers based on the Company’s demand forecast or customer orders. As of September 30, 2019, the Company had accrued $29.7 million based on its estimate of such charges.



Legal Proceedings



Investigations



The Company previously disclosed that it has been the subject of investigations by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") and the U.S. Department of Justice ("DOJ") into possible violations by the Company of the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. In cooperation with these investigations, the Company and the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors, with the assistance of outside counsel and other independent advisors, conducted a thorough internal investigation. As a result of its internal investigation, the Company made significant improvements in its internal controls and carried out a number of disciplinary actions. In the fourth quarter of 2017, the DOJ notified the Company that the DOJ has closed its investigation related to these matters without taking any action against the Company, and in August 2019, the Company, without admitting or denying any fault or wrongdoing, entered into a settlement with the SEC that resolved this government investigation. As part of the settlement with the SEC, the Company made a payment of $11.8 million. The Company had previously accrued approximately $12.0 million with respect to these matters. 



Other Litigations and Investigations



In addition to the investigations discussed above, the Company is involved in other investigations, disputes, litigations, and legal proceedings. The Company records an accrual for loss contingencies for legal proceedings when it believes that an unfavorable outcome is both (a) probable and (b) the amount or range of any possible loss is reasonably estimable. The Company intends to aggressively defend itself in these matters, and while there can be no assurances and the outcome of these matters is currently not determinable, the Company currently believes that none of these existing claims or proceedings are likely to have a material adverse effect on its financial position. Notwithstanding the foregoing, there are many uncertainties associated with any litigation and these matters or other third-party claims against the Company may cause the Company to incur costly litigation and/or substantial settlement charges. In addition, the resolution of any intellectual property litigation may require the Company to make royalty payments, which could adversely affect gross margins in future periods. If any of those events were to occur, the Company's business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows could be adversely affected. The actual liability in any such matters may be materially different from the Company's estimates, if any, which could result in the need to adjust the liability and record additional expenses.
