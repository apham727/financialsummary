 OVERVIEW
 ﻿
 Strategy and Capital Allocation Framework
 ﻿
 In October 2015, Corning announced a strategy and capital allocation framework (the “Framework”) that reflects the Company’s financial and operational strengths, as well as its ongoing commitment to increasing shareholder value.
The Framework outlines our leadership priorities and articulates the opportunities we see across our businesses.
We designed the Framework to create significant value for shareholders by focusing our portfolio and leveraging our financial strength.
Under our Framework, we target generating $26 billion to $30 billion of cash through 2019, returning more than $12.5 billion to shareholders and investing $10 billion to extend our leadership positions and deliver growth.
 ﻿
 Our probability of success increases as we invest in our world-class capabilities.
Corning is concentrating approximately 80% of its research, development and engineering investment and capital spending on a cohesive set of three core technologies, four manufacturing and engineering platforms, and five market-access platforms.
This strategy allows us to quickly apply our talents and repurpose our assets as needed.
 ﻿
 Summary of results for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2018
 ﻿
 Net sales for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2018 were $3.0 billion and $8.3 billion, compared to $2.6 billion and $7.5 billion, respectively, for the same periods in 2017, driven by an increase in net sales in all segments.
The increase in both periods was led by the Optical Communications segment, which increased $200 million and $409 million, respectively, due to higher sales of carrier network products in North America and Europe, an increase in sales of enterprise network products from growth in data centers and sales from 3M’s Communications Market Division which we acquired in June.
Net sales in the Display Technologies segment increased by $57 million and $23 million, respectively, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2018, with volumes exceeding the display glass market’s strong growth and more than offsetting price declines.
The Specialty Materials segment net sales increased by $86 million and $70 million, respectively, resulting from strong demand for Gorilla Glass products in support of new product releases.
Net sales for Environmental Technologies increased $54 million and $155 million, respectively, driven by growth in all product categories.
Life Sciences sales increased by $8 million and $54 million, respectively, driven by higher sales across all product lines.

 ﻿
   ·    An increase of $154 million in translated earnings contract gains;
   ·    Higher segment net income in all our business segments, up $98 million; and
   ·    Lower segment net income in the All Other segment, down $8 million, resulting from continued investment in product development.
 ﻿
 Diluted earnings per share increased by $0.28 per share, or 72%, when compared to the third quarter of 2017, driven by the increase in net income described above, coupled with the repurchase of 76 million shares of common stock over the last twelve months.
 ﻿
 ﻿
   ·    An increase of $120 million in legal expenses, driven by a ruling in an intellectual property lawsuit and developments in civil litigation matters;
   ·    An increase of $53 million in discrete tax and other tax related items, including the preliminary agreement with the Internal Revenue Service to settle an audit in the amount of $172 million, offset by a $48 million benefit related an adjustment of the provisional estimate of the one-time Toll Charge recorded in 2017, and a $28 million benefit from the release of a valuation allowance on deferred tax assets that are now considered realizable;
   ·    A decrease of $46 million in equity earnings, driven by the absence of a $46 million gain recorded in the first quarter of 2017 resulting from the modification of a long-term sales agreement with a customer of HSG;
   ·    Higher net income in the Optical Communications, Environmental Technologies, Specialty Materials and Life Sciences segments, up $57 million, $44 million, $13 million and $17 million, respectively, offset by lower net income in the Display Technologies and All Other segments of $87 million and $38 million, respectively; and
   ·    An increase in the translated earnings contract gains of $174 million.
 ﻿
 Diluted earnings per share decreased by $0.07 per share, or 8%, when compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2017, driven by the decrease in net income described above, coupled with the repurchase of 76 million shares of common stock over the last twelve months.
 ﻿
 The translation impact of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, including the impact of hedges realized in the current quarter, did not materially impact Corning’s consolidated net income in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2018 when compared to the same periods in 2017.
 ﻿
 ﻿
 We believe 2018 will be another year of strong growth and investment, consistent with our Strategy and Capital Allocation Framework, and anticipate that segment net sales will exceed $11.3 billion.
In our Display Technologies segment, we expect pricing to continue to improve, with moderate year-over-year declines during the fourth quarter, an important milestone toward our goal of stabilizing returns.
For the full year, we anticipate Corning’s glass volume will grow faster than the expected display glass market growth of mid-single digits, driven by the ramp of our Gen 10.5 facility in China.
In the Optical Communications segment, we expect sales to increase in the high-teen percentage range, including approximately $200 million from the acquisition of 3M’s Communications Market Division.
We expect organic growth will improve by a low-teen percentage range driven by strong demand from carrier and enterprise network customers.
We expect mid-single digit percentage growth in the Specialty Materials segment, driven by new model launches and the adoption of our innovations.
We expect sales growth in the mid-teen percentage range in our Environmental Technologies segment, driven by continued strength in automotive product sales, on-going improvements in the heavy-duty diesel market and the commercial launch of gas-particulate filters.
We expect mid-to-high single digit percentage growth in the Life Sciences segment.

 Comprehensive Income
 For the three months ended September 30, 2018 comprehensive income increased by $79 million when compared to the same period in 2017, due to an increase in net income of $235 million and higher unrealized gains on designated hedges of $23 million, offset by the negative impact of the change in foreign currency translation gains and losses of $181 million, driven primarily by the Japanese yen and the Korean won.
 ﻿
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2018 comprehensive income decreased by $965 million when compared to the same period in 2017, due to the negative impact of the change in foreign currency translation adjustments of $749 million, driven primarily by the devaluation of the Japanese yen and the Korean won, a $141 million decrease in net income and a decrease of $38 million in unrealized gains on designated hedges.
 ﻿
 Refer to Note 14 (Shareholders’ Equity) to the consolidated financial statements for additional information.
 CORE PERFORMANCE MEASURES
 ﻿
 In managing the Company and assessing our financial performance, we adjust certain measures provided by our consolidated financial statements to exclude specific items to arrive at core performance measures.
These items include gains and losses on our translated earnings contracts, acquisition-related costs, certain discrete tax items, restructuring and restructuring-related charges, certain litigation-related expenses, pension mark-to-market adjustments and other items which do not reflect on-going operating results of the Company or our equity affiliates.
Additionally, Corning has adopted the use of constant currency reporting for our Display Technologies and Specialty Materials segments for the Japanese yen, South Korean won, Chinese yuan and New Taiwan dollar currencies.
The Company believes that the use of constant currency reporting allows investors to understand our results without the volatility of currency fluctuations, and reflects the underlying economics of the translated earnings contracts used to mitigate the impact of changes in currency exchange rates on our earnings and cash flows.
Corning also believes that reporting core performance measures provides investors greater transparency to the information used by our management team to make financial and operational decisions.
 ﻿
 Core performance measures are not prepared in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles in the United States (“GAAP”).
We believe investors should consider these non-GAAP measures in evaluating our results as they are more indicative of our core operating performance and how management evaluates our operational results and trends.
These measures are not, and should not be viewed as a substitute for, GAAP reporting measures.
With respect to the Company’s outlooks for future periods, it is not possible to provide reconciliations for these non-GAAP measures because the Company does not forecast the movement of the Japanese yen, South Korean won, Chinese yuan or New Taiwan dollar against the U.S. dollar, or other items that do not reflect ongoing operations, nor does it forecast items that have not yet occurred or are out of the Company’s control.
As a result, the Company is unable to provide outlook information on a GAAP basis.
 ﻿
 For a reconciliation of non-GAAP performance measures to their most directly comparable GAAP financial measure, please see “Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Measures” below.

 Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Measures
 We utilize certain financial measures and key performance indicators that are not calculated in accordance with GAAP to assess our financial and operating performance.
A non-GAAP financial measure is defined as a numerical measure of a company’s financial performance that (i) excludes amounts, or is subject to adjustments that have the effect of excluding amounts, that are included in the comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP in the statement of income or statement of cash flows, or (ii) includes amounts, or is subject to adjustments that have the effect of including amounts, that are excluded from the comparable measure as calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP in the statement of income or statement of cash flows.
 ﻿
 Core net sales, core equity in earnings of affiliated companies and core earnings are non-GAAP financial measures utilized by our management to analyze financial performance without the impact of items that are driven by general economic conditions and events that do not reflect the underlying fundamentals and trends in the Company’s operations.

In the third quarter of 2018, Corning amended and restated its revolving credit agreement (the “Revolving Credit Agreement”).
The Revolving Credit Agreement provides a $1.5 billion unsecured multi-currency line of credit and expires August 15, 2023.
The Revolving Credit Agreement includes affirmative and negative covenants with which Corning must comply, including a leverage (debt to capital ratio) financial covenant.
The required leverage ratio is a maximum of 60%.
 ﻿
 There were no significant items that impacted Corning’s financing structure in the nine months ended September 30, 2017.
 ﻿
 Share Repurchase Program
 During 2017, Corning repurchased 84.4 million shares for approximately $2.4 billion through accelerated share repurchase agreements and open market repurchases under the 2016 Repurchase Program.
 ﻿
 On April 26, 2018, Corning’s Board of Directors approved a $2 billion share repurchase program with no expiration (the “2018 Repurchase Program”).
During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2018, the Company repurchased 11.8 million and 63.4 million shares of common stock on the open market for approximately $384 million and $1.9 billion, respectively, as part of its 2016 and 2018 Repurchase Programs.

 Refer to Note 14 (Shareholders’ Equity) for additional information.
 ﻿
 Capital Spending
 Capital spending totaled $1.6 billion and $1.2 billion in the nine months ended September 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively.
We expect our 2018 capital expenditures to be slightly more than $2.0 billion, driven by expansions related to the Gen 10.5 glass manufacturing facility, the addition of capacity to support the new gas-particulate filters business in the Environmental Technologies segment and investment to support growth in customer demand in the Optical Communications and Specialty Materials segments.
 ﻿
 Cash Flow
 ﻿
 ﻿
 Net cash provided by operating activities increased by $862 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2018 when compared to the same period last year, primarily driven by customer deposits received of $691 million and the positive impact of changes in working capital of $214 million.

 Net cash used in investing activities increased by $1 billion in the nine months ended September 30, 2018 when compared to the same period last year, driven by the cash outflow of $794 million for the acquisition of 3M’s Communications Market Division, an increase of $382 million in capital expenditures largely due to capacity expansion projects in our Display Technologies, Optical Communications and Environmental Technologies segments and a decrease of $137 million in realized gains on translated earnings contracts.
Cash received of $196 million, which represents the original fair value of the contingent consideration asset related to the acquisition of Samsung Corning Precision Materials (see Note 13), partially offset the net cash used in investing activities.
 ﻿
 Net cash used in financing activities in the nine months ended September 30, 2018 increased by $521 million when compared to the same period last year, driven by an increase in debt repayments of $375 million and decreases of $201 million and $106 million in proceeds received from the exercise of stock options and the issuance of debt, respectively.
A decrease of $184 million in share repurchases partially offset the negative cash impact of these items.

 Management Assessment of Liquidity
 We ended the first three quarters of 2018 with approximately $1.9 billion of cash and cash equivalents.
Our cash and cash equivalents are held in various locations throughout the world, with approximately 72% held outside of the United States, and are generally unrestricted.
We utilize a variety of financing strategies to ensure that our worldwide cash is available in the locations in which it is needed.
In the first three quarters of 2018, the Company distributed approximately $2.2 billion from its foreign subsidiaries to the U.S. parent of those subsidiaries.
There were no incremental taxes beyond the Toll Charge due with the respect to this distribution of cash.
 ﻿
 To manage interest rate exposure, the Company, from time to time, enters into interest rate swap agreements.
We are currently party to two interest rate swaps that are designated as fair value hedges and economically exchange a notional amount of $550 million of previously issued fixed rate long-term debt to floating rate debt.
Under the terms of the swap agreements, we pay the counterparty a floating rate that is indexed to the one-month LIBOR rate.
In addition, the company has entered into $300 million of treasury lock agreements to economically fix the benchmark interest rate associated with future debt issuances.
This hedge is designated as a cash flow hedge.
 ﻿
 Corning also has a commercial paper program pursuant to which we may issue short-term, unsecured commercial paper notes up to a maximum aggregate principal amount outstanding at any one time of $1.5 billion.
Under this program, the Company may issue the paper from time to time and will use the proceeds for general corporate purposes.
The Company’s Revolving Credit Agreement is available to support obligations under the commercial paper program, if needed.
At September 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017 Corning did not have outstanding commercial paper.
 ﻿
 Other
 We complete comprehensive reviews of our significant customers and their creditworthiness by analyzing their financial strength at least annually or more frequently for customers where we have identified a measure of increased risk.
We closely monitor payments and developments which may signal possible customer credit issues.
We currently have not identified any potential material impact on our liquidity resulting from customer credit issues.
 ﻿
 Our major source of funding for 2018 and beyond will be our operating cash flow, our existing balances of cash and cash equivalents and proceeds from any issuances of debt.
We believe we have sufficient liquidity to fund operations, acquisitions, capital expenditures, scheduled debt repayments, dividend payments and share repurchase programs.

﻿
 Our Revolving Credit Agreement includes affirmative and negative covenants with which we must comply, including a leverage (debt to capital ratio) financial covenant.
The required leverage ratio is a maximum of 60%.
At September 30, 2018, our leverage using this measure was approximately 28%.
As of September 30, 2018, we were in compliance with the terms of the Revolving Credit Agreement.
 ﻿
 Our debt instruments contain customary event of default provisions, which allow the lenders the option of accelerating all obligations upon the occurrence of certain events.
In addition, some of our debt instruments contain a cross default provision, whereby an uncured default in excess of a specified amount on one debt obligation of the Company, also would be considered a default under the terms of another debt instrument.
As of September 30, 2018, we were in compliance with all such provisions.
 ﻿
 Management is not aware of any known trends or any known demands, commitments, events or uncertainties that will result in or that are reasonably likely to result in a material decrease in our liquidity.
In addition, other than items discussed, there are no known material trends, favorable or unfavorable, in our capital resources and no expected material changes in the mix and relative cost of such resources.
 ﻿
 Off Balance Sheet Arrangements
 There have been no material changes outside the ordinary course of business in our off balance sheet arrangements as disclosed in our 2017 Form 10-K under the caption “Off Balance Sheet Arrangements.”
 ﻿
 Contractual Obligations
 There have been no material changes outside the ordinary course of business in the contractual obligations disclosed in our 2017 Form 10-K under the caption “Contractual Obligations.”
 ﻿
 CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES
 ﻿
 The preparation of financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect amounts reported therein.
The estimates that require management’s most difficult, subjective or complex judgments are described in our 2017 Form 10-K and remain unchanged through the first nine months of 2018.
For certain items, additional details are provided below.
 ﻿
 Impairment of Assets Held for Use
 We are required to assess the recoverability of the carrying value of long-lived assets when an indicator of impairment has been identified.
We review our long-lived assets in each quarter in which impairment indicators are present.
We must exercise judgment in assessing whether an event of impairment has occurred.
 ﻿
 Manufacturing equipment includes certain components of production equipment that are constructed of precious metals, primarily platinum and rhodium.
These metals are not depreciated because they have very low physical losses and are repeatedly reclaimed and reused in our manufacturing process and have a very long useful life.
Precious metals are reviewed for impairment as part of our assessment of long-lived assets.
This review considers all of the Company’s precious metals that are either in place in the production process; in reclamation, fabrication, or refinement in anticipation of re-use; or awaiting use to support increased capacity.
Precious metals are only acquired to support our manufacturing operations and are not held for trading or other purposes.
 ﻿
 At September 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017, the carrying value of precious metals was higher than the fair market value by $624 million and $711 million, respectively.
These precious metals are utilized by the Display Technologies and Specialty Materials segments.
Corning believes these precious metal assets to be recoverable due to the significant positive cash flow in both segments.
The potential for impairment exists in the future if negative events significantly decrease the cash flow of these segments.
Such events include, but are not limited to, a significant decrease in demand for products or a significant decrease in profitability in our Display Technologies or Specialty Materials segments.

ENVIRONMENT
 ﻿
 Corning has been named by the Environmental Protection Agency (“the Agency”) under the Superfund Act, or by state governments under similar state laws, as a potentially responsible party for 15 active hazardous waste sites.
Under the Superfund Act, all parties who may have contributed any waste to a hazardous waste site, identified by the Agency, are jointly and severally liable for the cost of cleanup unless the Agency agrees otherwise.
It is Corning’s policy to accrue for its estimated liability related to Superfund sites and other environmental liabilities related to property owned by Corning based on expert analysis and continual monitoring by both internal and external consultants.
At September 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017, Corning had accrued approximately $33 million and $38 million, respectively, (undiscounted) for the estimated liability for environmental cleanup and related litigation.
Based upon the information developed to date, management believes that the accrued reserve is a reasonable estimate of the Company’s liability and that the risk of an additional loss in an amount materially higher than that accrued is remote.
