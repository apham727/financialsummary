OVERVIEW
Strategy and Capital Allocation Framework and recently introduced Strategy and Growth Framework
In October 2015, Corning announced a strategy and capital allocation framework (the “Framework”) that reflects the Company’s financial and operational strengths, as well as its ongoing commitment to increasing shareholder value.
The Framework outlined our leadership priorities and articulated the opportunities we saw across our businesses.
We designed the Framework to create significant value for shareholders by focusing our portfolio and leveraging our financial strength.
Under the Framework, we targeted generating $26 billion to $30 billion of cash through 2019, returning more than $12.5 billion to shareholders and investing $10 billion to extend our leadership positions and deliver growth.
As of June 30, 2019, Corning met its goal of returning more than $12.5 billion to shareholders and is on track to invest $11 billion for growth and extended leadership.
On June 14, 2019, Corning introduced its 2020-2023 Strategy and Growth Framework.
From 2020 to 2023, the company plans to invest $10 billion to $12 billion for growth and to return $8 billion to $10 billion to shareholders.

Summary of results for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2019
Net sales in the Display Technologies segment decreased by $59 million, with volume decreases and display glass price declines in the low single-digits;
Optical Communications net sales declined $110 million.
Net sales of carrier products were $105 million lower due to general market weakness and capital spending reductions by several major carriers;
Specialty Materials segment net sales increased by $4 million;
Net sales for Environmental Technologies increased $66 million, primarily driven by sales growth of gasoline particulate filters; and
Life Sciences net sales increased by $25 million, as volume grew faster than the underlying market.
Net sales in the Display Technologies segment increased by $82 million, with volume increases in the high single-digits more than offsetting moderate display glass price declines;
Optical Communications net sales increased $135 million, primarily due to higher sales of enterprise network products, up $152 million, including the impact of sales from the acquisition of CMD, offset by lower carrier sales of $17 million;
Specialty Materials segment net sales increased by $61 million primarily driven by sales of Gorilla Glass and Advanced Optics products;
Net sales for Environmental Technologies increased $155 million, primarily driven by sales growth of gasoline particulate filters and strong demand for heavy-duty diesel products; and
Life Sciences net sales increased by $51 million, as volume grew faster than the underlying market.
Translated earnings contract gains in the current period were $106 million lower than prior year gains;
Higher costs of $116 million, primarily driven by accelerated depreciation in our Display Technologies segment and asset write-offs for our Display Technologies and Optical Communications segments; and
Lower segment net income of $33 million, $41 million and $24 million for the Display Technologies, Optical Communications and Specialty Materials segments, respectively.
The decreases in net income outlined above were slightly offset by higher net income for the Environmental Technologies and Life Sciences segments of $19 million and $11 million, respectively.
Diluted earnings per share decreased by $0.29 per share when compared to the third quarter of 2018, driven by the decrease in net income described above, offset by the repurchase of 34.7 million shares of common stock over the last twelve months.
Translated earnings contract gains in the current period were $75 million higher than prior year gains;
Higher segment net income of $64 million driven by increased sales;
The positive impact of discrete tax and other tax-related items in the amount of $109 million, largely driven by the absence of a $172 million IRS audit settlement, or approximately $40 million tax payable after utilization of tax attributes, recorded in the first quarter of 2018 offset by changes to our tax reserves and a release of foreign valuation allowances on deferred tax assets; and
Costs related to litigation, regulatory and other legal matters were $130 million lower, primarily driven by the absence of a $103 million charge related to legal matters recorded in 2018, including a ruling in an intellectual property lawsuit and developments in civil litigation.

Higher costs of $136 million, primarily driven by accelerated depreciation in our Display Technologies segment and asset write-offs for our Display Technologies and Optical Communications segments; and
Higher translation losses on Japanese yen-denominated debt of $30 million.
Diluted earnings per share increased by $0.21 per share when compared to the same period in 2018, driven by the increase in net income described above, coupled with the repurchase of 34.7 million shares of common stock over the last twelve months.
The translation impact of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, including the impact of hedges realized in the current quarter, did not materially impact Corning’s consolidated net income in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2019 when compared to the same periods in 2018.
In our Display Technologies segment, we now expect full year 2019 price declines to improve further to a low-single digit percentage compared to our previous guidance of low-to-mid single digit declines.
We anticipate Corning’s display glass volume will increase slightly, outperforming the market.
In the Optical Communications segment, we expect sales to decrease three to five percent year-over-year.
We expect growth in the Specialty Materials segment, despite a maturing phone market.
We expect sales growth in our Environmental Technologies and Life Sciences segments in the mid-teens and mid-single-digit percentages, respectively.

Cost of Sales
Gross Margin
In the three and nine months ended September 30, 2019, gross margin decreased by $215 million, or 17%, and $78 million, or 2%, respectively.
Gross margin as a percentage of sales declined by 6% and 2%, respectively.
Negative impacts to gross margin were primarily driven by accelerated depreciation for the Display Technologies segment and asset write-offs in our Display Technologies and Optical Communications segments.
Selling, General and Administrative Expenses
When compared to the third quarter of 2018, selling, general and administrative expenses declined by $70 million, or 16%, in the three months ended September 30, 2019, driven by lower variable compensation expense and reduced operating expenses in Display Technologies and Optical Communications to align with near-term sales projections.
When compared to the first nine months of 2018, selling, general and administrative expenses decreased by $168 million, or 12%, in the nine months ended September 30, 2019.
The decrease was due to the absence of a $132 million charge related to legal matters in 2018, including a ruling in an intellectual property lawsuit and developments in civil litigation matters and a reduction of variable compensation expense of $37 million and reduced operating expenses in Display Technologies and Optical Communications to align with near-term sales projections; partially offset by an increase of $39 million in the Optical Communications segment, driven largely by the acquisition of CMD in June 2018.
Selling, general and administrative expenses declined as a percentage of sales by 2% for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2019.

Research, Development and Engineering Expenses
For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2019, research, development and engineering expenses increased by $11 million, or 5%, and $25 million, or 3%, respectively, when compared to the same periods last year, driven by higher costs associated with new product launches and our emerging businesses.
As a percentage of sales, these expenses were similar when compared to the same periods last year.
Equity in Earnings of Affiliated Companies
In the third quarter ending September 30, 2019, equity in earnings of affiliated companies declined by $9 million primarily driven by lower sales volumes for some of our affiliates.
Equity in earnings of affiliated companies for the nine months ended September 30, 2019 decreased by $21 million, primarily driven by the absence of a gain recorded in the first quarter of 2018 resulting from a legal settlement.

Income Before Income Taxes
The translation impact of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, including the impact of hedges realized in the current quarter, did not materially impact Corning’s consolidated income before income taxes in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2019 when compared to the same periods in 2018.
Provision for Income Taxes
For the three months ended September 30, 2019, the effective income tax rate differed from the U.S. statutory rate of 21% primarily due to an increase in the estimated impact of BEAT offset by the return to provision true-up of the U.S. Federal 2018 tax return filed in October 2019, primarily due to tax reform.
For the nine months ended September 30, 2019, the effective income tax rate differed from the U.S. statutory rate of 21% primarily due to an increase in the estimated impact of BEAT offset by return to provision true-up of the U.S. Federal 2018 tax return filed in October 2019, primarily due to tax reform, additional net tax expense of $86 million driven by changes to our tax reserves and the release of foreign valuation allowances on deferred tax assets.
For the three months ended September 30, 2018, the effective income tax rate differed from the U.S. statutory rate of 21% primarily due to additional tax amounts related to the estimated annual impact of GILTI and BEAT offset by benefits related to FDII and a $48 million benefit related to an adjustment to the provisional estimate of the one-time Toll Charge recorded in 2017.
For the nine months ended September 30, 2018, the effective income tax rate differed from the U.S. statutory rate of 21% primarily due to additional tax expense of $172 million related to a preliminary agreement with the IRS to settle the income tax audits for the years 2013 and 2014, additional tax amounts related to the estimated annual impact of GILTI and BEAT, offset by benefits related to FDII, $28 million from the release of a foreign valuation allowance on deferred tax assets that are now considered realizable and a $48 million benefit related to an adjustment to the provisional estimate of the one-time Toll Charge recorded in 2017.

Net Income Attributable to Corning Incorporated
Comprehensive Income
For the three months ended September 30, 2019 comprehensive income decreased by $444 million when compared to the same period in 2018, due to lower net income of $288 million and $110 million of negative impacts from the change in foreign currency translation losses, driven primarily by the Korean won.
For the nine months ended September 30, 2019 comprehensive income increased by $71 million when compared to the same period in 2018, primarily due to an increase in net income of $154 million offset by $53 million related to the adoption of the new standard for reclassification of stranded tax effects in AOCI.

CORE PERFORMANCE MEASURES
In managing the Company and assessing our financial performance, we adjust certain measures provided by our consolidated financial statements to exclude specific items to report core performance measures.
These items include gains and losses on our translated earnings contracts, acquisition-related costs, certain discrete tax items, restructuring and restructuring-related charges, certain litigation-related expenses, pension mark-to-market adjustments and other items which do not reflect on-going operating results of the Company or our equity affiliates.
Corning utilizes constant-currency reporting for our Display Technologies and Specialty Materials segments for the Japanese yen, South Korean won, Chinese yuan and new Taiwan dollar currencies.
Effective January 1, 2019, Corning also began using constant-currency reporting for our Environmental Technologies and Life Sciences segments for the euro, Japanese yen and Chinese yuan.
The Company believes that the use of constant-currency reporting allows investors to understand our results without the volatility of currency fluctuations, and reflects the underlying economics of the translated earnings contracts used to mitigate the impact of changes in currency exchange rates on our earnings and cash flows.
Corning also believes that reporting core performance measures provides investors greater transparency to the information used by our management team to make financial and operational decisions.
Core performance measures are not prepared in accordance with GAAP.
We believe investors should consider these non-GAAP measures in evaluating our results as they are more indicative of our core operating performance and how management evaluates our operational results and trends.
These measures are not, and should not be viewed as a substitute for GAAP reporting measures.
With respect to the Company’s outlooks for future periods, it is not possible to provide reconciliations for these non-GAAP measures because the Company does not forecast foreign currency exchange rates or other items that do not reflect ongoing operations, nor does it forecast items that have not yet occurred or are out of the Company’s control.
As a result, the Company is unable to provide outlook information on a GAAP basis.
Effective July 1, 2019, we have replaced the term “Core Earnings” with “Core Net Income”.
The terms are interchangeable and the underlying calculations remain the same.
For a reconciliation of non-GAAP performance measures to their most directly comparable GAAP financial measure, please see “Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Measures”.

Core Equity in Earnings of Affiliated Companies
Core Net Income
For the three months ended September 30, 2019, we generated core net income of $397 million, or $0.44 per share, compared to core net income generated in the three months ended September 30, 2018 of $476 million, or $0.51 per share.
The decrease of $79 million was due to lower net income across the Display Technologies, Optical Communications and Specialty Materials segments, partially offset by higher net income for the Environmental Technologies and Life Sciences segments.
For the nine months ended September 30, 2019, we generated core net income of $1,172 million, or $1.30 per share, compared to core net income generated in the nine months ended September 30, 2018 of $1,134 million, or $1.20 per share.
The increase of $38 million was due to increased core net income across most reportable segments.
Included in core net income for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2019 and 2018 is net periodic pension expense in the amounts of $22 million and $64 million, respectively, and $13 million and $38 million respectively.
Refer to Note 9 (Employee Retirement Plans) to the consolidated financial statements.
Core Earnings per Common Share
Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Measures
We utilize certain financial measures and key performance indicators that are not calculated in accordance with GAAP to assess our financial and operating performance.
A non-GAAP financial measure is defined as a numerical measure of a company’s financial performance that (i) excludes amounts, or is subject to adjustments that have the effect of excluding amounts, that are included in the comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP in the statement of income or statement of cash flows, or (ii) includes amounts, or is subject to adjustments that have the effect of including amounts, that are excluded from the comparable measure as calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP in the statement of income or statement of cash flows.
Core net sales, core equity in earnings of affiliated companies and core net income are non-GAAP financial measures utilized by our management to analyze financial performance without the impact of items that are driven by general economic conditions and events that do not reflect the underlying fundamentals and trends in the Company’s operations.

We included the earnings of equity affiliates that are closely associated with our reportable segments in the respective segment’s net income.
We have allocated certain common expenses among reportable segments differently than we would for stand-alone financial information.
Segment net income may not be consistent with measures used by other companies.
Display Technologies
Net sales in the Display Technologies segment decreased by $59 million in the three months ended September 30, 2019, driven by volume decreases and display glass price declines in the low single-digits.
Net sales in the Display Technologies segment increased by $82 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2019, with the increase in glass volume in the high-single digits in percentage terms more than offsetting moderate price declines.
Net income in the Display Technologies segment decreased by $33 million and increased by $11 million in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2019, respectively, driven by the changes in sales outlined above.
For the fourth quarter of 2019, we expect our volume to be down mid-single digits sequentially.
Fourth-quarter display glass prices are expected to decline slightly from the third quarter.
We expect full-year pricing to be down low-single digits year-over-year.

Specialty Materials
Net sales in the Specialty Materials segment increased by $4 million, or 1%, and $61 million, or 6%, respectively, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2019.
Increased sales of Gorilla Glass and Advanced Optics products drove the increase for the first half of 2019.
However, third quarter shipments of Gorilla Glass in China were lower due to the current trade environment and sales of Advanced Optics products were down due to semiconductor market weakness.
Net income decreased by $24 million, or 21%, and $18 million, or 8% for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2019, impacted by the sales drivers outlined above.
The company expects full-year sales growth, despite a maturing smartphone market.

Cash Flow
Net cash provided by operating activities decreased by $965 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2019, when compared to the same period in the prior year.
The change was primarily driven by fewer customer deposits and incentives received of $689 million, and a larger increase in working capital as compared to the same period in 2018.
Net cash used in investing activities decreased by $732 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2019 when compared to the same period last year, primarily driven by last year’s acquisition of substantially all of CMD for approximately $800 million.

and developments which may signal possible customer credit issues.
We currently have not identified any potential material impact on our liquidity resulting from customer credit issues.
Our major sources of funding for 2019 and beyond will be our operating cash flow and proceeds from any issuances of debt.
We believe we have sufficient liquidity to fund operations, acquisitions, capital expenditures, scheduled debt repayments, dividend payments and share repurchase programs.
Our Revolving Credit Agreement includes affirmative and negative covenants with which we must comply, including a leverage (debt to capital ratio) financial covenant.
The required leverage ratio is a maximum of 60%.
At September 30, 2019, our leverage using this measure was approximately 33%.
As of September 30, 2019, we were in compliance and no amounts were outstanding.
Our debt instruments contain customary event of default provisions, which allow the lenders the option of accelerating all obligations upon the occurrence of certain events.
In addition, some of our debt instruments contain a cross default provision, whereby an uncured default of a specified amount on one debt obligation of the Company, also would be considered a default under the terms of another debt instrument.
As of September 30, 2019, we were in compliance with all such provisions.
Management is not aware of any known trends or any known demands, commitments, events or uncertainties that will result in or that are reasonably likely to result in a material decrease in our liquidity.
In addition, other than items discussed, there are no known material trends, favorable or unfavorable, in our capital resources and no expected material changes in the mix and relative cost of such resources.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES
The preparation of financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect amounts reported therein.
The estimates that require management’s most difficult, subjective or complex judgments are described in our 2018 Form 10-K and remain unchanged through the first nine months of 2019.
For certain items, additional details are provided below.
Impairment of Assets Held for Use
We are required to assess the recoverability of the carrying value of long-lived assets when an indicator of impairment has been identified.
We review our long-lived assets in each quarter in which impairment indicators are present.
We must exercise judgment in assessing whether an event of impairment has occurred.
Manufacturing equipment includes certain components of production equipment that are constructed of precious metals, primarily platinum and rhodium.
These metals are not depreciated because they have very low physical losses and are repeatedly reclaimed and reused in our manufacturing process and have a very long useful life.
Precious metals are reviewed for impairment as part of our assessment of long-lived assets.
This review considers all the Company’s precious metals that are either in place in the production process; in reclamation, fabrication, or refinement in anticipation of re-use; or awaiting use to support increased capacity.
Precious metals are only acquired to support our manufacturing operations and are not held for trading or other purposes.
At September 30, 2019 and December 31, 2018, the carrying value of precious metals was lower than the fair market value by $578 million and higher than the fair market value by $719 million, respectively.
These precious metals are utilized by the Display Technologies and Specialty Materials segments.
Corning believes these precious metal assets to be recoverable due to the significant positive cash flow in both segments.
The potential for impairment exists in the future if negative events significantly decrease the cash flow of these segments.
Such events include, but are not limited to, a significant decrease in demand for products or a significant decrease in profitability in our Display Technologies or Specialty Materials segments.
NEW ACCOUNTING STANDARDS
Refer to Note 1 (Significant Accounting Policies) to the consolidated financial statements.
ENVIRONMENT
Corning has been named by the Environmental Protection Agency (“the Agency”) under the Superfund Act, or by state governments under similar state laws, as a potentially responsible party for 15 active hazardous waste sites.
Under the Superfund Act, all parties who may have contributed any waste to a hazardous waste site, identified by the Agency, are jointly and severally liable for the cost of cleanup unless the Agency agrees otherwise.
It is Corning’s policy to accrue for its estimated liability related to Superfund sites and other environmental liabilities related to property owned by Corning based on expert analysis and continual monitoring by both internal and external consultants.
At September 30, 2019 and December 31, 2018, Corning had accrued approximately $39 million and $30 million, respectively, for the undiscounted estimated liability for environmental cleanup and related litigation.
Based upon the information developed to date, management believes that the accrued reserve is a reasonable estimate of the Company’s liability and that the risk of an additional loss in an amount materially higher than that accrued is remote.
FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS
The statements in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, in reports subsequently filed by Corning with the SEC on Forms 8-K, and related comments by management that are not historical facts or information and contain words such as “will,” “believe,” “anticipate,” “expect,” “intend,” “plan,” “seek,” “see,” “would,” and “target” and similar expressions are forward-looking statements.
Such statements relate to future events that by their nature address matters that are, to different degrees, uncertain.
These forward-looking statements relate to, among other things, the company’s future operating performance, the company's share of new and existing markets, the company's revenue and earnings growth rates, the company’s ability to innovate and commercialize new products, and the company’s implementation of cost-reduction initiatives and measures to improve pricing, including the optimization of the company’s manufacturing capacity.
