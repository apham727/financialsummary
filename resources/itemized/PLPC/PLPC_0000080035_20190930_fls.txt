FORWARD LOOKING STATEMENTS 

Cautionary Statement for “Safe Harbor” Purposes Under The Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 

This Form 10-Q and other documents we file with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) contain forward-looking statements regarding the Company’s and management’s beliefs and expectations.
As a general matter, forward-looking statements are those focused upon future plans, objectives or performance (as opposed to historical items) and include statements of anticipated events or trends and expectations and beliefs relating to matters not historical in nature.
Such forward-looking statements are subject to uncertainties and factors relating to the Company’s operations and business environment, all of which are difficult to predict and many of which are beyond the Company’s control.
Such uncertainties and factors could cause the Company’s actual results to differ materially from those matters expressed in or implied by such forward-looking statements.
The following factors, among others, could affect the Company’s future performance and cause the Company’s actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied by forward-looking statements made in this report: 

•  

The overall demand for cable anchoring and control hardware for electrical transmission and distribution lines on a worldwide basis, which has a slow growth rate in mature markets such as the U.S., Canada, Australia and Western Europe and may grow slowly or experience prolonged delay in developing regions despite expanding power needs; 

•  

The potential impact of the global economic condition on the Company’s ongoing profitability and future growth opportunities in the Company’s core markets in the U.S. and other foreign countries where the financial situation is expected to be similar going forward; 

•  

The ability of the Company’s customers to raise funds needed to build the facilities their customers require; 

•  

Technological developments that affect longer-term trends for communication lines, such as wireless communication; 

•  

The decreasing demand for product supporting copper-based infrastructure due to the introduction of products using new technologies or adoption of new industry standards; 

•  

The Company’s success at continuing to develop proprietary technology and maintaining high quality products and customer service to meet or exceed new industry performance standards and individual customer expectations; 

•  

The Company’s success in strengthening and retaining relationships with the Company’s customers, growing sales at targeted accounts and expanding geographically; 

•  

The extent to which the Company is successful at expanding the Company’s product line or production facilities into new areas or implementing efficiency measures at existing facilities; 

•  

The effects of fluctuation in currency exchange rates upon the Company’s foreign subsidiaries’ operations and reported results from international operations, together with non-currency risks of investing in and conducting significant operations in foreign countries, including those relating to political, social, economic and regulatory factors; 

•  

The Company’s ability to identify, complete, obtain funding for and integrate acquisitions for profitable growth; 

•  

The potential impact of consolidation, deregulation and bankruptcy among the Company’s suppliers, competitors and customers and of any legal or regulatory claims; 


•  

The relative degree of competitive and customer price pressure on the Company’s products; 

•  

The cost, availability and quality of raw materials required for the manufacture of products and any tariffs that may be associated with the purchase of these products; 

•  

Strikes, labor disruptions and other fluctuations in labor costs; 

•  

Changes in significant government regulations affecting environmental compliances or other litigation matters; 

•  

The telecommunication market’s continued deployment of Fiber-to-the-Premises; and 

•  

Those factors described under the heading “Risk Factors” on page 12 of the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018 filed on March 8, 2019.
QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 

The Company operates manufacturing facilities and offices around the world and uses fixed and floating rate debt to finance the Company’s global operations.
As a result, the Company is subject to business risks inherent in non-U.S. activities, including political and economic uncertainty, import and export limitations and market risk related to changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates.
The Company believes that the political and economic risks related to the Company’s international operations are mitigated due to the geographic diversity in which the Company’s international operations are located.
