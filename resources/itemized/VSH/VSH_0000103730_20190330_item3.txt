Except as described below, there have been no material developments to the legal proceedings previously disclosed.
As previously reported, the Korean Ministry of Justice conducted a review of the conduct of Vishay Polytech Co., Ltd., a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company (“VPC”), at the request of the Korean Fair Trade Commission.
At the conclusion of that review, the Seoul Central District Prosecutors’ Office issued a summary indictment of VPC, along with other respondents, for alleged violations of applicable antitrust laws.
On March 4, 2019, the Seoul Central District Court issued a summary order finding that VPC had violated South Korea’s Monopoly Regulation and Fair Trade Law and imposed a penalty of approximately $44,000 against VPC.
VPC waived its opportunity for a trial.
The conduct attributable to VPC occurred prior to the acquisition of that entity from Holy Stone Enterprises Co. Ltd. (“Holy Stone”) in 2014.
Holy Stone has agreed to indemnify VPC for losses, including the penalty and expenses associated with the decision described above.
