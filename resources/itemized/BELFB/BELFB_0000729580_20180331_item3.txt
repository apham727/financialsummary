Item 3.
Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 

The Company is exposed to market risk primarily from changes in foreign currency exchange rates and changes in interest rates associated with its long-term debt.
During the first quarter of 2018, the U.S. Dollar continued to weaken against most other currencies in which the Company pays its expenses.
In comparing average exchange rates during the first quarter of 2018 versus those during the first quarter of 2017, the Euro appreciated by 13%, the Pound appreciated by 11%, the Peso increased by 8% and the Renminbi appreciated by 8% against the U.S. Dollar.
The Company estimates that the appreciation in these foreign currencies led to $1.8 million in higher operating costs, as the majority of our expenses in the PRC, Europe and Mexico are paid in local currency.
This is in addition to the foreign exchange loss recognized in the first quarter of 2018 of $1.0 million on translation of local currency balance sheet accounts to the U.S. Dollar in consolidation, resulting from foreign currency fluctuations since December 31, 2017.
Refer to Item 7A, "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations," in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2017 for further discussion of market risks.
