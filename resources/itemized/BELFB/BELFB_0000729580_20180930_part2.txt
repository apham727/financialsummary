Item 2.
Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds
Pursuant to the Bel Fuse Inc. Employees' Savings Plan (the "Employees' Savings Plan"), the Company makes matching contributions of pre-tax elective deferral contributions made by associates.
The Employees' Savings Plan provides for matching contributions to be invested in shares of the Company's Class A Common Stock.
The trustees of the Employees' Savings Plan adopted a "10b5-1 Plan," in accordance with guidelines specified by Rule 10b5-1 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, to make open market purchases of shares of Class A Common Stock with such matching contributions.
The purchases in the table above were made under the 10b5-1 Plan.
The maximum dollar amount for cumulative purchases under the 10b5-1 Plan during the plan period (August 20, 2018 to November 30, 2018) will not exceed $650,000.
Item 5.
Other Information
As previously disclosed, on August 16, 2018, the trustees of the Employees' Savings Plan adopted a plan (the "10b5-1 Plan") in accordance with guidelines specified by Rule 10b5-1 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, pursuant to which KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc. was engaged to purchase shares of the Class A common stock of Bel Fuse Inc. ("Bel") to implement the Employees' Savings Plan's requirements that matching contributions be invested in shares of Bel's Class A common stock.
While it was originally expected that purchases under the 10b5-1 Plan would be completed by November 30, 2018, as a sufficient number of shares of Class A common stock have been purchased already to meet the requirements of the "match" for 2018, the 10b5-1 Plan was terminated effective November 7, 2018.
