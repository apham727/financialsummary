Item 3.
Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk
The Company is exposed to market risk primarily from changes in foreign currency exchange rates and changes in interest rates associated with its long-term debt.
During the first nine months of 2019, the U.S. Dollar was stronger against most other currencies in which the Company pays its expenses.
In comparing average exchange rates during the first nine months of 2019 versus those during the same period of 2018, the Euro depreciated by 6%, the Pound depreciated by 6%, the Peso depreciated by 1% and the Renminbi depreciated by 5% against the U.S. Dollar.
The Company estimates that the depreciation in these foreign currencies led to lower operating costs of $3.9 million, as the majority of our expenses in the PRC, Europe and Mexico are paid in local currency.
Foreign exchange gains were also recognized in the first nine months of 2019 of $0.5 million on translation of local currency balance sheet accounts to the U.S. Dollar in consolidation, resulting from foreign currency fluctuations since December 31, 2018.
Refer to Item 7A, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,” in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018 for further discussion of market risks.
