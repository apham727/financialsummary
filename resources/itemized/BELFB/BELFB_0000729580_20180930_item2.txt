  Overview
Our Company
We design, manufacture and market a broad array of products that power, protect and connect electronic circuits.
These products are primarily used in the networking, telecommunications, computing, military, aerospace, transportation and broadcasting industries.
Bel's portfolio of products also finds application in the automotive, medical and consumer electronics markets.
Our operating expenses are driven principally by the cost of labor where the factories that Bel uses are located, the cost of the materials that we use and our ability to effectively and efficiently manage overhead costs.
As labor and material costs vary by product line and region, any significant shift in product mix can have an associated impact on our costs of sales.
Costs are recorded as incurred for all products manufactured.
Such amounts are determined based upon the estimated stage of production and include labor cost and fringes and related allocations of factory overhead.
Our products are manufactured at various facilities in the U.S., Mexico, Dominican Republic, England, Czech Republic, Slovakia and the PRC.
We have little visibility into the ordering habits of our customers and we can be subjected to large and unpredictable variations in demand for our products.
Accordingly, we must continually recruit and train new workers to replace those lost to attrition and be able to address peaks in demand that may occur from time to time.
These recruiting and training efforts and related inefficiencies, and overtime required in order to meet any increase in demand, can add volatility to the labor costs incurred by us.
Key Factors Affecting our Business
  ·   Revenues – The Company's revenues increased by $33.8 million, or 9.1%, in the first nine months of 2018 as compared to the same period of 2017, despite a $5.1 million decline in sales related to the NPS divestiture.
Sales growth was seen across all of our major product groups as certain project wins from 2017 are in full production and we continue to see strength in sales through our distribution partners.
  ·   Backlog – Our backlog reached $185.1 million at September 30, 2018, representing an increase of $38.6 million, or 26%, from December 31, 2017.
Since year-end, we saw a 65% increase at Magnetic Solutions, driven by a strong position with our integrated connector modules in next-generation switching products.
The backlog for our Connectivity Solutions products increased by 21%, driven by recent awards on key military programs, and heightened structured cabling demand for our passive connectors.
Our Power Solutions and Protection backlog grew by 9%, led by higher demand for our power supplies for a variety of datacenter applications.
  ·   Product Mix – Material and labor costs vary by product line and any significant shift in product mix between higher- and lower-margin product lines will have a corresponding impact on the Company's gross margin percentage.
In general, our connectivity products have the highest contribution margins, our magnetic products are more labor intensive and are therefore less profitable than the connectivity products and our power products are on the lower end of our profit margin range, due to their high material content.
Fluctuations in sales volume among our product groups will have a corresponding impact on Bel's profit margins.
Return to Index
  ·   Pricing and Availability of Materials – There have been recent supply constraints related to components that constitute raw materials in our manufacturing processes, particularly with resistors, capacitors, mosfets and printed circuit boards.
Lead times have been extended and the reduction in supply has also caused an increase in prices for certain of these components.
As a result, the Company's material costs as a percentage of sales increased to 42.0% during the first nine months of 2018 from 39.7% during the first nine months of 2017.
  ·   Labor Costs – Labor costs during the first nine months of 2018 increased from 10.4% of sales during the first nine months of 2017 to 11.5% of sales during the first nine months of 2018, primarily due to the appreciation of the Renminbi against the U.S. Dollar, particularly during the first half of 2018, minimum wage increases in the PRC, and growth in sales of our labor-intensive integrated connector module (ICM) products.
Effective February 1, 2018, the PRC government issued an increase to the minimum wage in a region where one of Bel's factories is located.
Effective July 1, 2018, government-mandated minimum wage increases went into effect at Bel's other three manufacturing facilities in the PRC.
  ·   Impact of Foreign Currency – During the first nine months of 2018, the Company incurred foreign exchange transactional gains of $2.4 million and higher labor and overhead costs of $2.5 million related to unfavorable fluctuation in exchange rates versus the first nine months of 2017.
Since we are a U.S. domiciled company, we translate our foreign currency-denominated financial results into U.S. dollars.
Due to the changes in the value of foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar, translating our financial results and the revaluation of certain intercompany as well as third-party transactions to and from foreign currencies to U.S. dollars may result in a favorable or unfavorable impact to our consolidated statements of operations and cash flows.
The Company was unfavorably impacted by transactional foreign exchange losses during the first nine months of 2018 due to the appreciation of the Euro, Pound, and Renminbi against the U.S. dollar as compared to exchange rates in effect during the first nine months of 2017.
The Company has significant manufacturing operations located in the PRC where labor and overhead costs are paid in local currency.
As a result, the U.S. Dollar equivalent costs of these operations were $2.5 million higher in the first nine months of 2018.
The Company monitors changes in foreign currencies and may implement pricing actions to help mitigate the impact that changes in foreign currencies may have on its consolidated operating results.
  ·   Effective Tax Rate – The Company's effective tax rate will fluctuate based on the geographic segment in which our pretax profits are earned.
Of the geographic segments in which we operate, the U.S. and Europe's tax rates are generally equivalent; and Asia has the lowest tax rates of the Company's three geographical segments.
See Note 9, "Income Taxes".
Our third quarter 2018 bookings reached its highest quarterly amount in the last four years, representing a 28% increase from the third quarter of last year.
This growth in orders received was seen across all of our major product groups, and is an encouraging data point for our top line as we look to 2019.
On the cost side, higher labor and material costs have had a more visible impact on our margins this quarter as the cost of finished goods that were sold during the quarter were impacted by both higher raw material costs and increased minimum wage rates associated with production labor in the PRC.
Sales growth and price stabilization will help to mitigate these margin pressures.
We continue to evaluate opportunities to grow our business through acquisitions that would provide access to new markets and customers while being accretive to the overall business.
Summary by Operating Segment
The growth in North America sales in 2018 was largely due to increased demand for our passive connector products from our premise wiring customers, strength in our connectivity products within key military programs, and higher sales of our transformer products into medical applications.
Sales of our Power Solutions products have also increased in 2018 with heightened demand for our power supplies for use in various datacenter applications.
The increases in Asia sales noted above for the 2018 periods primarily relate to higher sales of our integrated connector modules for next-generation switching platforms.
Sales in Europe increased in both 2018 periods presented as a result of higher demand for our Stewart and Cinch connector products in that region, coupled with strong sales of our power products into rail applications.
There was also a favorable impact on our European sales in general during the nine-month period ended September 30, 2018 as a portion of those sales are invoiced in Euros or Pounds, which had appreciated against the U.S. Dollar particularly during the first half of 2018 as compared to the same period of 2017.
Return to Index
Net sales and income from operations by operating segment for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2018 and 2017 were as follows.
Segment net sales are attributed to individual segments based on the geographic source of the billing for customer sales.
The improvement in income from operations within our North America segment was largely due to higher sales volumes in the 2018 periods, partially offset by increased material costs on purchased components.
The income from operations at our Asia segment for both 2018 periods presented was impacted by higher labor costs driven by increased minimum wage rates at our factories in the PRC, higher raw material costs during 2018 and the unfavorable appreciation of the Renminbi particularly during the first half of 2018 compared to the same period of 2017.
The increase in income from operations from our Europe segment are consistent with the increase in sales for that segment.
Net Sales
Return to Index
Our Magnetic Solutions group continued to benefit from a strong position on next-generation switching products which utilize our integrated connector modules.
This accounted for $7.5 million and $11.4 million of the sales growth during the third quarter and nine-month period of 2018 versus 2017.
Our Signal Transformer business also contributed with an increase in sales of $1.6 million and $3.2 million during the third quarter and nine-month period of 2018, as orders from new programs within industrial applications remained strong throughout the third quarter.
Our connectivity solutions products showed an overall improvement in sales of $5.7 million and $12.0 million during the third quarter and first nine months of 2018, respectively, compared to the same periods of 2017.
Sales of our Stewart passive connectors were very strong in the 2018 periods with increases of $3.6 million and $7.1 million during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2018 as compared to 2017.
This was largely led by higher demand from our premise wiring customers in North America and Europe in response to improved economic conditions in the construction industry.
We have also had a greater level of focus on our distribution channel in 2018 and our Stewart products have benefited from the increased exposure through our distribution base.
Sales of our Cinch products were also up in 2018 (by $2.1 million for the third quarter and by $5.0 million for the nine-month period) primarily from the military sector for our optical and copper products used in encryption, communications and flight-grade applications and for our micro-miniature copper connectivity products in relation to key defense programs.
Cost of Sales
Material costs as a percentage of sales increased during the 2018 periods noted above compared to the same periods of 2017 primarily due to industry-wide supply constraints related to certain of our purchased components throughout 2018.
This has had an unfavorable impact in the form of higher material costs across most of our product lines.
Labor costs as a percentage of sales also increased during the third quarter and first nine months of 2018 compared to the same periods of 2017 due primarily to two factors.
Effective February 1, 2018, the PRC issued an increase to the minimum wage in a region where one of Bel's factories is located, and effective July 1, 2018, minimum wage increases went into effect at our remaining facilities in the PRC.
This contributed to the higher labor costs in both 2018 periods presented above.
The other factor impacting the nine-month period above relates to the appreciation of the Renminbi against the U.S. Dollar, particularly during the first half of 2018.
This drove labor costs as a percentage of sales higher during the earlier part of 2018, as the majority of our Asia sales are invoiced in U.S.
Dollars, while our manufacturing staff at PRC locations are paid in local currency.
Return to Index
The other expenses noted in the table above include fixed cost items such as support labor and fringe, depreciation and amortization, and facility costs (rent, utilities, insurance).
In total, these other expenses increased during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2018 by $1.1 million and $3.1 million, respectively, as compared to the same periods of 2017.
This included higher support labor costs of $1.5 million and $3.0 million, respectively, partially offset by lower depreciation and amortization expense of $0.4 million and $0.9 million during the three and nine-month periods ending September 30, 2018 as compared to the same periods of 2017.
Provision for Income Taxes
The Company's effective tax rate will fluctuate based on the geographic segment in which the pretax profits are earned.
Of the geographic segments in which the Company operates, the U.S. and Europe's tax rates are generally equivalent; and Asia has the lowest tax rates of the Company's three geographical segments.
See Note 9, "Income Taxes".
The (benefit) provision for income taxes for the three months ended September 30, 2018 and 2017 was ($2.2) million and less than $0.1 million, respectively.
The Company's earnings before income taxes for the three months ended September 30, 2018, were approximately $4.1 million higher than the same period in 2017, primarily attributable to significantly higher earnings in the North America and Asia segments.
The Company's effective tax rate was (24.1%) and 1.2% for the three months ended September 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively.
The change in the effective tax rate during the three months ended September 30, 2018 as compared to the same period in 2017, is primarily attributable to a decrease in tax expense in the North America segment due to the reduction in the estimated transition tax on post 1986 untaxed accumulated foreign earnings, a reduction in the U.S. tax rate from 35% in 2017 to 21% in 2018, as well as a decrease in the taxes related to uncertain tax positions.
This decrease was partially offset by an increase in U.S. taxes relating to income from foreign subsidiaries taxed in the U.S. as part of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act.
See Note 9, "Income Taxes."
The provision for income taxes for the nine months ended September 30, 2018 and 2017 was $0.5 million and $2.3 million, respectively.
The Company's earnings before income taxes for the nine months ended September 30, 2018 were approximately $6.0 million higher than the same period in 2017, primarily attributable to increases in income in the Europe and North America segments.
The Company's effective tax rate was 3.0% and 20.8% for the nine month periods ended September 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively.
The change in the effective tax rate during the nine months ended September 30, 2018 as compared to the same period of 2017, is primarily attributable to a decrease in tax expense in the North America segment due to the reduction in the estimated transition tax on post 1986 untaxed accumulated foreign earnings, a reduction in the U.S. tax rate from 35% in 2017 to 21% in 2018, as well as a decrease in taxes related to uncertain tax positions.
This decrease was partially offset by an increase in U.S. taxes relating to income from foreign subsidiaries taxed in the U.S. as part of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act.
Additionally, the decrease in the effective tax rate for the nine months ended September 30, 2018 as compared to the same period in 2017, is attributable to U.S. and foreign taxes accrued for gains recognized on a Bel Fuse legal entity restructuring transaction during the 2017 period.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
Our primary sources of cash are the collection of trade receivables generated from the sales of our products and services to our customers and amounts available under our existing lines of credit, including our credit facility.
Our primary uses of cash are payments for operating expenses, investments in working capital, capital expenditures, interest, taxes, dividends, debt obligations and other long-term liabilities.
We believe that our current liquidity position and future cash flows from operations will enable us to fund our operations, including all of the items mentioned above in the next twelve months.
Return to Index
Cash and cash equivalents, marketable securities and accounts receivable comprised approximately 33.9% of the Company's total assets at September 30, 2018 and 34.4% of total assets at December 31, 2017.
The Company's current ratio (i.e., the ratio of current assets to current liabilities) was 2.9 to 1 at September 30, 2018 and 3.0 to 1 at December 31, 2017.
In June 2014, the Company entered into a senior Credit and Security Agreement, which was subsequently amended in March 2016, and further amended and refinanced in December 2017.
The Credit and Security Agreement contains customary representations and warranties, covenants and events of default and financial covenants that measure (i) the ratio of the Company's total funded indebtedness, on a consolidated basis, to the amount of the Company's consolidated EBITDA, as defined ("Leverage Ratio"), and (ii) the ratio of the amount of the Company's consolidated EBITDA to the Company's consolidated fixed charges ("Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio").
If an event of default occurs, the lenders under the Credit and Security Agreement would be entitled to take various actions, including the acceleration of amounts due thereunder and all actions permitted to be taken by a secured creditor.
At September 30, 2018, the Company was in compliance with its debt covenants, including its most restrictive covenant, the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio.
The unused credit available under the credit facility at September 30, 2018 was $75.0 million, of which we had the ability to borrow $34.1 million without violating our Leverage Ratio covenant based on the Company's existing consolidated EBITDA.
Cash Flows
Nine months Ended September 30, 2018
  ·   purchases of property, plant and equipment of $8.8 million;
  ·   repayments of long-term debt of $8.3 million; and
  ·   dividend payments of $2.4 million; partially offset by
  ·   net cash provided by operations of $4.2 million.
During the nine months ended September 30, 2018, accounts receivable increased by $19.0 million primarily due to higher sales volume in the third quarter of 2018 as compared to the fourth quarter of 2017.
Days sales outstanding (DSO) increased to 61 days at September 30, 2018 from 60 days at December 31, 2017.
Effective January 1, 2018, the Company implemented a change in the timing of revenue recognition (and related release of inventory from our books) in connection with the adoption of ASC 606, as described in Note 2.
Excluding the adoption adjustment related to this accounting change, inventory increased by $20.1 million at September 30, 2018 compared to December 31, 2017, primarily in raw materials.
The increased raw materials balance was driven by a higher volume of raw materials purchased to accommodate increased demand for our products, coupled with higher material costs in 2018 resulting from constraints in component availability.
Inventory turns increased from 3.6 at December 31, 2017 to 4.0 at September 30, 2018, primarily due to the change in revenue recognition accounting noted above.
Return to Index
Nine months Ended September 30, 2017
  ·   purchases of property, plant and equipment of $3.8 million;
  ·   dividend payments of $2.3 million; and
  ·   repayments of long-term debt of $25.2 million; partially offset by
  ·   net cash provided by operating activities of $14.2 million; and
  ·   net borrowings under our revolving credit line of $4.0 million
During the nine months ended September 30, 2017, accounts receivable increased by $7.9 million primarily due to higher sales volume in the third quarter of 2017 as compared to the fourth quarter of 2016.
Days sales outstanding (DSO) increased to 60 days at September 30, 2017 from 54 days at December 31, 2016, primary due the extension of credit terms with one of our large customers, as well as the increase in revenue (and resulting accounts receivable balance) in our Asia segment where DSO tends to be higher as compared to our other geographic segments.
Inventory levels were up by $3.3 million at September 30, 2017 compared to December 31, 2016 as work in progress and finished goods balances increased from year-end levels to accommodate the increase in demand for our products in 2017.
Critical Accounting Policies
Management's discussion and analysis of Bel's financial condition and results of operations are based upon the Company's condensed consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP.
The preparation of these financial statements requires the Company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities.
On an on-going basis, the Company evaluates its estimates, including those related to product returns, bad debts, inventories, goodwill, intangible assets, investments, warranties, SERP expense, income taxes and contingencies and litigation.
The Company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources.
Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.
Recent Accounting Pronouncements
The discussion of new financial accounting standards applicable to the Company is incorporated herein by reference to Note 1 to the Company's Financial Statements, "Basis of Presentation and Accounting Policies," included in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.
Item 2.
Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds
Pursuant to the Bel Fuse Inc. Employees' Savings Plan (the "Employees' Savings Plan"), the Company makes matching contributions of pre-tax elective deferral contributions made by associates.
The Employees' Savings Plan provides for matching contributions to be invested in shares of the Company's Class A Common Stock.
The trustees of the Employees' Savings Plan adopted a "10b5-1 Plan," in accordance with guidelines specified by Rule 10b5-1 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, to make open market purchases of shares of Class A Common Stock with such matching contributions.
The purchases in the table above were made under the 10b5-1 Plan.
The maximum dollar amount for cumulative purchases under the 10b5-1 Plan during the plan period (August 20, 2018 to November 30, 2018) will not exceed $650,000.
Item 5.
Other Information
As previously disclosed, on August 16, 2018, the trustees of the Employees' Savings Plan adopted a plan (the "10b5-1 Plan") in accordance with guidelines specified by Rule 10b5-1 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, pursuant to which KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc. was engaged to purchase shares of the Class A common stock of Bel Fuse Inc. ("Bel") to implement the Employees' Savings Plan's requirements that matching contributions be invested in shares of Bel's Class A common stock.
While it was originally expected that purchases under the 10b5-1 Plan would be completed by November 30, 2018, as a sufficient number of shares of Class A common stock have been purchased already to meet the requirements of the "match" for 2018, the 10b5-1 Plan was terminated effective November 7, 2018.
