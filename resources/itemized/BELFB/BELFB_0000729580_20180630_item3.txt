Item 3.
Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk
The Company is exposed to market risk primarily from changes in foreign currency exchange rates and changes in interest rates associated with its long-term debt.
During the first half of 2018, the U.S. Dollar was in a weakened position (compared to the first half of 2017) against most other currencies in which the Company pays its expenses.
In comparing average exchange rates during the second quarter of 2018 versus those during the second quarter of 2017, the Euro appreciated by 8%, the Pound appreciated by 6%, and the Renminbi appreciated by 7% against the U.S. Dollar.
In comparing average exchange rates during the first half of 2018 versus those during the first half of 2017, the Euro appreciated by 11%, the Pound appreciated by 9%, and the Renminbi appreciated by 7% against the U.S. Dollar.
The Company estimates that the appreciation in these foreign currencies led to $1.4 million and $3.2 million in higher operating costs for the second quarter and six-month periods, respectively, as the majority of our expenses in the PRC, Europe and Mexico are paid in local currency.
In addition to the foreign exchange losses recognized, the Company recorded foreign exchange gains of $1.9 million and $0.9 million during the three and six months ended June 30, 2018, respectively, on remeasurement of foreign currency transactions.
This compares to foreign exchange losses recorded during the three and six months ended June 30, 2017 of $1.6 million and $2.1 million, respectively, resulting from remeasurement of foreign currency transactions.
Refer to Item 7A, "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations," in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2017 for further discussion of market risks.
