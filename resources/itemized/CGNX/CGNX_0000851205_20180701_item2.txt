Executive Overview

Cognex Corporation is a leading worldwide provider of machine vision products that capture and analyze visual information in order to automate tasks, primarily in manufacturing processes, where vision is required.
In addition to product revenue derived from the sale of machine vision products, the Company also generates revenue by providing maintenance and support, consulting, and training services to its customers; however, service revenue accounted for less than 10% of total revenue for all periods presented.
The Company’s customers are predominantly in the factory automation market.
Factory automation customers purchase Cognex products and incorporate them into their manufacturing processes.
Customers in the consumer electronics and automotive industries contribute the largest percentage to the Company's factory automation revenue.
Most manufacturers can achieve better quality and manufacturing efficiency by using machine vision, and therefore, this market also includes a broad base of customers across a variety of other industries, including consumer products, food and beverage, medical devices, and pharmaceuticals.
Factory automation customers also purchase Cognex products for use outside of the manufacturing process, such as using ID products in logistics automation for package sorting and distribution.
A small percentage of the Company’s customers are in the semiconductor and electronics capital equipment market.
These customers purchase Cognex products and integrate them into the automation equipment that they manufacture and then sell to their customers to either make semiconductor chips or assemble printed circuit boards.
On January 1, 2018, the Company adopted Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 606, "Revenue from Contracts with Customers," using the full retrospective method to present all periods reported on a consistent basis.
Accordingly, prior period revenue, cost of revenue, and gross profit have been restated to apply the provisions of this ASC.
Revenue for the second quarter of 2018 totaled $211,264,000, representing an increase of 19% from the second quarter of 2017 driven primarily by strong sales in the logistics and automotive industries.
The gross margin percentage 


declined to 74% of revenue in the second quarter of 2018 from 76% of revenue in the second quarter of 2017 due primarily to a higher percentage of revenue related to application-specific customer solutions.
Operating expenses increased by 23% over the second quarter of 2017 due principally to the impact of headcount additions to support the higher revenue level and future growth plans.
Operating income increased by 6% over the second quarter of 2017; however, a lower tax benefit related to stock option exercises than the prior year resulted in relatively flat net income.
Net income per diluted share was $0.32 in both the second quarter of 2018 and 2017.
Results of Operations

As foreign currency exchange rates are a factor in understanding period-to-period comparisons, we believe the presentation of results on a constant-currency basis in addition to reported results helps improve investors’ ability to understand our operating results and evaluate our performance in comparison to prior periods.
We also use results on a constant-currency basis as one measure to evaluate our performance.
Constant-currency information compares results between periods as if exchange rates had remained constant period-over-period.
We generally refer to such amounts calculated on a constant-currency basis as excluding the impact of foreign currency exchange rate changes.
Results on a constant-currency basis are not in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (U.S. GAAP) and should be considered in addition to, and not as a substitute for, results prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP.
Revenue

Revenue increased by $33,184,000, or 19%, for the three-month period and increased by $63,712,000, or 20%, for the six-month period.
Changes in foreign currency exchange rates, primarily related to the translation of Euro-denominated revenue to U.S.
Dollars, accounted for approximately 4% of the revenue increase in both periods.
The remaining constant-currency revenue increases came from higher sales in a variety of industries, with the largest contributions coming from the logistics and automotive industries.
As of the date of this report, we expect revenue for the third quarter of 2018 to increase sequentially from the second quarter of 2018.
Although we expect this growth to come from a variety of industries, the most notable increase is expected to come from the consumer electronics industry due to the quarterly timing of revenue from large customer orders in this industry.
The future quarterly timing of revenue in the consumer electronics industry will depend upon a number of factors, including the product introduction cycles of these customers.
Despite the level of quarterly revenue currently anticipated from customers in the consumer electronics industry in the third quarter of 2018, we expect consumer electronics revenue to be lower than the third quarter of 2017 and for the full year 2018 as compared to 2017.
Gross Margin

Gross margin as a percentage of revenue was 74% and 75% for the three-month and six-month periods in 2018, respectively, compared to 76% for both periods in 2017.
Although a higher volume of products sold resulted in manufacturing efficiencies, this favorable impact was offset by a greater percentage of revenue related to application-specific customer solutions.
These solutions typically have lower gross margins due to the application configuration and deployment services included as part of the solution, as well as on-site support services provided after the solution is deployed.
In addition, these solutions are often provided to large customers that may receive favorable pricing.
The Company's gross margin percentage has ranged in the mid 70s for the past several years.
As of the date of this report, we expect the gross margin percentage to be relatively flat for the third quarter of 2018 as compared to the second quarter of 2018.
Operating Expenses






Selling, General, and Administrative Expenses




Non-operating Income (Expense)

The Company recorded foreign currency losses of $195,000 and $329,000 for the three-month and six-month periods in 2018, respectively, compared to foreign currency losses of $184,000 and $447,000 for the three-month and six-month period in 2017.
Foreign currency gains and losses result primarily from the revaluation and settlement of accounts receivable, accounts payable, and intercompany balances that are reported in one currency and collected in another.
Investment income increased by $1,421,000, or 66%, for the three-month period and increased by $2,649,000, or 64%, for the six-month period.
The increase was due to higher yields on the Company's portfolio of debt securities, as well as additional funds available for investment.
The Company recorded other expense of $246,000 and other income of $31,000 for the three-month and six-month periods in 2018, respectively, compared to other expense of $169,000 and other income of $101,000 for the same periods in 2017.
Other income (expense) includes fair value adjustments of contingent consideration liabilities arising from business acquisitions, as well as rental income, net of associated expenses, from leasing space in buildings adjacent to the Company’s corporate headquarters.
Income Tax Expense

The Company’s effective tax rate was an expense of 16% and 11% of pre-tax income for the three-month and six-month periods in 2018, respectively, compared to an expense of 9% of pre-tax income and a benefit of 1% of pre-tax income for the same periods in 2017.
The effective tax rate included a decrease in tax expense of $654,000 and $5,589,000 for the three-month and six-month periods in 2018, respectively, and $5,787,000 and $18,954,000 for the same periods in 2017 from the excess tax benefit arising from the difference between the deduction for tax purposes and the compensation cost recognized for financial reporting purposes from stock option exercises.
The Company cannot predict the level of stock option exercises by employees in future periods.
Excluding the impact of tax benefits related to stock option exercises, the Company’s effective tax rate was 17% and 16% for the three-month and six-month periods in 2018, respectively, compared to 18% for the same periods in 2017.
This decrease in the effective tax rate was primarily due to the impact of the Tax Act.
The Tax Act included a decrease in the U.S. federal statutory corporate tax rate from 35% to 21%.
The majority of income earned outside of the United States is indefinitely reinvested to provide funds for international expansion.
The Company is tax resident in numerous jurisdictions around the world and has identified its major tax jurisdictions as the United States, Ireland, and China.
The statutory tax rate is 12.5% in Ireland and 25% in China.
International rights to certain of the Company’s intellectual property are held by a subsidiary whose legal jurisdiction does not tax this income, resulting in a foreign effective tax rate lower than the above mentioned statutory rates.
The Company has not yet determined how the Tax Act will impact its financial statement assertion related to indefinite reinvestment in future years.
Liquidity and Capital Resources

The Company has historically been able to generate positive cash flow from operations, which has funded its operating activities and other cash requirements and has resulted in an accumulated cash and investment balance of $754,883,000 as of July 1, 2018.
The Company has established guidelines relative to credit ratings, diversification, and maturities of its investments that maintain liquidity.
The Company’s cash requirements during the six months ended July 1, 2018 were met with positive cash flows from operations, investment maturities, and the proceeds from stock option exercises.
Cash requirements consisted of operating activities, investment purchases, the repurchase of common stock, the payment of dividends, and capital expenditures.
Operating cash outflows included the purchase of inventory for large customer orders already received or anticipated to be received that are expected to ship and generate revenue later in 2018.
Capital expenditures in the six-month period ended July 1, 2018 totaled $21,675,000 and consisted primarily of computer hardware and software, manufacturing test equipment related to new product introductions, and improvements made to the Company's headquarters building in Natick, Massachusetts and distribution center in Cork, Ireland.
Cumulative capital expenditures since the second quarter of 2017 related to application development activities for a new Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) system totaled approximately $10,000,000 as of July 1, 2018.
This capital asset has been placed into service in the third quarter of 2018 and will be depreciated over a ten year estimated useful life.
In April 2017, the Company's Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of $100,000,000 of the Company's common stock.
As of July 1, 2018, the Company repurchased 1,744,000 shares at a cost of $100,000,000 under this program, including 803,000 shares at a cost of $45,200,000 in the first quarter of 2018.
Stock repurchases under this April 2017 program were completed in the first quarter of 2018.
In February, 2018, the Company's Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of an additional $150,000,000 of the Company's common stock.
Purchases under this February 2018 program commenced during the first quarter of 2018.
As of July 1, 2018, the Company repurchased 1,553,000 shares at a cost of $76,108,000 under this program, leaving a remaining authorized balance of $73,892,000.
Total stock repurchases in the six-month period ended July 1, 2018 amounted to $121,308,000.
The Company may repurchase 


shares under this program in future periods depending on a variety of factors, including, among other things, the impact of dilution from employee stock options, stock price, share availability, and cash requirements.
The Company’s Board of Directors declared and paid a cash dividend of $0.0450 per share in the first and second quarters of 2018, amounting to $15,524,000 for the six-month period ended July 1, 2018.
Future dividends will be declared at the discretion of the Company’s Board of Directors and will depend upon such factors as the Board deems relevant including, among other things, the Company’s ability to generate positive cash flows from operations.
The Company’s business strategy includes selective expansion into new machine vision markets and applications through the acquisition of businesses and technologies.
Certain of the Company's business acquisitions have contractual obligations for deferred cash payments, contingent cash payments tied to performance, and special incentive cash payments tied to employment, none of which are material individually or in the aggregate to the Company's cash flows.
The Company believes that its existing cash and investment balances, together with cash flow from operations, will be sufficient to meet its operating, investing, and financing activities for the next twelve months.
As of July 1, 2018, the Company had $754,883,000 in cash and investments.
In addition, Cognex has no long-term debt and does not anticipate needing debt financing in the near future.
We believe that our strong cash position has put us in a relatively good position with respect to our longer-term liquidity needs.
