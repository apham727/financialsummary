ITEM 4: CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES


There was no change in the Company's internal control over the financial reporting that occurred during the quarter ended June 30, 2019 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company's internal control over financial reporting.
LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

Various claims and legal proceedings generally incidental to the normal course of business are pending or threatened on behalf of or against the Company.
While we cannot predict the outcome of these matters, we believe that any liability arising from them will not have a material adverse effect on our financial position, liquidity, or results of operations.
