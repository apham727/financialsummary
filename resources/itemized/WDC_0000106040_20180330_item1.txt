Note 1.Organization and Basis of Presentation



Western Digital Corporation (“Western Digital” or “the Company”) is a leading developer, manufacturer and provider of data storage devices and solutions that address the evolving needs of the information technology (“IT”) industry and the infrastructure that enables the proliferation of data in virtually every industry. The Company’s broad portfolio of technology and products address the following key markets: Client Devices; Data Center Devices and Solutions; and Client Solutions. The Company also generates license and royalty revenue related to its intellectual property (“IP”), which is included in each of these three categories.



The accounting policies followed by the Company are set forth in Part II, Item 8, Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10‑K for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2017. In the opinion of management, all adjustments necessary to fairly state the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements have been made. All such adjustments are of a normal, recurring nature. Certain information and footnote disclosures normally included in the Consolidated Financial Statements prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (“U.S. GAAP”) have been condensed or omitted pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”). These Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements and the notes thereto included in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10‑K for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2017. The results of operations for interim periods are not necessarily indicative of results to be expected for the full year.



Fiscal Year



The Company’s fiscal year ends on the Friday nearest to June 30 and typically consists of 52 weeks. Fiscal years 2018, which ends on June 29, 2018, and 2017, which ended on June 30, 2017, are both comprised of 52 weeks, with all quarters presented consisting of 13 weeks.



Use of Estimates



Company management has made estimates and assumptions relating to the reporting of certain assets and liabilities in conformity with U.S. GAAP. These estimates and assumptions have been applied using methodologies that are consistent throughout the periods presented. However, actual results could differ materially from these estimates.

Note 2.Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements



In August 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) No. 2016-15, “Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230), Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments” (“ASU 2016-15”). ASU 2016-15 provides amendments that address eight specific cash flow classification issues for which there exists diversity in practice: Debt prepayment or debt extinguishment costs; settlement of zero-coupon debt instruments or other debt instruments with coupon interest rates that are insignificant in relation to the effective interest rate of the borrowing; contingent consideration payments made after a business combination; proceeds from the settlement of insurance claims; proceeds from the settlement of corporate-owned life insurance policies, including bank-owned life insurance policies; distributions received from equity method investees; beneficial interests in securitization transactions; and separately identifiable cash flows and application of the predominance principle. The Company adopted ASU 2016-15 in the second quarter of 2018 on a modified retrospective basis as required by the standard. The Company’s adoption of ASU 2016-15 did not have a material effect on the Company’s historical Consolidated Financial Statements.



In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-09, “Compensation - Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting” (“ASU 2016-09”). ASU 2016-09 simplifies several aspects of the accounting for stock-based payment transactions and states that, among other things, all excess tax benefits and tax deficiencies should be recognized as income tax expense or benefit in the income statement and an entity can make an entity-wide accounting policy election to either estimate the number of awards that are expected to vest or account for forfeitures when they occur. The Company adopted this standard in the first quarter of 2018 using the modified retrospective approach. This adoption resulted in a one-time net increase to beginning retained earnings of $70 million, consisting of a $58 million cumulative adjustment for the previously unrecognized windfall tax benefits related to previous vesting and exercises of stock-based awards, and a $19 million cumulative adjustment related to the change in accounting policy for estimated forfeitures and share cancellations, partially offset by a decrease of $7 million for the related tax impacts of change in forfeiture policy. In addition, upon adoption of the new standard in the Company’s first quarter of 2018, the Company began prospectively reflecting the tax deficiencies and benefits as an operating activity, rather than as a financing activity under the previous standard, in the Company’s Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. For the three and nine months ended March 30, 2018, the Company recognized excess tax benefits of $46 million and $73 million, respectively, as a component of its income tax expense (benefit).



In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-07, “Investments - Equity Method and Joint Ventures (Topic 323): Simplifying the Transition to the Equity Method of Accounting” (“ASU 2016-07”). ASU 2016-07 eliminates the requirement to apply the equity method of accounting retrospectively when a reporting entity obtains significant influence over a previously held investment. The Company adopted this standard in the second quarter of 2018. The Company’s adoption of ASU 2016-07 did not have a material impact on its Consolidated Financial Statements.



In July 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015‑11, “Inventory (Topic 330) - Simplifying the Measurement of Inventory” (“ASU 2015‑11”), which dictates that an entity should measure inventory within the scope of this update at the lower of cost and net realizable value. Net realizable value is the estimated selling prices in the ordinary course of business, less reasonably predictable costs of completion, disposal, and transportation. The Company adopted this standard in the first quarter of 2018. The Company’s adoption of ASU 2015‑11 did not have a material impact on its Consolidated Financial Statements.

Goodwill



[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]



On September 15, 2017, the Company acquired substantially all the assets of Tegile Systems, Inc., a provider of flash and persistent-memory storage solutions for enterprise data center applications. On August 25, 2017, the Company acquired substantially all the assets of Upthere, Inc., a cloud services company. These acquisitions are primarily intended to help meet the evolving needs of customers, while driving long-term growth for the Company's existing data center and client solution products over the long term.

 (Unaudited) 



The aggregate purchase price of acquisitions during the nine months ended March 30, 2018 was $99 million in cash, with net assets acquired primarily consisting of developed technology and other intangible assets, of which $61 million was allocated to goodwill. Goodwill is primarily attributable to the benefits the Company expects to derive from diversifying product offerings to its Data Center Devices and Solutions and Client Solutions end markets as well as the acquired workforce. Goodwill is expected to be deductible for tax purposes because the acquisitions were structured as asset acquisitions but accounted for as business combinations. Concurrent with these acquisitions, the Company received $36 million in proceeds on previously outstanding notes receivable due from these acquired entities. 



During the nine months ended March 30, 2018, the expenses incurred by the Company related to these acquisitions were immaterial and are primarily included within Selling, General and Administrative expenses in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations. Revenues and earnings related to these acquisitions was not material.



Intangible assets



[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]



As part of prior acquisitions, the Company recorded at the time of the acquisition acquired in-process research and development (“IPR&D”) for projects in progress that had not yet reached technological feasibility. IPR&D is initially accounted for as an indefinite-lived intangible asset. Once a project reaches technological feasibility, the Company reclassifies the balance to existing technology and begins to amortize the intangible asset over its estimated useful life. During the nine months ended March 30, 2018, two IPR&D projects reached technological feasibility totaling $616 million and commenced amortization over an estimated useful life of 4 years.



Product warranty liability



Changes in the warranty accrual were as follows:



[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]



The long-term portion of the warranty accrual classified in Other liabilities was $110 million and $125 million as of March 30, 2018 and June 30, 2017, respectively.

Financial Instruments Not Carried at Fair Value 



The carrying value of the Company’s revolving credit facility approximates its fair value given the revolving nature of the balance and the variable market interest rate. For financial instruments where the carrying value (which includes principal adjusted for any unamortized issuance costs, and discounts or premiums) differs from fair value (which is based on quoted market prices), the following table represents the related carrying value and fair value for each of the Company’s outstanding financial instruments. Each of the financial instruments presented below was categorized as Level 2 for all periods presented, based on the frequency of trading immediately prior to the end of the third quarter of 2018 and the fourth quarter of 2017, respectively. 



[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]



(1) Euro Term Loan B-2 outstanding principal amount as of June 30, 2017 was based upon the Euro to U.S. dollar exchange rate as of that respective date.



Cost Method Investments



From time to time, the Company enters into certain strategic investments for the promotion of business and strategic objectives. The Company reports these investments under the cost method of accounting as it does not have a significant influence over the operations of these investees. These investments consist of debt and equity securities of privately-held companies that do not have a readily determinable fair value and are carried at historical cost. The Company assesses these securities for indications of other-than-temporary impairments. 



During the three and nine months ended March 30, 2018, the Company recorded impairment charges and losses related to the sale of these cost method investments of $9 million and $15 million, respectively, which were included in Other expense, net in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations. During the three and nine months ended March 31, 2017, the Company recorded impairment charges and losses related to the sale of these cost method investments of $7 million and $11 million, respectively. As of March 30, 2018 and June 30, 2017, these investments aggregated $28 million and $91 million, respectively, and are reported under Other non-current assets in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets.

Note 5.Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities



As of March 30, 2018, the Company had outstanding foreign exchange forward contracts that were designated as either cash flow hedges or non-designated hedges. The contract maturity dates of these foreign exchange forward contracts do not exceed 12 months. In addition, the Company had outstanding interest rate swaps that were designated as cash flow hedges. The Company determined the ineffective portion and the amount excluded for effectiveness testing associated with its cash flow hedges to be immaterial to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for the three and nine months ended March 30, 2018 and March 31, 2017.



As of March 30, 2018, the amount of existing net gains related to cash flow hedges recorded in AOCI was $28 million. Over the next twelve months, the Company expects to reclassify the majority of this amount into earnings. In addition, as of March 30, 2018, the Company did not have any foreign exchange forward contracts with credit-risk-related contingent features.



A change in the fair value of non-designated hedges is recognized in earnings in the period incurred and is reported as a component of Other expense, net. The changes in fair value on these contracts were immaterial to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for the three and nine months ended March 30, 2018 and March 31, 2017.



The Company accounts for its interest rate swap as a designated cash flow hedge to mitigate variations in interest payments under a portion of its LIBOR-based term loans due to variations in the LIBOR index. The Company pays interest monthly at a fixed rate and receives interest monthly at the LIBOR rate on the notional amount of the contract. The effective portion of the change in fair value of this designated cash flow hedge is deferred in Other comprehensive income (loss), net of tax, with any ineffective portion recognized in Other income (expense), net.



Derivative Instruments



The fair value and balance sheet location of the Company’s derivative instruments were as follows:

As of March 30, 2018 and June 30, 2017, the effect of rights of offset was not material and the Company did not offset or net the fair value amounts of derivative instruments in its Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets.

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]



(1) Euro Term Loan B-2 outstanding principal amount as of June 30, 2017 was based upon the Euro to U.S. dollar exchange rate as of that date.



In February 2018, the Company issued $2.30 billion aggregate principal amount of senior unsecured notes due February 15, 2026 (the “2026 Senior Unsecured Notes”). The 2026 Senior Unsecured Notes bear interest at an annual rate of 4.750% with interest payable on February 15 and August 15 of each year. The Company is not required to make principal payments on the 2026 Senior Unsecured Notes prior to the maturity date. The 2026 Senior Unsecured Notes are jointly and severally guaranteed by certain material domestic subsidiaries of the Company. The 2026 Senior Unsecured Notes issuance costs are amortized to interest expense over the term of the 2026 Senior Unsecured Notes and as of March 30, 2018, issuance costs of $20 million remained unamortized.



In February 2018, the Company also issued $1.10 billion aggregate principal amount of convertible senior notes due February 1, 2024 (the “2024 Convertible Notes”). The 2024 Convertible Notes bear interest at an annual rate of 1.50% with interest payable on February 1 and August 1 of each year. The Company is not required to make principal payments on the 2024 Convertible Notes prior to the maturity date. The 2024 Convertible Notes are jointly and severally guaranteed by certain material domestic subsidiaries of the Company.



The 2024 Convertible Notes are convertible into cash, shares of the Company’s common stock, or a combination thereof at an initial conversion price of approximately $121.91 per share of common stock. Holders of the 2024 Convertible Notes may freely convert their 2024 Convertible Notes on or after November 1, 2023 until the close of business on the business day immediately preceding the maturity date. Prior to November 1, 2023, holders may convert their 2024 Convertible Notes based on variations in market price of the Company’s common stock in relation to the conversion price or the trading price of the 2024 Convertible Notes or upon the occurrence of specified corporate events.

The Company separately accounts for the liability and equity components of the 2024 Convertible Notes. The value of the liability component as of the date of issuance was recognized at the present value of its cash flows using a discount rate of 4.375%, the Company’s borrowing rate at the date of the issuance for a similar debt instrument without the conversion feature, resulting in a debt discount of $165 million, which was allocated to equity as the value of the conversion feature. The 2024 Convertible Notes debt issuance costs were approximately $18 million, of which $15 million was allocated to the debt component and $3 million was allocated to equity. The debt discount and issuance costs are amortized to interest expense over the term of the 2024 Convertible Notes. As of March 30, 2018, debt discount and issuance cost of $176 million remained unamortized.



In February 2018, the Company entered into an amendment to the credit agreement entered into on April 29, 2016 (as amended, the “Credit Agreement”), to provide for, among other things, (i) the issuance of a new $5.02 billion of term loan A-1 due 2023 (the “Term Loan A-1”), (ii) a new $2.25 billion revolving credit facility maturing in 2023 (the “Revolving Facility”), which replaced the Company’s prior $1.50 billion revolving credit facility maturing in 2021, (iii) modifications to the restrictive and financial maintenance covenants, to provide more flexibility and increased incremental debt capacity, (iv) amendments of the applicable varying interest rate margins to be based on the Company’s corporate credit ratings as described in the indenture, and (v) upon the occurrence of certain circumstances, a release of the security and guarantees as well as further covenant flexibility and increased incremental debt capacity. The Company used a portion of the proceeds of the Term Loan A-1 to repay in full its previous variable interest rate Term Loan A in the principal amount of $4.02 billion. 



The Term Loan A-1 bears interest at a per annum rate equal to, at the Company’s option, either an adjusted London Interbank Offered Rate (“LIBOR”) rate, subject to a 0.00% floor, plus an applicable margin varying from 1.125% to 2.000% or a base rate plus an applicable margin varying from 0.125% to 1.000%, in each case depending on the Company’s corporate credit ratings. Currently the Company has selected the LIBOR rate option, and the applicable rate was 3.38% as of March 30, 2018. Principal payments are due in quarterly installments of (i) 0.625% per quarter from June 2018 through March 2019 and (ii) 1.25% per quarter from June 2019 through December 2022, with the remaining balance payable on February 27, 2023. The Term Loan A-1 issuance costs are amortized to interest expense over the term of the loan, and as of March 30, 2018, issuance costs of $9 million remained unamortized. 



Proceeds of $500 million were drawn under the Revolving Facility and were used to fund a voluntary partial prepayment of the Company’s existing U.S. Dollar denominated term B-3 loans (“U.S. Term Loan B-3”). Loans under the Revolving Facility bear interest, at the Company’s option, at either LIBOR plus an applicable margin varying from 1.125% to 2.000% or a base rate plus an applicable margin varying from 0.125% to 1.000%, in each case depending on the Company’s corporate credit ratings. Currently the Company has selected the LIBOR rate option, and the applicable interest rate was 3.38% as of March 30, 2018. The Company will also pay an unused commitment fee on the Revolving Facility ranging from 0.120% to 0.350% based on the Company’s corporate credit ratings as described in the indenture, with an initial fee of 0.250%.



The Term Loan A-1 and the Revolving Facility are unconditionally guaranteed by each of the guarantors under the Credit Agreement and are secured on a first-priority basis (subject to permitted liens) by a lien on the same collateral that secure the other loans under the Credit Agreement; provided that the security and guarantees will be automatically suspended upon certain conditions.



During the three months ended March 30, 2018, the Company completed the redemption of all of its outstanding 7.375% senior secured notes due 2023 in the aggregate principal amount of $1.875 billion (the “2023 Notes”) and the tender offer and redemption and settlement of all of its outstanding 10.50% senior unsecured notes due 2024 in the aggregate principal amount of $3.350 billion (the “2024 Notes” and collectively with the 2023 Notes, the “Redeemed Notes”), including an aggregate of $720 million of “make-whole” and tender premiums required for the tender offer of the 2024 Notes and the optional redemption of the Redeemed Notes in accordance with the applicable indentures and accrued interest through the applicable redemption dates.

In November 2017, the Company settled in full the principal amounts of the Euro Term Loan B-2, plus accrued interest, using cash on hand. Additionally, in November 2017, the Company borrowed $2.96 billion under U.S. Term Loan B-3 under its Credit Agreement and used the proceeds of this new loan to prepay in full the U.S. Term Loan B-2 previously outstanding under the Credit Agreement. The U.S. Term Loan B-3 has an interest rate equal to, at the Company’s option, either an adjusted LIBOR rate, subject to a 0.00% floor, plus 2.00% or a base rate plus 1.00%. Currently the Company has selected the LIBOR rate option, and the applicable interest rate was 3.88% as of March 30, 2018. Principal payments on U.S. Term Loan B-3 of 0.25% are due quarterly and began on December 29, 2017 with the balance due on April 29, 2023. During the three months ended March 30, 2018, the Company funded a voluntary partial prepayment of $500 million, which was allocated towards principal payments. As a result, the Company is not required to make principal payments on the U.S. Term Loan B-3 prior to its maturity date. The U.S. Term Loan B-3 issuance costs are amortized to interest expense over the term of the loan and as of March 30, 2018, issuance costs of $3 million remained unamortized. 



In connection with the settlements of the various debt instruments described above, the Company recognized an aggregate loss on debt extinguishment of $896 million for the nine months ended March 30, 2018, consisting of $720 million of “make-whole” and tender premiums and $176 million of unamortized issuance costs, of which $894 million was incurred in the three months ended March 30, 2018. In the three and nine months ended March 31, 2017, the Company incurred losses on the extinguishment of debt of $7 million and $274 million, respectively.



The Credit Agreement requires the Company to comply with certain financial covenants, such as a leverage ratio and an interest coverage ratio. As of March 30, 2018, the Company was in compliance with all financial covenants. In addition, the Credit Agreement requires the Company to comply with customary covenants that limit or restrict the Company’s and its subsidiaries’ ability to incur liens and indebtedness; make certain restricted payments, acquisitions, investments, loans and guarantees; and enter into certain transactions with affiliates, mergers and consolidations. In addition, the indentures governing the 2026 Senior Unsecured Notes and the 2024 Convertible Notes contain restrictive covenants that limit the Company’s and its subsidiaries’ ability to, among other things, consolidate, merge or sell all or substantially all of their assets; create liens; and incur, assume or guarantee additional indebtedness.

Flash Ventures



The Company’s business ventures with Toshiba Memory Corporation (“TMC”) consist of three separate legal entities: Flash Partners Ltd. (“Flash Partners”), Flash Alliance Ltd. (“Flash Alliance”), and Flash Forward Ltd. (“Flash Forward”), collectively referred to as “Flash Ventures”.



In connection with a settlement agreement with Toshiba in December 2017, the Company entered into a facility agreement (“Y6 Facility Agreement”) with TMC related to the construction and operation of a new 300-millimeter wafer fabrication facility in Yokkaichi, Japan, referred to as “Fab 6”, which is primarily intended to provide cleanroom space to continue the transition of the parties’ existing 2D NAND manufacturing capacity to BiCS 3D NAND manufacturing capacity. Under the Y6 Facility Agreement, the Company is committed to 50% of Fab 6’s start-up costs, as well as 50% of the joint ventures’ portion of an upcoming investment in manufacturing equipment for Fab 6.



The following table presents the notes receivable from, and equity investments in, Flash Ventures as of March 30, 2018 and June 30, 2017:



[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]



During the three and nine months ended March 30, 2018, the Company made net payments to Flash Ventures of $1.00 billion and $3.0 billion, respectively, for purchased flash-based memory wafers and net loans.



The Company makes, or will make, loans to Flash Ventures to fund equipment investments for new process technologies and additional wafer capacity. The Company aggregates its Flash Ventures’ notes receivable into one class of financing receivables due to the similar ownership interest and common structure in each Flash Venture entity. For all reporting periods presented, no loans were past due and no loan impairments were recorded. The Company’s notes receivable from each Flash Ventures entity, denominated in Japanese yen, are secured by equipment owned by that Flash Ventures entity.



The Company assesses financing receivable credit quality through financial and operational reviews of the borrower and creditworthiness, including credit rating agency ratings, of significant investors of the borrower, where material or known. There were no impairments for credit worthiness in the three and nine months ended March 30, 2018 and March 31, 2017.



As of March 30, 2018 and June 30, 2017, the Company had accounts payable balances due to Flash Ventures of $282 million and $206 million, respectively.

The Company is committed to purchase its provided three-month forecast of Flash Ventures’ NAND wafer supply, which generally equals 50% of Flash Ventures’ output. The Company is not able to estimate its total wafer purchase commitment obligation beyond its rolling three-month purchase commitment because the price is determined by reference to the future cost of producing the semiconductor wafers. In addition, the Company is committed to fund 49.9% to 50.0% of each Flash Ventures entity’s investments to the extent that each Flash Ventures entity’s operating cash flow is insufficient to fund these investments.



Off-Balance Sheet Liabilities



Flash Ventures sells and leases back from a consortium of financial institutions a portion of its tools and has entered into equipment lease agreements of which the Company guarantees half or all of the outstanding obligations under each lease agreement. The lease agreements contain customary covenants for Japanese lease facilities. In addition to containing customary events of default related to Flash Ventures that could result in an acceleration of Flash Ventures’ obligations, the lease agreements contain acceleration clauses for certain events of default related to the guarantors, including the Company. 



The following table presents the Company’s portion of the remaining guarantee obligations under the Flash Ventures’ lease facilities in both Japanese yen and U.S. dollar-equivalent, based upon the Japanese yen to U.S. dollar exchange rate as of March 30, 2018.

Note 10.Income Tax Expense (Benefit)



The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (“2017 Act”) was enacted on December 22, 2017. The 2017 Act includes a broad range of tax reform proposals affecting businesses, including a reduction in the U.S. federal corporate tax rate from 35% to 21%, a one-time mandatory deemed repatriation tax on earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries that were previously tax deferred and creates new taxes on certain foreign earnings.



For the three and nine months ended March 30, 2018, the Company has not finalized the accounting for the tax effects of the enactment of the 2017 Act. However, consistent with applicable SEC guidance, the Company has made a reasonable estimate of the effects on the Company’s existing deferred tax balances and the one-time mandatory deemed repatriation tax required by the 2017 Act and has recognized a provisional income tax expense of $1.66 billion for the one-time mandatory deemed repatriation tax and a provisional income tax benefit of $79 million related to the re-measurement of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the nine months ended March 30, 2018. For other elements of tax expense noted below, or where the Company has not made an election, the Company has not been able to make a reasonable estimate and continues to account for such items based on the provisions of the tax laws that were in effect immediately prior to the 2017 Act. As the Company finalizes the accounting for the tax effects of the enactment of the 2017 Act during a one-year measurement period permitted by applicable SEC guidance, the Company expects to reflect adjustments to the recorded provisional amounts and record additional tax effects of the 2017 Act.



Additional information regarding the significant provisions of the 2017 Act that are expected to impact the Company is provided below.



Re-measurement of deferred taxes



The provisional income tax expense of $9 million and income tax benefit of $79 million recorded for the three and nine months ended March 30, 2018, respectively, related to the re-measurements of the Company’s deferred tax balances are based on the rates at which the deferred tax assets and liabilities are expected to reverse in the current and future fiscal years, which are generally 29% and 22%, respectively. However, the Company is still analyzing certain aspects of the 2017 Act and refining the calculations, which could potentially affect the measurement of these balances or potentially give rise to new deferred tax amounts. The Company is also analyzing the impact of the 2017 Act to the existing valuation allowance assessments from both a federal and state tax perspective, which could potentially affect the realizability of the existing deferred tax assets. In calculating the provisional amount, the Company utilized an estimate of the expected reversals of certain tax assets and liabilities, which will be revised in future quarters during the one-year measurement period as additional information becomes available.



Mandatory deemed repatriation tax



In connection with the transition from a global to a territorial U.S. tax system, companies are required to pay a mandatory deemed repatriation tax. The tax is to be computed using the Company’s total foreign post-1986 earnings and profits that were previously deferred from U.S. income taxes. This tax is based on the amount of foreign earnings held in cash and other specified assets which are taxed at 15.5% and 8%, respectively, and is payable over an 8-year period. For the nine months ended March 30, 2018, the Company recorded a provisional amount for the mandatory deemed repatriation tax liability of $1.66 billion for foreign subsidiaries and $132 million of this amount is classified as a current tax liability. The calculation of the mandatory deemed repatriation tax liability is provisional and based upon preliminary estimates of post-1986 earnings and profits. In addition, the mandatory deemed repatriation tax is based on a provisional amount of foreign earnings held in cash and other specified assets, which the Company expects will require additional clarifying guidance from U.S. Treasury. As such, the provisional amount may change during the one-year measurement period when the Company finalizes the calculation of post-1986 foreign earnings and profits and the amount of foreign earnings held in cash or other specified assets. The Company made no adjustment to this provisional amount in the three months ended March 30, 2018.



28

WESTERN DIGITAL CORPORATION



NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)



 (Unaudited) 



Although the mandatory deemed repatriation tax has removed U.S. federal taxes on distributions to the U.S., the Company continues to evaluate the expected manner of recovery to determine whether or not to continue to assert indefinite reinvestment on a part or all the foreign undistributed earnings. This requires the Company to re-evaluate the existing short and long-term capital allocation policies in light of the 2017 Act and calculate the tax cost that is incremental to the deemed repatriation tax (e.g., foreign withholding, state income taxes, and additional U.S. tax on currency transaction gains or losses) of repatriating cash to the U.S. While the provisional tax expense for the three and nine months ended March 30, 2018 is based upon an assumption that foreign undistributed earnings are indefinitely reinvested, the Company’s plan may change upon the completion of long-term capital allocation plans in light of the 2017 Act and completion of the calculation of the incremental tax effects on the repatriation of foreign undistributed earnings. In the event the Company determines not to continue to assert the permanent reinvestment of part or all of foreign undistributed earnings, such a determination could result in the accrual and payment of additional foreign, state and local taxes.



Deferred taxes on foreign earnings



As a result of the shift to a territorial system for U.S. taxation, the new minimum tax on certain foreign earnings (“global intangible low-tax income”) provision of the 2017 Act imposes a tax on foreign earnings and profits in excess of a deemed return on tangible assets of foreign subsidiaries. This provision is effective for tax years beginning on or after January 1, 2018, which for the Company would be the fiscal year beginning on June 30, 2018 (fiscal year 2019). The Company has not progressed sufficiently in the analysis of this provision to make an election either to account for the effects of this provision either as a component of future income tax expense in the period the tax arises or as a component of deferred taxes on the related investments. Accordingly, no deferred tax assets and liabilities have been established for timing differences between foreign U.S. GAAP income and foreign earnings and profits that would be expected to reverse under the new minimum tax in future years. Additionally, the Company has not yet completed the calculation of post-1986 foreign earnings and profits for the mandatory repatriation tax, which would be the starting point for the measurement of deferred tax assets and liabilities in order to record any provisional amounts. 



The following table presents the Company’s income tax expense and the effective tax rate, which reflect provisional amounts related to the mandatory deemed repatriation tax and re-measurement of deferred tax assets and liabilities pursuant to the 2017 Act as discussed above:



[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]



Under the 2017 Act, the reduction of the U.S. federal corporate tax rate from 35% to 21% is effective January 1, 2018, requiring companies to use a blended rate for their fiscal 2018 tax year by applying a pro-rated percentage of the number of days before and after the January 1, 2018 effective date. This results in the use of an estimated annual effective tax rate of approximately 28% for the Company’s U.S. federal corporate tax rate for fiscal year 2018. The U.S. federal corporate tax rate was reduced from 35% to the blended tax rate of 28% for fiscal year 2018. For fiscal year 2019 and beyond, the Company will utilize the enacted U.S. federal corporate tax rate of 21%.

The primary drivers for the difference between the effective tax rate for the three months ended March 30, 2018 and the U.S. Federal statutory rate of 28% include discrete effects consisting of an income tax benefit of $211 million from deductible make-whole premiums and the write-off of unamortized issuance costs from the debt financing transactions. The primary drivers for the difference between the effective tax rate for the nine months ended March 30, 2018 and the U.S. Federal statutory rate of 28% are related to the net charge of $1.66 billion for the one-time mandatory deemed repatriation tax, offset in part by an income tax benefit related to the re-measurement of deferred taxes as required by the 2017 Act and deductible make-whole premiums and the write-off of unamortized issuance costs from the debt financing transactions. The primary drivers for the remaining difference between the effective tax rate for the three and nine months ended March 30, 2018 and the U.S. Federal statutory rate of 28% are current year tax credits, and tax holidays in Malaysia, Philippines, Singapore and Thailand that expire at various dates during fiscal years 2018 through 2030 and windfall tax benefits related to vesting and exercises of stock-based awards. The windfall tax benefits are a result of the adoption of ASU 2016-09, which requires the Company to now recognize $46 million and $73 million of windfall tax benefits related to vesting and exercises of stock-based awards as a component of its income tax expense for the three and nine months ended March 30, 2018, respectively. The windfall tax benefits for the three and nine months ended March 31, 2017 were recorded within shareholders’ equity.



The primary drivers for the difference between the effective tax rate for the nine months ended March 31, 2017 and the U.S. Federal statutory rate of 35% include discrete effects consisting of income tax expense from the integration of SanDisk Corporation (“SanDisk”) of $91 million and a valuation allowance on acquired tax attributes of $111 million, partially offset by income tax benefit from deductible debt issuance costs, debt discounts and prepayment fees from the debt extinguishment of $98 million. The primary drivers for the remaining difference between the effective tax rate for the three and nine months ended March 31, 2017 and the U.S. Federal statutory rate of 35% are these discrete items, the current year generation of tax credits and tax holidays in Malaysia, Philippines, Singapore and Thailand that expire at various dates during fiscal years 2018 through 2030.



During the nine months ended March 30, 2018, the Company recorded a net decrease of $17 million in its liability for unrecognized tax benefits (excluding accrued interest and penalties). As of March 30, 2018, the Company’s liability for unrecognized tax benefits (excluding accrued interest and penalties) was approximately $505 million. Accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as of March 30, 2018 was approximately $105 million.



The Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) previously completed its field examination of the Company’s federal income tax returns for fiscal years 2006 through 2009 and proposed certain adjustments. The Company received Revenue Agent Reports from the IRS that seek to increase the Company’s U.S. taxable income, which would result in additional federal tax expense totaling $795 million, subject to interest. The issues in dispute relate primarily to transfer pricing with the Company’s foreign subsidiaries and intercompany payable balances. The Company disagrees with the proposed adjustments and in September 2015, filed a protest with the IRS Appeals Office and received the IRS rebuttal in July 2016. Meetings with the IRS Appeals Office began in March 2017. The Company believes that its tax positions are properly supported and will vigorously contest the position taken by the IRS. In September 2015, the IRS commenced an examination of the Company’s fiscal years 2010 through 2012.



The Company believes that adequate provision has been made for any adjustments that may result from tax examinations. However, the outcome of tax examinations cannot be predicted with certainty. If any issues addressed in the Company’s tax examinations are resolved in a manner not consistent with management’s expectations, the Company could be required to adjust its provision for income taxes in the period such resolution occurs. As of March 30, 2018, it was not possible to estimate the amount of change, if any, in the unrecognized tax benefits that is reasonably possible within the next twelve months. Any significant change in the amount of the Company’s liability for unrecognized tax benefits would most likely result from additional information or settlements relating to the examination of the Company’s tax returns.

Intellectual Property Litigation



In May 2016, Lambeth Magnetic Structures, LLC (“Lambeth”) filed a complaint with the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Pennsylvania against WD and certain of its subsidiaries alleging infringement of U.S. Patent No. 7,128,988. The complaint seeks unspecified monetary damages and injunctive relief. The ’988 patent, entitled “Magnetic Material Structures, Devices and Methods,” allegedly relates to a magnetic material structure for hard disk drive devices. The Company intends to defend itself vigorously in this matter.



Antitrust



In July 2010, Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd. (“Samsung”) filed an action against Panasonic Corporation (“Panasonic”) and SD-3C LLC (“SD-3C”) with the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California, alleging that the defendants violated federal antitrust laws and California antitrust and unfair competition laws relating to the licensing practices and operations of SD-3C. The complaint seeks damages, restitution, injunctive and declaratory relief, and fees and costs. SanDisk is not a defendant in this case, but it established SD-3C along with Panasonic and Toshiba Corporation (“Toshiba”), and the complaint includes various factual allegations concerning SanDisk. As a member of SD-3C, SanDisk could be responsible for a portion of any monetary award. Other requested relief, if granted, could result in a loss of revenue to SanDisk. In November 2015, the defendants filed a motion to dismiss. In September 2016, the District Court stayed the litigation pending the outcome of an ongoing arbitration between Samsung and Toshiba. The District Court denied the motion to dismiss without prejudice to refiling after the stay is lifted. The arbitration between Samsung and Toshiba was concluded in May 2017. In October 2017, the District Court issued an order directing Samsung and Toshiba to seek clarification from the arbitration panel regarding certain aspects of its decision. In April 2018, Samsung voluntarily dismissed its case against Panasonic and SD-3C with prejudice.



In March 2011, a complaint was filed against SanDisk, SD-3C, Panasonic, Panasonic Corporation of North America, Toshiba and Toshiba America Electronic Components, Inc. with the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California. The lawsuit purports to be on behalf of a nationwide class of indirect purchasers of SD cards. The complaint asserts claims under federal antitrust laws and California antitrust and unfair competition laws, as well as common law claims. The complaint seeks damages, restitution, injunctive relief, and fees and costs. The plaintiffs allege that the defendants conspired to artificially inflate the royalty costs associated with manufacturing SD cards, which in turn allegedly caused the plaintiffs to pay higher prices for SD cards. The allegations are similar to and incorporate allegations in Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd. v. Panasonic Corp., et al., described above. In November 2015, the defendants filed a motion to dismiss the plaintiffs’ federal law claims. In October 2016, the District Court granted the defendants’ motion with leave to amend and the defendants filed a motion to dismiss the plaintiffs’ remaining claims. Discovery is presently stayed until after completion of the pleading stage. The Company intends to defend itself vigorously in this matter.

Securities



Beginning in March 2015, SanDisk and two of its officers, Sanjay Mehrotra and Judy Bruner, were named in three putative class action lawsuits filed with the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California. Two complaints are brought on behalf of a purported class of purchasers of SanDisk’s securities between October 2014 and March 2015, and one is brought on behalf of a purported class of purchasers of SanDisk’s securities between April 2014 and April 2015. The complaints generally allege violations of federal securities laws arising out of alleged misstatements or omissions by the defendants during the alleged class periods. The complaints seek, among other things, damages and fees and costs. In July 2015, the District Court consolidated the cases and appointed Union Asset Management Holding AG and KBC Asset Management NV as lead plaintiffs. The lead plaintiffs filed an amended complaint in August 2015. In January 2016, the District Court granted the defendants’ motion to dismiss and dismissed the amended complaint with leave to amend. In February 2016, the District Court issued an order appointing as new lead plaintiffs Bristol Pension Fund; City of Milford, Connecticut Pension & Retirement Board; Pavers and Road Builders Pension, Annuity and Welfare Funds; the Newport News Employees’ Retirement Fund; and Massachusetts Laborers’ Pension Fund (collectively, the “Institutional Investor Group”). In March 2016, the Institutional Investor Group filed an amended complaint. In June 2016, the District Court granted the defendants’ motion to dismiss and dismissed the amended complaint with leave to amend. In July 2016, the Institutional Investor Group filed a further amended complaint. In June 2017, the District Court denied the defendants’ motion to dismiss. The Company intends to defend itself vigorously in this matter.



Copyright



In December 2011, the German Central Organization for Private Copying Rights (Zentralstelle für private Überspielungsrechte) (“ZPÜ”), an organization consisting of several copyright collecting societies, instituted arbitration proceedings against WD’s German subsidiary (“WD Germany”) before the Copyright Arbitration Board (“CAB”) claiming copyright levies for multimedia hard drives, external hard drives and network hard drives sold or introduced into commerce in Germany by WD Germany from January 2008 through December 2010. In February 2013, WD Germany filed a declaratory relief action against ZPÜ in the Higher Regional Court of Munich (the “Higher Court”), seeking an order from the Higher Court to determine the copyright levy issue. In May 2013, ZPÜ filed a counter-claim against WD Germany with the Higher Court, seeking copyright levies for multimedia hard drives, external hard drives and network hard drives sold or introduced into commerce from January 2008 through December 2010 based on tariffs published by ZPÜ in November 2011. In January 2015, the Higher Court ruled in favor of ZPÜ. In its ruling, the Higher Court declared that WD Germany must pay certain levies on certain products that it sold in Germany between January 2008 and December 2010. The judgment specified levy amounts on certain products sold from January 2008 through December 2010 and directed WD Germany to disclose applicable sales data to ZPÜ. The exact amount of the judgment had not been determined. ZPÜ and WD Germany filed appeals with the German Federal Court of Justice in February 2015. In March 2017, the German Federal Court of Justice rendered a judgment affirming ZPÜ’s claim concerning the disclosure of WD Germany’s sales data regarding HDDs sold between January 2008 and December 2010. The German Federal Court of Justice also set aside the Higher Court’s decision on the levy amounts and referred the case back to the Higher Court for further fact finding and decision on the levy amounts. The Company intends to defend itself vigorously in this matter.



In December 2014, ZPÜ submitted a pleading to the CAB seeking copyright levies for multimedia hard drives, external hard drives and network hard drives sold or introduced into commerce in Germany by WD Germany between January 2012 and December 2013. The Company intends to defend itself vigorously in this matter.



The Company has recorded an accrual for German copyright levies in an amount that is not material to the Company’s financial position, results of operations or cash flows; however, it is reasonably possible that the Company could incur losses totaling up to $189 million, inclusive of amounts accrued, if it does not prevail in this matter. 



Other Matters



In the normal course of business, the Company is subject to other legal proceedings, lawsuits and other claims. Although the ultimate aggregate amount of probable monetary liability or financial impact with respect to these other matters is subject to many uncertainties, management believes that any monetary liability or financial impact to the Company from these other matters, individually and in the aggregate, would not be material to the Company’s financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. However, any monetary liability and financial impact to the Company from these other matters could differ materially from the Company’s expectations.
