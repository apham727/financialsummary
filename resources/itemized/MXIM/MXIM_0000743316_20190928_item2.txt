ITEM 2: UNREGISTERED SALES OF EQUITY SECURITIES AND USE OF PROCEEDS

On October 30, 2018, the Board of Directors of the Company authorized the repurchase of up to $1.5 billion of the Company’s common stock.
This stock repurchase authorization does not have an expiration date and the pace of repurchase activity will depend on factors such as current stock price, levels of cash generation from operations, cash requirements, and other factors.
The Company’s prior repurchase authorization was cancelled and superseded by this new repurchase authorization.
In the three months ended September 28, 2019, the Company repurchased approximately 1.6 million shares of its common stock for approximately $93.6 million.
As of September 28, 2019, the Company had remaining authorization of $1.0 billion for future share repurchases.
The number of shares to be repurchased and the timing of such repurchases will be based on several factors, including the price of the Company’s common stock and general market and business conditions.
