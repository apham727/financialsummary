ITEM 2.
MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
Maxim Integrated Products, Inc. (“Maxim Integrated” or the “Company” and also referred to as “we,” “our” or “us”) disclaims any duty to and undertakes no obligation to update any forward-looking statement, whether as a result of new information relating to existing conditions, future events or otherwise or to release publicly the results of any future revisions it may make to forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances after the date hereof or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events, except as required by federal securities laws.
Readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on such statements, which speak only as of the date of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.
Readers should carefully review future reports and documents that the Company files with or furnishes to the SEC from time to time, such as its Annual Reports on Form 10-K, its Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, and any Current Reports on Form 8-K.
Overview of Business
Maxim Integrated is incorporated in the state of Delaware.
Maxim Integrated designs, develops, manufactures and markets a broad range of linear and mixed-signal integrated circuits, commonly referred to as analog circuits, for a large number of geographically diverse customers.
We also provide a range of high-frequency process technologies and capabilities that can be used in custom designs.
The analog market is fragmented and characterized by many diverse applications, a great number of product variations and, with respect to many circuit types, relatively long product life cycles.
We are a global company with a wafer manufacturing facility in the U.S., testing facilities in the Philippines and Thailand, and sales and circuit design offices around the world.
We also utilize third party foundries for manufacturing of our products.
The major end-markets in which our products are sold are the Automotive, Communications and Data Center, Computing, Consumer and Industrial markets.
CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES
The methods, estimates, and judgments we use in applying our most critical accounting policies have a significant impact on the results we report in our financial statements.
The Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) has defined the most critical accounting policies as the ones that are most important to the presentation of our financial condition and results of operations, and that require us to make our most difficult and subjective accounting judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates of matters that are inherently uncertain.
Based on this definition, our most critical accounting policies include revenue recognition, which impacts the recording of net revenues; valuation of inventories, which impacts costs of goods sold and gross margins; the assessment of recoverability of long-lived assets, which impacts impairment of long-lived assets; assessment of recoverability of intangible assets and goodwill, which impacts impairment of goodwill and intangible assets; accounting for income taxes, which impacts the income tax provision; and assessment of litigation and contingencies, which impacts charges recorded in cost of goods sold, selling, general and administrative expenses and income taxes.
These policies and the estimates and judgments involved are discussed further in the Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2018.
We have other significant accounting policies that either do not generally require estimates and judgments that are as difficult or subjective, or it is less likely that such accounting policies would have a material impact on our reported results of operations for a given period.
Except for the accounting policies and estimates outlined under Part I, Item 1.
Financial Statements - Note 2, there have been no material changes during the nine months ended March 30, 2019 to the items that we disclosed as our critical accounting policies and estimates in Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2018.
RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
Net Revenues
Net revenues were $542.4 million and $648.6 million for the three months ended March 30, 2019 and March 31, 2018, respectively.
Revenue from consumer products was down by 27%, mainly due to lower shipments in cell phone and home entertainment products, partially offset by higher shipments in wearable products.
Revenue from industrial products was down by 18%, mainly due to a decline in shipments of control, automation and automatic test equipment products.
Revenue from communications and data center products was down by 22%, due to generally lower shipments of server, network and data center products.
These declines were partially offset by an increase in revenue from automotive products.
Revenue from automotive products was up by 5%, driven by higher demand for battery management systems and driver assistance content.
Net revenues were $1.8 billion for both the nine months ended March 30, 2019 and March 31, 2018.
Revenue from automotive products was up by 7%, driven by higher demand for battery management systems and driver assistance content.
Revenue from communications and data center products was down by 12% due to generally lower shipments of network, server, and data center products.
Revenue from industrial products was down by 7%, driven by lower demand for control, automation, security and other industrial products, partially offset by higher demand for USB extension products.
Revenue from consumer products was down by 6%, driven by lower demand for cell phone and home entertainment products, partially offset by higher demand for wearable
and handheld computing products.
The decrease in revenues in these markets was partially driven by the 13-week second quarter of fiscal year 2019, compared to the 14-week second quarter of fiscal year 2018.
In addition, there was a one-time incremental $22.0 million of revenue recognized as a result of the sell-in accounting revenue transition during the second quarter of fiscal 2018.
During both the three months ended March 30, 2019 and March 31, 2018, approximately 88% of net revenues, were derived from customers outside of the United States.
While less than 1.0% of our sales are denominated in currencies other than U.S. dollars, we enter into foreign currency forward contracts to mitigate our risks on firm commitments and net monetary assets denominated in foreign currencies.
The impact of changes in foreign exchange rates on our revenue and results of operations for the three months ended March 30, 2019 and March 31, 2018 was immaterial.
Gross Margin
Our gross margin percentages were 62.8% and 65.4% for the three months ended March 30, 2019 and March 31, 2018, respectively.
Our gross margin decreased by 2.6 percentage points, primarily due to higher inventory reserves.
Our gross margin percentages were 65.1% and 65.4% for the nine months ended March 30, 2019 and March 31, 2018, respectively.
Our gross margin decreased by 0.3 percentage points, primarily due to higher inventory reserves.
Research and Development
Research and development expenses were $107.1 million and $114.4 million for the three months ended March 30, 2019 and March 31, 2018, respectively, which represented 19.7% and 17.6% of net revenues for each respective period.
The $7.3 million decrease was due to lower salaries and related personnel expenses.
Research and development expenses were $330.1 million and $338.9 million for the nine months ended March 30, 2019 and March 31, 2018, respectively, which represented 18.8% and 18.3% of net revenues for each respective period.
The $8.8 million decrease was due to lower salaries and related personnel expenses.
Selling, General and Administrative
Selling, general and administrative expenses were $74.1 million and $81.3 million for the three months ended March 30, 2019 and March 31, 2018, respectively, which represented 13.7% and 12.5% of net revenues for each respective period.
The $7.2 million decrease was due to lower salaries and related personnel expenses.
Selling, general and administrative expenses were $233.5 million and $240.3 million for the nine months ended March 30, 2019 and March 31, 2018, respectively, which represented 13.3% and 13.0% of net revenues for each respective period.
The $6.8 million decrease was due to lower salaries and related personnel expenses.
Severance and Restructuring Expenses
Severance and restructuring expenses were $1.7 million and $2.3 million for the three months ended March 30, 2019 and March 31, 2018, respectively, which represented 0.3% and 0.4% of net revenues for each respective period.
The $0.5 million decrease was primarily due to a decrease in restructuring activities.
Severance and restructuring expenses were $3.9 million and $14.2 million for the nine months ended March 30, 2019 and March 31, 2018, respectively, which represented 0.2% and 0.8% of net revenues for each respective period.
The $10.3 million decrease was primarily due to a decrease in restructuring activities.
Provision for Income Taxes
In the three and nine months ended March 30, 2019, the Company recorded an income tax provision of $29.8 million and $116.8 million, respectively, compared to $28.7 million and $328.0 million for the three and nine months ended March 31, 2018, respectively.
The Company’s effective tax rate for the three and nine months ended March 30, 2019 was 18.6% and 20.3%, respectively, compared to 12.9% and 54.6% for the three and nine months ended March 31, 2018, respectively.
On December 22, 2017 legislation, commonly referred to as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the “Act”), was enacted.
The Act included a one-time tax on accumulated unremitted earnings of our foreign subsidiaries (“Transition Tax”).
SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin
No.
118 allowed the use of provisional amounts (reasonable estimates) if accounting for the income tax effects of the Act was not completed.
Provisional amounts must be adjusted within a one-year measurement period from the enactment date of the Act.
In the second quarter of fiscal year 2018, the Company recorded a discrete $236.9 million provisional Transition Tax charge.
During the measurement period the Company gathered information and analyzed available guidance to more precisely compute the amount of the Transition Tax.
In the second quarter of fiscal year 2019 the Company completed this work and recorded a discrete $22.1 million measurement period adjustment for the Transition Tax, which increased the Company’s effective tax rate for the nine months ended March 30, 2019 by 3.8%.
As of the end of the second quarter of fiscal year 2019 accounting for the income tax effects of the Act were completed.
The Act reduced the federal statutory tax rate from 35% to 21%, effective January 1, 2018, which resulted in a fiscal year 2018 federal statutory tax rate of 28.1% for the Company (average of a 35% rate for the first half of fiscal year 2018 and a 21% rate for the second half of fiscal year 2018).
The Company’s federal statutory tax rate for fiscal year 2019 is 21%.
In the second quarter of fiscal year 2018 the Company recorded a $13.7 million discrete charge to remeasure deferred tax assets and liabilities as of the enactment date of the Act to reflect the federal statutory tax rate reductions.
The Act included Global Intangible Low-Taxed Income (“GILTI”) provisions, which first impact the Company in fiscal year 2019.
The GILTI provisions effectively subject income earned by the Company’s foreign subsidiaries to current U.S. tax at a rate of 10.5%, less foreign tax credits.
The Company has elected to treat tax generated by the GILTI provisions as a period expense.
The Company’s federal statutory tax rate for fiscal year 2019 is 21%.
The Company’s effective tax rate for the three months ended March 30, 2019 was lower than the statutory rate primarily due to earnings of foreign subsidiaries, generated primarily by the Company's international operations managed in Ireland, that were taxed at lower rates, partially offset by tax generated by the GILTI provisions, a $4.1 million discrete charge for differences between our fiscal year 2018 tax returns and the tax provision originally recorded, and $5.7 million of discrete interest accruals for unrecognized tax benefits.
The Company’s effective tax rate for the nine months ended March 30, 2019 was lower than the statutory rate primarily due to earnings of foreign subsidiaries, generated primarily by the Company's international operations managed in Ireland, that were taxed at lower rates, partially offset by $21.0 million of discrete charges for the Transition Tax , tax generated by GILTI provisions, $15.1 million of discrete interest accruals for unrecognized tax benefits, and $4.8 million of discrete charges for differences between our fiscal year 2018 tax returns and the tax provision originally recorded.
The Company’s federal statutory tax rate for fiscal year 2018 was 28.1%.
The Company’s effective tax rate for the three months ended March 31, 2018 was lower than the statutory rate primarily due to earnings of foreign subsidiaries, generated primarily by the Company's international operations managed in Ireland, that were taxed at lower rates, and $4.6 million of discrete excess tax benefits generated by the settlement of share-based awards, partially offset by $5.1 million of discrete interest accruals for unrecognized tax benefits.
The Company’s effective tax rate for the nine months ended March 31, 2018 was higher than the statutory rate primarily due to a $236.9 million discrete provisional charge for the Transition Tax, a $13.7 million discrete charge to remeasure deferred taxes as of the enactment date of the Act, and $13.1 million of discrete interest accruals for unrecognized tax benefits, partially offset by earnings of foreign subsidiaries, generated primarily by the Company's international operations managed in Ireland, that were taxed at lower rates and $8.3 million of discrete excess tax benefits generated by the settlement of share-based awards.
BACKLOG
As of March 30, 2019 and June 30, 2018, our current quarter backlog was approximately $398.8 million and $441.1 million, respectively.
In backlog, we include orders with customer request dates within the next three months.
As is customary in the semiconductor industry, these orders may be canceled in most cases without penalty to customers.
Accordingly, we believe that our backlog is not a reliable measure of future revenues.
All backlog numbers have been adjusted for estimated future distribution ship and debit pricing adjustments.
FINANCIAL CONDITION, LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES
Financial Condition
Operating activities
Cash provided by operating activities is net income adjusted for certain non-cash items and changes in certain assets and liabilities.
Cash provided by operating activities was $638.4 million in the nine months ended March 30, 2019, a decrease of $34.4 million compared with the nine months ended March 31, 2018.
This decrease was due to changes in working capital and adjustments for non-cash items, partially offset by higher net income.
Investing activities
Investing cash flows consist primarily of net investment purchases and maturities, and capital expenditures.
Cash provided by investing activities was $785.4 million for the nine months ended March 30, 2019, compared with cash used in investing activities of $708.8 million for the nine months ended March 31, 2018, a change of $1.5 billion.
The change was due to lower purchases of and higher proceeds from maturity of available-for-sale securities.
Financing activities
Financing cash flows consist primarily of debt issuance, repurchases of common stock, and payment of dividends to stockholders.
Net cash used in financing activities increased by approximately $732.2 million for the nine months ended March 30, 2019 compared to the nine months ended March 31, 2018.
The increase was due to the repayment of the November 2018 Notes and repurchases of our common stock.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
As of March 30, 2019, our available funds consisted of $1.9 billion in cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments.
We anticipate that the available funds and cash generated from operations will be sufficient to meet cash and working capital requirements, including the anticipated level of capital expenditures, common stock repurchases, debt repayments and dividend payments for at least the next twelve months.
In November 2018, the Company repaid $500.0 million of principal and related outstanding interest of the Company's 2.5% coupon notes.
In January 2019, the Company terminated its $350.0 million revolving credit facility with certain institutional lenders.
On October 30, 2018, we were authorized to repurchase up to $1.5 billion of the Company's common stock.
During the three and nine months ended March 30, 2019, we repurchased an aggregate of $117.0 million and $437.0 million, respectively, of the Company's common stock.
During the three and nine months ended March 30, 2019, we paid cash dividends of $0.46 and $1.38 per common share totaling $125.6 million and $380.2 million, respectively.
Off-Balance-Sheet Arrangements
As of March 30, 2019, we did not have any material off-balance-sheet arrangements, as defined in Item 303(a)(4)(ii) of SEC Regulation S-K.
ITEM 2: UNREGISTERED SALES OF EQUITY SECURITIES AND USE OF PROCEEDS
On July 20, 2017, the Board of Directors of the Company authorized the repurchase of up to $1.0 billion of the Company's common stock.
The stock repurchase authorization did not have an expiration date and the pace of repurchase activity depended on factors such as current stock price, levels of cash generation from operations, cash requirements, and other factors.
The Company's prior repurchase authorization was cancelled and superseded by this repurchase authorization.
On October 30, 2018, the Board of Directors of the Company authorized the repurchase of up to $1.5 billion of the Company’s common stock.
This stock repurchase authorization does not have an expiration date and the pace of repurchase activity will depend on factors such as current stock price, levels of cash generation from operations, cash requirements, and other factors.
The Company’s prior repurchase authorization was cancelled and superseded by this new repurchase authorization.
In the fiscal quarter ended March 30, 2019, the Company repurchased approximately 2.2 million shares of its common stock for approximately $117.0 million.
As of March 30, 2019, the Company had remaining authorization of $1.2 billion for future share repurchases.
The number of shares to be repurchased and the timing of such repurchases will be based on several factors, including the price of the Company’s common stock and general market and business conditions.
