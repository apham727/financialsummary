CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICES
Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations is based upon our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (“U.S.”) and the rules and regulations of the SEC for interim financial reporting.
The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, and expenses, and the related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities.
We base our estimates and judgments on historical experience, knowledge of current conditions, and expectations of what could occur in the future given available information.

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
Revenue
Our license revenue is derived from sales of our applications and Pega Platform.
Our cloud revenue is derived from our hosted Pega Platform and software applications.
We expect our revenue mix to continue to shift in favor of our subscription offerings, particularly cloud arrangements, which could result in slower total revenue growth in the near term.
Revenue from cloud arrangements is generally recognized over the service period, while revenue from term and perpetual license arrangements is generally recognized upfront when the license rights become effective.
Subscription revenue
The increases in cloud revenue in the three and six months ended June 30, 2019 reflect the shift in client preferences to cloud arrangements from other types of arrangements.
The decreases in term license revenue in the three and six months ended June 30, 2019 were due to revenue recognized from several large, multi-year term license contracts in the three and six months ended June 30, 2018 and reflect the shift in client preferences in favor of our cloud offerings.
The decreases are also attributable to revenue recognized from term license contracts in the six months ended June 30, 2019 with multi-year committed maintenance periods, which resulted in a greater portion of the contract value being allocated to maintenance.
The increases in maintenance revenue in the three and six months ended June 30, 2019 were primarily due to the continued growth in the aggregate value of the installed base of our software and strong renewal rates in excess of 90%.
Perpetual license
The increase in perpetual license revenue in the three months ended June 30, 2019 was primarily due to revenue recognized from a large perpetual license contract in the second quarter of 2019.
The decrease in perpetual license revenue in the six months ended June 30, 2019 reflects the shift in client preferences in favor of our cloud offerings instead of our perpetual license arrangements.
Consulting
Our consulting revenue fluctuates depending upon the mix of new implementation projects we perform as compared to those performed by our enabled clients or led by our partners.
The decreases in consulting revenue in the three and six months ended June 30, 2019 were primarily due to a decrease in billable hours.
Gross profit
The recent shift in our revenue mix toward cloud arrangements has resulted in slower total gross profit growth as our cloud business continues to grow and scale.
Revenue from cloud arrangements is generally recognized over the service period, while revenue from term and perpetual license arrangements is generally recognized upfront when the license rights become effective.
The increase in total gross profit in the three months ended June 30, 2019 was primarily due to an increase in cloud revenue reflecting the shift in client preferences to cloud arrangements from other types of arrangements, and an increase in maintenance revenue due to the continued growth in the aggregate value of the installed base of our software and strong renewal rates in excess of 90%.
The decrease in total gross profit in the six months ended June 30, 2019 was primarily due to a decrease in term and perpetual license revenue reflecting the shift in client preferences toward our cloud offerings and a decrease in consulting revenue due to a decrease in billable hours.
The increase in total gross profit percent in the three months ended June 30, 2019 was driven by an increase in higher margin maintenance revenue.
The decrease in total gross profit percent in the six months ended June 30, 2019 was driven by the shift in client preferences in favor of cloud arrangements, which are lower margin than our term and perpetual license revenue streams.
The decreases in cloud gross profit percent in the three and six months ended June 30, 2019 were driven by an increase in costs as we accelerated our investments in cloud infrastructure and service delivery to support future growth.
The decrease in consulting gross profit percent in the six months ended June 30, 2019 was driven by a decrease in billable hours as consulting resources were transitioning to new projects after completing a large project and an increase in consulting resource availability as we continue growing and leveraging our partner network.
Operating expenses
Selling and marketing
The increases in the three and six months ended June 30, 2019 were primarily due to increases in compensation and benefits of $17.7 million and $35.4 million, attributable to increased headcount, equity compensation, and increases of $2.1 million and $6.6 million in deferred contract cost amortization.
The increase in headcount reflects our efforts to increase our sales capacity to deepen relationships with existing clients and target new accounts.
Research and development
The increases in the three and six months ended June 30, 2019 were primarily due to increases in compensation and benefits of $4.6 million and $6.7 million, attributable to an increase in headcount and equity compensation, and increases of $1.7 million and $3.3 million in cloud hosting expenses as we expand our cloud-focused research and development activities.
General and administrative
The increase in the three months ended June 30, 2019 was primarily due to an increase in compensation and benefits of $1.7 million, due to increased headcount.
Stock-based compensation
The increases in the three and six months ended June 30, 2019 were primarily due to the increased value of our annual periodic equity awards granted in March 2019 and 2018.
These awards generally have a five-year vesting schedule.
Other income (expense), net
The changes in foreign currency transaction gain (loss) were primarily due to the impact of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates associated with our foreign currency denominated cash, accounts receivable, and intercompany receivables and payables held by our United Kingdom (“U.K.”) subsidiary.
The inclusion of excess tax benefits from stock-based compensation in the provision for income taxes has increased the variability of the effective tax rates in recent periods.
This fluctuation may continue in future periods, as the amount of excess tax benefits from stock-based compensation awards varies depending on our future stock price in relation to the fair value of awards, the timing of RSU vestings, the exercise behavior of our stock option holders, and the total value of future grants of stock-based compensation awards.
During the six months ended June 30, 2019, the Company’s effective income tax rate changed primarily due to the Global Intangible Low-Taxed Income (“GILTI”) and Foreign Derived Intangible Income (“FDII”) provisions of the Tax Reform Act.
The Company’s effective income tax rate was also affected by excess tax benefits from stock-based compensation, an increase in U.S. research and development tax credits, and a decrease in uncertain tax positions as a result of the lapse of the statute of limitations on certain foreign reserves.
LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES
We believe that our current cash, cash equivalents, marketable securities, and cash flow from operations will be sufficient to fund our operations, quarterly cash dividends, and stock repurchases for at least the next 12 months.
If it became necessary to repatriate foreign funds, we may be required to pay U.S. state and local taxes, as well as foreign taxes, upon repatriation.
Due to the complexity of income tax laws and regulations, and the effects of the Tax Reform Act, it is impracticable to estimate the amount of taxes we would have to pay.
Cash provided by operating activities
As client preferences continue to shift in favor of cloud arrangements, we could continue to experience slower operating cash flow growth in the near term.
Cash from cloud arrangements is generally collected over an average service period of three years, while cash from perpetual license arrangements is generally collected upfront, shortly after the license rights become effective.
The primary driver of the decrease in the six months ended June 30, 2019 was the recent shift in our revenue mix toward cloud arrangements, which are generally collected over an average service period of three years, and increased costs as the Company accelerated investments in its cloud offerings and selling and marketing activities to support future growth.
Cash provided by (used in) investing activities
The change in cash provided by (used in) investing activities was primarily driven by the timing of investment maturities and sales, purchases of new investments, and the payment of consideration for the acquisition of In the Chat Communications Inc. in May 2019.
Cash (used in) financing activities
We primarily used cash in financing activities for repurchases of our common stock under our publicly announced stock repurchase programs, stock repurchases for tax withholdings for the net settlement of our equity awards, and the payment of our quarterly dividend.
Stock repurchase program (1)
Common stock repurchases
Dividends
It is our current intention to pay a quarterly cash dividend of $0.03 per share, however, the Board of Directors may terminate or modify the dividend program at any time without prior notice.
