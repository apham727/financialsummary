 ITEM 3.
QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK
Market risk represents the risk of loss from adverse changes in financial market prices and rates.
Our market risk exposure is primarily related to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates.
See Item 7A.
Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk and Item 1A.
Risk FactorsWe are exposed to fluctuations in currency exchange rates that could negatively impact our financial results and cash flows included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2017 for a more complete discussion of our market risk exposure.
Foreign currency exposure
Translation risk
Our international sales are usually denominated in foreign currencies.
However, the operating expenses of our foreign operations are also primarily denominated in foreign currencies, which partially offset our foreign currency exposure.
Remeasurement risk
We have experienced and expect to continue to experience fluctuations in our results of operations as a result of transaction gains or losses related to remeasuring monetary assets and liabilities that are denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the entities in which they are recorded.
We are primarily exposed to changes in foreign currency exchange rates associated with Australian dollar, Euro, and U.S. dollar denominated cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, unbilled receivables, and intercompany receivables and payables held by our U.K. subsidiary, a British pound functional entity.

A hypothetical 10% strengthening in the British pound exchange rate in comparison to the Australian dollar, Euro, and U.S. dollar would result in an incremental foreign currency transaction loss of $8 million and $6 million, at September 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017.
