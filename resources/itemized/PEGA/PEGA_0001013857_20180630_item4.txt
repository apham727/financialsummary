 ITEM 4.
CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES
Our management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer (CEO) and Chief Financial Officer (CFO) evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (Exchange Act)) as of June 30, 2018.
In designing and evaluating our disclosure controls and procedures, our management recognized that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives, and our management necessarily applied its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures.
Based on this evaluation, our CEO and CFO concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of June 30, 2018.
