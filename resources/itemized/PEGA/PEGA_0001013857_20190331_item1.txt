1. BASIS OF PRESENTATION



Pegasystems Inc. (together with its subsidiaries, “the Company”) has prepared the accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements pursuant to the rules and regulations of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) regarding interim financial reporting. Accordingly, they do not include all the information and footnotes required by accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“U.S.”) for complete financial statements and should be read in conjunction with the Company’s audited financial statements included in the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018.



In the opinion of management, the Company has prepared the accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements on the same basis as its audited financial statements, and these financial statements include all adjustments, consisting only of normal recurring adjustments, necessary for a fair presentation of the results of the interim periods presented. 



The operating results for the interim periods presented are not necessarily indicative of the results expected for the full year 2019.



2. NEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS



Financial instruments 



In June 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2016-13, “Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments,” which requires measurement and recognition of expected credit losses for financial assets measured at amortized cost, including accounts receivable, upon initial recognition of that financial asset using a forward-looking expected loss model, rather than an incurred loss model. Credit losses relating to available-for-sale debt securities should be recorded through an allowance for credit losses when the fair value is below the amortized cost of the asset, removing the concept of “other-than-temporary” impairments. The effective date for the Company will be January 1, 2020, with early adoption permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the effect this ASU will have on its consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.



Leases



On January 1, 2019, the Company adopted Accounting Standards Codifications 842 “Leases” (“ASC 842”) using the modified retrospective method, reflecting any cumulative effect as an adjustment to equity. Results for reporting periods beginning on or after January 1, 2019 are presented under ASC 842, while prior period amounts were not adjusted and continue to be reported in accordance with the Company’s historic accounting under ASC 840 “Leases”. 





See Note 9. “Leases” for additional information.









As of March 31, 2019, the Company did not hold any investments with unrealized losses that are considered to be other-than-temporary. 



As of March 31, 2019, maturities of marketable securities ranged from April 2019 to August 2022, with a weighted-average remaining maturity of approximately 1.4 years.

4. RECEIVABLES, CONTRACT ASSETS, AND DEFERRED REVENUE



Receivables





Unbilled receivables are client committed amounts for which revenue recognition precedes billing, and billing is solely subject to the passage of time.



As of March 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018, the allowance for doubtful accounts was not material.







Contract assets and deferred revenue







Contract assets are amounts under client contracts where revenue recognized exceeds the amount billed to the client and the right to payment is subject to conditions other than the passage of time, such as the completion of a related performance obligation. Deferred revenue consists of billings and payments received in advance of revenue recognition. Contract assets and deferred revenue are netted at the contract level for each reporting period. 



The change in deferred revenue in the three months ended March 31, 2019 was primarily due to $89.4 million of revenue recognized, excluding the impact of netting contract assets and deferred revenue at the contract level, during the period that was included in deferred revenue at December 31, 2018, partially offset by new billings in advance of revenue recognition.



5. DEFERRED CONTRACT COSTS



The Company recognizes an asset for the incremental costs of obtaining a client contract, which primarily relate to sales commissions, if the Company expects to benefit from those costs for more than one year. Deferred costs are amortized on a straight-line basis over the benefit period, which is on average 5 years.

8. FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS 



Assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis



The Company records its cash equivalents, marketable securities, and investments in privately-held companies at fair value on a recurring basis. Fair value is an exit price, representing the amount that would be received from the sale of an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants based on assumptions that market participants would use in pricing an asset or liability. 





PEGASYSTEMS INC.



NOTES TO UNAUDITED CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)





•Level 1 - observable inputs such as quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities; 



•Level 2 - significant other inputs that are observable either directly or indirectly; and 



•Level 3 - significant unobservable inputs on which there is little or no market data, which require the Company to develop its own assumptions. This hierarchy requires the Company to use observable market data, when available, and to minimize the use of unobservable inputs when determining fair value.



The Company’s cash equivalents are composed of money market funds and time deposits, which are classified within Level 1 and Level 2, respectively, in the fair value hierarchy. The Company’s marketable securities, which are classified within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy are valued based on a market approach using quoted prices, when available, or matrix pricing compiled by third party pricing vendors, using observable market inputs such as interest rates, yield curves, and credit risk. The Company’s investments in privately-held companies are classified within Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy.



If applicable, the Company will recognize transfers into and out of levels within the fair value hierarchy at the end of the reporting period in which the actual event or change in circumstance occurs. There were no transfers between levels during the three months ended March 31, 2019.













For certain other financial instruments, including accounts receivable and accounts payable, the carrying value approximates fair value due to the relatively short maturity of these items.





The Company’s leases are primarily for office space used in the ordinary course of business. 



Accounting policy



All the Company’s leases are operating leases. The Company accounts for a contract as a lease when it has the right to control the asset for a period of time while obtaining substantially all of the asset’s economic benefits. The Company determines the initial classification and measurement of its operating right of use assets and lease liabilities at the lease commencement date and thereafter if modified. Fixed lease costs are recognized on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease. Variable lease costs are recognized in the period in which the obligation for those payments is incurred. The Company combines lease and non-lease components in the determination of lease costs for its office space leases. The lease liability includes lease payments related to options to extend or renew the lease term, if the Company is reasonably certain it will exercise those options. The Company’s leases do not contain any material residual value guarantees or restrictive covenants.

Remaining performance obligations









The above amounts include contracts that have an original expected duration of one year or less. 





Expense





The Company recognizes stock-based compensation using the accelerated recognition method, treating each vesting tranche as if it were an individual grant. As of March 31, 2019, the Company had $114.1 million of unrecognized stock-based compensation expense, net of estimated forfeitures, related to all unvested restricted stock units (“RSUs”) and stock options. These amounts are expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 2.3 years.



Grants







RSU vestings and stock option exercises



During the three months ended March 31, 2019, 0.5 million shares of common stock were issued due to stock option exercises and RSU vestings under the Company’s stock-based compensation plans.

Effective income tax rate





During the three months ended March 31, 2019, the Company’s effective income tax rate changed primarily due to the Global Intangible Low-Taxed Income (“GILTI”) and Base Erosion and Anti-Abuse Tax (“BEAT”) provisions of the Tax Reform Act. The Company’s effective income tax rate was also affected by excess tax benefits from stock-based compensation, an increase in U.S. research and development tax credits, and a decrease in uncertain tax positions as a result of the lapse of the statute of limitations on certain foreign reserves. 



13. EARNINGS PER SHARE



Basic earnings per share is computed using the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during the applicable period. Diluted earnings per share is computed using the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during the applicable period, plus the dilutive effect of outstanding stock options and RSUs, using the treasury stock method. In periods of loss, all stock options and RSUs are excluded, as their inclusion would be anti-dilutive.









ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS



We encourage you to carefully consider the risk factors identified in Item 1A. “Risk Factors” of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018. These risk factors could materially affect our business, financial condition, and future results and could cause our actual business and financial results to differ materially from those contained in forward-looking statements made in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q or elsewhere by management from time to time.



There have been no material changes during the three months ended March 31, 2019 to the risk factors disclosed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018.
