OVERVIEW
Microsoft is a technology company whose mission is to empower every person and every organization on the planet to achieve more.
We strive to create local opportunity, growth, and impact in every country around the world.
Our strategy is to build best-in-class platforms and productivity services for an intelligent cloud and an intelligent edge infused with artificial intelligence (“AI”).
We develop, license, and support a wide range of software products, services, and devices that deliver new opportunities, greater convenience, and enhanced value to people’s lives.
Our platforms and tools help drive small business productivity, large business competitiveness, and public-sector efficiency.
They also support new startups, improve educational and health outcomes, and empower human ingenuity.
We generate revenue by licensing and supporting an array of software products, by offering a wide range of cloud-based and other services to consumers and businesses, by designing, manufacturing, and selling devices that integrate with our cloud-based services, and by delivering relevant online advertising to a global audience.
Our most significant expenses are related to compensating employees; designing, manufacturing, marketing, and selling our products and services; datacenter costs in support of our cloud-based services; and income taxes.

On December 22, 2017, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (“TCJA”) was enacted into law, which significantly changes existing U.S. tax law and includes numerous provisions that affect our business.
During the second quarter of fiscal year 2018, we recorded a net charge of $13.8 billion related to the TCJA.
Refer to Note 12 – Income Taxes of the Notes to Financial Statements (Part I, Item 1 of this Form 10-Q) for further discussion.
We adopted the new accounting standards for revenue recognition and leases effective July 1, 2017.
These new standards had a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.
Beginning in fiscal year 2018, our financial results reflect adoption of the standards with prior periods restated accordingly.
Refer to Note 1 – Accounting Policies of the Notes to Financial Statements (Part I, Item 1 of this Form 10-Q) for further discussion.
On December 8, 2016, we completed our acquisition of LinkedIn Corporation for a total purchase price of $27.0 billion.
LinkedIn has been included in our consolidated results of operations since the date of acquisition.
Refer to Note 8 – Business Combinations of the Notes to Financial Statements (Part I, Item 1 of this Form 10-Q) for further discussion.
Industry Trends
Our industry is dynamic and highly competitive, with frequent changes in both technologies and business models.
Each industry shift is an opportunity to conceive new products, new technologies, or new ideas that can further transform the industry and our business.
At Microsoft, we push the boundaries of what is possible through a broad range of research and development activities that seek to identify and address the changing demands of customers and users, industry trends, and competitive forces.
Economic Conditions, Challenges, and Risks
The markets for software, devices, and cloud-based services are dynamic and highly competitive.
Our competitors are developing new software and devices, while also deploying competing cloud-based services for consumers and businesses.
The devices and form factors customers prefer evolve rapidly, and influence how users access services in the cloud, and in some cases, the user’s choice of which suite of cloud-based services to use.
We must continue to evolve and adapt over an extended time in pace with this changing environment.
The investments we are making in infrastructure and devices will continue to increase our operating costs and may decrease our operating margins.
Our success is highly dependent on our ability to attract and retain qualified employees.
We hire a mix of university and industry talent worldwide.
We compete for talented individuals globally by offering an exceptional working environment, broad customer reach, scale in resources, the ability to grow one’s career across many different products and businesses, and competitive compensation and benefits.
Aggregate demand for our software, services, and devices is correlated to global macroeconomic and geopolitical factors, which remain dynamic.
Our international operations provide a significant portion of our total revenue and expenses.
Many of these revenue and expenses are denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar.
As a result, changes in foreign exchange rates may significantly affect revenue and expenses.
Strengthening of the U.S. dollar relative to certain foreign currencies throughout fiscal year 2017 negatively impacted reported revenue and reduced reported expenses from our international operations.
This trend has reversed in fiscal year 2018.
Strengthening of foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar positively impacted reported revenue and increased reported expenses from our international operations.
Refer to Risk Factors (Part II, Item 1A of this Form 10-Q) for a discussion of these factors and other risks.
PART I
Item 2
Seasonality
We expect our revenue to fluctuate quarterly and to be higher in the second and fourth quarters of our fiscal year.
Second quarter revenue is driven by corporate year-end spending trends in our major markets and holiday season spending by consumers, and fourth quarter revenue is driven by the volume of multi-year on-premises contracts executed during the period.
Reportable Segments
Additional information on our reportable segments is contained in Note 19 – Segment Information and Geographic Data of the Notes to Financial Statements (Part I, Item 1 of this Form 10-Q).

INCOME TAXES
Effective Tax Rate
Our effective tax rate was 14% and 23% for the three months ended March 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively, and 70% and 21% for the nine months ended March 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively.
The decrease in our effective tax rate for the current quarter compared to the prior year was primarily due to the reduction of the U.S. federal statutory tax rate as a result of the TCJA.
The increase in our effective tax rate for the year-to-date compared to the prior year was primarily due to the net charge related to the enactment of the TCJA in the second quarter of fiscal year 2018.
Our effective tax rate for the three months ended March 31, 2018 was lower than the U.S. federal statutory rate, primarily due to earnings taxed at lower rates in foreign jurisdictions resulting from producing and distributing our products and services through our foreign regional operations centers in Ireland, Singapore, and Puerto Rico.
Our effective tax rate for the nine months ended March 31, 2018 was higher than the U.S. federal statutory rate, primarily due to the net charge related to the enactment of the TCJA in the second quarter of fiscal year 2018.
PART I
Item 2
Recent Tax Legislation
On December 22, 2017, the TCJA was enacted into law, which significantly changes existing U.S. tax law and includes numerous provisions that affect our business, such as imposing a one-time transition tax on deemed repatriation of deferred foreign income, reducing the U.S. federal statutory tax rate, and adopting a territorial tax system.
The TCJA required us to incur a one-time transition tax on deferred foreign income not previously subject to U.S. income tax at a rate of 15.5% for foreign cash and certain other net current assets, and 8% on the remaining income.
The TCJA also reduced the U.S. federal statutory tax rate from 35% to 21% effective January 1, 2018.
For fiscal year 2018, our blended U.S. federal statutory tax rate is 28%.
This is the result of using the tax rate of 35% for the first and second quarter of fiscal year 2018 and the reduced tax rate of 21% for the third and fourth quarter of fiscal year 2018.
The TCJA includes a provision to tax global intangible low-taxed income (“GILTI”) of foreign subsidiaries and a base erosion anti-abuse tax (“BEAT”) measure that taxes certain payments between a U.S. corporation and its subsidiaries.
The GILTI and BEAT provisions of the TCJA will be effective for us beginning July 1, 2018.
The TCJA was effective in the second quarter of fiscal year 2018.
As of March 31, 2018, we have not completed our accounting for the tax effects of the TCJA.
During the second quarter of fiscal year 2018, we recorded a provisional net charge based on reasonable estimates for those tax effects.
We have not recorded any adjustments to our provisional net charge in the third quarter of fiscal year 2018.
Due to the timing of the enactment and the complexity in applying the provisions of the TCJA, the provisional net charge is subject to revisions as we continue to complete our analysis of the TCJA, collect and prepare necessary data, and interpret any additional guidance issued by the U.S. Treasury Department, Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”), FASB, and other standard-setting and regulatory bodies.
Adjustments may materially impact our provision for income taxes and effective tax rate in the period in which the adjustments are made.
Our accounting for the tax effects of the TCJA will be completed during the measurement period, which should not extend beyond one year from the enactment date.
During the second quarter of fiscal year 2018, we recorded an estimated net charge of $13.8 billion related to the TCJA, due to the impact of the one-time transition tax on the deemed repatriation of deferred foreign income of $17.8 billion, offset in part by the impact of changes in the tax rate of $4.0 billion, primarily on deferred tax assets and liabilities.
Uncertain Tax Positions
While we settled a portion of the IRS audit for tax years 2004 to 2006 during the third quarter of fiscal year 2011, and a portion of the IRS audit for tax years 2007 to 2009 during the first quarter of fiscal year 2016, we remain under audit for those years.
In the second quarter of fiscal year 2018, we settled a portion of the IRS audit for tax years 2010 to 2013.
We continue to be subject to examination by the IRS for tax years 2010 to 2016.
In February 2012, the IRS withdrew its 2011 Revenue Agents Report for tax years 2004 to 2006 and reopened the audit phase of the examination.
As of March 31, 2018, the primary unresolved issue relates to transfer pricing, which could have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements if not resolved favorably.
We believe our allowances for income tax contingencies are adequate.
We have not received a proposed assessment for the unresolved issues and do not expect a final resolution of these issues in the next 12 months.
Based on the information currently available, we do not anticipate a significant increase or decrease to our tax contingencies for these issues within the next 12 months.
We are subject to income tax in many jurisdictions outside the U.S. Our operations in certain jurisdictions remain subject to examination for tax years 1996 to 2017, some of which are currently under audit by local tax authorities.
The resolutions of these audits are not expected to be material to our consolidated financial statements.
Tax contingencies and other income tax liabilities were $14.5 billion and $13.5 billion as of March 31, 2018 and June 30, 2017, respectively, and are included in long-term income taxes on our consolidated balance sheets.
This increase relates primarily to current period intercompany transfer pricing.
NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES
Adjusted net income and diluted earnings per share are non-GAAP financial measures which exclude the net charge related to the TCJA.
We believe these non-GAAP measures aid investors by providing additional insight into our operational performance and help clarify trends affecting our business.
For comparability of reporting, management considers non-GAAP measures in conjunction with GAAP financial results in evaluating business performance.
These non-GAAP financial measures presented should not be considered a substitute for, or superior to, the measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP.
PART I
Item 2
FINANCIAL CONDITION
Cash, Cash Equivalents, and Investments
Cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments totaled $132.3 billion and $133.0 billion as of March 31, 2018 and June 30, 2017, respectively.
Equity and other investments were $2.8 billion and $6.0 billion as of March 31, 2018 and June 30, 2017, respectively.
Our short-term investments are primarily intended to facilitate liquidity and capital preservation.
They consist predominantly of highly liquid investment-grade fixed-income securities, diversified among industries and individual issuers.
The investments are predominantly U.S. dollar-denominated securities, but also include foreign currency-denominated securities to diversify risk.
Our fixed-income investments are exposed to interest rate risk and credit risk.
The credit risk and average maturity of our fixed-income portfolio are managed to achieve economic returns that correlate to certain fixed-income indices.
The settlement risk related to these investments is insignificant given that the short-term investments held are primarily highly liquid investment-grade fixed-income securities.
As a result of the TCJA, our cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments held by foreign subsidiaries are no longer subject to U.S. tax on repatriation into the U.S.
Securities Lending
Valuation
In general, and where applicable, we use quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities to determine the fair value of our financial instruments.
This pricing methodology applies to our Level 1 investments, such as U.S. government securities, domestic and international equities, and mutual funds.
If quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities are not available to determine fair value, then we use quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities or inputs other than the quoted prices that are observable either directly or indirectly.
This pricing methodology applies to our Level 2 investments such as corporate notes and bonds, foreign government bonds, commercial paper, mortgage- and asset-backed securities, and certificates of deposit.
Level 3 investments are valued using internally developed models with unobservable inputs.
Assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis using unobservable inputs are an immaterial portion of our portfolio.
PART I
Item 2
A majority of our investments are priced by pricing vendors and are generally Level 1 or Level 2 investments as these vendors either provide a quoted market price in an active market or use observable inputs for their pricing without applying significant adjustments.
Broker pricing is used mainly when a quoted price is not available, the investment is not priced by our pricing vendors, or when a broker price is more reflective of fair values in the market in which the investment trades.
Our broker-priced investments are generally classified as Level 2 investments because the broker prices these investments based on similar assets without applying significant adjustments.
In addition, all our broker-priced investments have a sufficient level of trading volume to demonstrate that the fair values used are appropriate for these investments.
Our fair value processes include controls that are designed to ensure appropriate fair values are recorded.
These controls include model validation, review of key model inputs, analysis of period-over-period fluctuations, and independent recalculation of prices where appropriate.

Cash from operations increased $4.0 billion to $32.5 billion for the nine months ended March 31, 2018, mainly due to an increase in cash received from customers, offset in part by an increase in cash paid to employees, net cash paid for income taxes, cash paid for interest on debt, and cash paid to suppliers.
Cash used in financing was $27.6 billion for the nine months ended March 31, 2018, compared to cash from financing of $11.1 billion for the nine months ended March 31, 2017.
The change was mainly due to a $39.1 billion decrease in proceeds from issuance of debt, net of repayments, offset in part by a $1.7 billion decrease in cash used for common stock repurchases.
Cash used in investing decreased $36.0 billion to $3.4 billion for the nine months ended March 31, 2018, mainly due to a $25.1 billion decrease in cash used for acquisitions of companies, net of cash acquired, and purchases of intangible and other assets, and a $12.7 billion increase in cash from net investment purchases, sales, and maturities.
Debt
We issued debt to take advantage of favorable pricing and liquidity in the debt markets, reflecting our credit rating and the low interest rate environment.
The proceeds of these issuances were or will be used for general corporate purposes, which may include, among other things, funding for working capital, capital expenditures, repurchases of capital stock, acquisitions, and repayment of existing debt.
Refer to Note 11 – Debt of the Notes to Financial Statements (Part I, Item 1 of this Form 10-Q) for further discussion.
Unearned Revenue
Unearned revenue comprises mainly unearned revenue related to volume licensing programs and includes Software Assurance (“SA”) and cloud services.
Unearned revenue is generally billed upfront at the beginning of each annual coverage period for multi-year agreements and recognized ratably over the coverage period.
Unearned revenue also includes payments for other offerings for which we have been paid in advance and earn the revenue when we transfer control of the product or service.
Refer to Note 1 – Accounting Policies of the Notes to Financial Statements (Part I, Item 1 of this Form 10-Q) for further discussion.
If our customers choose to license cloud-based versions of our products and services rather than licensing transaction-based products and services, the associated revenue will shift from being recognized at the time of the transaction to being recognized over the subscription period or upon consumption, as applicable.
PART I
Item 2
Share Repurchases
For the nine months ended March 31, 2018, we repurchased 78 million shares of our common stock for $6.5 billion through our share repurchase programs.
All repurchases were made using cash resources.
Refer to Note 17 – Stockholders’ Equity of the Notes to Financial Statements (Part I, Item 1 of this Form 10-Q) for further discussion.
Dividends
Refer to Note 17 – Stockholders’ Equity of the Notes to Financial Statements (Part I, Item 1 of this Form 10-Q) for further discussion.
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
We provide indemnifications of varying scope and size to certain customers against claims of intellectual property infringement made by third parties arising from the use of our products and certain other matters.
Additionally, we have agreed to cover damages resulting from breaches of certain security and privacy commitments in our cloud business.
In evaluating estimated losses on these obligations, we consider factors such as the degree of probability of an unfavorable outcome and our ability to make a reasonable estimate of the amount of loss.
These obligations did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements during the periods presented.
Other Planned Uses of Capital
We will continue to invest in sales, marketing, product support infrastructure, and existing and advanced areas of technology, as well as continue making acquisitions that align with our business strategy.
Additions to property and equipment will continue, including new facilities, datacenters, and computer systems for research and development, sales and marketing, support, and administrative staff.
We expect capital expenditures to increase in coming years to support growth in our cloud offerings.
We have operating and finance leases for datacenters, corporate offices, research and development facilities, retail stores, and certain equipment.
We have not engaged in any related party transactions or arrangements with unconsolidated entities or other persons that are reasonably likely to materially affect liquidity or the availability of capital resources.
Liquidity
As a result of the TCJA, we are required to pay a one-time transition tax of $17.8 billion on deferred foreign income not previously subject to U.S. income tax.
Under the TCJA, the transition tax is payable beginning in fiscal year 2019 interest-free over eight years, with 8% due in each of the first five years, 15% in year six, 20% in year seven, and 25% in year eight.
We expect existing cash, cash equivalents, short-term investments, cash flows from operations, and access to capital markets to continue to be sufficient to fund our operating activities and cash commitments for investing and financing activities, such as dividends, share repurchases, debt maturities, material capital expenditures, and the transition tax related to the TCJA, for at least the next 12 months and thereafter for the foreseeable future.
RECENT ACCOUNTING GUIDANCE
Refer to Note 1 – Accounting Policies of the Notes to Financial Statements (Part I, Item 1 of this Form 10-Q) for further discussion.
APPLICATION OF CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES
Our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes are prepared in accordance with GAAP.
Preparing consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, and expenses.
These estimates and assumptions are affected by management’s application of accounting policies.
Critical accounting policies for us include revenue recognition, impairment of investment securities, goodwill, research and development costs, contingencies, income taxes, and inventories.
PART I
Item 2
Revenue Recognition
Our contracts with customers often include promises to transfer multiple products and services to a customer.
Determining whether products and services are considered distinct performance obligations that should be accounted for separately versus together may require significant judgment.
When a cloud-based service includes both on-premises software licenses and cloud services, judgment is required to determine whether the software license is considered distinct and accounted for separately, or not distinct and accounted for together with the cloud service and recognized over time.
Certain cloud services, primarily Office 365, depend on a significant level of integration, interdependency, and interrelation between the desktop applications and cloud services, and are accounted for together as one performance obligation.
Revenue from Office 365 is recognized ratably over the period in which the cloud services are provided.
Judgment is required to determine the stand-alone selling price (“SSP") for each distinct performance obligation.
We use a single amount to estimate SSP for items that are not sold separately, including on-premises licenses sold with SA or software updates provided at no additional charge.
We use a range of amounts to estimate SSP when we sell each of the products and services separately and need to determine whether there is a discount to be allocated based on the relative SSP of the various products and services.
In instances where SSP is not directly observable, such as when we do not sell the product or service separately, we determine the SSP using information that may include market conditions and other observable inputs.
We typically have more than one SSP for individual products and services due to the stratification of those products and services by customers and circumstances.
In these instances, we may use information such as the size of the customer and geographic region in determining the SSP.
Due to the various benefits from and the nature of our SA program, judgment is required to assess the pattern of delivery, including the exercise pattern of certain benefits across our portfolio of customers.
Our products are generally sold with a right of return and we may provide other credits or incentives, which are accounted for as variable consideration when estimating the amount of revenue to recognize.
The new standard related to revenue recognition had a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.
Refer to Note 1 – Accounting Policies of the Notes to Financial Statements (Part I, Item 1 of this Form 10-Q) for further discussion.
Impairment of Investment Securities
Goodwill
We allocate goodwill to reporting units based on the reporting unit expected to benefit from the business combination.
We evaluate our reporting units on an annual basis and, if necessary, reassign goodwill using a relative fair value allocation approach.
Goodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level (operating segment or one level below an operating segment) on an annual basis (May 1 for us) and between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value.
These events or circumstances could include a significant change in the business climate, legal factors, operating performance indicators, competition, or sale or disposition of a significant portion of a reporting unit.
PART I
Item 2
Application of the goodwill impairment test requires judgment, including the identification of reporting units, assignment of assets and liabilities to reporting units, assignment of goodwill to reporting units, and determination of the fair value of each reporting unit.
The fair value of each reporting unit is estimated primarily through the use of a discounted cash flow methodology.
This analysis requires significant judgments, including estimation of future cash flows, which is dependent on internal forecasts, estimation of the long-term rate of growth for our business, estimation of the useful life over which cash flows will occur, and determination of our weighted average cost of capital.
The estimates used to calculate the fair value of a reporting unit change from year to year based on operating results, market conditions, and other factors.
Changes in these estimates and assumptions could materially affect the determination of fair value and goodwill impairment for each reporting unit.
Research and Development Costs
Costs incurred internally in researching and developing a computer software product are charged to expense until technological feasibility has been established for the product.
Once technological feasibility is established, all software costs are capitalized until the product is available for general release to customers.
Judgment is required in determining when technological feasibility of a product is established.
We have determined that technological feasibility for our software products is reached after all high-risk development issues have been resolved through coding and testing.
Generally, this occurs shortly before the products are released to production.
The amortization of these costs is included in cost of revenue over the estimated life of the products.
Legal and Other Contingencies
The outcomes of legal proceedings and claims brought against us are subject to significant uncertainty.
An estimated loss from a loss contingency such as a legal proceeding or claim is accrued by a charge to income if it is probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated.
In determining whether a loss should be accrued we evaluate, among other factors, the degree of probability of an unfavorable outcome and the ability to make a reasonable estimate of the amount of loss.
Changes in these factors could materially impact our consolidated financial statements.
Income Taxes
The objectives of accounting for income taxes are to recognize the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current year, and deferred tax liabilities and assets for the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in an entity’s financial statements or tax returns.
We recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position.
The tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such a position are measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement.
Accounting literature also provides guidance on derecognition of income tax assets and liabilities, classification of deferred income tax assets and liabilities, accounting for interest and penalties associated with tax positions, and income tax disclosures.
Judgment is required in assessing the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized on our consolidated financial statements or tax returns.
Variations in the actual outcome of these future tax consequences could materially impact our consolidated financial statements.
The TCJA significantly changes existing U.S. tax law and includes numerous provisions that affect our business.
Refer to Note 12 – Income Taxes of the Notes to Financial Statements (Part I, Item 1 of this Form 10-Q) for further discussion.
Inventories
Inventories are stated at average cost, subject to the lower of cost or market.
Cost includes materials, labor, and manufacturing overhead related to the purchase and production of inventories.
We regularly review inventory quantities on hand, future purchase commitments with our suppliers, and the estimated utility of our inventory.
These reviews include analysis of demand forecasts, product life cycle status, product development plans, current sales levels, pricing strategy, and component cost trends.
If our review indicates a reduction in utility below carrying value, we reduce our inventory to a new cost basis through a charge to cost of revenue.
