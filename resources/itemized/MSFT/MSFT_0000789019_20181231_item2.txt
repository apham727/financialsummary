Refer to Note 7 – Business Combinations of the Notes to Financial Statements (Part I, Item 1 of this Form 10-Q) for further discussion.
On December 22, 2017, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (“TCJA”) was enacted into law, which significantly changed existing U.S. tax law and includes numerous provisions that affect our business.
We recorded a provisional net charge of $13.8 billion in the second quarter of fiscal year 2018, and $13.7 billion in fiscal year 2018, related to the TCJA.
We adjusted our provisional net charge by recording additional tax expense of $157 million in the second quarter of fiscal year 2019.
Refer to Note 11 – Income Taxes of the Notes to Financial Statements (Part I, Item 1 of this Form 10-Q) for further discussion.
Industry Trends
Our industry is dynamic and highly competitive, with frequent changes in both technologies and business models.
Each industry shift is an opportunity to conceive new products, new technologies, or new ideas that can further transform the industry and our business.
At Microsoft, we push the boundaries of what is possible through a broad range of research and development activities that seek to identify and address the changing demands of customers and users, industry trends, and competitive forces.
Economic Conditions, Challenges, and Risks
The markets for software, devices, and cloud-based services are dynamic and highly competitive.
Our competitors are developing new software and devices, while also deploying competing cloud-based services for consumers and businesses.
The devices and form factors customers prefer evolve rapidly, and influence how users access services in the cloud, and in some cases, the user’s choice of which suite of cloud-based services to use.
We must continue to evolve and adapt over an extended time in pace with this changing environment.
The investments we are making in infrastructure and devices will continue to increase our operating costs and may decrease our operating margins.
Our success is highly dependent on our ability to attract and retain qualified employees.
We hire a mix of university and industry talent worldwide.
We compete for talented individuals globally by offering an exceptional working environment, broad customer reach, scale in resources, the ability to grow one’s career across many different products and businesses, and competitive compensation and benefits.
Aggregate demand for our software, services, and devices is correlated to global macroeconomic and geopolitical factors, which remain dynamic.
Our international operations provide a significant portion of our total revenue and expenses.
Many of these revenue and expenses are denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar.
As a result, changes in foreign exchange rates may significantly affect revenue and expenses.
Strengthening of foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar throughout fiscal year 2018 positively impacted reported revenue and increased reported expenses from our international operations.
Strengthening of the U.S. dollar relative to certain foreign currencies in the first and second quarters of fiscal year 2019 has not significantly impacted reported revenue or expenses from our international operations.
Refer to Risk Factors (Part II, Item 1A of this Form 10-Q) for a discussion of these factors and other risks.
Seasonality
Our revenue fluctuates quarterly and is generally higher in the second and fourth quarters of our fiscal year.
Second quarter revenue is driven by corporate year-end spending trends in our major markets and holiday season spending by consumers, and fourth quarter revenue is driven by the volume of multi-year on-premises contracts executed during the period.

INCOME TAXES
Effective Tax Rate
Our effective tax rate was 19% and 169% for the three months ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively, and 16% and 98% for the six months ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively.
The decrease in our effective tax rate for the three and six months ended December 31, 2018 compared to the prior year was primarily due to the net charge related to the enactment of the TCJA in the second quarter of fiscal year 2018.
Our effective tax rate for the three and six months ended December 31, 2018 was lower than the U.S. federal statutory rate, primarily due to earnings taxed at lower rates in foreign jurisdictions resulting from producing and distributing our products and services through our foreign regional operations centers in Ireland, Singapore, and Puerto Rico, and tax benefits relating to stock-based compensation.
Recent Tax Legislation
On December 22, 2017, the TCJA was enacted into law, which significantly changed existing U.S. tax law and included numerous provisions that affect our business, such as imposing a one-time transition tax on deemed repatriation of deferred foreign income, reducing the U.S. federal statutory tax rate, and adopting a territorial tax system.
In fiscal year 2018, the TCJA required us to incur a transition tax on deferred foreign income not previously subject to U.S. income tax at a rate of 15.5% for foreign cash and certain other net current assets, and 8% on the remaining income.
The TCJA also reduced the U.S. federal statutory tax rate from 35% to 21% effective January 1, 2018.
The TCJA included a provision to tax global intangible low-taxed income (“GILTI”) of foreign subsidiaries and a base erosion anti-abuse tax (“BEAT”) measure that taxes certain payments between a U.S. corporation and its foreign subsidiaries.
The GILTI and BEAT provisions of the TCJA were effective for us beginning July 1, 2018.
The TCJA was effective in the second quarter of fiscal year 2018.
We recorded a provisional net charge of $13.8 billion in the second quarter of fiscal year 2018, and $13.7 billion for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2018, related to the TCJA.
We adjusted our provisional net charge by recording additional tax expense of $157 million in the second quarter of fiscal year 2019 related to GILTI deferred taxes pursuant to SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin No.

Refer to Note 11 – Income Taxes of the Notes to Financial Statements (Part I, Item 1 of this Form 10-Q) for further discussion.
Uncertain Tax Positions
While we settled a portion of the Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) audit for tax years 2004 to 2006 in the third quarter of fiscal year 2011, a portion of the IRS audit for tax years 2007 to 2009 in the first quarter of fiscal year 2016, and a portion of the IRS audit for tax years 2010 to 2013 in the second quarter of fiscal year 2018, we remain under audit for those years.
We continue to be subject to examination by the IRS for tax years 2014 to 2017.
In February 2012, the IRS withdrew its 2011 Revenue Agents Report for tax years 2004 to 2006 and reopened the audit phase of the examination.
As of December 31, 2018, the primary unresolved issues for this and other open IRS audits are related to transfer pricing.
While we believe our allowances for income tax contingencies related to the unresolved issues are adequate, the final resolution of these issues, if unfavorable, could have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.
We have not received a proposed assessment for the unresolved issues and do not expect a final resolution of these issues in the next 12 months.
Based on the information currently available, we do not anticipate a significant increase or decrease to our tax contingencies for these issues within the next 12 months.
We are subject to income tax in many jurisdictions outside the U.S. Our operations in certain jurisdictions remain subject to examination for tax years 1996 to 2018, some of which are currently under audit by local tax authorities.
The resolution of each of these audits is not expected to be material to our consolidated financial statements.
NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES
Non-GAAP net income and diluted earnings per share are non-GAAP financial measures which exclude the net charge related to the TCJA.
We believe these non-GAAP measures aid investors by providing additional insight into our operational performance and help clarify trends affecting our business.
For comparability of reporting, management considers non-GAAP measures in conjunction with GAAP financial results in evaluating business performance.
These non-GAAP financial measures presented should not be considered a substitute for, or superior to, the measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP.

FINANCIAL CONDITION
Cash, Cash Equivalents, and Investments
Cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments totaled $127.7 billion and $133.8 billion as of December 31, 2018 and June 30, 2018, respectively.
Equity investments were $2.3 billion and $1.9 billion as of December 31, 2018 and June 30, 2018, respectively.
Our short-term investments are primarily intended to facilitate liquidity and capital preservation.
They consist predominantly of highly liquid investment-grade fixed-income securities, diversified among industries and individual issuers.
The investments are predominantly U.S. dollar-denominated securities, but also include foreign currency-denominated securities to diversify risk.
Our fixed-income investments are exposed to interest rate risk and credit risk.
The credit risk and average maturity of our fixed-income portfolio are managed to achieve economic returns that correlate to certain fixed-income indices.
The settlement risk related to these investments is insignificant given that the short-term investments held are primarily highly liquid investment-grade fixed-income securities.
Valuation
In general, and where applicable, we use quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities to determine the fair value of our financial instruments.
This pricing methodology applies to our Level 1 investments, such as U.S. government securities, common and preferred stock, and mutual funds.
If quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities are not available to determine fair value, then we use quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities or inputs other than the quoted prices that are observable either directly or indirectly.
This pricing methodology applies to our Level 2 investments, such as commercial paper, certificates of deposit, U.S. agency securities, foreign government bonds, mortgage- and asset-backed securities, corporate notes and bonds, and municipal securities.
Level 3 investments are valued using internally developed models with unobservable inputs.
Assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis using unobservable inputs are an immaterial portion of our portfolio.
A majority of our investments are priced by pricing vendors and are generally Level 1 or Level 2 investments as these vendors either provide a quoted market price in an active market or use observable inputs for their pricing without applying significant adjustments.
Broker pricing is used mainly when a quoted price is not available, the investment is not priced by our pricing vendors, or when a broker price is more reflective of fair values in the market in which the investment trades.
Our broker-priced investments are generally classified as Level 2 investments because the broker prices these investments based on similar assets without applying significant adjustments.
In addition, all our broker-priced investments have a sufficient level of trading volume to demonstrate that the fair values used are appropriate for these investments.
Our fair value processes include controls that are designed to ensure appropriate fair values are recorded.
These controls include model validation, review of key model inputs, analysis of period-over-period fluctuations, and independent recalculation of prices where appropriate.
PART I
Item 2
Cash Flows
Cash from operations increased $2.2 billion to $22.6 billion for the six months ended December 31, 2018, mainly due to an increase in cash received from customers, offset in part by an increase in cash paid to suppliers and employees, and cash paid for income taxes.
Cash used in financing increased $12.7 billion to $20.6 billion for the six months ended December 31, 2018, mainly due to a $5.7 billion decrease in proceeds from issuances of debt, net of repayments, and a $5.6 billion increase in common stock repurchases.
Cash used in investing decreased $82 million to $7.2 billion for the six months ended December 31, 2018, mainly due to a $4.2 billion decrease in net investment purchases, sales, and maturities, offset in part by a $2.6 billion increase in additions to property and equipment and a $1.6 billion increase in cash used for acquisitions of companies, net of cash acquired, and purchases of intangible and other assets.
Debt
We issued debt to take advantage of favorable pricing and liquidity in the debt markets, reflecting our credit rating and the low interest rate environment.
The proceeds of these issuances were or will be used for general corporate purposes, which may include, among other things, funding for working capital, capital expenditures, repurchases of capital stock, acquisitions, and repayment of existing debt.
Refer to Note 10 – Debt of the Notes to Financial Statements (Part I, Item 1 of this Form 10-Q) for further discussion.
Unearned Revenue
Unearned revenue comprises mainly unearned revenue related to volume licensing programs and includes Software Assurance (“SA”) and cloud services.
Unearned revenue is generally billed upfront at the beginning of each annual coverage period for multi-year agreements and recognized ratably over the coverage period.
Unearned revenue also includes payments for other offerings for which we have been paid in advance and earn the revenue when we transfer control of the product or service.
If our customers choose to license cloud-based versions of our products and services rather than licensing transaction-based products and services, the associated revenue will shift from being recognized at the time of the transaction to being recognized over the subscription period or upon consumption, as applicable.
Share Repurchases
For the six months ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, we repurchased 81 million shares and 44 million shares of our common stock for $8.7 billion and $3.4 billion, respectively, through our share repurchase programs.
All repurchases were made using cash resources.
Refer to Note 15 – Stockholders’ Equity of the Notes to Financial Statements (Part I, Item 1 of this Form 10-Q) for further discussion.
Dividends
Refer to Note 15 – Stockholders’ Equity of the Notes to Financial Statements (Part I, Item 1 of this Form 10-Q) for further discussion.
PART I
Item 2
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
We provide indemnifications of varying scope and size to certain customers against claims of intellectual property infringement made by third parties arising from the use of our products and certain other matters.
Additionally, we have agreed to cover damages resulting from breaches of certain security and privacy commitments in our cloud business.
In evaluating estimated losses on these obligations, we consider factors such as the degree of probability of an unfavorable outcome and our ability to make a reasonable estimate of the amount of loss.
These obligations did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements during the periods presented.
Other Planned Uses of Capital
We will continue to invest in sales, marketing, product support infrastructure, and existing and advanced areas of technology, as well as continue making acquisitions that align with our business strategy.
Additions to property and equipment will continue, including new facilities, datacenters, and computer systems for research and development, sales and marketing, support, and administrative staff.
We expect capital expenditures to increase in coming years to support growth in our cloud offerings.
We have operating and finance leases for datacenters, corporate offices, research and development facilities, retail stores, and certain equipment.
We have not engaged in any related party transactions or arrangements with unconsolidated entities or other persons that are reasonably likely to materially affect liquidity or the availability of capital resources.

As a result of the TCJA, we are required to pay a one-time transition tax of $17.9 billion on deferred foreign income not previously subject to U.S. income tax.
We have paid transition tax of approximately $1.8 billion, which included $1.5 billion for the six months ended December 31, 2018.
Under the TCJA, the remaining transition tax of $16.1 billion is payable interest free over the next seven years, with 8% due in each of the next four years, 15% in fiscal year 2024, 20% in fiscal year 2025, and 25% in fiscal year 2026.
We expect existing cash, cash equivalents, short-term investments, cash flows from operations, and access to capital markets to continue to be sufficient to fund our operating activities and cash commitments for investing and financing activities, such as dividends, share repurchases, debt maturities, material capital expenditures, and the transition tax related to the TCJA, for at least the next 12 months and thereafter for the foreseeable future.
RECENT ACCOUNTING GUIDANCE
Refer to Note 1 – Accounting Policies of the Notes to Financial Statements (Part I, Item 1 of this Form 10-Q) for further discussion.
APPLICATION OF CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES
Our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes are prepared in accordance with GAAP.
Preparing consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, and expenses.
These estimates and assumptions are affected by management’s application of accounting policies.
Critical accounting policies for us include revenue recognition, impairment of investment securities, goodwill, research and development costs, contingencies, income taxes, and inventories.
Revenue Recognition
Our contracts with customers often include promises to transfer multiple products and services to a customer.
Determining whether products and services are considered distinct performance obligations that should be accounted for separately versus together may require significant judgment.
When a cloud-based service includes both on-premises software licenses and cloud services, judgment is required to determine whether the software license is considered distinct and accounted for separately, or not distinct and accounted for together with the cloud service and recognized over time.
Certain cloud services, primarily Office 365, depend on a significant level of integration, interdependency, and interrelation between the desktop applications and cloud services, and are accounted for together as one performance obligation.
Revenue from Office 365 is recognized ratably over the period in which the cloud services are provided.
PART I
Item 2
Judgment is required to determine the stand-alone selling price (“SSP") for each distinct performance obligation.
We use a single amount to estimate SSP for items that are not sold separately, including on-premises licenses sold with SA or software updates provided at no additional charge.
We use a range of amounts to estimate SSP when we sell each of the products and services separately and need to determine whether there is a discount to be allocated based on the relative SSP of the various products and services.
In instances where SSP is not directly observable, such as when we do not sell the product or service separately, we determine the SSP using information that may include market conditions and other observable inputs.
We typically have more than one SSP for individual products and services due to the stratification of those products and services by customers and circumstances.
In these instances, we may use information such as the size of the customer and geographic region in determining the SSP.
Due to the various benefits from and the nature of our SA program, judgment is required to assess the pattern of delivery, including the exercise pattern of certain benefits across our portfolio of customers.
Our products are generally sold with a right of return, we may provide other credits or incentives, and in certain instances we estimate customer usage of our products and services, which are accounted for as variable consideration when determining the amount of revenue to recognize.
Returns and credits are estimated at contract inception and updated at the end of each reporting period if additional information becomes available.
Changes to our estimated variable consideration were not material for the periods presented.
Impairment of Investment Securities
Equity investments without readily determinable fair values are written down to fair value if a qualitative assessment indicates that the investment is impaired and the fair value of the investment is less than carrying value.
We perform a qualitative assessment on a quarterly basis.
We are required to estimate the fair value of the investment to determine the amount of the impairment loss.
Once an investment is determined to be impaired, an impairment charge is recorded in other income (expense), net.
Goodwill
We allocate goodwill to reporting units based on the reporting unit expected to benefit from the business combination.
We evaluate our reporting units on an annual basis and, if necessary, reassign goodwill using a relative fair value allocation approach.
Goodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level (operating segment or one level below an operating segment) on an annual basis (May 1 for us) and between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value.
These events or circumstances could include a significant change in the business climate, legal factors, operating performance indicators, competition, or sale or disposition of a significant portion of a reporting unit.
Application of the goodwill impairment test requires judgment, including the identification of reporting units, assignment of assets and liabilities to reporting units, assignment of goodwill to reporting units, and determination of the fair value of each reporting unit.
The fair value of each reporting unit is estimated primarily through the use of a discounted cash flow methodology.
This analysis requires significant judgments, including estimation of future cash flows, which is dependent on internal forecasts, estimation of the long-term rate of growth for our business, estimation of the useful life over which cash flows will occur, and determination of our weighted average cost of capital.
PART I
Item 2
The estimates used to calculate the fair value of a reporting unit change from year to year based on operating results, market conditions, and other factors.
Changes in these estimates and assumptions could materially affect the determination of fair value and goodwill impairment for each reporting unit.
Research and Development Costs
Costs incurred internally in researching and developing a computer software product are charged to expense until technological feasibility has been established for the product.
Once technological feasibility is established, all software costs are capitalized until the product is available for general release to customers.
Judgment is required in determining when technological feasibility of a product is established.
We have determined that technological feasibility for our software products is reached after all high-risk development issues have been resolved through coding and testing.
Generally, this occurs shortly before the products are released to production.
The amortization of these costs is included in cost of revenue over the estimated life of the products.
Legal and Other Contingencies
The outcomes of legal proceedings and claims brought against us are subject to significant uncertainty.
An estimated loss from a loss contingency such as a legal proceeding or claim is accrued by a charge to income if it is probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated.
In determining whether a loss should be accrued we evaluate, among other factors, the degree of probability of an unfavorable outcome and the ability to make a reasonable estimate of the amount of loss.
Changes in these factors could materially impact our consolidated financial statements.
Income Taxes
The objectives of accounting for income taxes are to recognize the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current year, and deferred tax liabilities and assets for the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in an entity’s financial statements or tax returns.
We recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position.
The tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such a position are measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement.
Accounting literature also provides guidance on derecognition of income tax assets and liabilities, classification of deferred income tax assets and liabilities, accounting for interest and penalties associated with tax positions, and income tax disclosures.
Judgment is required in assessing the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized on our consolidated financial statements or tax returns.
Variations in the actual outcome of these future tax consequences could materially impact our consolidated financial statements.
The TCJA significantly changes existing U.S. tax law and includes numerous provisions that affect our business.
Refer to Note 11 – Income Taxes of the Notes to Financial Statements (Part I, Item 1 of this Form 10-Q) for further discussion.
Inventories
Inventories are stated at average cost, subject to the lower of cost or net realizable value.
Cost includes materials, labor, and manufacturing overhead related to the purchase and production of inventories.
Net realizable value is the estimated selling price less estimated costs of completion, disposal, and transportation.
We regularly review inventory quantities on hand, future purchase commitments with our suppliers, and the estimated utility of our inventory.
These reviews include analysis of demand forecasts, product life cycle status, product development plans, current sales levels, pricing strategy, and component cost trends.
If our review indicates a reduction in utility below carrying value, we reduce our inventory to a new cost basis through a charge to cost of revenue.
