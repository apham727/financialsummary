PART II - OTHER INFORMATION



Item 1.  Legal Proceedings



From time to time we are involved in litigation with respect to matters arising from the ordinary conduct of our business, and currently certain claims are pending against us. In the opinion of management, based upon presently available information, either adequate provision for anticipated costs have been accrued or the ultimate anticipated costs will not materially affect our consolidated financial position, results of operations, or cash flows.



Item 1A.  Risk Factors



There have been no significant changes to our risk factors since December 31, 2018.



Item 2.  Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds



On February 7, 2019 the Board of Directors authorized a new stock repurchase program with a maximum dollar limit of $25 million. This program authorizes us to make repurchases of our common stock from time to time on the open market, but does not obligate us to make repurchases, and has no expiration date.
