ITEM 2. UNREGISTERED SALES OF EQUITY SECURITIES AND USE OF PROCEEDS



Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities



Beginning August 2004, our Board of Directors authorized us to repurchase our stock. 



Since the inception of our share repurchase program, we have repurchased an aggregate of 255 million shares under our share repurchase program for a total cost of $6.36 billion through October 28, 2018. All shares delivered from these repurchases have been placed into treasury stock.



In November 2018, the Board authorized an additional $7.00 billion under our share repurchase program and extended it through the end of December 2022. As of November 5, 2018, we were authorized to repurchase additional shares of our common stock up to $7.94 billion through December 2022.



For fiscal year 2019, we previously announced our plan to return $1.25 billion to shareholders. We now intend to return an additional $3.00 billion to shareholders by the end of fiscal year 2020, which may begin in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2019.



The repurchases can be made in the open market, in privately negotiated transactions, or in structured share repurchase programs, and can be made in one or more larger repurchases. The program does not obligate NVIDIA to acquire any particular amount of common stock and the program may be suspended at any time at our discretion.



The following table presents details of our share repurchase transactions during the third quarter of fiscal year 2019:

Transactions Related to our Convertible Notes and Note Hedges



During the third quarter of fiscal year 2019, we issued 485 thousand shares of our common stock upon settlement of $11 million in principal of Convertible Notes submitted for conversion. In connection with these conversions, we exercised a portion of our Note Hedges to acquire an equal number of shares of our common stock. The counterparty to the Note Hedges may be deemed an “affiliated purchaser” and may have purchased the shares of our common stock deliverable to us upon this exercise of our option. Refer to Note 12 of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion regarding the Convertible Notes and the Note Hedges.



Restricted Stock Unit Share Withholding



We also withhold common stock shares associated with net share settlements to cover tax withholding obligations upon the vesting of restricted stock unit awards under our employee equity incentive program. During the third quarter of fiscal year 2019, we withheld approximately 1.7 million shares at a total cost of $467 million through net share settlements. During the first nine months of fiscal year 2019, we withheld approximately 3.8 million shares at a total cost of $982 million through net share settlements. Refer to Note 3 of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion regarding our equity incentive plans.
