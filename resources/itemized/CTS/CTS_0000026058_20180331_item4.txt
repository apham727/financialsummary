Item 4.
Controls and Procedures
Pursuant to Rule 13a-15(e) of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, management, under the direction of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, evaluated our disclosure controls and procedures.
Based on such evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of March 31, 2018.
Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
Beginning January 1, 2018, we adopted ASC 606 "Revenue from Contracts with Customers".
It is expected to have an immaterial impact on our ongoing net income; however, we implemented changes to our processes related to revenue recognition and related internal controls.
These changes included the development of new policies related to the five-step model, training, ongoing contract review requirements, and gathering of information to comply with disclosure requirements.
