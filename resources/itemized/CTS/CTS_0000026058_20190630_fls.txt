In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-13, Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments, which amends the current accounting guidance and requires the measurement of all expected losses based on historical experience, current conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts.
For trade receivables, loans, and other financial instruments, we will be required to use a forward-looking expected loss model rather than the incurred loss model for recognizing credit losses which reflects losses that are probable.
The standard will become effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2019, with early adoption permitted.
Application of the amendments is through a cumulative-effect adjustment to retained earnings as of the effective date.
We plan to adopt this standard on the effective date and are currently evaluating the impact of this new standard on our financial statements.
