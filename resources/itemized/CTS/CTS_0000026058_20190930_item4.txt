Item 4. Controls and Procedures



Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures



Pursuant to Rule 13a-15(e) of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, management, under the direction of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, evaluated our disclosure controls and procedures. Based on such evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of September 30, 2019.



Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting



The acquisition of Quality Thermistor, Inc. ("QTI") on July 31, 2019, represents a material change in internal control over financial reporting since management’s last assessment of our internal control over financial reporting which was completed as of December 31, 2018. The QTI business utilizes separate information and accounting systems and processes. We intend to exclude the operations of QTI from the scope of our Sarbanes-Oxley Section 404 report on internal controls over financial reporting for the year ended December 31, 2019.



There were no other significant changes in the Company’s internal control over financial reporting during the most recent fiscal quarter that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company’s internal control over financial reporting. The process for evaluating controls and procedures is continuous and encompasses constant improvement of the design and effectiveness of established controls and procedures and the remediation of any deficiencies which may be identified during this process.
