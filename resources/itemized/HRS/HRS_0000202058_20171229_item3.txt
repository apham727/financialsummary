Item 3.
Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk.
In the normal course of business, we are exposed to risks associated with foreign currency exchange rates and changes in interest rates.
We employ established policies and procedures governing the use of financial instruments to manage our exposure to such risks.
exchange rates for our foreign currency derivatives held at December 29, 2017 would not have had a material impact on the fair value of such instruments or our results of operations or cash flows.
This quantification of exposure to the market risk associated with foreign currency financial instruments does not take into account the offsetting impact of changes in the fair value of our foreign denominated assets, liabilities and firm commitments.
See Note N â€” Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities in the Notes for additional information.
