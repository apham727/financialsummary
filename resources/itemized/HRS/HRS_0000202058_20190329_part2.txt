PART II.
OTHER INFORMATION
Item 1.
Legal Proceedings.
Merger Litigation.
As described in Note R — Legal Proceedings and Contingencies in the Notes, in connection with our pending merger with L3 (see Note S — Pending Merger in the Notes for additional information), two putative class action lawsuits and one individual lawsuit were filed against the L3 Parties in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York between December 19, 2018 and January 15, 2019, and a third putative class action lawsuit, Kent v. L3 Technologies, Inc., et al., was filed against the L3 Parties and the Harris Parties in the U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware on January 4, 2019.
The complaints in the lawsuits contained substantially similar allegations contending, among other things, that the registration statement on Form S-4 in support of the pending merger misstated or failed to disclose certain allegedly material information in violation of federal securities laws.
The complaint in the Kent lawsuit further alleged that the Harris Parties were liable for these violations as “controlling persons” of L3 within the meaning of federal securities laws.
On March 12, 2019, the parties to the actions entered into an agreement to settle all claims that were or could have been alleged in the action subject to, among other things, the supplementation by L3 of certain disclosures contained in the registration statement, which were reflected in a Current Report on Form 8-K filed by L3 with the SEC on March 13, 2019, and the dismissal of the four lawsuits, all of which were dismissed by March 18, 2019.
Tax Audits.
Our tax filings are subject to audit by taxing authorities in jurisdictions where we conduct or conducted business.
These audits may result in assessments of additional taxes that are subsequently resolved with the authorities or ultimately through legal proceedings.
We believe we have adequately accrued for any ultimate amounts that are likely to result from these audits; however, final assessments, if any, could be different from the amounts recorded in our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited).
Item 1A.
Risk Factors.
Investors should carefully review and consider the information regarding certain factors that could materially affect our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows as set forth under Item 1A.
“Risk Factors” in our Fiscal 2018 Form 10-K.
Except as set forth below in this Item 1A.
“Risk Factors,” we do not believe that there have been any material changes to the risk factors previously disclosed in our Fiscal 2018 Form 10-K. We may disclose changes to such risk factors or disclose additional risk factors from time to time in our future filings with the SEC.
Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently believe not to be material also may adversely impact our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.
•Because the exchange ratio is fixed and will not be adjusted in the event of any change in either our or L3’s stock price, the value of the shares of the combined company is uncertain.
•The market price for shares of common stock of the combined company following the completion of the merger may be affected by factors different from, or in addition to, those that historically have affected or currently affect the market prices of shares of our common stock and L3 common stock.
•The shares of common stock of the combined company to be received by L3 stockholders as a result of the merger will have rights different from the shares of L3 common stock.
•Our stockholders and L3 stockholders will each have reduced ownership and voting interest in and will exercise less influence over management of the combined company.
•Until the completion of the merger or the termination of the merger agreement in accordance with its terms, we and L3 are each prohibited from entering into certain transactions and taking certain actions that might otherwise be beneficial to us or L3 and our respective stockholders.
•Obtaining required approvals and satisfying closing conditions may prevent or delay completion of the merger.
•We and L3 must obtain certain regulatory approvals and clearances to consummate the merger, which, if delayed, not granted or granted with unacceptable conditions, could prevent, substantially delay or impair consummation of the merger, result in additional expenditures of money and resources or reduce the anticipated benefits of the merger.
•Failure to attract, motivate and retain executives and other key employees could diminish the anticipated benefits of the merger.
•The merger, including uncertainty regarding the merger, may cause customers, suppliers or strategic partners to delay or defer decisions concerning us and L3 and adversely affect each company’s ability to effectively manage their respective businesses.
•The opinions rendered to us and L3 from our respective financial advisors will not reflect changes in circumstances between the dates of such opinions and the completion of the merger.
•Whether or not the merger is completed, the announcement and pendency of the merger could cause disruptions in the businesses of us and L3, which could have an adverse effect on our respective businesses and financial results.
•The merger agreement may be terminated in accordance with its terms and the merger may not be consummated.
•The termination of the merger agreement could negatively impact us or L3.
•The directors and executive officers of us and L3 have interests and arrangements that may be different from, or in addition to, those of our and L3 stockholders generally.
•We or L3 may waive one or more of the closing conditions without re-soliciting stockholder approval.
•The merger agreement contains provisions that could discourage a potential competing acquirer that might be willing to pay more to acquire or merge with either us or L3.
•We and L3 each will incur significant transaction, merger-related and restructuring costs in connection with the merger.
•Our stockholders and L3 stockholders will not be entitled to appraisal rights in the merger.
•Litigation filed against the L3 Parties and the Harris Parties could prevent or delay the consummation of the merger or result in the payment of damages following completion of the merger.
•The failure to successfully combine the businesses of us and L3 may adversely affect the combined company’s future results.
•The combined company may not be able to retain customers or suppliers or customers or suppliers may seek to modify contractual obligations with the combined company, which could have an adverse effect on the combined company’s business and operations.
•The combined company may be exposed to increased litigation, which could have an adverse effect on the combined company’s business and operations.
•Combining the businesses of us and L3 may be more difficult, costly or time-consuming than expected and the combined company may fail to realize the anticipated benefits of the merger, which may adversely affect the combined company’s business results and negatively affect the value of the common stock of the combined company following the merger.
•The failure to integrate successfully the businesses and operations of us and L3 in the expected time frame may adversely affect the combined company’s future results.
•Our and L3’s unaudited prospective financial information is inherently subject to uncertainties, the unaudited pro forma financial data included in our Form S-4 registration statement related to the proposed merger is preliminary and the combined company’s actual financial position and results of operations after the merger may differ materially from those estimates and the unaudited pro forma financial data included in such registration statement.
Specifically, the unaudited pro forma combined financial data does not reflect the effect of any divestitures that may be required in connection with the merger.
•The revenue of the combined company will depend on our and L3’s ability to maintain certain levels of government business.
The loss of contracts with U.S. and non-U.S. government agencies could adversely affect the combined company’s revenue.
•Third parties may terminate or alter existing contracts or relationships with us or L3.
•The combined company may be unable to retain our and L3 personnel successfully after the merger is completed.
•The combined company’s debt may limit its financial flexibility.
•Declaration, payment and amounts of dividends, if any, distributed to stockholders of the combined company will be uncertain.
These risks are discussed more fully in the registration statement on Form S-4 we filed with the SEC on December 14, 2018, which the SEC declared effective on February 20, 2019.
