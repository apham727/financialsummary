Item 2: Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations

Overview

Belden Inc. (the Company, us, we, or our) is a global supplier of specialty networking solutions built around two global business platforms - Enterprise Solutions and Industrial Solutions.
Our comprehensive portfolio of solutions enables customers to transmit and secure data, sound, and video for mission critical applications across complex enterprise and industrial environments.
We use a set of tools and processes that are designed to continuously improve business performance in the critical areas of quality, delivery, cost, and innovation.
We consider revenue growth, Adjusted EBITDA margin, free cash flows, and return on invested capital to be our key operating performance indicators.
We also seek to acquire businesses that we believe can help us achieve these objectives.
Trends and Events

The following trends and events during 2019 have had varying effects on our financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.
Foreign currency

Our exposure to currency rate fluctuations primarily relates to exchange rate movements between the U.S. dollar and the euro, Canadian dollar, Hong Kong dollar, Chinese yuan, Japanese yen, Mexican peso, Australian dollar, British pound, Indian rupee, and Brazilian real.
Generally, as the U.S. dollar strengthens against these foreign currencies, our revenues and earnings are negatively impacted as our foreign denominated revenues and earnings are translated into U.S. dollars at a lower rate.
Conversely, as the U.S. dollar weakens against foreign currencies, our revenues and earnings are positively impacted.
During the three and nine months ended September 29, 2019, approximately 48% of our consolidated revenues were to customers outside of the U.S.
In addition to the translation impact described above, currency rate fluctuations have an economic impact on our financial results.
As the U.S. dollar strengthens or weakens against foreign currencies, it results in a relative price increase or decrease for certain of our products that are priced in U.S. dollars in a foreign location.
Commodity prices

Our operating results can be affected by changes in prices of commodities, primarily copper and compounds, which are components in some of the products we sell.
Generally, as the costs of inventory purchases increase due to higher commodity prices, we raise selling prices to customers to cover the increase in costs, resulting in higher sales revenue but a lower gross profit percentage.
Conversely, a decrease in commodity prices would result in lower sales revenue but a higher gross profit percentage.
Selling prices of our products are affected by many factors, including end market demand, capacity utilization, overall economic conditions, and commodity prices.
Importantly, however, there is no exact measure of the effect of changing commodity prices, as there are thousands of transactions in any given quarter, each of which has various factors involved in the individual pricing decisions.
Therefore, all references to the effect of copper prices or other commodity prices are estimates.
Channel Inventory

Our operating results also can be affected by the levels of Belden products purchased and held as inventory by our channel partners and customers.
Our channel partners and customers purchase and hold the products they bought from us in their inventory in order to meet the service and on-time delivery requirements of their customers.
Generally, as our channel partners and customers change the level of products they buy from us and hold in their inventory, it impacts our revenues.
Comparisons of our results between periods can be impacted by changes in the levels of channel inventory.
We use information provided to us by our channel partners and make certain assumptions based on our sales to them to determine the amount of products they bought from us and hold in their inventory.
As such, all references to the effect of channel inventory changes are estimates.
Market Growth and Market Share

The markets in which we operate can generally be characterized as highly competitive and highly fragmented, with many players.
We monitor available data regarding market growth, including independent market research reports, publicly available indices, and the financial results of our direct and indirect peer companies, in order to estimate the extent to which our served markets grew or contracted during a particular period.
We expect that our unit sales volume will increase or decrease consistently with the market growth rate.
Our strategic goal is to utilize our Market Delivery System to target faster growing geographies, applications, and trends within our end markets, in order to achieve growth that is higher than the general market growth rate.
To the extent that we exceed the market growth rates, we consider it to be the result of capturing market share.
Acquisitions

We completed the acquisitions of Opterna International Corp. (Opterna) on April 15, 2019 and FutureLink on April 5, 2019.
The results of Opterna and FutureLink have been included in our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements from the acquisition dates and are reported in the Enterprise Solutions segment.
See Note 3.
Goodwill and Other Asset Impairment

We performed an interim impairment test on our Grass Valley reporting unit, which resulted in a total goodwill and other asset impairment charge of $342.1 million for the three and nine months ended September 29, 2019.
See Note 8.
Opterna and FutureLink Integration Program

In 2019, we began a restructuring program to integrate Opterna and FutureLink with our existing businesses.
The restructuring and integration activities are focused on achieving desired cost savings by consolidating existing and acquired facilities and other support functions.
We recognized $3.1 million and $5.6 million of severance and other restructuring costs for this program during the three and nine months ended September 29, 2019, respectively.
The costs were incurred by the Enterprise Solutions segment.
We do not expect to incur any more costs for this program.
Grass Valley and SAM Integration Program

In 2018, we began a restructuring program to integrate SAM with Grass Valley.
The restructuring and integration activities are focused on achieving desired cost savings by consolidating existing and acquired facilities and other support functions.
We recognized $3.0 million of severance and other restructuring costs for this program during the nine months ended September 29, 2019.
The costs were incurred by the Enterprise Solutions segment.
The integration of these businesses is complete, and thus, we do not expect to incur any more costs for this program.
Preferred Stock Conversion

On July 15, 2019, all outstanding Preferred Stock was automatically converted into shares of Belden common stock at the conversion rate of 132.50, resulting in the issuance of approximately 6.9 million shares of Belden common stock.
Upon conversion, the Preferred Stock was automatically extinguished and discharged, is no longer deemed outstanding for all purposes, and delisted from trading on the New York Stock Exchange.
During the three and nine months ended September 29, 2019, dividends on the Preferred Stock were $1.0 million and $18.4 million, respectively.
See Note 15.
Subsequent Events

During the fourth quarter of 2019, we committed to a plan to sell Grass Valley, and at such time, met all of the criteria to classify the assets and liabilities of this business as held for sale.
As a result, the Grass Valley disposal group, which is currently part of the Enterprise Solutions segment, will be included in discontinued operations commencing in the fourth quarter.
We intend to complete the sale of the Grass Valley disposal group during the next twelve months.
During the fourth quarter, we announced a cost reduction program designed to improve performance and enhance margins by streamlining the organizational structure and investing in technology to drive productivity.
The cost reduction program is expected to deliver an estimated $40.0 million annualized reduction in selling, general, and administrative expenses, with some benefit in 2020, and the full benefit realized in 2021.
We expect to incur severance and other related costs as part of this program but the timing and amounts of such costs are not yet known.
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements

We have no off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows that are or would be considered material to investors.
Critical Accounting Policies


•We did not change any of our existing critical accounting policies from those listed in our 2018 Annual Report on Form 10-K other than updating our lease accounting policies for the adoption of ASU 2016-02;

•No existing accounting policies became critical accounting policies because of an increase in the materiality of associated transactions or changes in the circumstances to which associated judgments and estimates relate; and

•There were no significant changes in the manner in which critical accounting policies were applied or in which related judgments and estimates were developed.
Results of Operations

Consolidated Income before Taxes 



Gross profit decreased $25.5 million and $47.9 million in the three and nine months ended September 29, 2019, respectively, from the comparable periods of 2018.
Gross profit for the three months ended September 29, 2019 decreased due to the decreases in revenue discussed above as well as unfavorable mix; partially offset by decreases in severance, restructuring, and acquisition integration costs of $4.0 million from the comparable period of 2018.
Gross profit for the nine months ended September 29, 2019 decreased due to the decreases in revenue discussed above as well as unfavorable mix; partially offset by decreases in severance, restructuring, and acquisition integration costs of $19.7 million from the comparable period of 2018.
Selling, general and administrative expenses decreased $12.5 million and $31.0 million in the three and nine months ended September 29, 2019, respectively, from the comparable periods of 2018.
Improved productivity; a decline in severance, restructuring, and acquisition integration costs; and currency translation contributed $10.0 million, $3.0 million, and $1.2 million, respectively, to the decrease in selling, general and administrative expenses for the three months ended September 29, 2019 as compared to the year ago period; partially offset by the impact of acquisitions, which increased selling, general and administrative expenses by $1.7 million.
A decline in severance, restructuring, and acquisition integration costs; improved productivity; and currency translation contributed $21.9 million, $14.3 million, and $3.9 million, respectively, to the decrease in selling, general 


and administrative expenses for the nine months ended September 29, 2019 as compared to the year ago period; partially offset by the impact of acquisitions, which increased selling, general and administrative expenses by $9.1 million.
The improved productivity stems from successful cost saving measures implemented during the current year.
Research and development expenses decreased $2.1 million and $7.2 million in the three and nine months ended September 29, 2019, respectively, from the comparable periods of 2018.
Productivity improvement initiatives contributed $1.4 million and $3.2 million to the decline in research and development expenses in the three and nine months ended September 29, 2019, respectively, from the comparable periods of 2018.
Decreases in severance, restructuring, and acquisition integration costs of $0.5 million and $4.4 million also contributed to the decline in research and development expenses in the three and nine months ended September 29, 2019, respectively, over the year ago period.
Currency translation contributed $0.3 million and $1.1 million to the decline in research and development expenses in the three and nine months ended September 29, 2019, respectively, as compared to the year ago period.
The above decreases were partially offset by the impact of acquisitions, which increased research and development expenses by $0.1 million and 1.5 million in the three and nine months ended September 29, 2019, respectively, as compared to the year ago period.
Amortization of intangibles decreased $3.3 million and $7.0 million in the three and nine months ended September 29, 2019, respectively, from the comparable periods of 2018 primarily due to certain intangible assets becoming fully amortized.
Goodwill and other asset impairment increased $342.1 million in the three and nine months ended September 29, 2019 from the comparable periods of 2018.
We performed an interim impairment test on our Grass Valley reporting unit, which resulted in a total goodwill and other asset impairment charge of $342.1 million for the three and nine months ended September 29, 2019.
Gain from patent litigation decreased $62.1 million in the three and nine months ended September 29, 2019 from the comparable periods of 2018.
In 2011, our wholly-owned subsidiary, PPC, filed an action for patent infringement against Corning alleging they willfully infringed upon two of their patents, and after years of post-trial motions and appeals, the District Court ruled that Corning shall pay judgments of $62.1 million, which we received in July 2018 and recorded as a gain from patent litigation for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2018.
Operating income decreased $411.8 million and $406.9 million in the three and nine months ended September 29, 2019, respectively, from the comparable periods of 2018 primarily as a result of the $342.1 million goodwill and other asset impairment charge recognized during the three and nine months ended September 29, 2019, the $62.1 million gain from patent litigation during the nine months ended September 30, 2018, and the decline in gross profit discussed above.
Net interest expense decreased $0.3 million and $4.0 million in the three and nine months ended September 29, 2019, respectively, from the comparable periods of 2018 as a result of our debt transactions during 2018.
In March 2018, we issued €350.0 million aggregate principal amount of new senior subordinated notes due 2028 at an interest rate of 3.875%, and used the net proceeds of this offering and cash on hand to repurchase all of our outstanding €200.0 million 5.5% senior subordinated notes due 2023 as well as all of our outstanding $200.0 million 5.25% senior subordinated notes due 2024.
The loss on debt extinguishment recognized in 2018 represents the premium paid to the bond holders to retire a portion of the 2023 and 2024 notes and the unamortized debt issuance costs written-off.
Income (loss) before taxes decreased $412.4 million and $379.3 million in the three and nine months ended September 29, 2019, respectively, from the comparable periods of 2018.
The decrease is primarily a result of the operating loss during the three and nine months ended September 29, 2019; partially offset by the loss on debt extinguishment in the nine months ended September 30, 2018.
Income Taxes



For the three and nine months ended September 29, 2019, we recognized income tax expense of $2.8 million and $13.6 million, respectively, representing an effective tax rate of (1.0)% and (6.3)%, respectively.
The effective tax rates were impacted by an income tax benefit of $5.7 million as a result of changes in our estimated valuation allowance requirement related to foreign tax credits due to the restructuring of certain foreign operations.
These effective rates are also reflective of the impact of more favorable statutory tax rates applied to the earnings of these foreign operations due to the restructuring efforts.
The income tax expense for the three and nine months ended September 29, 2019 was also impacted by a $5.1 million income tax benefit for the partial deductibility of the goodwill and other asset impairment charge during the period.
•We recognized an income tax benefit of $1.2 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2018 due to a decrease in reserves for uncertain tax positions of prior years.
Our income tax expense and effective tax rate in future periods may be impacted by many factors, including our geographic mix of income and changes in tax laws.
Consolidated Adjusted Revenues and Adjusted EBITDA 



Adjusted EBITDA decreased $25.1 million and $62.7 million in the three and nine months ended September 29, 2019, respectively, from the comparable periods of 2018.
Adjusted EBITDA for both the three and nine months ended September 29, 2019 decreased due to the decreases in Adjusted Revenues discussed above as well as unfavorable mix as compared to the year ago period of 2018.
Use of Non-GAAP Financial Information



above in all periods presented, unless the impact is clearly immaterial to our financial statements.
When we calculate the tax effect of the adjustments, we include all current and deferred income tax expense commensurate with the adjusted measure of pre-tax profitability.
to the Opterna and FutureLink acquisitions.
For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2018, we recognized cost of sales for the adjustment of acquired inventory to fair value related to the SAM and NT2 acquisitions.

For the three months ended September 29, 2019, decreases in volume, unfavorable currency translation, and lower copper prices contributed an estimated $28.2 million, $3.5 million, and $2.8 million to the decline in revenues, respectively; partially offset by the impact of acquisitions, which contributed an estimated $10.5 million increase in revenues.
For the nine months ended September 29, 2019, decreases in volume, unfavorable currency translation, and lower copper prices contributed an estimated $86.5 million, $13.9 million, and $6.7 million to the decline in revenues, respectively, partially offset by the impact of acquisitions, which contributed an estimated $28.8 million increase in revenues.
The decrease in revenues was most notable in Asia, and partially offset by continued growth and share capture in the Americas region.

The decrease in volume was primarily due to changes in channel inventory levels.
The decrease in revenues in the nine months ended September 29, 2019 from the comparable period of 2018 was primarily due to unfavorable currency translation and lower copper prices, which had an estimated impact of $18.0 million and $8.8 million, respectively; partially offset by an increase in volume, which increased revenues $12.3 million over the year ago period.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

Significant factors affecting our cash liquidity include (1) cash from operating activities, (2) disposals of businesses and tangible assets, (3) cash used for acquisitions, restructuring actions, capital expenditures, share repurchases, dividends, and senior subordinated note repurchases, (4) our available credit facilities and other borrowing arrangements, and (5) cash proceeds from equity offerings.
We expect our operating activities to generate cash in 2019 and believe our sources of liquidity are sufficient to 





Operating cash flows were a source of cash of $89.5 million and $100.9 million in 2019 and 2018, respectively.
The $11.4 million decline as compared to prior year is primarily due to the $62 million pre-tax cash proceeds from the Corning patent litigation received in 2018.
Excluding the patent litigation proceeds, operating cash flows increased year-over-year due in part to favorable changes in receivables and inventory.
Receivables were a source of cash of $6.0 million compared to a use of cash of $25.3 million in the prior year.
Inventory was a source of cash of $32.3 million compared to a use of cash of $16.6 million in the prior year.
