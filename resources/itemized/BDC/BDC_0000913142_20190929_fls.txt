Forward-Looking Statements
Statements in this report other than historical facts are “forward-looking statements” made in reliance upon the safe harbor of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.
Forward-looking statements include statements regarding future financial performance (including revenues, expenses, earnings, margins, cash flows, dividends, capital expenditures and financial condition), plans and objectives, and related assumptions.
These forward-looking statements reflect management’s current beliefs and expectations and are not guarantees of future performance.
Actual results may differ materially from those suggested by any forward-looking statements based on a number of factors.
These factors include, among others, those set forth in Part II, Item 1A and in other documents that we file with the SEC.
We expressly disclaim any obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events, or otherwise, except as required by law.
