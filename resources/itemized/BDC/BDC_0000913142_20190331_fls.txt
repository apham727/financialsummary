Forward-Looking Statements

Statements in this report other than historical facts are “forward-looking statements” made in reliance upon the safe harbor of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.
Forward-looking statements include statements regarding future financial performance (including revenues, expenses, earnings, margins, cash flows, dividends, capital expenditures and financial condition), plans and objectives, and related assumptions.
These forward-looking statements reflect management’s current beliefs and expectations and are not guarantees of future performance.
Actual results may differ materially from those suggested by any forward-looking statements based on a number of factors.
We expressly disclaim any obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events, or otherwise, except as required by law.
