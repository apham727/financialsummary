Item 2: Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations
Overview
Belden Inc. (the Company, us, we, or our) is a signal transmission solutions company built around two global business platforms – Enterprise Solutions and Industrial Solutions.
Our comprehensive portfolio of signal transmission solutions provides industry leading secure and reliable transmission of data, sound, and video for mission critical applications.
We use a set of tools and processes that are designed to continuously improve business performance in the critical areas of quality, delivery, cost, and innovation.
We consider revenue growth, Adjusted EBITDA margin, free cash flows, and return on invested capital to be our key operating performance indicators.
We also seek to acquire businesses that we believe can help us achieve these objectives.
Trends and Events
The following trends and events during 2018 have had varying effects on our financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.
Foreign currency
Our exposure to currency rate fluctuations primarily relates to exchange rate movements between the U.S. dollar and the Euro, Canadian dollar, Hong Kong dollar, Chinese yuan, Japanese yen, Mexican peso, Australian dollar, British pound, and Brazilian real.
Generally, as the U.S. dollar strengthens against these foreign currencies, our revenues and earnings are negatively impacted as our foreign denominated revenues and earnings are translated into U.S. dollars at a lower rate.
Conversely, as the U.S. dollar weakens against foreign currencies, our revenues and earnings are positively impacted.
For both the three and six months ended July 1, 2018, approximately 49% of our consolidated revenues were to customers outside of the U.S.
In addition to the translation impact described above, currency rate fluctuations have an economic impact on our financial results.
As the U.S. dollar strengthens or weakens against foreign currencies, it results in a relative price increase or decrease for certain of our products that are priced in U.S. dollars in a foreign location.
Commodity prices
Our operating results can be affected by changes in prices of commodities, primarily copper and compounds, which are components in some of the products we sell.
Generally, as the costs of inventory purchases increase due to higher commodity prices, we raise selling prices to customers to cover the increase in costs, resulting in higher sales revenue but a lower gross profit percentage.
Conversely, a decrease in commodity prices would result in lower sales revenue but a higher gross profit percentage.
Selling prices of our products are affected by many factors, including end market demand, capacity utilization, overall economic conditions, and commodity prices.
Importantly, however, there is no exact measure of the effect of changing commodity prices, as there are thousands of transactions in any given quarter, each of which has various factors involved in the individual pricing decisions.
Therefore, all references to the effect of copper prices or other commodity prices are estimates.
Channel Inventory
Our operating results also can be affected by the levels of Belden products purchased and held as inventory by our channel partners and customers.
Our channel partners and customers purchase and hold the products they bought from us in their inventory in order to meet the service and on-time delivery requirements of their customers.
Generally, as our channel partners and customers change the level of products they buy from us and hold in their inventory, it impacts our revenues.
Comparisons of our results between periods can be impacted by changes in the levels of channel inventory.
We use information provided to us by our channel partners and make certain assumptions based on our sales to them to determine the amount of products they bought from us and hold in their inventory.
As such, all references to the effect of channel inventory changes are estimates.
Market Growth and Market Share
The markets in which we operate can generally be characterized as highly competitive and highly fragmented, with many players.
We monitor available data regarding market growth, including independent market research reports, publicly available indices, and the financial results of our direct and indirect peer companies, in order to estimate the extent to which our served markets grew or contracted during a particular period.
We expect that our unit sales volume will increase or decrease consistently with the market growth rate.
Our strategic goal is to utilize our Market Delivery System to target faster growing geographies, applications, and trends within our end markets, in order to achieve growth that is higher than the general market growth rate.
To the extent that we exceed the market growth rates, we consider it to be the result of capturing market share.
Operating Segments
Effective January 1, 2018, we changed our organizational structure and, as a result, now are reporting two segments.
The segments formerly known as Broadcast Solutions and Enterprise Solutions now are presented as the Enterprise Solutions segment, and the segments formerly known as Industrial Solutions and Network Solutions now are presented as the Industrial Solutions segment.
The reorganization allows us to further accelerate progress in key strategic areas and the segment consolidation properly aligns our external reporting with the way the businesses are now managed.
We have recast the prior period segment information to conform to the change in the composition of these reportable segments.
Acquisitions
We completed the acquisition of Net-Tech Technology, Inc. (NT2) and Snell Advanced Media (SAM) on April 25, 2018 and February 8, 2018, respectively.
The results of both NT2 and SAM have been included in our Consolidated Financial Statements from the acquisition date and are reported in the Enterprise Solutions segment.
See Note 3.
Long-term Debt
In March 2018, we issued €350.0 million ($431.3 million at issuance) aggregate principal amount of new senior subordinated notes due 2028 at an interest rate of 3.875%.
During March and April 2018, we used the net proceeds of this offering to repurchase our outstanding $200.0 million 5.25% senior subordinated notes due 2024 and our outstanding €200.0 million 5.5% senior subordinated notes due 2023.
We paid approximately $7.5 million of fees related to issuing the 2028 notes, and recognized a $3.0 million and $23.0 million loss on debt extinguishment during the three and six months ended July 1, 2018, respectively, for premiums paid to the bond holders to retire the 2024 and 2023 notes and for the unamortized debt issuance costs that we wrote-off.
See Note 10.
Grass Valley and SAM Integration Program
During the first quarter of 2018, we began a restructuring program to integrate SAM with Grass Valley.
The restructuring and integration activities are focused on achieving desired cost savings by consolidating existing and acquired facilities and other support functions.
We recognized $20.3 million and $29.5 million of severance and other restructuring costs for this program during the three and six months ended July 1, 2018, respectively.
The costs were incurred by the Enterprise Solutions segment.
We expect to incur approximately $22 million of additional severance and restructuring costs for this program, most of which will be incurred by the end of 2018.
We also expect the program to generate approximately $44 million of savings on an annualized basis, which we will start realizing in the second half of 2018.
Industrial Manufacturing Footprint Program
In 2016, we began a program to consolidate our manufacturing footprint.
The manufacturing consolidation will be completed this year.
We recognized $3.9 million and $11.4 million of severance and other restructuring costs for this program during the three and six months ended July 1, 2018, respectively.
The costs were incurred by the Enterprise Solutions and Industrial Solutions segments, as the manufacturing locations involved in the program serve both platforms.
We expect the program to generate approximately $13 million of savings on an annualized basis, which we began to realize in the third quarter of 2017.
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
We have no off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows that are or would be considered material to investors.
Critical Accounting Policies
•We did not change any of our existing critical accounting policies from those listed in our 2017 Annual Report on Form 10-K other than updating our revenue recognition accounting policies for the adoption of ASU 2014-09;
•No existing accounting policies became critical accounting policies because of an increase in the materiality of associated transactions or changes in the circumstances to which associated judgments and estimates relate; and
•There were no significant changes in the manner in which critical accounting policies were applied or in which related judgments and estimates were developed.
Results of Operations
Consolidated Income before Taxes
•Acquisitions contributed $37.2 million and $65.8 million in the three and six months ended July 1, 2018, respectively.
•Favorable currency translation contributed $9.7 million and $27.7 million in the three and six months ended July 1, 2018, respectively.
•Higher copper prices contributed $9.7 million and $17.2 million in the three and six months ended July 1, 2018, respectively.
•Higher sales volume resulted in a $8.3 million and $14.5 million in the three and six months ended July 1, 2018, respectively.
•The divestiture of our MCS business resulted in a $7.0 million and $13.0 million decrease in revenues in the three and six months ended July 1, 2018, respectively.
Gross profit increased in the three and six months ended July 1, 2018 from the comparable periods of 2017 due to the increases in revenues discussed above.
In the three months ended July 1, 2018, decreases in severance, restructuring, and acquisition integration costs; purchase accounting effects of acquisitions; and accelerated depreciation of $1.0 million, $0.4 million, and $0.3 million, respectively, further contributed to the increase in gross profit, partially offset by a $0.5 million increase in the amortization of software development intangible assets as compared to the year ago period.
For the six months ended July 1, 2018, decreases in accelerated depreciation of $0.5 million further contributed to the increase in gross profit, partially offset by increases in severance, restructuring, and acquisition integration costs; amortization of software development intangible assets; and purchase accounting effects of acquisitions of $2.6 million, $0.7 million and $0.1 million, respectively, as compared to the year ago period.
Selling, general and administrative expenses increased $20.8 million and $33.1 million, respectively, in the three and six months ended July 1, 2018 from the comparable periods of 2017.
Acquisitions contributed $13.0 million and $23.3 million, respectively, to the increases in selling, general and administrative expenses year-over-year.
Increases in severance, restructuring, and acquisition integration costs, contributed $13.1 million and $21.8 million, respectively, to the increases in selling, general and administrative expenses year-over-year.
Currency translation contributed approximately $2.2 million and $5.9 million, respectively, to the increase
in selling, general and administrative expenses year-over-year.
These increases were partially offset by $6.5 million and $15.8 million, respectively, from improved productivity, and $1.0 million and $2.1 million, respectively, from the MCS divestiture in the fourth quarter of 2017.
Research and development expenses increased $2.1 million and $4.6 million, respectively, in the three and six months ended July 1, 2018 from the comparable periods of 2017.
Acquisitions contributed $4.4 million and $8.8 million, respectively; increases in severance, restructuring, and acquisition integration costs contributed $3.2 million and $4.8 million, respectively; and currency translation contributed $0.7 million and $1.8 million, respectively, to the increase in research and development expenses.
These increases were partially offset by $5.7 million and $9.6 million, respectively, from improved productivity and $0.5 million and $1.2 million, respectively, from the MCS divestiture in the fourth quarter of 2017.
Amortization of intangibles decreased $2.1 million and $1.3 million, respectively, in the three and six months ended July 1, 2018 from the comparable periods of 2017.
The decrease is due to certain intangible assets becoming fully amortized, partially offset by the acquisitions of SAM, Thinklogical, and NT2, which contributed a total $3.0 million and $8.4 million, respectively, in the three and six months ended July 1, 2018 as compared to the year ago period.
Operating income decreased $6.3 million and $13.7 million, respectively, in the three and six months ended July 1, 2018 from the comparable periods of 2017 primarily due to the increases in selling, general and administrative expenses and research and development, partially offset by the increase in gross profit and decrease in amortization expense discussed above.
Net interest expense decreased $8.4 million, or 35.9%, and $15.0 million, or 31.8%, in the three and six months ended July 1, 2018, respectively, from the comparable period of 2017 as a result of our debt transactions during 2017 and 2018.
In July 2017, we issued €450.0 million aggregate principal amount of new senior subordinated notes due 2027 at an interest rate of 3.375%, and used the net proceeds of this offering and cash on hand to repurchase all of our outstanding $700.0 million 5.5% senior subordinated notes due 2022.
In September 2017, we issued €300.0 million aggregate principal amount of new senior subordinated notes due 2025 at an interest rate of 2.875%, and used the net proceeds of this offering to repurchase €300.0 million of our outstanding €500.0 million 5.5% senior subordinated notes due 2023.
In March 2018, we issued €350.0 million aggregate principal amount of new senior subordinated notes due 2028 at an interest rate of 3.875%, and used the net proceeds of this offering and cash on hand to repurchase all of our outstanding €200.0 million 5.5% senior subordinated notes due 2023 and all of our outstanding $200.0 million 5.25% senior subordinated notes due 2024.
See Note 10.
The loss on debt extinguishment recognized in 2018 represents the premium paid to the bond holders to retire the 2023 and 2024 notes and the unamortized debt issuance costs that were written-off.
The loss on debt extinguishment recognized in 2017 represents unamortized debt issuance costs related to creditors no longer participating in the Amended and Restated Agreement (the Revolver).
See Note 10.
Income before taxes remained flat for in three months ended July 1, 2018 from the comparable period of 2017, but decreased $20.8 million in the six months ended July 1, 2018 from the comparable period of 2017 primarily due to the loss on debt extinguishment and decrease in operating income, partially offset by lower interest expense discussed above.
Income Taxes
•We recognized an income tax benefit of $1.2 million in the three and six months ended July 1, 2018 due to a decrease in reserves for uncertain tax positions of prior years.
•We recognized income tax expense of $1.8 million in the six months ended July 1, 2018 as a result of a change in our valuation allowance on foreign tax credits associated with our euro debt refinancing.
•We also recognized income tax expense of $0.5 million in the six months ended July 1, 2018 as a result of changes in our valuation allowance for the “Tax Cuts and Jobs Act” (the Act).
The amount of this adjustment remains provisional under Staff Accounting Bulletin No.
118 (SAB 118) as of the date of this report.
On December 22, 2017, the Act was signed into law, making significant changes to the Internal Revenue Code.
Changes include, but are not limited to, a corporate tax rate decrease from 35% to 21% effective for tax years beginning after December 31, 2017, the transition of U.S. international taxation from a worldwide tax system to a territorial tax system, and a one-time transition tax on the mandatory deemed repatriation of cumulative foreign earnings as of December 31, 2017.
On December 22, 2017, SAB 118 was issued to address the application of US GAAP in situations when a registrant does not have the necessary information available, prepared, or analyzed (including computations) in reasonable detail to complete the accounting for certain income tax effects of the Act.
During 2018, we obtained additional information affecting the provisional amount initially recorded for the valuation allowance on certain foreign tax credits in 2017.
As a result, we recorded an adjustment to the valuation allowance on certain foreign tax credits.
Additional work is still necessary for a more detailed analysis of all provisional amounts associated with the Act including the remeasurement of certain deferred tax assets and liabilities, the one-time transition tax on the mandatory deemed repatriation of foreign earnings and the valuation allowance on certain foreign tax credits.
We continue to evaluate the need for a provisional amount regarding the non-deductibility of certain covered employee compensation associated with the amendments to IRC section 162(m).
As of the date of this report, we reasonably believe no such provision should be recorded.
Any subsequent adjustment to these amounts will be recorded to tax expense in 2018 when the analysis is complete.
All adjustments related to the Act remain provisional as of the date of this report.
Our income tax expense and effective tax rate in future periods may be impacted by many factors, including our geographic mix of income and changes in tax laws.
Consolidated Adjusted Revenues and Adjusted EBITDA
•Acquisitions contributed $40.0 million and $70.5 million in the three and six months ended July 1, 2018, respectively.
•Favorable currency translation contributed $9.7 million and $27.7 million in the three and six months ended July 1, 2018, respectively.
•Higher copper prices contributed $9.7 million and $17.2 million in the three and six months ended July 1, 2018, respectively.
•Higher sales volume contributed $8.3 million and $14.5 million in the three and six months ended July 1, 2018, respectively.
•The divestiture of our MCS business resulted in $7.0 million and $13.0 million decrease in revenues in the three and six months ended July 1, 2018, respectively.
Adjusted EBITDA increased in the three and six months ended July 1, 2018 from the comparable periods of 2017 primarily due to the increases in revenues discussed above.

Segment Results of Operations
For additional information regarding our segment measures, see Note 5 to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements.
Enterprise Solutions
Enterprise Solutions revenues increased in both the three and six months ended July 1, 2018 from the comparable periods of 2017.
For the three months ended July 1, 2018, acquisitions, higher copper prices, favorable currency translation, and volume growth contributed $40.0 million, $5.1 million, $4.1 million, and $1.7 million, respectively, to the increase in revenues.
For the six months ended July 1, 2018, acquisitions, favorable currency translation, and higher copper prices contributed $70.5 million, $12.1 million, and $8.6 million, respectively, to the increase in revenues, partially offset by declines in volume of $3.6 million.
Enterprise Solutions EBITDA increased $13.9 million and $21.7 million, respectively, in the three and six months ended July 1, 2018 from the comparable periods of 2017 as a result of the revenue growth discussed above, successful restructuring actions,
and sustainable productivity initiatives.
Accordingly, EBITDA margins expanded 140 and 100 basis points, respectively, over the year ago period.
Industrial Solutions
Industrial Solutions revenues increased in both the three and six months ended July 1, 2018 from the comparable periods of 2017.
For the three months ended July 1, 2018, volume growth, favorable currency translation, and higher copper prices contributed $6.6 million, $5.7 million, and $4.6 million, respectively, to the increase in revenues, partially offset by $7.0 million from the MCS divestiture in the fourth quarter of 2017.
For the six months ended July 1, 2018, volume growth, favorable currency translation, and higher copper prices contributed $18.1 million, $15.6 million, and $8.6 million, respectively, to the increase in revenues, partially offset by $13.0 million from the MCS divestiture in the fourth quarter of 2017.
Industrial Solutions EBITDA decreased $0.8 million and increased $1.8 million in the three and six months ended July 1, 2018 from the comparable periods of 2017, respectively.
The revenue growth discussed above was partially offset by unfavorable product mix experienced during the three and six months ended July 1, 2018.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
Net cash used for operating activities for the six months ended July 1, 2018 totaled $29.4 million, compared to $34.8 million of net cash provided by operating activities for the comparable period of 2017.
The decrease in operating cash flow as compared to prior year is primarily due to an unfavorable change in accounts payable.
Accounts payable was a use of cash of $84.7 million in
the first six months of 2018 compared to a source of cash of $14.7 million in the prior year period.
The accounts payable use of cash in the first six months of 2018 is primarily attributable to higher inventory levels, due in part to the build in safety stock inventory in the fourth quarter of 2017 in support of the closure of an operating facility.
This is evidenced through the decline in inventory turns from 5.8 turns in the second quarter of 2017 to 5.2 turns in second quarter of 2018, while days payable outstanding remained constant at 87 days.
Net cash used for investing activities totaled $82.4 million for the six months ended July 1, 2018, compared to $189.1 million for the comparable period of 2017.
Investing activities for the six months ended July 1, 2018 included payments, net of cash acquired, for the acquisitions of SAM and NT2 of $83.7 million, capital expenditures of $39.5 million, net proceeds from the sale of an operating facility of $1.5 million, and a payment related to our 2015 acquisition of Tripwire that had previously been deferred of $1.0 million; net of cash received for the sale of the MCS business and Hirschmann JV which closed on December 31, 2017 of $40.2 million.
Investing activities for the six months ended July 2, 2017 included payments, net of cash acquired, for the acquisition of Thinklogical of $165.8 million, capital expenditures of $22.2 million, and a $1.0 million payment related to our 2015 acquisition of Tripwire that had previously been deferred.
Net cash used for financing activities for the six months ended July 1, 2018 totaled $185.0 million, compared to $33.7 million for the comparable period of 2017. Financing activities for the six months ended July 1, 2018 included payments under borrowing arrangements of $484.8 million, payments under our share repurchase program of $100.0 million, cash dividend payments of $22.0 million, debt issuance costs of $7.5 million, net payments related to share based compensation activities of $1.6 million, $0.4 million for the redemption of our stockholders' rights agreement, and $431.3 million of cash proceeds from the issuance of the €350.0 million 3.875% Notes due 2028. Financing activities for the six months ended July 2, 2017 included cash dividend payments of $21.7 million, payments under borrowing arrangements of $5.2 million, net payments related to share based compensation activities of $4.7 million, and debt issuance costs of $2.0 million.
Our cash and cash equivalents balance was $261.4 million as of July 1, 2018.
Of this amount, $155.2 million was held outside of the U.S. in our foreign operations.
Substantially all of the foreign cash and cash equivalents are readily convertible into U.S. dollars or other foreign currencies.
We consider the undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries to be indefinitely reinvested, and accordingly, no provision for any withholding taxes has been recorded.
Upon distribution of those earnings in the form of dividends or otherwise, we may be subject to withholding taxes payable to the respective foreign countries.
Our outstanding debt obligations as of July 1, 2018 consisted of $1,507.0 million of senior subordinated notes.
Additional discussion regarding our various borrowing arrangements is included in Note 10 to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements.
As of July 1, 2018, we had $348.0 million in available borrowing capacity under our Revolver.
