 Item 3.
Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.
 We are exposed to an immaterial level of market risk from changes in interest rates.
We have from time to time previously used interest rate swap agreements to modify variable rate obligations to fixed rate obligations, thereby reducing our exposure to interest rate fluctuations.
We had no long-term variable rate debt obligations as of July 1, 2018.
Based on July 1, 2018 borrowing levels, a 1.0% increase or decrease in current market interest rates would have an immaterial effect on our statement of income.
 We are exposed to an immaterial level of market risk from changes in foreign currency rates.

Dollars so we have an immaterial amount of foreign currency risk.
Those sales not made in U.S.
Dollars are made in Canadian Dollars.
