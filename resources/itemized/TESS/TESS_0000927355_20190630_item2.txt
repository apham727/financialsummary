Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.
This commentary should be read in conjunction with the Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations from the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2019.
 Business Overview and Environment
 TESSCO architects and delivers innovative product and value chain solutions to support wireless broadband systems.
Although we sell products to customers in many countries, approximately 97% of our sales are made to customers in the United States.
We have operations and office facilities in Hunt Valley, Maryland, Reno, Nevada and San Antonio, Texas.
 Our first quarter fiscal 2020 revenue decreased by 13.4% compared to the first quarter of fiscal 2019.
First quarter fiscal 2020 revenue in the commercial segment and retail segment decreased 6.8% and 28.8%, respectively, as compared to the first fiscal quarter of 2019.
The decline in our commercial segment revenue was driven by a decrease in our public carrier market due to the project-oriented nature of this business.
Several large customers either adjusted their forecasts or pushed out their product requirements from the first fiscal quarter into the remainder of the year.
For the retail segment, revenue decreased due to significantly lower revenues from one of our more significant retail customers following its recent acquisition, change in business model and subsequent transition of its business elsewhere, as well as ongoing overall market softness.
Among our product categories, revenue decreased in our base station infrastructure, network systems, installation, test and maintenance, and mobile device accessories categories by 7.1%, 1.0%, 18.9% and 28.7%, respectively, for the first quarter of fiscal 2020, as compared to the same quarter last year.
 Our first quarter fiscal year 2020 gross profit decreased by 17.7%, compared to the first quarter of fiscal year 2019.
The decrease in gross profit was primarily the result of the decrease in revenue discussed above.
Gross

margin for the first quarter fiscal year 2020 and fiscal year 2019 was 19.3% and 20.3%, respectively.
The decline in gross margin was a result of the impact of tariffs and inventory write-offs.
Selling, General and Administrative expenses for the first quarter of fiscal year 2020 were down 3.0% compared to the first quarter fiscal year 2019.
The decrease is related to decreased compensation, benefits, and rewards expense.
These decreases were partially offset by an increase in occupancy expense and distribution support expense.
The Company also incurred a restructuring charge related to severance expenses.
As a result, net income decreased by $3.7 million or 315.2% and diluted earnings per share decreased by $0.42 or 323.1% compared to the prior-year quarter.
 Our ongoing ability to earn revenues and gross profits from customers and vendors looking to us for product and supply chain solutions depends upon a number of factors.
The terms, and accordingly the factors, applicable to each relationship often differ.
Among these factors are the strength of the customer’s or vendor’s business, the supply and demand for the product or service, including price stability, changing customer or vendor requirements, and our ability to support the customer or vendor and to continually demonstrate that we can improve the way they do business.
In addition, the agreements or arrangements on which our customer and vendor relationships are based are typically of limited duration, typically do not include any obligation in respect of any specific product purchase or sale and are terminable by either party upon several months or otherwise relatively short notice.
Because of the nature of our business, we have been affected from time to time in the past by the loss and changes in the business habits of significant customer and vendor relationships, and expect that we will again be so affected from time to time in the future.
Our customer relationships could also be affected by wireless carrier consolidation or the overall global economic environment.
 The wireless communications distribution industry is competitive and fragmented and is comprised of several national distributors.
In addition, many manufacturers sell direct.
Barriers to entry for distributors are relatively low, particularly in the mobile devices and accessories market, and the risk of new competitors entering the marketplace is high.
Consolidation of larger wireless carriers has and will most likely continue to impact our current and potential customer base.
Our ability to maintain customer and vendor relationships is subject to competitive pressures and challenges.
We believe, however, that our strength in service, the breadth and depth of our product offering, our information technology system, industry experience and knowledge, and our large customer base and purchasing relationships with approximately 400 manufacturers, provide us with a significant competitive advantage over new entrants to the marketplace.

 Results of Operations
 First Quarter of Fiscal Year 2020 Compared with First Quarter of Fiscal Year 2019
 Total Revenues.
Revenues for the first quarter of fiscal 2020 decreased 13.4% compared with the first quarter of fiscal 2019.
Revenues in our public carrier market, value-added resellers and integrators market and retail market decreased by 17.0%, 0.5% and 28.8%, respectively.
The decline in the commercial segment was primarily due to the project-oriented nature of this business.
Several large customers adjusted their forecasts or pushed out their product requirements from the first fiscal quarter into the remainder of the fiscal year.
The decline in the retail segment was driven by significantly lower revenues from one of our more significant retail customers following its recent acquisition, change in business model and subsequent transition of its business elsewhere, as well as ongoing overall market softness.
 Total Gross Profit.
Gross profit for the first quarter of fiscal 2020 decreased by 17.7% compared to the first quarter of fiscal 2019.
This decrease was primarily due to lower sales volume combined with the impact of tariffs and inventory write-offs.
Overall gross profit margin decreased from 20.3% in the first quarter of fiscal 2019 to 19.3% in the first quarter of fiscal 2020.
Within our commercial segment, gross profit margin in our public carrier market decreased from 13.9% to 12.7% due to changes in customer mix.
Gross profit margin in our value-added resellers and integrators market increased slightly from 24.3% to 24.5%.
Within our retail segment, gross profit margin decreased from 20.3% to 15.7% in the first quarter of fiscal 2020, compared to 2019, primarily due to the impact of tariffs and inventory write-offs.
 As discussed above under the heading “Business Overview and Environment,” our ongoing ability to earn revenues and gross profits from customers and vendors depends upon a number of factors which often differ for each relationship.
Agreements or arrangements on which these relationships are based typically do not include any obligation in respect of any specific product purchase or sale, are of limited duration, and are terminable by either party upon relatively short notice.
We have been affected from time to time in the past by the loss and changes in the business habits of significant customer and vendor relationships, and expect that we will again be so affected from time to time in the future.
 Selling, General, Administrative and Restructuring Expenses.
Total selling, general and administrative expenses decreased by $864,800 for the first quarter of fiscal 2020, compared to the first quarter of fiscal 2019.
Selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenues increased from 19.2% for the first quarter of fiscal 2019, to 21.4% for the first quarter of fiscal 2020.
 The decrease in our selling, general and administrative expenses was primarily due to a decrease of $0.7 million in compensation and benefits expense and a decrease of $0.6 million in rewards expense, during the first quarter of fiscal 2020 as compared to the first quarter of fiscal 2019.
These decreases were partially offset by the $0.3 million increase in distribution support expense, primarily related to variable operations costs related to large carrier customers, and the $0.2 million increase in occupancy expense.
 The Company also incurred a $0.5 million restructuring charge related to severance expense for the first quarter of fiscal 2020.
 We continually evaluate the credit worthiness of our existing customer receivable portfolio and provide an appropriate reserve based on this evaluation.
We also evaluate the credit worthiness of prospective and current customers and make decisions regarding extension of credit terms to such customers based on this evaluation.
We incurred bad debt expense of $135,400 and $356,200 for the three months ended June 30, 2019 and July 1, 2018, respectively.

 Interest, Net.
Net interest expense increased from $174,400 for the first quarter of fiscal 2019 to $208,700 for the first quarter of fiscal 2020.
Increased focus on business opportunities for sales to our public carrier customers has required us to maintain increased inventory levels, and at times has resulted in increased borrowings and interest expense under our secured Revolving Credit Facility (discussed in Note 4 to our Consolidated Financial Statements, included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q).
We expect this higher level of interest expense to continue for at least the next several quarters.
 Income Taxes, Net Income and Diluted Earnings per Share.
The effective tax rate increased from 25.9% for the first quarter of fiscal 2019 to 29.4% for the first quarter of fiscal 2020.
The increase in the effective tax rate is the result of permanent and other tax adjustments remaining consistent year over year while pre-tax income decreased year over year.
Tax benefits were fully recognized in fiscal 2019.
Net income decreased 315.2% and diluted earnings per share decreased 323.1% for the first quarter of fiscal 2020, compared to the corresponding prior-year quarter.
 Liquidity and Capital Resources
 The following table summarizes our cash flows provided by or used in operating, investing and financing activities for the three months ended June 30, 2019 and July 1, 2018.
 We used $2.0 million of net cash from operating activities for the first three months of fiscal 2020, compared with net cash used in operating activities of $1.7 million for the first three months of fiscal 2019.
This fiscal 2020 outflow was driven by a net loss and an increase in inventory, partially offset by an increase in accounts payable and a decrease in accounts receivable.
Both current and potential opportunities within our public carrier business caused a significant investment in inventory.
Accounts payable also increased in response to higher inventory levels.
 Net cash used in investing activities of $1.9 million for the first three months of fiscal 2020 increased from cash used of $1.4 million for the first three months of fiscal 2019.
Cash used in both periods was due to capital expenditures largely comprised of investments in information technology.
 Net cash provided by financing activities was $3.8 million for the first three months of fiscal 2020, compared to $3.1 million provided in the first three months of fiscal 2019.
We utilized our asset based secured Revolving Credit Facility during the first three months of fiscal 2020 and 2019, leading to a cash inflow of $5.7 million and $4.9 million, respectively, during those periods.
During the first three months of both fiscal 2020 and fiscal 2019, we had cash outflows of $1.7 million, due to cash dividends paid to shareholders.
 On October 19, 2017, the Company and its primary operating subsidiaries, as co-borrowers, entered into an Amended and Restated Credit Agreement with SunTrust Bank, as Administrative Agent, and Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, as a lender (the “Amended and Restated Credit Agreement”), which amended and restated the terms of a previously established secured Revolving Credit Facility and which provides for, among

other things, an increase the Company’s borrowing limit from up to $35 million to up to $75 million.
In addition to expanding the borrowing limit, the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement extended the applicable maturity date to October 19, 2021.
As of June 30, 2019, borrowings under the secured Revolving Credit Facility totaled $20.1 million; therefore, we then had $54.9 million available, subject to the Borrowing Base limitations and compliance with the other applicable terms of the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement, including the financial and other covenants discussed in Note 4 to our Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.
Borrowings under the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement accrue interest at the rates, and the Company is required to pay a monthly commitment fee, as also discussed in Note 4 to our Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.
 In connection with the entering into of the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement, the Company and the other Company affiliate borrowers under the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement, and other subsidiaries, referred to collectively as the Loan Parties, executed and delivered to SunTrust Bank, as Administrative Agent, a Reaffirmation Agreement, pursuant to which the obligations of the Loan Parties under the Guaranty and Security Agreement previously delivered by the Loan Parties in connection with the secured Revolving Credit Facility as previously existing (including the previously existing guaranty by the Loan Parties not otherwise Borrowers and the previously existing grant by the Company and the other Loan Parties of a continuing first priority security interest in inventory, accounts receivable and deposit accounts, and on all documents, instruments, general intangibles, letter of credit rights, and all proceeds) were ratified and confirmed as respects the Obligations arising from time to time under the secured Revolving Credit Facility provided for pursuant to the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement.
 We have made quarterly dividend payments to holders of our common stock since the third quarter of fiscal 2010.
Our most recent quarterly cash dividend of $0.20 per share was paid in June 2019.
On July 16, 2019, our Board declared a quarterly cash dividend in the amount of $0.20 per share, payable on August 21, 2019 to shareholders of record as of August 7, 2019.
 Any future declaration of dividends and the establishment of any corresponding record and payment dates remains subject to further determination from time to time by the Board of Directors.
 In addition, our liquidity could be negatively impacted by decreasing revenues and profits resulting from a decrease in demand for our products or a reduction in capital expenditures by our customers, or by the weakened financial conditions of our customers or suppliers, in each case as a result of a downturn in the global economy, among other factors.

Controls and Procedures.
 The Company’s management, with the participation of the Chief Executive Officer (CEO) and Chief Financial Officer (CFO), has evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(e) or 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (Exchange Act)) as of the end of the period covered by this quarterly report.
Controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance of achieving the desired control objectives, and management is required to apply its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures.
Based on the evaluation of these controls and procedures required by Rules 13a-15(b) or 15d-15(b) of the Exchange Act, the Company’s management, including the CEO and CFO, have concluded that, as of the end of the period covered by this quarterly report, the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures were effective to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed by the Company in reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission’s rules and forms and to provide reasonable assurance that such information is accumulated and communicated to the Company’s management, including the Company’s CEO and CFO, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.
During the period covered by this quarterly report, there have been no changes to the Company’s internal control over financial reporting that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company’s internal control over financial reporting.
