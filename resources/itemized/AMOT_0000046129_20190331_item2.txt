Operating Results 



Quarter ended March 31, 2019 compared to quarter ended March 31, 2018 



  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 



NET INCOME: Net income increased during the first quarter 2019 compared to the first quarter 2018 reflecting a significant increase in revenues partially offset by increased selling and general and administrative costs to support growth. Gross margins and operating margins were muted by some atypical events within our supply chain and production cycles supporting manufacturing development and customer requirements for new contracts that are beginning to ramp-up in 2019. 



EBITDA AND ADJUSTED EBITDA: EBITDA was $11,004 for the first quarter of 2019 compared to $9,096 for the same quarter last year. Adjusted EBITDA was $11,731 and $9,743 for the first quarters of 2019 and 2018, respectively. EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA are non-GAAP measurements. EBITDA consists of income before interest expense, provision for income taxes, and depreciation and amortization. Adjusted EBITDA also excludes stock compensation expense and certain other items. Refer to information included in Non - GAAP Measures below for a reconciliation of net income to EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA. 



REVENUES: For the quarter, the increase in revenues reflects increased sales in all our served markets as well as contributions from the TCI acquisition made in December 2018.

Table of Contents 



Sales to U.S. customers were 54% of total sales for the first quarter 2019 compared with 53% for the same period last year, with the balance of sales to customers primarily in Europe, Canada and Asia. The overall increase in revenue was due to an 27% volume increase offset by a 4% unfavorable currency impact. 



ORDER BOOKINGS AND BACKLOG: The increase in bookings in the first quarter of 2019 compared to the first quarter of 2018 is largely due to organic growth across all of the major markets served by the company. The acquisition of TCI in late 2018 contributes to the increased bookings in 2019. The increase in backlog as of March 31, 2019, compared to at March 31, 2018 was attributable to the same factors. 



GROSS MARGIN: Gross margin remained consistent at 29.5% for the first quarters of 2019 and 2018 however 2019 was negatively impacted by some atypical events within our supply chain and production cycles as referenced earlier. The first event relates to an increase in pricing from a supplier who is discontinuing operations and subsequently increased their prices for any new orders through the first half of 2019. The second item was the timing of investment into tooling and prototype samples related to new Vehicle market programs. Both impacts are expected to moderate over the coming quarters. 



SELLING EXPENSES: Selling expenses increased in the first quarter of 2019 compared to the same period of 2018. This was attributable to higher commissioned sales and the additional selling organizations associated with the Maval OE Steering and TCI acquisitions. Selling expenses as a percentage of revenues were 4.4% in the first quarter of 2019 compared to 3.5% for the same period last year. 



GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES: General and administrative expenses increased by 20% in the first quarter 2019 from the first quarter 2018 largely due to the acquisitions of Maval OE Steering and TCI along with higher stock compensation and incentive compensation expense associated with improved performance. As a percentage of revenues, general and administrative expenses decreased 20 basis points to 9.5% for the quarter ended March 31, 2019 compared to 9.7% for the same period in 2018. 



ENGINEERING AND DEVELOPMENT EXPENSES: Engineering and development expenses increased by 17.2% in the first quarter of 2019 compared to the same quarter last year, however decreased as a percentage of sales. The increase in expenses is primarily due to added resources (headcount and consulting), the continued ramp up of development projects to meet the future needs of customers and target markets along with the engineering resources associated with the acquired businesses in 2018. As a percentage of revenues, engineering and development expenses were 6.2% and 6.5% for the first quarters of 2019 and 2018, respectively. 



BUSINESS DEVELOPMENT COSTS: The Company incurred $53 of business development costs in the first quarter 2019 compared to $151 of business development costs in the first quarter last year. The costs in 2019 relate to activity from the December 2018 acquisition of TCI. The costs in first quarter 2018 were related to the acquisition of the Maval OE Steering business and activity associated with other M&A opportunities. 



AMORTIZATION OF INTANGIBLE ASSETS: Amortization expense increased 62% to $1,432 in the first quarter of 2019 compared to the first quarter of 2018 due to the increase in intangible assets from the acquisition of TCI. 



INCOME TAXES: The effective income tax rate as a percentage of income before income taxes was 27.5% and 26.2% in the first quarter 2019 and 2018, respectively. The effective tax rate is net of a discrete tax benefit of (1.8%) and (2.3%), rate for the first quarters of 2019 and 2018 respectively, related primarily to the recognition of excess tax benefits for share-based payment awards. The effective rate before discrete items varies from the statutory rate primarily due to differences in state taxes, the impact of international tax provisions in the US, the difference in foreign tax rates and the mix of foreign and domestic income. 



Non-GAAP Measures 



Revenue excluding foreign currency exchange impacts, EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are provided for information purposes only and are not measures of financial performance under GAAP. 



Management believes the presentation of these financial measures reflecting non-GAAP adjustments provides important supplemental information in evaluating the operating results of the Company as distinct from results that include items that are not indicative of ongoing operating results; in particular, those charges and credits that are not directly related to operating unit performance, and that are not a helpful measure of the performance of our underlying business particularly in light of their unpredictable nature. These non-GAAP disclosures have limitations as analytical tools, should not be viewed as a substitute for revenue and net income determined in accordance with GAAP, and should not be considered in isolation or as 



22 



Table of Contents 



a substitute for analysis of the Companys results as reported under GAAP, nor are they necessarily comparable to non-GAAP performance measures that may be presented by other companies. In addition, supplemental presentation should not be construed as an inference that the Companys future results will be unaffected by similar adjustments to net income determined in accordance with GAAP. 



The Company believes that revenue excluding foreign currency exchange impacts is a useful measure in analyzing organic sales results. The Company excludes the effect of currency translation from revenue for this measure because currency translation is not under managements control, is subject to volatility and can obscure underlying business trends. The portion of revenue attributable to currency translation is calculated as the difference between the current period revenue and the current period revenue after applying foreign exchange rates from the prior period. 



The Company believes EBITDA is often a useful measure of a Companys operating performance and is a significant basis used by the Companys management to measure the operating performance of the Companys business because EBITDA excludes charges for depreciation, amortization and interest expense that have resulted from our debt financings, as well as our provision for income tax expense. EBITDA is frequently used as one of the bases for comparing businesses in the Companys industry. 



The Company also believes that Adjusted EBITDA provides helpful information about the operating performance of its business. Adjusted EBITDA excludes stock compensation expense, as well as certain income or expenses which are not indicative of the ongoing performance of the Company. EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA do not represent and should not be considered as an alternative to net income, operating income, net cash provided by operating activities or any other measure for determining operating performance or liquidity that is calculated in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. 



The Companys calculation of revenues excluding foreign currency exchange impacts for the quarter ended March 31, 2019 is as follows:

Liquidity and Capital Resources 



The Companys liquidity position as measured by cash and cash equivalents decreased by $1,511 to a balance of $10,184 at March 31, 2019 from December 31, 2018. 



  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 



During the first quarter of 2019, the decrease in cash provided by operating activities is primarily due to an increase in working capital needs to support the sequential quarter, primarily for trade receivables. 



The significant cash used in investing activities in the first quarter 2018 reflects the acquisition the Maval OE Steering business. Purchases of property and equipment were $2,505 during the first quarter 2019 compared to $2,222 for the first quarter 2018. Capital expenditures are expected to increase for the remainder of 2019 to support our continued growth. The Company expects to invest between $15 million and $18 million in capital expenditures during 2019. 



During 2019, the Company utilized revolver borrowings to fund working capital to support the growth seen from fourth quarter 2018 along with the payment of annual incentive compensation amounts. The cash used in financing activities in first quarter 2018 reflects the use of the revolver to partially finance the acquisition of the Maval OE Steering business. At March 31, 2019, we had $129,502 of obligations under the Revolving Facility excluding the unamortized debt issue costs. 



The Credit Agreement contains certain financial covenants related to minimum interest coverage and total leverage ratio at the end of each quarter. The Credit Agreement also includes other covenants and restrictions, including limits on the amount of additional indebtedness, and restrictions on the ability to merge, consolidate or sell all or substantially all our assets. We were in compliance with all covenants at March 31, 2019. 



As of March 31, 2019, the amount available to borrow under the Credit Agreement was approximately $45,498. The Credit Agreement matures in October 2021. 



There were no borrowings for the China Facility balance during the quarter ended March 31, 2019. 



The Company declared dividends of $0.030 per share during the first quarter 2019 and $0.025 per share during the first quarter of 2018. The Companys working capital, capital expenditure and dividend requirements are expected to be funded from cash provided by operations and amounts available under the Credit Agreement.
