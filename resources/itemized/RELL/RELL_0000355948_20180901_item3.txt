ITEM 3.
QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK
Risk Management and Market Sensitive Financial Instruments
We are exposed to many different market risks with the various industries we serve.
The primary financial risk we are exposed to is foreign currency exchange, as certain operations, assets and liabilities of ours are denominated in foreign currencies.
We manage these risks through normal operating and financing activities.
The interpretation and analysis of these disclosures should not be considered in isolation since such variances in exchange rates would likely influence other economic factors.
Such factors, which are not readily quantifiable, would likely also affect our operations.
Additional disclosure regarding various market risks are set forth in Part I, Item 1A, “Risk Factors“ of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended June 2, 2018, filed August 2, 2018.
