LEGAL PROCEEDINGS
On December 5, 2017, Steven H. Busch filed a Verified Stockholder Derivative Complaint against Edward J. Richardson, Paul Plante, Jacques Belin, James Benham, Kenneth Halverson and the Company in the Delaware Court of Chancery, captioned Steven H. Busch v. Edward J. Richardson, et al., C.A.
No.
2017-0868-AGB.
The lawsuit alleges claims for breach of fiduciary duty by the Company’s directors and challenges the decision of a special committee of the Company’s Board to refuse Mr. Busch’s demand that the Company’s Board, among other things, rescind the Company’s May 2013 repurchase of stock from Mr. Richardson and May 2013 and October 2014 repurchases of Company stock from the Richardson Wildlife Foundation.
On September 21, 2018, the court heard oral arguments on the Company’s March 9, 2018 motion to dismiss the lawsuit.
On November 14, 2018, the Court of Chancery issued a ruling granting defendant’s motion to dismiss and dismissed the case with prejudice.
The plaintiff’s time to appeal the Court of Chancery dismissal expired December 14, 2018.
No notice of appeal was filed.
The case is concluded.
