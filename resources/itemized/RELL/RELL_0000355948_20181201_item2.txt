Sales for PMT increased 7.5%, sales for Canvys decreased 3.1% and sales for Healthcare increased 7.6%. The increase in PMT was mainly due to major growth in our new technology partners in RF and microwave components and power conversion and market share gains in the RF and microwave tube business. The decrease in Canvys was due to several large non-recurring orders that shipped in the second quarter of fiscal 2018. The increase in Healthcare was due to higher CT tube sales and increasing equipment sales, partially offset by lower part sales.

Income Tax Provision 



We recorded an income tax provision of $0.4 million and $0.6 million for the first six months of fiscal 2019 and the first six months of fiscal 2018, respectively. The effective income tax rate during the first six months of fiscal 2019 was a tax provision of 77.9%, as compared to a tax provision of 90.9% during the first six months of fiscal 2018. The difference in rate during the first six months of fiscal 2019, as compared to the first six months of fiscal 2018, reflects the changes in our geographical distribution of income (loss), the recording of provision to return true-ups of various foreign jurisdictions and our positions with respect to ASC 740-30, Income Taxes - Other Considerations or Special Areas. The 77.9% effective income tax rate differs from the federal statutory rate of 21% as a result of our geographical distribution of income (loss) and the movement of the valuation allowance against our U.S. state and federal net deferred tax assets.  



In the normal course of business, we are subject to examination by taxing authorities throughout the world. Generally, years prior to fiscal 2008 are closed for examination under the statute of limitation for U.S. federal, U.S. state and local or non-U.S. tax jurisdictions. We are currently under examination in Thailand (fiscal 2008 through 2011). Our primary foreign tax jurisdictions are Germany and the Netherlands. We have tax years open in Germany beginning in fiscal 2015 and the Netherlands beginning in fiscal 2012.
