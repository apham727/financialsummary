ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS



We encourage you to carefully consider the risk factors identified in Item 1A. “Risk Factors” of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018. These risk factors could materially affect our business, financial condition, and future results and could cause our actual business and financial results to differ materially from those contained in forward-looking statements made in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q or elsewhere by management from time to time.



There have been no material changes during the three months ended March 31, 2019 to the risk factors disclosed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018.

We have established a pre-arranged stock repurchase plan, intended to comply with the requirements of Rule 10b5-1 under the Exchange Act, and Rule 10b-18 under the Exchange Act (the “10b5-1 Plan”). All stock repurchases under the Current Program during closed trading window periods will be made pursuant to the 10b5-1 Plan.
