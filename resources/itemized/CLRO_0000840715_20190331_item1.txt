1. Business Description, Basis of Presentation and Significant Accounting Policies 



Business Description: 



ClearOne, Inc., together with its subsidiaries (collectively, “ClearOne” or the “Company”), is a global market leader enabling conferencing, collaboration, and AV streaming solutions for voice and visual communications. The performance and simplicity of our advanced, comprehensive solutions offer unprecedented levels of functionality, reliability and scalability. 



Basis of Presentation: 



The fiscal year for ClearOne is the twelve months ending on December 31. The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of ClearOne and its subsidiaries. All significant inter-company accounts and transactions have been eliminated. 



These accompanying interim unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared by the Company pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) and are not audited. Certain information and footnote disclosures that are usually included in financial statements prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (“GAAP”) have been either condensed or omitted in accordance with SEC rules and regulations. The accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements contain all adjustments, consisting of normal recurring accruals, necessary for a fair presentation of our financial position as of March 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018, the results of operations for the three months ended March 31, 2019 and 2018, and the cash flows for the three months ended March 31, 2019 and 2018. The results of operations for the three months ended March 31, 2019 and 2018 are not necessarily indicative of the results for a full-year period. These interim unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the financial statements included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018 filed with the SEC. 



Significant Accounting Policies: 



The significant accounting policies were described in Note 1 to the audited consolidated financial statements included in the Company’s annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018. There have been no changes to these policies during the three months ended March 31, 2019 that are of significance or potential significance to the Company except for the change in accounting for leases as described below. 



Recent accounting standard related to Leases: In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02, Leases (“ASU 2016-02”). This new standard establishes a right-of-use (ROU) model that requires a lessee to record a ROU asset and a lease liability on the balance sheet for all leases with terms longer than 12 months. Leases will be classified as either finance or operating, with classification affecting the pattern of expense recognition in the income statement. ASU 2016-02 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted. In July 2018, the FASB issued ASU No. 2018-11 which provides an alternative transition method that allows entities to apply the new leases standard at the adoption date and recognize a cumulative-effect adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings in the period of adoption. The Company has adopted the requirements of ASU 2016-02 on January 1, 2019, the first day of fiscal year 2019, using the optional transition method. The Company elected to use certain practical expedient options, which allows an entity not to reassess whether any existing or expired contracts contain leases. There was an increase in assets of $2,966 and liabilities of $3,101 due to the recognition of the required right-of-use asset and corresponding liability for all lease obligations that are currently classified as operating leases with the difference of $135 related to existing deferred rent that reduced the ROU asset recorded. The standard did not have a material impact on our condensed consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss.

Accounting Policy related to Leases: We determine if an arrangement is a lease at inception. Operating leases are included in operating lease - right of use (“ROU”) assets, accrued liabilities, and operating lease liability in our consolidated balance sheets. As of adoption of ASC 842 and as of March 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018, the Company was not party to finance lease arrangements. 



ROU assets represent our right to use an underlying asset for the lease term and operating lease liabilities represent our obligation to make lease payments arising from the lease. Operating lease ROU assets and operating lease liabilities are recognized at the commencement date based on the present value of lease payments over the lease term. As most of our leases do not provide an implicit rate, we use our incremental borrowing rate based on the information available at commencement date in determining the present value of lease payments. We use the implicit rate when readily determinable. The operating lease ROU asset also includes any lease payments made and excludes lease incentives. Our lease terms may include options to extend or terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain that we will exercise that option. Lease expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term. 



Under the available practical expedient, we account for the lease and non-lease components as a single lease component. 



Other recent accounting pronouncements: The Company has determined that other recently issued accounting standards will either have no material impact on its consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows, or will not apply to its operations.  



2. Revenue Information 



The following table disaggregates the Company’s revenue into primary product groups: 



 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]  



 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]   



3. Earnings (Loss) Per Share 



Earnings (loss) per common share is computed based on the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding and, when appropriate, dilutive potential common stock outstanding during the period. Stock options are considered to be potential common stock. The computation of diluted earnings (loss) per share does not assume exercise or conversion of securities that would have an anti-dilutive effect. 



Basic earnings (loss) per common share is the amount of net earnings (loss) for the period available to each weighted-average share of common stock outstanding during the reporting period. Diluted earnings (loss) per common share is the amount of earnings (loss) for the period available to each weighted-average share of common stock outstanding during the reporting period and to each share of potential common stock outstanding during the period, unless inclusion of potential common stock would have an anti-dilutive effect.

4. Marketable Securities 



The Company has classified its marketable securities as available-for-sale securities. These securities are carried at estimated fair value with unrealized holding gains and losses included in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) in stockholders’ equity until realized. Gains and losses on marketable security transactions are reported on the specific-identification method. Dividend and interest income are recognized when earned. 



The amortized cost, gross unrealized holding gains, gross unrealized holding losses, and fair value for available-for-sale securities by major security type and class of securities at March 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018 were as follows:

Debt securities in an unrealized loss position as of March 31, 2019 were not deemed impaired at acquisition and subsequent declines in fair value are not deemed attributed to declines in credit quality. Management believes that it is more likely than not that the securities will receive a full recovery of par value, although there can be no assurance that such recovery will occur. The available-for-sale marketable securities with continuous gross unrealized loss position for less than 12 months and 12 months or greater and their related fair values were as follows:

Long-term inventory represents inventory held in excess of our current (next 12 months) requirements based on our recent sales and forecasted level of sales. We expect to sell the above inventory, net of reserves, at or above the stated cost and believe that no loss will be incurred on its sale, although there can be no assurance of the timing or amount of any sales. 



Net loss incurred on valuation of inventory at lower of cost or market value and write-off of obsolete inventory during the three months ended March 31, 2019 and 2018 was $185 and $255, respectively.

 10. Fair Value Measurements 



The fair value of the Company’s financial instruments reflects the amounts that the Company estimates it will receive in connection with the sale of an asset or pay in connection with the transfer of a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date (exit price). The fair value hierarchy prioritizes the use of inputs used in valuation techniques into the following three levels: 



Level 1 - Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities. 



Level 2 - Observable inputs other than quoted prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities; quoted prices in markets that are not active; or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities. This category generally includes U.S. Government and agency securities; municipal securities; mutual funds and securities sold and not yet settled. 



Level 3 - Unobservable inputs.

11. Income Taxes 



The current year loss did not result in income tax benefit due to recording a full valuation allowance against expected benefits. The valuation allowance was recorded as we concluded that it was more likely than not that our deferred tax assets were not realizable primarily due to the Company's recent pre-tax losses.
