Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures



We maintain disclosure controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in reports filed under the Securities Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"), is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the specified time periods, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to management, including our Chief Executive Officer ("CEO") and Interim Chief Financial Officer ("CFO"), as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.

Based on that evaluation, our CEO and CFO concluded that, as of that date, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective.
