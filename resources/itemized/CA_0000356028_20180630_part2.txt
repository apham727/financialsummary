Item 1A. RISK FACTORS



Current and potential stockholders should consider carefully the risk factors described in more detail in our 2018 Form 10-K. There were no material changes to such risk factors, except to include the risk factors described below. Any of these factors, or others, many of which are beyond our control, could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, operating results, cash flow and stock price.



The announcement and pendency of our agreement to be acquired by Broadcom may have an adverse effect on our business and operating results.



On July 11, 2018, we entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the “Merger Agreement”) with Broadcom Inc. (“Broadcom”) under which Broadcom agreed to acquire us subject to the terms and conditions set forth therein. Our pending acquisition by Broadcom may have an adverse effect on our revenue in the near term if our customers delay, defer, or cancel purchases pending completion of the transaction. In addition, the announcement and pendency of the transaction may cause reluctance by customers to begin or continue to do business with us due to potential uncertainty about the direction of our products and solutions following consummation of the transaction. We are subject to additional risks in connection with the announcement and pendency of the proposed transaction, including:



•Difficulties maintaining existing and/or establishing business relationships, including relationships with significant customers, suppliers, channel partners, and other business partners;



•Disruption to our business, including increased costs and diversion of management time and resources that could otherwise have been devoted to other opportunities that may have been beneficial to us;



•The restrictions imposed on our business and operations pursuant to certain covenants set forth in the Merger Agreement, which may prevent us from pursuing certain opportunities, responding to competitive pressures and industry developments, or taking certain actions without Broadcom’s approval;



•Adverse effects on our ability to attract, recruit, retain and motivate current and prospective employees who may be uncertain about their future roles following completion of the proposed transaction, and the possibility that our employees could lose productivity as a result of uncertainty regarding their employment following the proposed transaction;



•The pendency and outcome of the legal proceedings that have been or may be instituted against us, our directors, executive officers and others relating to the proposed transaction; and



•The diversion of our employees’ attention due to activities related to the proposed transaction.



The failure to complete our pending acquisition by Broadcom may adversely affect our business, financial condition, operating results, and stock price.



Consummation of the Broadcom transaction remains subject to certain customary closing conditions, including, without limitation, adoption of the Merger Agreement by the Company’s stockholders and the absence of legal impediments and regulatory clearances in the United States, the European Union and Japan. There can be no assurance that these conditions to the completion of the merger will be satisfied in a timely manner or at all. If the merger is not completed, our stock price could fall to the extent its current price reflects an assumption that the acquisition will be completed. Furthermore, if the acquisition is not completed, we may suffer other consequences that could adversely affect our business, financial condition, operating results, and stock price, including the following:



•Any disruptions to our business resulting from the announcement and pendency of the proposed transaction, including adverse changes in our relationships with customers, suppliers, channel partners, other business partners and employees, may continue or intensify in the event the acquisition is not consummated or is significantly delayed;



•We would have incurred significant costs, including professional services fees and other transaction costs, in connection with the proposed transaction that we would be unable to recover;



•We may have to pay Broadcom a termination fee of $566 million under certain circumstances that give rise to the termination of the Merger Agreement;



•We may be subject to negative publicity or be negatively perceived by the investment or business communities;



•We may be subject to legal proceedings related to the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement;



43

•We may not be able to take advantage of alternative business opportunities or effectively respond to competitive pressures; and



•We may experience a departure of employees.



The Merger Agreement with Broadcom limits our ability to pursue alternative transactions, which could deter a third party from proposing an alternative transaction.



The Merger Agreement contains provisions that limit our ability to pursue an alternative acquisition transaction. These or other provisions may discourage a potential competing acquirer that might have an interest in acquiring all or a significant part of us from considering or proposing an acquisition or might result in a potential competing acquirer proposing to pay a lower per share price to acquire us than it might otherwise have proposed to pay.
