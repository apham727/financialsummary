  Forward-Looking statements. Certain statements contained in this report are not based on historical facts, but are forward-looking statements that are based upon various assumptions about future conditions. Actual events in the future could differ materially from those described in the forward-looking information. Numerous unknown factors and future events could cause such differences, including but not limited to, product demand, market acceptance, success of marketing strategy, success of expansion efforts, impact of competition, adverse economic conditions, and other factors affecting the Company’s business that are beyond the Company’s control, which are discussed elsewhere in this report. Consequently, no forward-looking statement can be guaranteed. The Company undertakes no obligation to publicly update forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.

 Overview. The Company reflected a loss before income tax benefit of $83,900 for the three months ended March 31, 2018 compared to income before tax expense of $82,900 for the three months ended March 31, 2017, primarily due to increase in contingent consideration liability resulting from increased royalty revenues for the Bioprocessing Systems Operations. The Company reflected a loss before income tax benefit of $374,100 for the nine months ended March 31, 2018 compared to income before income tax expense of $78,200 for the nine months ended March 31, 2017 mainly due to the increase in contingent consideration liability for the Bioprocessing Systems Operations and reduced income from the Catalyst Research Instruments Operations resulting from decreased catalyst research instrument sales. The results reflected total non-cash amounts for depreciation, amortization and contingent consideration liability adjustments totaling $521,700 and $675,800 for the three and nine month periods ended March 31, 2018 compared to $87,100 and $276,500 for the corressponding three and nine month periods in 2017.



  Results of Operations. 



  The Three months ended March 31, 2018 Compared with The Three Months Ended March 31, 2017 



 Net revenues for the three months ended March 31, 2018 increased $188,400 (9.9%) to $2,099,300 from $1,910,900 for the three months ended March 31, 2017, reflecting an increase of $297,600 in royalty revenues earned by the Bioprocessing Systems Operations, $139,900 increase in net sales of benchtop laboratory equipment, partially offset by a $249,100 decrease in catalyst research instruments sales due to decreased orders from Original Equipment Manufacturer ("OEM") customers and lack of large orders. As of March 31, 2018, the order backlog for catalyst research instruments was $1,175,800, all of which is expected to be shipped during fiscal year ending June 30, 2018, compared to $431,200 as of March 31, 2017. 



 The overall gross profit percentage for the three months ended March 31, 2018 was 36.6% compared to 44.8% for the three months ended March 31, 2017 due to adjustment for increased contingent consideration from increased royalty revenues for the Bioprocessing Systems Operations. 



 General and administrative expenses increased by $35,100 (8.1%) to $470,200 for the three months ended March 31, 2018 compared to $435,100 for the three months ended March 31, 2017 due to various incremental increases across the three operational segments. 



 Selling expenses for the three months ended March 31, 2018 increased $39,900 (17.8%) to $263,800 from $223,900 for the three months ended March 31, 2017, due to higher selling and marketing expenses by the Benchtop Laboratory Equipment Operations primarily for new products. 



 Research and development expenses amounted to $117,700 for the three months ended March 31, 2018 and $114,100 for the three months ended March 31, 2017. 



 The Company reflected an income tax benefit of $46,200 for the three months ended March 31, 2018 compared to income tax expense of $17,300 for the three months ended March 31, 2017, primarily due to the loss for the period. 



 As a result of the foregoing, the Company recorded a net loss of $37,700 for the three months ended March 31, 2018 compared to net income of $65,600 for the three months ended March 31, 2017. 



  The Nine months ended March 31, 2018 Compared with The Nine months ended March 31, 2017 



 Net revenues for the nine months ended March 31, 2018 decreased $881,200 (14.3%) to $5,272,600 from $6,153,800 for the nine months ended March 31, 2017, reflecting a decrease of $1,336,400 in net sales of catalyst research instruments due to decreased orders from OEM customers and lack of large orders during the beginning of the year, partially offset by an increase of $101,900 in sales of benchtop laboratory equipment and $353,300 increase in bioprocessing royalties earned. 



 The overall gross profit percentage for both the nine months ended March 31, 2018 and 2017 was 37.7%. 



 General and administrative expenses for the nine months ended March 31, 2018 increased $49,900 (4.0%) to $1,306,600 compared to $1,256,700 for the nine months ended March 31, 2017 due to various incremental increases across the three operational segments. 



 Selling expenses for the nine months ended March 31, 2018 increased $14,700 (2.2%) to $679,500 from $664,800 for the nine months ended March 31, 2017, due to higher selling and marketing expenses by the Benchtop Laboratory Equipment Operations primarily for new products. 



 Research and development expenses increased by $45,200 (13.5%) to $379,700 for the nine months ended March 31, 2018 compared to $334,500 for the nine months ended March 31, 2017, primarily due to increased new product development costs incurred by the Benchtop Laboratory Equipment Operations related to the Torbal Scales Division. 



 Total other income decreased by $7,200 (52.9%) to $6,400 for the nine months ended March 31, 2018 from $13,600 for the nine months ended March 31, 2018 due to a gain on a sale of investment securities last year. 



 12  



 The Company reflected an income tax benefit of $22,600 for the nine months ended March 31, 2018 compared to $16,000 tax expense for the nine months ended March 31, 2017, primarily due to the loss for the period. 



 As a result of the foregoing, the Company recorded a net loss of $351,500 for the nine months ended March 31, 2018 compared to net income of $62,200 for the nine months ended March 31, 2017. 



  Liquidity and Capital Resources. Cash and cash equivalents decreased by $346,500 to $678,600 as of March 31, 2018 from $1,025,100 as of June 30, 2017 primarily due to increased inventories partially offset by customer advances. 



  Net cash used in operating activities was $150,200 for the nine months ended March 31, 2018 compared to $204,800 provided during the nine months ended March 31, 2017. The current period reflected increased inventories due to new products and work in process for catalyst research instruments partially offset by an adjustment to the fair value of contingent consideration liability and customer advances. Net cash used in investing activities was $88,600 for the nine months ended March 31, 2018 compared to $38,600 used during the nine months ended March 31, 2017 principally due to new capital equipment purchased during the current year period by the Benchtop Laboratory Equipment Operations. The Company used $107,700 in financing activities in the nine months ended March 31, 2018 compared to $199,900 in the nine months ended March 31, 2017, principally because the Company paid a dividend last year, and paid more in contingent consideration in last year’s same period. 



  The Company's working capital amounted to $3,777,800 as of March 31, 2018 and $3,728,500, as of June 30, 2017. 



  The Company has a Demand Line of Credit through June 2018 with First National Bank of Pennsylvania which provides for borrowings of up to $300,000 for regular working capital needs, bearing interest at prime, currently 4.75%. Advances on the line, are secured by a pledge of the Company’s assets including inventory, accounts, chattel paper, equipment and general intangibles of the Company. As of March 31, 2018 $40,000 which was borrowed by our subsidiary, Altamira Instruments, was outstanding under such line. 



  Management believes that the Company will be able to meet its cash flow needs during the 12 months ending June 30, 2018 from its available financial resources including its line of credit, its cash and investment securities, and operations.

 Item 4. Controls and Procedures 



  Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures. As of the end of the period covered by this report, the Company's management performed an evaluation of the effectiveness of its disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934). Based on this evaluation, the Chief Executive and Chief Financial Officer of the Company has concluded that the Company's disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of March 31, 2018, because of the identification of a material weakness in internal control over financial reporting which related to the accounting for the fair market value of a contingent consideration liability related to its Bioprocessing Systems Operations. Notwithstanding the material weakness that existed as of March 31, 2018, the Chief Executive and Chief Financial Officer of the Company has concluded that the financial statements included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position, results of operations, and cash flows of the Company and its subsidiaries in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ("GAAP").
