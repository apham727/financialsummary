Item 4. Controls and Procedures 



Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 



We maintain disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”) that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in Exchange Act reports is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission’s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 



As of June 30, 2019, we carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures. Based on the foregoing, our chief executive officer and chief financial officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of the end of the period covered by this report. 



Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting  



On April 1, 2019, we adopted the new lease standard, as discussed in Note 1. “Description of Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies” and Note 4. “Leases” accompanying the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements included within Item 1. “Financial Statements” of this report. As a result, we made additions and/or modifications to policies, procedures, systems and controls that have materially affected our internal control over financial reporting, including changes to accounting policies and procedures, operational processes and documentation practices.
