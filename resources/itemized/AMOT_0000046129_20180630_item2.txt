Operating Results

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 



NET INCOME: Net income increased during the second quarter due to a significant increase in revenues and the leveraging of fixed cost compared to the second quarter of 2017. The increase in revenue was partially offset by higher operating expenses, mainly additional incentive compensation expense and investments in E&D and the One Allied organizational buildout in support of our aggressive growth strategy. 



EBITDA AND ADJUSTED EBITDA: EBITDA was $9,263 for the second quarter of 2018 compared to $6,417 for the same quarter last year. Adjusted EBITDA was $10,026 and $6,905 for the second quarter of 2018 and 2017, respectively. EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA are non-GAAP measurements. EBITDA consists of income before interest expense, provision for income taxes, and depreciation and amortization. Adjusted EBITDA also excludes stock compensation expense and certain other items. Refer to information included in Non - GAAP Measures below for a reconciliation of net income to EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA.

Sales to U.S. customers were 52% of total sales for the quarter compared with 54% for the same period last year, with the balance of sales to customers primarily in Europe, Canada and Asia. The overall increase in revenue was due to a 29% volume increase and a 4% favorable currency impact. 



ORDER BOOKINGS AND BACKLOG: The increase in bookings in the second quarter of 2018 compared to the second quarter of 2017 is largely due to organic growth across all of the major markets served by the company.

AMORTIZATION OF INTANGIBLE ASSETS: Amortization expense increased 10% to $878 in the second quarter of 2018 compared to the second quarter of 2017 due to the increase in intangible assets from the acquisition of the Maval OE Steering business. 



INCOME TAXES: The effective income tax rate as a percentage of income before income taxes was 27.4% and 31.8% in the second quarter 2018 and 2017, respectively.

Non-GAAP Measures 



EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are provided for information purposes only and are not measures of financial performance under GAAP. 



Management believes the presentation of these financial measures reflecting non-GAAP adjustments provides important supplemental information in evaluating the operating results of the Company as distinct from results that include items that are not indicative of ongoing operating results; in particular, those charges and credits that are not directly related to operating unit performance, and that are not a helpful measure of the performance of our underlying business particularly in light of their unpredictable nature. This non-GAAP disclosure has limitations as an analytical tool, should not be viewed as a substitute for net income determined in accordance with GAAP, and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of the Companys results as reported under GAAP, nor is it necessarily comparable to non-GAAP performance measures that may be presented by other companies. In addition, supplemental presentation should not be construed as an inference that the Companys future results will be unaffected by similar adjustments to net income determined in accordance with GAAP. 



The Company believes EBITDA is often a useful measure of a Companys operating performance and is a significant basis used by the Companys management to measure the operating performance of the Companys business because EBITDA excludes charges for depreciation, amortization and interest expense that have resulted from our debt financings, as well as our provision for income tax expense. EBITDA is frequently used as one of the bases for comparing businesses in the Companys industry. 



The Company also believes that Adjusted EBITDA provides helpful information about the operating performance of its business. Adjusted EBITDA excludes stock compensation expense, as well as certain income or expenses which are not indicative of the ongoing performance of the Company. EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA do not represent and should not be considered as an alternative to net income, operating income, net cash provided by operating activities or any other measure for determining operating performance or liquidity that is calculated in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 



Operating cash flow is flat for the six months ended June 30, 2018 compared to 2017. The increase in net income in 2018 is offset by increases in working capital needs due to the Maval OE Steering business acquisition and Company growth. 



The significant cash used in investing activities in 2018 reflects the acquisition the Maval OE Steering business during the quarter. Also during the six months ended June 30, 2018, purchases of property and equipment were $5,555 compared to $2,677 for the six months ended June 30, 2017. Capital expenditures are expected to increase throughout 2018 to support our new contract wins along with our continued IT infrastructure enhancements. The Company expects to invest between $13 million and $16 million in capital expenditures during 2018. 



The change in cash used in financing activities reflects the 2018 use of the revolver to partially finance the acquisition of the Maval OE Steering business. During the second quarter 2018, we utilized our foreign revolver to make a $1,500 capital investment into our Changzhou operation to fund expansion and future capital spending in support of recently announced contract wins. During the six months ended June 30, 2018, we made payments of $2,500 for our Revolving Facility obligation compared to $6,000 for the same period in 2017. At June 30, 2018, we had $64,982 of obligations under the Revolving Facility. 



The Credit Agreement contains certain financial covenants related to minimum interest coverage and total leverage ratio at the end of each quarter.
