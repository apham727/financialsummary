 Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.  



 Interest Rate Risk:  



 We are exposed to an immaterial level of market risk from changes in interest rates. We have from time to time previously used interest rate swap agreements to modify variable rate obligations to fixed rate obligations, thereby reducing our exposure to interest rate fluctuations. We had no long-term variable rate debt obligations as of December 24, 2017. Based on December 24, 2017 borrowing levels, a 1.0% increase or decrease in current market interest rates would have an immaterial effect on our statement of income.   



 Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Risk:  



 We are exposed to an immaterial level of market risk from changes in foreign currency rates. Almost all of our sales are made in U.S. Dollars so we have an immaterial amount of foreign currency risk. Those sales not made in U.S. Dollars are made in Canadian Dollars.
