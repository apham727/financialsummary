Quarterly Highlights

Business Seasonality and Product Introductions

The Company has historically experienced higher net sales in its first quarter compared to other quarters in its fiscal year due in part to seasonal holiday demand.
The foregoing statement regarding the Company’s expected total gross margin percentage in the third quarter of 2019 is forward-looking and could differ from actual results.
The Company’s future gross margins can be impacted by multiple factors including, but not limited to, those set forth in Part II, Item 1A of this Form 10-Q under the heading “Risk Factors” and those described in this paragraph.
In general, the Company believes gross margins will be subject to volatility and remain under downward pressure due to a variety of factors, including: continued industry-wide global product pricing pressures and product pricing actions that the Company may take in response to such pressures; increased competition; the Company’s ability to effectively stimulate demand for certain of its products and services; compressed product life cycles; potential increases in the cost of components, outside manufacturing services, and acquiring and delivering content for the Company’s services; the Company’s ability to manage product quality and warranty costs effectively; shifts in the mix of products and services, or in the geographic, currency or channel mix; fluctuations in exchange rates; and costs associated with the Company’s frequent introductions and transitions of products and services.
Operating Expenses

The Company’s effective tax rate for the first six months of 2019 was lower compared to the same period in 2018 due primarily to higher taxes in 2018 arising from the remeasurement of deferred tax assets and liabilities as a result of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the “Act”) and a lower statutory federal income tax rate in 2019, partially offset by higher taxes on foreign earnings in 2019.
