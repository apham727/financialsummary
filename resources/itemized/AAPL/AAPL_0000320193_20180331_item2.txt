Business Strategy







Business Seasonality and Product Introductions



The Company has historically experienced higher net sales in its first quarter compared to other quarters in its fiscal year due in part to seasonal holiday demand. Additionally, new product introductions can significantly impact net sales, product costs and operating expenses. Product introductions can also impact the Company’s net sales to its indirect distribution channels as these channels are filled with new product inventory following a product introduction, and channel inventory of a particular product often declines as the next related major product launch approaches. Net sales can also be affected when consumers and distributors anticipate a product introduction. However, neither historical seasonal patterns nor historical patterns of product introductions should be considered reliable indicators of the Company’s future pattern of product introductions, future net sales or financial performance.



Fiscal Period



The Company’s fiscal year is the 52- or 53-week period that ends on the last Saturday of September. The first quarter of 2018 spanned 13 weeks, whereas a 14th week was added to the first quarter of 2017, as is done every five or six years, to realign fiscal quarters with calendar quarters.



Second Quarter Fiscal 2018 Highlights



Net sales increased 16% or $8.2 billion during the second quarter of 2018 compared to the same quarter in 2017, primarily driven by higher net sales of iPhone, Services and Other Products. Year-over-year net sales increased in each of the geographic reportable segments. Additionally, the strength in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar had a favorable impact on net sales during the second quarter of 2018 compared to the same quarter in 2017.



The Company began shipping HomePod in February 2018. In March 2018, the Company introduced a new 9.7-inch iPad with Apple Pencil® compatibility, which began shipping at the end of the second quarter of 2018.



The Company spent $23.5 billion to repurchase shares of its common stock and paid dividends and dividend equivalents of $3.2 billion during the second quarter of 2018.

Americas includes both North and South America. Europe includes European countries, as well as India, the Middle East and Africa. Greater China includes China, Hong Kong and Taiwan. Rest of Asia Pacific includes Australia and those Asian countries not included in the Company’s other reportable segments. Although the reportable segments provide similar hardware and software products and similar services, each one is managed separately to better align with the location of the Company’s customers and distribution partners and the unique market dynamics of each geographic region. Further information regarding the Company’s reportable segments can be found in Part I, Item 1 of this Form 10-Q in the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements in Note 10, “Segment Information and Geographic Data.”

Japan







Japan net sales increased during the second quarter and first six months of 2018 compared to the same periods in 2017 due primarily to higher net sales of iPhone and Services. Additionally, the value of the Japanese Yen relative to the U.S. dollar had a favorable impact on Japan net sales during the second quarter of 2018 and an unfavorable impact during the first six months of 2018.



Rest of Asia Pacific

Additionally, year-over-year Rest of Asia Pacific net sales increased during the first six months of 2018 due primarily to higher net sales of iPhone and Services.





Gross Margin







Gross margin increased during the second quarter and first six months of 2018 compared to the same periods in 2017 due primarily to a favorable shift in mix of products and Services, partially offset by higher product cost structures. Additionally, to a lesser extent the strength in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar had a favorable impact on gross margin.



Gross margin percentage decreased during the second quarter and first six months of 2018 compared to the same periods in 2017 due primarily to higher product cost structures, partially offset by a favorable shift in mix of products and Services. Additionally, to a lesser extent the strength in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar had a favorable impact on gross margin percentage. 



The Company anticipates gross margin percentage during the third quarter of 2018 to be between 38.0% and 38.5%. The foregoing statement regarding the Company’s expected gross margin percentage in the third quarter of 2018 is forward-looking and could differ from actual results. The Company’s future gross margins can be impacted by multiple factors including, but not limited to, those set forth in Part II, Item 1A of this Form 10-Q under the heading “Risk Factors” and those described in this paragraph. In general, the Company believes gross margins will remain under downward pressure due to a variety of factors, including: continued industry-wide global product pricing pressures; increased competition; the Company’s ability to effectively stimulate demand for certain of its products; compressed product life cycles; product transitions; potential increases in the cost of components and outside manufacturing services; the Company’s ability to manage product quality and warranty costs effectively; and a potential shift in the Company’s sales mix towards products with lower gross margins. In response to competitive pressures, the Company expects it will continue to take product pricing actions, which would adversely affect gross margins. Due to the Company’s significant international operations, its financial condition and operating results, including gross margins, could be significantly affected by fluctuations in exchange rates.



Operating Expenses







Research and Development





Selling, General and Administrative



The growth in selling, general and administrative expense during the second quarter and first six months of 2018 compared to the same periods in 2017 was driven primarily by increases in headcount-related expenses and infrastructure-related costs.













Provision for Income Taxes







On December 22, 2017, the U.S. enacted the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the “Act”), which significantly changed U.S. tax law. The Act lowered the Company’s U.S. statutory federal income tax rate from 35% to 21% effective January 1, 2018, while also imposing a deemed repatriation tax on previously deferred foreign income. By operation of law, the Company will apply a blended U.S. statutory federal income tax rate of 24.5% for 2018 (the “2018 blended U.S. tax rate”). The Act also created a new minimum tax on certain future foreign earnings.



The Company’s effective tax rate of 14.5% for the second quarter of 2018 was lower than the 2018 blended U.S. tax rate due primarily to the lower tax rate on foreign earnings. The Company’s effective tax rate of 21.6% for the first six months of 2018 was lower than the 2018 blended U.S. tax rate due primarily to the lower tax rate on foreign earnings, partially offset by the remeasurement of deferred tax assets and liabilities as a result of the Act.



The Company’s effective tax rate of 14.5% for the second quarter of 2018 was lower than the same period in 2017 due to the lower 2018 blended U.S. tax rate as a result of the Act. The Company’s effective tax rate of 21.6% for the first six months of 2018 was lower than the same period in 2017 due to the lower 2018 blended U.S. tax rate, partially offset by the remeasurement of deferred tax assets and liabilities as a result of the Act.





The Company is subject to audits by federal, state, local and foreign tax authorities. Management believes that adequate provisions have been made for any adjustments that may result from tax examinations. However, the outcome of tax audits cannot be predicted with certainty. If any issues addressed in the Company’s tax audits are resolved in a manner inconsistent with management’s expectations, the Company could be required to adjust its provision for income taxes in the period such resolution occurs.





On August 30, 2016, the European Commission announced its decision that Ireland granted state aid to the Company by providing tax opinions in 1991 and 2007 concerning the tax allocation of profits of the Irish branches of two subsidiaries of the Company (the “State Aid Decision”). The State Aid Decision orders Ireland to calculate and recover additional taxes from the Company for the period June 2003 through December 2014. Irish legislative changes, effective as of January 2015, eliminated the application of the tax opinions from that date forward. The Company believes the State Aid Decision to be without merit and appealed to the General Court of the Court of Justice of the European Union. Ireland has also appealed the State Aid Decision. Although Ireland is still computing the recovery amount, the Company expects the amount to be in line with the European Commission’s announced recovery amount of €13 billion, plus interest of €1 billion. During the third quarter of 2018, the Company expects to begin funding amounts into escrow, where they will remain pending conclusion of all appeals. The Company believes that any incremental Irish corporate income taxes potentially due related to the State Aid Decision would be creditable against U.S. taxes.



Recent Accounting Pronouncements

Income Taxes





Leases 



In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842) (“ASU 2016-02”), which modifies lease accounting for lessees to increase transparency and comparability by recording lease assets and liabilities for operating leases and disclosing key information about leasing arrangements. The Company will adopt ASU 2016-02 in its first quarter of 2020 utilizing the modified retrospective transition method. While the Company is currently evaluating the impact of adopting ASU 2016-02, based on the lease portfolio as of March 31, 2018, the Company anticipates recording lease assets and liabilities of approximately $9.0 billion on its Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets, with no material impact to its Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations. However, the ultimate impact of adopting ASU 2016-02 will depend on the Company’s lease portfolio as of the adoption date.



Financial Instruments 









Revenue Recognition 



In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606) (“ASU 2014-09”), which amends the existing accounting standards for revenue recognition. ASU 2014-09 is based on principles that govern the recognition of revenue at an amount an entity expects to be entitled when products are transferred to customers.





The new revenue standards may be applied retrospectively to each prior period presented or retrospectively with the cumulative effect recognized as of the date of adoption. The Company will adopt the new revenue standards in its first quarter of 2019 utilizing the full retrospective transition method. The new revenue standards are not expected to have a material impact on the amount and timing of revenue recognized in the Company’s consolidated financial statements.



Liquidity and Capital Resources











The Company believes its existing balances of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities will be sufficient to satisfy its working capital needs, capital asset purchases, outstanding commitments and other liquidity requirements associated with its existing operations over the next 12 months. The Company currently anticipates the cash used for future dividends, the share repurchase program and debt repayments will come from its current cash and cash generated from ongoing operating activities.



In connection with the State Aid Decision, although Ireland is still computing the recovery amount, the Company expects the amount to be in line with the European Commission’s announced recovery amount of €13 billion, plus interest of €1 billion. During the third quarter of 2018, the Company expects to begin funding amounts into escrow, where they will remain pending conclusion of all appeals.



The Company’s marketable securities investment portfolio is primarily invested in highly rated securities, and its investment policy generally limits the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer. The policy generally requires investments to be investment grade, with the primary objective of minimizing the potential risk of principal loss.





During the six months ended March 31, 2018, cash generated by operating activities of $43.4 billion was a result of $33.9 billion of net income and an increase in the net change in operating assets and liabilities of $35.8 billion, partially offset by non-cash adjustments to net income of $26.3 billion. Cash generated by investing activities of $15.1 billion during the six months ended March 31, 2018 consisted primarily of proceeds from sales or maturities of marketable securities, net of purchases, of $22.4 billion, partially offset by cash used to acquire property, plant and equipment of $7.0 billion. Cash used in financing activities of $33.8 billion during the six months ended March 31, 2018 consisted primarily of cash used to repurchase common stock of $32.9 billion and cash used to pay dividends and dividend equivalents of $6.5 billion, partially offset by proceeds from the issuance of term debt, net of $7.0 billion.



During the six months ended April 1, 2017, cash generated by operating activities of $39.8 billion was a result of $28.9 billion of net income, non-cash adjustments to net income of $10.4 billion and an increase in the net change in operating assets and liabilities of $479 million. Cash used in investing activities of $33.3 billion during the six months ended April 1, 2017 consisted primarily of cash used for purchases of marketable securities, net of sales and maturities, of $26.9 billion and cash used to acquire property, plant and equipment of $6.3 billion. Cash used in financing activities of $11.8 billion during the six months ended April 1, 2017 consisted primarily of cash used to repurchase common stock of $18.0 billion and cash used to pay dividends and dividend equivalents of $6.1 billion, partially offset by proceeds from the issuance of term debt, net of $11.0 billion and proceeds from commercial paper, net of $1.9 billion.



Capital Assets



The Company’s capital expenditures were $5.8 billion during the first six months of 2018. The Company anticipates utilizing approximately $16.0 billion for capital expenditures during 2018, which includes product tooling and manufacturing process equipment; data centers; corporate facilities and infrastructure, including information systems hardware, software and enhancements; and retail store facilities.



Debt



The Company issues unsecured short-term promissory notes (“Commercial Paper”) pursuant to a commercial paper program. The Company uses the net proceeds from the commercial paper program for general corporate purposes, including dividends and share repurchases. As of March 31, 2018, the Company had $12.0 billion of Commercial Paper outstanding, with a weighted-average interest rate of 1.68% and maturities generally less than nine months.



As of March 31, 2018, the Company had outstanding floating- and fixed-rate notes with varying maturities for an aggregate principal amount of $111.1 billion (collectively the “Notes”). During the second quarter of 2018, the Company repaid $500 million of its Notes. The Company has entered, and in the future may enter, into interest rate swaps to manage interest rate risk on the Notes. In addition, the Company has entered, and in the future may enter, into foreign currency swaps to manage foreign currency risk on the Notes. 



Further information regarding the Company’s debt issuances and related hedging activity can be found in Part I, Item 1 of this Form 10-Q in the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements in Note 2, “Financial Instruments” and Note 5, “Debt.”



Capital Return Program



As of March 31, 2018, the Company had an authorized capital return program of $300 billion, which included a share repurchase program of up to $210 billion of the Company’s common stock. As of March 31, 2018, $199.6 billion of the share repurchase program had been utilized.











Off–Balance Sheet Arrangements and Contractual Obligations





Operating Leases



As of March 31, 2018, the Company’s total future minimum lease payments under noncancelable operating leases were $9.8 billion. The Company’s retail store and other facility leases typically have original terms not exceeding 10 years and generally contain multi-year renewal options.



Manufacturing Purchase Obligations



The Company utilizes several outsourcing partners to manufacture sub-assemblies for the Company’s products and to perform final assembly and testing of finished products. These outsourcing partners acquire components and build product based on demand information supplied by the Company, which typically covers periods up to 150 days. The Company also obtains individual components for its products from a wide variety of individual suppliers. As of March 31, 2018, the Company expects to pay $27.1 billion under manufacturing-related supplier arrangements, substantially all of which is noncancelable.



Other Purchase Obligations





Other Non-Current Liabilities



The Company’s other non-current liabilities in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets consist primarily of long-term taxes payable of $34.9 billion, and net unrecognized tax benefits and related interest and penalties of $7.5 billion. The Company plans to pay the tax payable in installments in accordance with the Act. The Company is unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate of the timing of payments related to unrecognized tax benefits due to uncertainties in the timing of tax audit outcomes.



Indemnification



Agreements entered into by the Company sometimes include indemnification provisions which may subject the Company to costs and damages in the event of a claim against an indemnified third party. In the opinion of management, there was not at least a reasonable possibility the Company may have incurred a material loss, or a material loss in excess of a recorded accrual, with respect to indemnification of third parties.



The Company offers an iPhone Upgrade Program, which is available to customers who purchase a qualifying iPhone in the U.S., the U.K. and mainland China. The iPhone Upgrade Program provides customers the right to trade in that iPhone for a specified amount when purchasing a new iPhone, provided certain conditions are met. The Company accounts for the trade-in right as a guarantee liability and recognizes arrangement revenue net of the fair value of such right, with subsequent changes to the guarantee liability recognized within revenue.





The Company has entered into indemnification agreements with its directors and executive officers. Under these agreements, the Company has agreed to indemnify such individuals to the fullest extent permitted by law against liabilities that arise by reason of their status as directors or officers of the Company and to advance expenses incurred by such individuals in connection with related legal proceedings. It is not possible to determine the maximum potential amount of payments the Company could be required to make under these agreements due to the limited history of prior indemnification claims and the unique facts and circumstances involved in each claim. While the Company maintains directors and officers liability insurance coverage, such insurance coverage may be insufficient to cover all losses or all types of claims that may arise.



Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates



The preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles and the Company’s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and operating results require the Company’s management to make judgments, assumptions and estimates that affect the amounts reported in its condensed consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions it believes to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities. Actual results may differ from these estimates, and such differences may be material.



Note 1, “Summary of Significant Accounting Policies” in Part I, Item 1 of this Form 10-Q and in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of the 2017 Form 10-K, and “Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates” in Part II, Item 7 of the 2017 Form 10-K describe the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of the Company’s condensed consolidated financial statements. With the exception of Income Taxes, there have been no material changes to the Company’s critical accounting policies and estimates since the 2017 Form 10-K.



Income Taxes



The Company records a tax provision for the anticipated tax consequences of its reported operating results. The provision for income taxes is computed using the asset and liability method, under which deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities, and for operating losses and tax credit carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the currently enacted tax rates that will be in effect for the years in which those tax assets and liabilities are expected to be realized or settled. The Company records a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that is believed more likely than not to be realized.



The Company recognizes tax benefits from uncertain tax positions only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position. The tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such positions are then measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement.



Management believes it is more likely than not that forecasted income, including income that may be generated as a result of certain tax planning strategies, together with future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences, will be sufficient to fully recover the Company’s deferred tax assets. In the event that the Company determines all or part of its net deferred tax assets are not realizable in the future, the Company will record an adjustment to the valuation allowance that would be charged to earnings in the period such determination is made. In addition, the calculation of tax liabilities involves significant judgment in estimating the impact of uncertainties in the application of GAAP and complex tax laws. Resolution of these uncertainties in a manner inconsistent with management’s expectations could have a material impact on the Company’s financial condition and operating results.



On December 22, 2017, the U.S. enacted the Act, which significantly changed U.S. tax law. The Act lowered the Company’s U.S. statutory federal income tax rate from 35% to 21% effective January 1, 2018, while also imposing a deemed repatriation tax on previously deferred foreign income. The Act also created a new minimum tax on certain future foreign earnings. During the first six months of fiscal 2018, the Company recognized income tax expense of $9.3 billion, of which $2.6 billion was a provisional estimate in accordance with the SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 118 and was recognized during the first quarter of 2018. This $2.6 billion provisional estimate included $1.8 billion related to the impact of remeasuring to reduce the Company’s deferred tax balances to reflect the new tax rate, and approximately $800 million associated with the net impact of the deemed repatriation tax. Resolution of the provisional estimates of the Act’s effects different from the assumptions made by the Company could have a material impact on the Company’s financial condition and operating results.
