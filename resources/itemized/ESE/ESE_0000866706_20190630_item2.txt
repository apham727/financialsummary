New Accounting Standards
In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No.
2016-062, “Leases” (ASU 2016-02) which supersedes ASC 840, “Leases” and creates a new topic, ASC 842 “Leases.” Subsequent to the issuance of ASU 2016-02, ASC 842 was amended by
various updates that amend and clarify the impact and implementation of the aforementioned update.
These updates require lessees to recognize a lease liability and a lease asset for all leases, including operating leases, with a term greater than 12 months on its balance sheet.
Upon initial application, the provisions of these updates are required to be applied using the modified retrospective method which requires retrospective adoption to each prior reporting period presented with the cumulative effect of adoption recorded to the earliest reporting period presented.
An optional transition method can be utilized which requires retrospective adoption beginning on the date of adoption with the cumulative effect of initially applying these updates recognized at the date of initial adoption.
These updates also expand the required quantitative and qualitative disclosures surrounding leases.
These updates are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018 and interim periods within those fiscal years, with earlier application permitted.
We expect to adopt these updates on October 1, 2019 using the optional transition method.
We continue to evaluate the impact these updates will have on our consolidated financial statements.
Based upon the analysis and preliminary evaluation of the standard, we estimate the adoption will result in the addition of assets and liabilities of less than $30 million to our consolidated balance sheet, with no significant change to our consolidated statements of operations or cash flows.
We believe the updates will also have an impact on our accounting policies, internal controls and disclosures related to leases.
​
In October 2016, the FASB issued ASU No.
2016-16, Intra-Entity Transfers of Assets Other Than Inventory, which eliminates the exception for all intra-entity sale of assets other than inventory.
This standard is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2017.
There was no significant impact to the Company’s consolidated financial statements as a result of adopting this new standard.
