ITEM 2.
MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
References to the first quarters of 2018 and 2017 represent the three-month periods ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively.
OVERVIEW
In the first quarter of 2018, sales, net earnings and diluted earnings per share were $173.5 million, $34.7 million and $1.33 per share, respectively, compared to $146.4 million, $10.7 million and $0.41 per share, respectively, in the first quarter of 2017.
The increase in net earnings and diluted earnings per share in the first quarter of 2018 as compared to the first quarter of 2017 was mainly due to the $25.1 million net tax benefit the Company recorded as a result of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act that was signed into law on December 22, 2017.
NET SALES
Net sales increased $27.1 million, or 18.5%, to $173.5 million in the first quarter of 2018 from $146.4 million in the first quarter of 2017.
The increase in net sales in the first quarter of 2018 as compared to the first quarter of 2017 was due to a $20.2 million increase in the USG segment, a $3.7 million increase in the Test segment, a $2.0 million increase in the Technical Packaging segment and a $1.2 million increase in the Filtration segment.
-Filtration
-Test
In the first quarter of 2018, net sales of $37.5 million were $3.7 million, or 10.9%, higher than the $33.8 million recorded in the first quarter of 2017.
The increase in the first quarter of 2018 compared to the first quarter of 2017 was primarily due to higher sales from the segment’s U.S. operations due to the timing of test and measurement chamber projects.
-Utility Solutions Group (USG)
Net sales increased $20.2 million, or 56.8%, to $55.8 million in the first quarter of 2018 from $35.6 million in the first quarter of 2017.
The increase in the first quarter of 2018 compared to the first quarter of 2017 was mainly driven by the $19 million sales contribution from the NRG, Morgan Schaffer and Vanguard acquisitions and new products and software solutions at Doble.
-Technical Packaging
In the first quarter of 2018, net sales of $20.2 million were $2.0 million, or 10.9% higher than the $18.2 million recorded in the first quarter of 2017.
The increase in the first quarter of 2018 compared to the first quarter of 2017 was mainly due to a $1.1 million increase in net sales at TEQ due to higher shipments to medical customers and a $0.9 million increase in net sales at Plastique.
ORDERS AND BACKLOG
Backlog was $404.1 million at December 31, 2017 compared with $377.1 million at September 30, 2017.
The Company received new orders totaling $200.5 million in the first quarter of 2018 compared to $182.9 million in the first quarter of 2017.
Of the new orders received in the first quarter of 2018, $65.4 million related to Filtration products, $58.3 million related to Test products, $57.6 million related to USG products, and $19.2 million related to Technical Packaging products.
Of the new orders received in the first quarter of 2017, $67.5 million related to Filtration products, $56.0 million related to Test products, $39.5 million related to USG products, and $19.9 million related to Technical Packaging products
SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES
AMORTIZATION OF INTANGIBLE ASSETS
Amortization of intangible assets was $4.4 million and $3.6 million for the first quarters of 2018 and 2017, respectively.
Amortization expenses consist of amortization of acquired intangible assets from acquisitions and other identifiable intangible assets (primarily software).
The increase in amortization expense in the first quarter of 2018 compared to the first quarter of 2017 was mainly due to an increase in amortization of intangibles related to the Morgan Schaffer, NRG, and Mayday acquisitions.
OTHER EXPENSES (INCOME), NET
Other expenses, net, were $0.2 million in the first quarter of 2018 compared to other income, net, of $0.8 million in the first quarter of 2017.
There were no significant items in other expenses, net, in the first quarter of 2018.
The principal component of other income, net, in the first quarter of 2017 was $0.4 million of income related to death benefit insurance proceeds from a former subsidiary.
EBIT
The Company evaluates the performance of its operating segments based on EBIT, and provides EBIT on a consolidated basis, which is a non-GAAP financial measure.
Please refer to the discussion of non-GAAP financial measures in Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, above.
EBIT was $15.0 million (8.6% of net sales) for the first quarter of 2018 compared to $16.8 million (11.5% of net sales) for the first quarter of 2017.
The following table presents a reconciliation of EBIT to net earnings.
-Filtration
EBIT in the first quarter of 2018 was $9.6 million (16.1% of net sales) compared to $10.7 million (18.2% of net sales) in the first quarter of 2017.
The decrease in EBIT dollars and as a percent of net sales in the first quarter of 2018 compared to the first quarter of 2017 was mainly due to lower sales volumes at Westland, PTI and Crissair, partially offset by an increase in EBIT at Mayday and VACCO due to increased sales volumes at these subsidiaries.
-Test
EBIT in the first quarter of 2018 was $2.6 million (6.9% of net sales) compared to $2.4 million (7.2% of net sales) in the first quarter of 2017.
EBIT increased in the first quarter of 2018 compared to the first quarter of 2017 primarily due to increased sales volumes.
-Utility Solutions Group
EBIT in the first quarter of 2018 was $10.7 million (19.1% of net sales) compared to $9.7 million (27.1% of net sales) in the first quarter of 2017.
The increase in EBIT in the first quarter of 2018 compared to the first quarter of 2017 was mainly due to higher sales volumes as well as the EBIT contribution from NRG (May 8, 2017 acquisition), Morgan Schaffer (May 25, 2017 acquisition) and Vanguard (August 30, 2017 acquisition).
The decrease in EBIT as a percent of net sales in the first quarter of 2018 compared to the first quarter of 2017 was primarily due to the change in product mix as a result of the recent acquisitions of NRG, Morgan Schaffer and Vanguard.
-Technical Packaging
EBIT in the first quarter of 2018 was $1.0 million (4.8% of net sales) compared to $1.0 million (5.7% of net sales) in the first quarter of 2017.
The decrease in EBIT as a percent of net sales in the first quarter of 2018 compared to the first quarter of 2017 was mainly due to product mix at Plastique.
-Corporate
Corporate costs included in EBIT were $8.9 million and $7.0 million in the first quarter of 2018 and 2017, respectively.
The increase in Corporate costs in the first quarter of 2018 compared to the first quarter of 2017 was primarily due to higher professional fees and an increase in amortization of intangible assets related to recent acquisitions.
INTEREST EXPENSE, NET
Interest expense, net was $2.2 million and $0.7 million in the first quarter of 2018 and 2017, respectively.
The increase in interest expense in the first quarter of 2018 compared to the first quarter of 2017 was mainly due to higher average outstanding borrowings ($265.7 million compared to $160.3 million) and higher average interest rates (2.7% vs. 1.6%) as a result of the additional borrowings to fund the Company’s 2017 acquisitions.
INCOME TAX EXPENSE
The Company was able to determine reasonable estimates of the TCJA income tax effects.
However, the Company was unable to complete the accounting under ASC Topic 740 for the change in the value of the Company’s deferred tax assets and liabilities as it needs more time to collect and analyze information primarily related to depreciation expense, pension liability, and percentage of completion revenue recognition.
The Company was also unable to complete the accounting under ASC Topic 740 for the income tax effects of subjecting the Company’s cumulative foreign earnings to federal income tax as it needs more time to collect and analyze information to compute the cumulative balance of earnings subject to the tax and the amount of foreign tax credit that is available to offset the tax.
Since the TCJA subjected the Company’s cumulative foreign earnings to U.S. tax, repatriation of those earnings generally provides that no additional federal tax will be imposed.
However, the permissible amount of repatriation can be restricted by local law and a repatriation can result in tax expense due to local country withholding tax, U.S. state tax, and changes in foreign exchange rates.
The Company is evaluating these considerations to determine the amount of its foreign subsidiaries’ cumulative earnings it intends to indefinitely reinvest.
The TCJA includes a tax on global intangible low-taxed income (“GILTI”).
The Company expects it will be subject to this tax.
At its January 10, 2018 meeting, the FASB staff indicated that companies should make and disclose a policy election as to whether they will recognize deferred taxes for basis differences expected to reverse as GILTI or whether they will account for GILTI as period costs if and when incurred.
Because there are interpretative questions associated with the approach that involves recognizing deferred taxes, the Company will undertake an evaluation of these questions and make the accounting policy election during the SAB 118 measurement period.
During the three-month period ended December 31, 2017, there were no material changes in the unrecognized tax benefits.
The Company does not anticipate a material change in the amount of unrecognized tax benefits in the next twelve months.
TCJA moved the U.S. to a federal tax system that will no longer tax dividends from foreign corporations to U.S. corporations.
The cost of transitioning to this new tax system is a deemed repatriation of cumulative foreign earnings, the “Foreign Earnings Toll Charge”, the estimated tax cost of which was recorded in the first quarter of 2018.
The actual repatriation of foreign earnings triggers foreign dividend withholding taxes and U.S. state taxes, the estimated cost of which was recorded in the first quarter of 2018.
CAPITAL RESOURCES AND LIQUIDITY
The Company’s overall financial position and liquidity remains strong.
Working capital (current assets less current liabilities) decreased to $195.0 million at December 31, 2017 from $197.8 million at September 30, 2017.
Accounts receivable decreased $12.1 million primarily related to an $11.9 million decrease within the Filtration segment due to timing of collections and lower sales volumes in the first quarter of 2018 compared to the fourth quarter of 2017.
Inventories increased by $6.1 million during this period mainly due to a $3.3 million increase within the Filtration segment to support new aerospace platforms.
Net cash provided by operating activities was $17.8 million and $15.7 million in the first quarter of 2018 and 2017, respectively.
Capital expenditures were $3.6 million and $7.0 million in the first quarter of 2018 and 2017, respectively.
The decrease in the first quarter of 2018 was mainly due to machinery and equipment additions at VACCO ($1.7 million) and Plastique ($1.3 million) during the first quarter of 2017.
In addition, the Company incurred expenditures for capitalized software of $2.1 million and $1.4 million in the first quarter of 2018 and 2017, respectively.
Credit Facility
At December 31, 2017, the Company had approximately $181 million available to borrow under its Credit Facility, a $250 million increase option, and $41.6 million cash on hand.
At December 31, 2017, the Company had $260.0 million of outstanding borrowings under the Credit Facility in addition to outstanding letters of credit of $9.0 million.
Cash flow from operations and borrowings under the Company’s Credit Facility are expected to meet the Company’s capital requirements and operational needs for the foreseeable future.
The Company’s ability to access the additional $250 million increase option of the facility is subject to acceptance by participating or other outside banks.
New Accounting Standards
In March 2017, the FASB issued ASU 2017-07, Improving the Presentation of Net Periodic Pension Cost and Net Periodic Postretirement Benefit Cost, which updates ASC 715, Compensation – Retirement Benefits.
This update permits only the service cost component of net periodic pension and postretirement expense to be reported with other compensation costs, while all other components are required to be reported separately in other deductions, outside any subtotal of operating income.
These updates are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, with early adoption permitted, and must be adopted on a retrospective basis.
The updates change presentation only and will not impact the Company’s results of operations.
In August 2017, the FASB issued ASU 2017-12, Targeted Improvements to Accounting for Hedge Activities, which updates ASC 815, Derivatives and Hedging.
This update is intended to amend the hedge accounting model to enable entities to better align the economics of risk management activities and financial reporting.
The updates eliminate the requirement to separately measure and report hedge ineffectiveness and simplify hedge documentation and effectiveness assessment requirements.
These updates are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, with early adoption permitted, and must be adopted using a modified retrospective approach.
These updates are not expected to materially impact the Company’s results of operations.
In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No.
2016-062, Leases (Topic 842), which, among other things, requires an entity to recognize lease assets and lease liabilities on the balance sheet and disclose key information about leasing arrangements.
This standard will increase an entities’ reported assets and liabilities.
The standard is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018 and mandates a modified retrospective transition period for all entities.
The Company is currently assessing the impact of this standard on its consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.
In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU No.
2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, which requires an entity to recognize the amount of revenue to which it expects to be entitled for the transfer of promised goods or services to customers.
This guidance has been further clarified and amended.
The new standard will be effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, and interim periods within those annual periods.
The standard permits the use of either the retrospective or cumulative effect transition method.
The Company is currently in the process of evaluating the effect that ASU 2014-09 will have on its consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.
The Company has selected the Cumulative Effect method of transition to the new standard.
Dividends
A dividend of $0.08 per share, totaling $2.1 million, was paid on October 17, 2017 to stockholders of record as of October 3, 2017.
Following the end of the first quarter, the quarterly dividend of $0.08 per share, or $2.1 million, was paid on January 19, 2018 to stockholders of record as of January 4, 2018.
OUTLOOK
CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES
Management has evaluated the accounting policies used in the preparation of the Company’s financial statements and related notes and believes those policies to be reasonable and appropriate.
Certain of these accounting policies require the application of significant judgment by Management in selecting appropriate assumptions for calculating financial estimates.
By their nature, these judgments are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty.
These judgments are based on historical experience, trends in the industry, information provided by customers and information available from other outside sources, as appropriate.
The most significant areas involving Management judgments and estimates may be found in the Critical Accounting Policies section of Management’s Discussion and Analysis.
OTHER MATTERS
Contingencies
As a normal incident of the business in which the Company is engaged, various claims, charges and litigation are asserted or commenced against the Company.
Additionally, the Company is currently involved in various stages of investigation and remediation relating to environmental matters.
In the opinion of Management, the aggregate costs involved in the resolution of these matters, and final judgments, if any, which might be rendered against the Company, are adequately reserved, are covered by insurance, or would not have a material adverse effect on the Company’s results from operations, capital expenditures, or competitive position.
