Amortization expenses consist of amortization of acquired intangible assets from acquisitions and other identifiable intangible assets (primarily software).

The principal component in other income, net, in the first six months of 2019 was a gain of approximately $8 million on the sale of the Doble Watertown, MA building and land, partially offset by certain restructuring activities at Doble, PTI, VACCO and Plastique and losses on derivative instruments.
The principal components in other expenses, net, in the first six months of 2018 were $2.1 million of charges related to the USG segment restructuring activities as mentioned above, partially offset by gains on derivative instruments.

Please refer to the discussion of non-GAAP financial measures in Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, above.

The increase in EBIT in the second quarter and first six months of 2019 compared to the corresponding periods of 2018 was mainly due to the gain on sale of the Doble Watertown facility of approximately $8 million in the first quarter of 2019, as well as an increase in EBIT from Morgan Schaffer and Manta product lines partially offset by a decrease in EBIT from NRG due to market softness.
-Technical Packaging

The decrease in EBIT in the second quarter and first six months of 2019 compared to the corresponding periods of 2018 was mainly due to the restructuring charges incurred related to the Plastique facility consolidation, ($0.4 million in the second quarter of 2019 and $0.7 million in the first six months of 2019).
These charges consisted primarily of severance and compensation benefits and asset impairment charges.
-Corporate
Corporate costs included in EBIT were $10.0 million and $20.5 million in the second quarter and first six months of 2019, respectively, compared to $8.3 million and $17.2 million in the corresponding periods of 2018.
The increase in Corporate costs in the second quarter and first six months of 2019 compared to the corresponding periods of 2018 was primarily due to higher professional fees and timing of other Corporate costs recorded in the first six months of 2019.
INTEREST EXPENSE, NET
Interest expense was $1.9 million and $3.8 million in the second quarter and first six months of 2019, respectively, and $2.0 million and $4.2 million in the corresponding periods of 2018.
The decrease in interest expense in the first six months of 2019 compared to the first six months of 2018 was mainly due to lower average outstanding borrowings ($215 million compared to $264 million).
INCOME TAX EXPENSE
The second quarter 2019 effective income tax rate was 12.0% compared to 26.4% in the second quarter of 2018.

The effective income tax rate for the first six months of 2019 was 19.0% compared to (69.3%) for the first six months of 2018.
The income tax expense in the second quarter and first six months of 2019 was favorably impacted by tax planning strategies to increase foreign tax credits claimed retrospectively.
The Company reduced the valuation allowance for excess foreign tax credits by $2.3 million and recorded an amended return receivable of $0.2 million which favorably impacted the second quarter and year-to-date effective tax rate by 12.1% and 5.8%, respectively.
In the first quarter of 2018, the Company recorded a $2.3 million provisional estimate of the income tax effects of the future repatriation of the cumulative earnings of its foreign subsidiaries which unfavorably impacted the year-to-date effective tax rate by 8.9%.
An additional $7.5 million pension contribution for the 2017 plan year was approved during the second quarter of 2018 increasing the value of the deferred tax liability by $1.0 million.
This favorable adjustment, net of the $0.3 million unfavorable impact to the 2017 Domestic Production Deduction, favorably impacted the second quarter and year-to-date effective tax rate by 5.8% and 3.0%, respectively.
The income tax expense in the second quarter and first six months of 2018 was also unfavorably impacted by the cancellation of debt income triggered by the dissolution of a foreign subsidiary increasing the second quarter and year-to-date effective tax rate by 1.5% and 0.8%, respectively.
Provisions under the TCJA that became effective for the Company in the current fiscal year include a further reduction in the U.S. statutory rate to 21%, a new minimum tax on global intangible low-taxed income (“GILTI”), the benefit of the deduction for foreign-derived intangible income (“FDII”), and changes to IRC Section 162(m) related to the deductibility of executive compensation.

2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (ASC 606).
Contract assets increased $47.5 million in the first six months of 2019 mainly due to the adoption of ASC 606 within the Filtration segment.

The decrease in net cash provided by operating activities in the first six months of 2019 as compared to the first six months of 2018 was due to higher working capital requirements.
Capital expenditures were $17.4 million and $10.1 million in the first six months of 2019 and 2018, respectively.
The increase in the first six months of 2019 was mainly due to a $7.1 million facility expansion at TEQ.

New Accounting Standards
In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No.
2016-062, Leases (Topic 842), which, among other things, requires an entity to recognize lease assets and lease liabilities on the balance sheet and disclose key information about leasing arrangements.
This standard will increase an entities’ reported assets and liabilities.
The standard is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018 and mandates a modified retrospective transition period for all entities.
The Company is currently assessing the impact of this standard on its consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.
In October 2016, the FASB issued ASU No.
2016-16, Intra-Entity Transfers of Assets Other Than Inventory, which eliminates the exception for all intra-entity sale of assets other than inventory.
This standard is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2017.
There was no significant impact to the Company’s consolidated financial statements as a result of adopting this new standard.
