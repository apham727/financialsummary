NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
 1.
BASIS OF PRESENTATION
The accompanying consolidated financial statements, in the opinion of management, include all adjustments, consisting of normal recurring accruals, necessary for a fair presentation of the results for the interim periods presented.
The consolidated financial statements are presented in accordance with the requirements of Form 10-Q and consequently do not include all the disclosures required for annual financial statements by accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (GAAP).
For further information, refer to the consolidated financial statements and related notes included in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2017.
The Company’s results for the three-month periods ended December 31, 2017 are not necessarily indicative of the results for the entire 2018 fiscal year.
References to the first quarters of 2018 and 2017 represent the fiscal quarters ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively.
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires Management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities.
Actual results could differ from those estimates.
 2.
EARNINGS PER SHARE (EPS)
The Company provides compensation benefits to certain key employees under several share-based plans providing for performance-accelerated restricted shares (restricted shares), and to non-employee directors under a non-employee directors compensation plan.
Performance-Accelerated Restricted Share Awards
Compensation expense related to the restricted share awards was $1.1 million and $1.2 million for the three-month periods ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively.
There were 337,325 non-vested shares outstanding as of December 31, 2017.
Non-Employee Directors Plan
Compensation expense related to the non-employee director grants was $0.3 million and $0.2 million for the three-month periods ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively.

GOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS
 6. BUSINESS SEGMENT INFORMATION
Management evaluates and measures the performance of its reportable segments based on “Net Sales” and “EBIT”, which are detailed in the table below.
EBIT is defined as earnings before interest and taxes.
Non-GAAP Financial Measures
The financial measure “EBIT” is presented in the above table and elsewhere in this Report.
EBIT on a consolidated basis is a non-GAAP financial measure.
Management believes that EBIT is useful in assessing the operational profitability of the Company’s business segments because it excludes interest and taxes, which are generally accounted for across the entire Company on a consolidated basis.
EBIT is also one of the measures used by management in determining resource allocations within the Company as well as incentive compensation.
A reconciliation of EBIT to GAAP net earnings is set forth in Item 2, Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – EBIT.
The Company believes that the presentation of EBIT provides important supplemental information to investors to facilitate comparisons with other companies, many of which use similar non-GAAP financial measures to supplement their GAAP results.
However, the Company’s non-GAAP financial measures may not be comparable to other companies’ non-GAAP financial performance measures.
Furthermore, the use of non-GAAP financial measures is not intended to replace any measures of performance determined in accordance with GAAP.
The Company’s existing credit facility (“the Credit Facility”) matures December 21, 2020.
The Credit Facility includes a $450 million revolving line of credit as well as provisions allowing for the increase of the facility commitment amount by an additional $250 million, if necessary, with the consent of the lenders.
The bank syndication supporting the facility is comprised of a diverse group of nine banks led by JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as Administrative Agent.
At December 31, 2017, the Company had approximately $181 million available to borrow under the Credit Facility, and a $250 million increase option, in addition to $41.6 million cash on hand.
At December 31, 2017, the Company had $260 million of outstanding borrowings under the Credit Facility in addition to outstanding letters of credit of $9.0 million.
The Company classified $20.0 million as the current portion of long-term debt as of December 31, 2017, as the Company intends to repay this amount within the next twelve month period; however, the Company has no contractual obligation to repay such amount during the next twelve month period.
The Credit Facility requires, as determined by certain financial ratios, a facility fee ranging from 12.5 to 27.5 basis points per year on the unused portion.
The terms of the facility provide that interest on borrowings may be calculated at a spread over the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) or based on the prime rate, at the Company’s election.
The facility is secured by the unlimited guaranty of the Company’s material domestic subsidiaries and a 65% pledge of the material foreign subsidiaries’ share equity.
The financial covenants of the Credit Facility include a leverage ratio and an interest coverage ratio.
The weighted average interest rates were 2.74% and 1.61% for the three-month periods ending December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively.
At December 31, 2017, the Company was in compliance with all debt covenants.

INCOME TAX EXPENSE
Staff Accounting Bulletin No.
118 (SAB 118) was issued by the SEC effective December 22, 2017.
SAB 118 allows registrants to record provisional amounts of the income tax effects of the TCJA where the information necessary to complete the accounting under ASC Topic 740 is not available but the amounts are based on reasonable estimates.
SAB 118 permits registrants to record adjustments to its provisional amounts during the measurement period (which cannot exceed one year).
The Company was able to determine reasonable estimates of the TCJA income tax effects.
However, the Company was unable to complete the accounting under ASC Topic 740 for the change in the value of the Company’s deferred tax assets and liabilities as it needs more time to collect and analyze information primarily related to depreciation expense, pension liability, and percentage of completion revenue recognition.
The Company was also unable to complete the accounting under ASC Topic 740 for the income tax effects of subjecting the Company’s cumulative foreign earnings to federal income tax as it needs more time to collect and analyze information to compute the cumulative balance of earnings subject to the tax and the amount of foreign tax credit that is available to offset the tax.
Since the TCJA subjected the Company’s cumulative foreign earnings to U.S. tax, repatriation of those earnings generally provides that no additional federal tax will be imposed.
However, the permissible amount of repatriation can be restricted by local law and a repatriation can result in tax expense due to local country withholding tax, U.S. state tax, and changes in foreign exchange rates.
The Company is evaluating these considerations to determine the amount of its foreign subsidiaries’ cumulative earnings it intends to indefinitely reinvest.
The TCJA includes a tax on global intangible low-taxed income (“GILTI”).
The Company expects it will be subject to this tax.
At its January 10, 2018 meeting, the FASB staff indicated that companies should make and disclose a policy election as to whether they will recognize deferred taxes for basis differences expected to reverse as GILTI or whether they will account for GILTI as period costs if and when incurred.
Because there are interpretative questions associated with the approach that involves recognizing deferred taxes, the Company will undertake an evaluation of these questions and make the accounting policy election during the SAB 118 measurement period.
 11.
DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS
Market risks relating to the Company’s operations result primarily from changes in interest rates and changes in foreign currency exchange rates.
The Company is exposed to market risk related to changes in interest rates and selectively uses derivative financial instruments, including forward contracts and swaps, to manage these risks.
During 2016, the Company entered into several forward contracts to purchase pounds sterling (GBP) to hedge two deferred payments due in connection with the acquisition of Plastique.
During the first quarter of 2018, the Company entered into three interest rate swaps with a notional amount of $150 million to hedge some of its exposure to variability in future LIBOR-based interest payments on variable rate debt.
In addition, the Company’s Canadian subsidiary Morgan Schaffer enters into foreign exchange contracts to manage foreign currency risk as a portion of their revenue is denominated in U.S. dollars.
The Company expects hedging gains or losses to be essentially offset by losses or gains on the related underlying exposures.
All derivative instruments are reported in either accrued expenses or other receivables on the balance sheet at fair value.
For derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges, the gain or loss on the derivative is deferred in accumulated other comprehensive income until recognized in earnings with the underlying hedged item.
The interest rate swaps entered into during the first quarter of 2018 were not designated as cash flow hedges and, therefore, the gain or loss on the derivative is reflected in earnings each period.

FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS
   · Level 1 – inputs to the valuation methodology are quoted prices (unadjusted) for identical assets or liabilities in active markets.
   · Level 2 – inputs to the valuation methodology include quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets, and inputs that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly, for substantially the full term of the financial instrument.
   · Level 3 – inputs to the valuation methodology are unobservable and significant to the fair value measurement.
Financial Assets and Liabilities
The Company has estimated the fair value of its financial instruments as of December 31, 2017 and September 30, 2017 using available market information or other appropriate valuation methodologies.
The carrying amounts of cash and cash equivalents, receivables, inventories, payables, debt and other current assets and liabilities approximate fair value because of the short maturity of those instruments.
Fair Value of Financial Instruments
Valuation was based on third party evidence of similarly priced derivative instruments.
Nonfinancial Assets and Liabilities
The Company’s nonfinancial assets such as property, plant and equipment, and other intangible assets are not measured at fair value on a recurring basis; however they are subject to fair value adjustments in certain circumstances, such as when there is evidence that an impairment may exist.
No impairments were recorded during the three-month period ended December 31, 2017.

NEW ACCOUNTING STANDARDS
In March 2017, the FASB issued ASU 2017-07, Improving the Presentation of Net Periodic Pension Cost and Net Periodic Postretirement Benefit Cost, which updates ASC 715, Compensation – Retirement Benefits.
This update permits only the service cost component of net periodic pension and postretirement expense to be reported with other compensation costs, while all other components are required to be reported separately in other deductions, outside any subtotal of operating income.
These updates are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, with early adoption permitted, and must be adopted on a retrospective basis.
The updates change presentation only and will not impact the Company’s results of operations.
In August 2017, the FASB issued ASU 2017-12, Targeted Improvements to Accounting for Hedge Activities, which updates ASC 815, Derivatives and Hedging.
This update is intended to amend the hedge accounting model to enable entities to better align the economics of risk management activities and financial reporting.
The updates eliminate the requirement to separately measure and report hedge ineffectiveness and simplify hedge documentation and effectiveness assessment requirements.
These updates are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, with early adoption permitted, and must be adopted using a modified retrospective approach.
These updates are not expected to materially impact the Company’s results of operations.
In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No.
2016-062, Leases (Topic 842), which, among other things, requires an entity to recognize lease assets and lease liabilities on the balance sheet and disclose key information about leasing arrangements.
This standard will increase an entities’ reported assets and liabilities.
The standard is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018 and mandates a modified retrospective transition period for all entities.
The Company is currently assessing the impact of this standard on its consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.
In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU No.
2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, which requires an entity to recognize the amount of revenue to which it expects to be entitled for the transfer of promised goods or services to customers.
This guidance has been further clarified and amended.
The new standard will be effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, and interim periods within those annual periods.
The standard permits the use of either the retrospective or cumulative effect transition method.
The Company is currently in the process of evaluating the effect that ASU 2014-09 will have on its consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.
The Company has selected the Cumulative Effect method of transition to the new standard.
