ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 



RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 



References to the first quarters of 2019 and 2018 represent the three-month periods ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. 



OVERVIEW 



In the first quarter of 2019, sales, net earnings and diluted earnings per share were $182.6 million, $17.3 million and $0.66 per share, respectively, compared to $173.5 million, $34.7 million and $1.33 per share, respectively, in the first quarter of 2018. The decrease in net earnings and diluted earnings per share in the first quarter of 2019 as compared to the first quarter of 2018 was mainly due to the $25.1 million net tax benefit the Company recorded in the first quarter of 2018 as a result of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act that was signed into law on December 22, 2017. 



NET SALES 



Net sales increased $9.1 million, or 5.2%, to $182.6 million in the first quarter of 2019 from $173.5 million in the first quarter of 2018. The increase in net sales in the first quarter of 2019 as compared to the first quarter of 2018 was due to a $6.2 million increase in the Filtration segment, a $3.8 million increase in the Test segment and a $0.1 million increase in the USG segment, partially offset by a $0.9 million decrease in the Technical Packaging segment. 



-Filtration 



In the first quarter of 2019, net sales of $66.2 million were $6.2 million, or 10.3%, higher than the $60.0 million in the first quarter of 2018. The sales increase in the first quarter of 2019 compared to the first quarter of 2018 was mainly due to a $3.2 million increase in net sales at Crissair due to higher aerospace shipments, a $2.3 million increase in net sales at Westland due to timing of revenue on government programs, a $1.5 million increase in net sales at PTI due to higher aerospace assembly shipments, a $1.5 million increase in net sales at Mayday due to higher aerospace shipments, partially offset by a $2.3 million decrease in net sales at VACCO due to lower revenue from its space products. 





-Test 



In the first quarter of 2019, net sales of $41.3 million were $3.8 million, or 10.0%, higher than the $37.5 million in the first quarter of 2018. The increase in the first quarter of 2019 compared to the first quarter of 2018 was primarily due to higher sales from the segment’s U.S. operations due to the timing of test and measurement chamber projects. 



-Utility Solutions Group (USG) 



In the first quarter of 2019, net sales of $55.9 million were $0.1 million, or 0.2% higher than the $55.8 million in the first quarter of 2018. The increase in the first quarter of 2019 compared to the first quarter of 2018 was mainly due to net sales increases from Morgan Schaffer and the Vanguard Instruments product line and new products and software solutions at Doble partially offset by a decrease in net sales at NRG due to softness in the renewable energy market. 



-Technical Packaging 



In the first quarter of 2019, net sales of $19.2 million were $0.9 million, or 4.7%, lower than the $20.2 million in the first quarter of 2018. The decrease in the first quarter of 2019 compared to the first quarter of 2018 was primarily due to the decrease in net sales from Plastique driven by timing of projects. 



ORDERS AND BACKLOG 



Backlog was $398.3 million at December 31, 2018 compared with $382.8 million at September 30, 2018. The Company received new orders totaling $198.1 million in the first quarter of 2019 compared to $200.5 million in the first quarter of 2018. Of the new orders received in the first quarter of 2019, $83.7 million related to Filtration products, $45.4 million related to Test products, $52.0 million related to USG products, and $17.0 million related to Technical Packaging products. Of the new orders received in the first quarter of 2018, $65.4 million related to Filtration products, $58.3 million related to Test products, $57.6 million related to USG products, and $19.2 million related to Technical Packaging products. 



SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES 







AMORTIZATION OF INTANGIBLE ASSETS 



Amortization of intangible assets was $4.7 million and $4.4 million for the first quarter of 2019 and 2018, respectively. Amortization expenses consist of amortization of acquired intangible assets from acquisitions and other identifiable intangible assets (primarily software). The increase in amortization expense in the first quarter of 2019 compared to the first quarter of 2018 was mainly due to an increase in amortization of intangibles related to the Manta acquisition. 



OTHER (INCOME) EXPENSES, NET 



Other income, net, was $7.1 million in the first quarter of 2019 compared to other expenses, net, of $0.2 million in the first quarter of 2018. The principal component in other income, net, in the first quarter of 2019 was a gain of approximately $8 million on the sale of the Doble Watertown, MA building and land. There were no individually significant items in other (income) expenses, net, in the first quarter of 2018. 



EBIT 



The Company evaluates the performance of its operating segments based on EBIT, and provides EBIT on a consolidated basis, which is a non-GAAP financial measure. Please refer to the discussion of non-GAAP financial measures in Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, above. EBIT was $25.1 million (13.8% of net sales) for the first quarter of 2019 compared to $15.0 million (8.6% of net sales) for the first quarter of 2018. 



The following table presents a reconciliation of EBIT to net earnings. 





-Filtration 



EBIT in the first quarter of 2019 was $10.6 million (16.0% of net sales) compared to $9.6 million (16.1% of net sales) in the first quarter of 2018. The increase in EBIT in the first quarter compared to the first quarter of 2018 was mainly due to an increase at Crissair and Westland due to higher sales volumes partially offset by a decrease in EBIT at VACCO due to the lower sales volumes mentioned above. 



-Test 



EBIT in the first quarter of 2019 was $3.3 million (8.0% of net sales) compared to $2.6 million (6.9% of net sales) in the first quarter of 2018. The increase in EBIT in the first quarter of 2019 compared to the first quarter of 2018 was primarily due to the increased sales volumes mainly from the segment’s U.S. operations. 





-Utility Solutions Group 



EBIT in the first quarter of 2019 was $21.5 million (38.6% of net sales) compared to $10.7 million (19.1% of net sales) in the first quarter of 2018. The increase in EBIT in the first quarter of 2019 compared to the first quarter of 2018 was mainly due to the gain on sale of the Doble Watertown facility of approximately $8 million as well as an increase in EBIT from Morgan Schaffer and the Vanguard Instruments and Manta product lines. 



-Technical Packaging 



EBIT in the first quarter of 2019 was $0.1 million (0.6% of net sales) compared to $1.0 million (4.8% of net sales) in the first quarter of 2018. The decrease in EBIT in the first quarter of 2019 compared to the first quarter of 2018 was mainly due to the decrease in sales volumes at Plastique. In addition, EBIT in the first quarter of 2019 included $0.3 million of restructuring charges related to the Plastique facility consolidation, which were recorded in the first quarter of 2019. These charges consisted primarily of severance and compensation benefits and asset impairment charges. 



-Corporate 



Corporate costs included in EBIT were $10.4 million and $8.9 million in the first quarter of 2019 and 2018, respectively. The increase in Corporate costs in the first quarter of 2019 compared to the first quarter of 2018 was mainly due to the $1.2 million of losses on derivative instruments recorded in the first quarter of 2019. 



INTEREST EXPENSE, NET 



Interest expense was $1.9 million and $2.2 million in the first quarter of 2019 and 2018, respectively. The decrease in interest expense in the first quarter of 2019 as compared to the first quarter of 2018 was mainly due to lower average outstanding borrowings ($212 million compared to $265.7 million), partially offset by higher average interest rates (3.3% vs. 2.7%). 



INCOME TAX EXPENSE 





Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 118 (SAB 118) was issued by the SEC effective December 22, 2017. SAB 118 allows registrants to record provisional amounts of the income tax effects of the TCJA where the information necessary to complete the accounting under ASC Topic 740 is not available but the amounts are based on reasonable estimates. SAB 118 permits registrants to record adjustments to its provisional amounts during the measurement period (which cannot exceed one year). 



The Company recorded a provisional charge for the Transition Tax of $3.7 million for the year ended September 30, 2018 and this charge is complete as of December 31, 2018 with minimal changes. Provisions under the TCJA that became effective for the Company in the current fiscal year include a further reduction in the U.S. statutory rate to 21%, a new minimum tax on global intangible low-taxed income (“GILTI”), the benefit of the deduction for foreign-derived intangible income (“FDII”), and changes to IRC Section 162(m) related to the deductibility of executive compensation. 



The Company’s foreign subsidiaries had accumulated unremitted earnings of $4.0 million at December 31, 2018. No deferred taxes have been provided on these accumulated unremitted earnings because these funds are not needed to meet the liquidity requirements of the Company’s U.S. operations and it is the Company’s intention to indefinitely reinvest these earnings in continuing international operations. In the event these foreign entities’ earnings were distributed, it is estimated that approximately $0.4 million of foreign tax withholding would be paid. The Company does not expect that these taxes would be creditable against U.S. income tax, so they would correspondingly reduce the Company’s net earnings. No significant portion of the Company’s foreign subsidiaries’ earnings was taxed at a rate significantly less than the U.S. statutory tax rate. 





CAPITAL RESOURCES AND LIQUIDITY 



The Company’s overall financial position and liquidity remains strong. Working capital (current assets less current liabilities) increased to $217.3 million at December 31, 2018 from $195.5 million at September 30, 2018. Accounts receivable decreased by $17.1 million during this period mainly due to a $12.6 million decrease within the Filtration segment driven by the timing of sales and focused collection efforts. Inventories decreased by $15.8 million during this period mainly due to a $15.8 million decrease within the Filtration segment resulting primarily from the adoption of ASU No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (ASC 606). Contract assets increased $41.0 million in the first quarter of 2019 mainly due to the adoption of ASC 606 within the Filtration segment. 



Net cash provided by operating activities was $8.1 million and $17.8 million in the first quarters of 2019 and 2018, respectively. The decrease in net cash provided by operating activities in the first quarter of 2019 as compared to the first quarter of 2018 was driven by lower earnings and higher working capital requirements. 



Capital expenditures were $8.9 million and $3.6 million in the first quarters of 2019 and 2018, respectively. The increase in the first quarter of 2019 was mainly due to a facility expansion at TEQ ($3.8 million). In addition, the Company incurred expenditures for capitalized software of $2.1 million in both of the first quarters of 2019 and 2018, respectively. 



Credit Facility 



At December 31, 2018, the Company had approximately $209 million available to borrow under its bank credit facility, a $250 million increase option subject to lender approval, and $36.6 million cash on hand. At December 31, 2018, the Company had $215 million of outstanding borrowings under the credit facility in addition to outstanding letters of credit of $8.2 million. Cash flow from operations and borrowings under the Company’s credit facility are expected to meet the Company’s capital requirements and operational needs for the foreseeable future. The Company’s ability to access the additional $250 million increase option of the credit facility is subject to acceptance by participating or other outside banks. 



New Accounting Standards 



In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-062, Leases (Topic 842), which, among other things, requires an entity to recognize lease assets and lease liabilities on the balance sheet and disclose key information about leasing arrangements. This standard will increase an entities’ reported assets and liabilities. The standard is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018 and mandates a modified retrospective transition period for all entities. The Company is currently assessing the impact of this standard on its consolidated financial statements and related disclosures. 



In October 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-16, Intra-Entity Transfers of Assets Other Than Inventory, which eliminates the exception for all intra-entity sale of assets other than inventory. This standard is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2017. There was no significant impact to the Company’s consolidated financial statements as a result of adopting this new standard. 



Dividends 



A dividend of $0.08 per share, totaling $2.1 million, was paid on October 17, 2018 to stockholders of record as of October 3, 2018. Subsequent to December 31, 2018, a quarterly dividend of $0.08 per share, totaling $2.1 million, was paid on January 18, 2019 to stockholders of record as of January 3, 2019. 



OUTLOOK 







CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES 



Management has evaluated the accounting policies used in the preparation of the Company’s financial statements and related notes and believes those policies to be reasonable and appropriate. Certain of these accounting policies require the application of significant judgment by Management in selecting appropriate assumptions for calculating financial estimates. By their nature, these judgments are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty. These judgments are based on historical experience, trends in the industry, information provided by customers and information available from other outside sources, as appropriate. The most significant areas involving Management judgments and estimates may be found in the Critical Accounting Policies section of Management’s Discussion and Analysis and in Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements contained in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2018.

Contingencies 



As a normal incident of the business in which the Company is engaged, various claims, charges and litigation are asserted or commenced against the Company. Additionally, the Company is currently involved in various stages of investigation and remediation relating to environmental matters. In the opinion of Management, the aggregate costs involved in the resolution of these matters, and final judgments, if any, which might be rendered against the Company, are adequately reserved, are covered by insurance, or would not have a material adverse effect on the Company’s results from operations, capital expenditures, or competitive position.
