NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Note 1 – Basis of presentation
The accompanying unaudited consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto for the year ended December 31, 2018, included in our annual report on Form 10-K, filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
In our opinion, the accompanying consolidated financial statements reflect all adjustments (consisting only of normal recurring items) considered necessary to present fairly our financial position at March 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018, the results of our operations and comprehensive income for the three months ended March 31, 2019 and 2018, and the cash flows for the three months ended March 31, 2019 and 2018.
Our operating results for the three months ended March 31, 2019 are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for the year ending December 31, 2019.
These financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States.
Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements
Leases
In February 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") established Topic 842, Leases, by issuing Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No.
2016-02, which supersedes ASC 840, Leases, and requires lessees to recognize leases on-balance sheet and disclose key information about leasing arrangements.
Topic 842 was subsequently amended by ASU No.
2018-01, Land Easement Practical Expedient for Transition to Topic 842; ASU No.
2018-10, Codification Improvements to Topic 842, Leases; and ASU No.
2018-11, Targeted Improvements.
Topic 842, as amended, (the "new lease standard") establishes a right-of-use model (ROU) that requires a lessee to recognize a ROU asset and lease liability on the balance sheet for all leases with a term longer than 12 months.
Leases will be classified as finance or operating, with classification affecting the pattern and classification of expense recognition in the income statement.
We adopted the new lease standard on January 1, 2019 and used the effective date as our date of initial adoption.
Consequently, financial information will not be updated and the disclosures required under the new standard will not be provided for earlier periods.
We have completed a qualitative and quantitative assessment of our lease portfolio, in which the standard had a material impact on our consolidated balance sheet but did not have an impact on our consolidated income statement.
Upon adoption, we recognized lease liabilities of approximately $52 million, with corresponding ROU assets of the same amount, based on the present value of the remaining minimum rental payments under current leasing standards for our existing operating leases.
Additionally, we also reclassified approximately $19 million from "Property, plant and equipment, net" to "Operating lease right-of-use assets" related to prepaid leasehold land.
The new standard provides a number of optional practical expedients in transition.
We elected the 'package of practical expedients', which permits us not to reassess under the new standard our prior conclusions about lease identification, lease classification and initial direct costs.
We did not elect the use-of-hindsight or the practical expedient pertaining to land easements; the latter not being applicable to us.
The new standard also provides practical expedients for an entity's ongoing accounting.
We elected the short-term lease recognition exemption for all leases that qualify.
This means, for those leases that qualify, we will not recognize ROU assets or lease liabilities, and this includes not recognizing ROU assets or lease liabilities for existing short-term leases of those assets in transition.
We also elected the practical expedient to not separate lease and non-lease components for our office leases.
Other Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements
In August 2018, the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") issued Release No.
33-10532 that amends and clarifies certain financial reporting requirements.
The principal change to our financial reporting will be the inclusion of the annual disclosure requirement of changes in stockholders’ equity in Rule 3-04 of Regulation S-X to interim periods.
We adopted this new rule beginning with our financial reporting for the quarter ended March 31, 2019.
Recent Accounting Guidance Not Yet Adopted
In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU No.
2016-13, Financial Instruments—Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments.
The ASU will replace the incurred loss impairment methodology under current GAAP with a methodology that reflects expected credit losses and requires consideration of a broader range of reasonable and supportable information to inform credit loss estimates.
We will be required to use a forward-looking expected credit loss model for accounts receivables and other financial instruments.
This ASU requires instruments measured at amortized cost to be presented at the net amount expected to be collected.
Entities are also required to record allowances for available-for-sale debt securities rather than reduce the carrying amount.
We do not plan to adopt the ASU earlier than our required effective date of January 1, 2020.
We expect that the adoption of the ASU will not have a material impact on our financial statements.
Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
As discussed above, we adopted the new lease standard as of January 1, 2019.
The impact of this new guidance on our accounting policies and financial statements is described below.
Additionally, in the first quarter of 2019, we granted performance-based restricted stock units to certain executives under our 2015 Equity Incentive Plan ("PRSUs").
The PRSU awards granted during the three months ended March 31, 2019 include a market condition as defined by ASC 718.
The impact of the new equity awards on our accounting policies is described below.
There were no other significant changes in our accounting policies during the three months ended March 31, 2019 compared to the significant accounting policies described in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018.
Stock-Based Compensation
Stock-based compensation costs are based on the fair value on the date of grant for all restricted stock units ("RSUs") and on the date of enrollment for the employee stock purchase plan.
We recognize compensation expense ratably over the requisite service period of the awards.
PRSUs are restricted stock unit awards that vest based on a market condition, currently our stockholder return relative to the total stockholder return of the constituents of the Russell 2000 Index at the end of a three-year performance period.
Up to 200% of the full target number of shares subject to each PRSU award are eligible to be earned after the completion of the three-year performance period based on our total stockholder return relative to the total stockholder return of the Russell 2000 Index at the end of the performance period.
The fair values of RSUs are estimated using their market price on the date of grant.
The fair values of employee stock purchase plans are estimated using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model.
The fair values of PRSUs are estimated using a Monte Carlo simulation.
The determination of fair value of the PRSUs is affected by our stock price and a number of assumptions including the expected volatility, expected dividend yield and the risk-free interest rate.
Our expected volatility at the date of grant was based on the historical volatilities of our stock and the constituents of the Russell 2000 Index over the performance period.
Refer to Note 11 – Authorized shares of common and preferred stock and stock-based compensation plans for additional information on our equity-based compensation programs.
Leases
We determine whether an arrangement is a lease at inception.
Operating leases are included in operating lease right-of-use ("ROU") assets and operating lease liabilities (current and non-current) on our consolidated balance sheet.
Finance leases are included in property and equipment, other current liabilities, and other long-term liabilities in our consolidated balance sheet.
Operating lease ROU assets and operating lease liabilities are recognized based on their present value of the future minimum lease payments over the lease term at commencement date.
As none of our leases provide an implicit rate we use our incremental borrowing rate based on the information available as of the commencement date.
The operating lease ROU assets also includes any lease payments made and excludes lease incentives and initial direct costs incurred.
Our lease terms may include options to extend or terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain that we will exercise that option.
Lease expense for minimum lease payments is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
We have lease agreements with lease and non-lease components.
For office leases we account for the lease and non-lease components as a single lease component.
For certain leases, such as equipment and vehicles, we account for the lease and non-lease components separately.
Additionally, for certain equipment leases, we apply a portfolio approach to effectively account for the operating lease ROU assets and liabilities.
Refer to Note 8 - Leases for additional information on our leasing activities.
Earnings Per Share
Basic earnings per share (“EPS”) is computed by dividing net income by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during each period.
Diluted EPS is computed by dividing net income by the weighted average number of common shares and common share equivalents outstanding (if dilutive) during each period.
The number of common share equivalents, which includes RSUs, is computed using the treasury stock method.
Stock awards to acquire 67,100 shares and 0 shares for the three months ended March 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively, were excluded in the computations of diluted EPS because the effect of including the stock awards would have been anti-dilutive.
Note 2 - Revenue
Revenue Recognition
Revenue is recognized upon transfer of control of the promised products or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration we expect to receive in exchange for those products or services.
We enter into contracts that can include various combinations of our products or services, which are generally capable of being distinct and accounted for as separate performance obligations.
Revenue is recognized net of allowances for returns and any taxes collected from customers, which are subsequently remitted to governmental authorities.
Disaggregation of Revenues
We disaggregate revenue from contracts with customers based on the timing of transfer of goods or services to customers (point-in-time or over time) and geographic region based on the billing location of the customer.
The geographic regions that are tracked are the Americas (United States, Canada, and Latin America), EMEIA (Europe, Middle East, India, and Africa) and APAC (Australia, New Zealand, Southeast Asia, China, South Korea and Japan).
We operate as one operating segment.
Information about Contract Balances
Amounts collected in advance of services being provided are accounted for as deferred revenue.
Nearly all of our deferred revenue balance is related to extended hardware and software maintenance contracts.
Payment terms and conditions vary by contract type, although payment is typically due within 30 to 90 days of contract inception.
In instances where the timing of revenue recognition differs from the timing of invoicing, we have determined our contracts generally do not include a significant financing component.
The primary purpose of our invoicing terms is to provide customers with simplified and predictable ways of purchasing our products and services, not to receive financing from our customers, such as invoicing at the beginning of a subscription term with a portion of the revenue recognized ratably over the contract period, or to provide customers with financing, such as multi-year on-premises licenses that are invoiced annually with revenue recognized upfront.
For the three months ended March 31, 2019, revenue recognized from performance obligations related to prior periods (for example, due to changes in transaction price) was not material.
Amounts recognized as revenue in excess of amounts billed are recorded as unbilled receivables.
Unbilled receivables which are anticipated to be invoiced in the next twelve months are included in "accounts receivable, net" on the consolidated balance sheet.
Based on the nature of our contracts with customers, we do not typically recognize unbilled receivables related to revenues recognized in excess of amounts billed.
For the three months ended March 31, 2019, amounts recognized related to unbilled receivables were not material.
Unsatisfied Performance Obligations
Revenue expected to be recognized in any future period related to remaining performance obligations, excluding revenue pertaining to contracts that have an original expected duration of one year or less, and contracts where revenue is recognized as invoiced, was approximately $57 million as of March 31, 2019.
Since we typically invoice customers at contract inception, this amount is included in our current and non-current deferred revenue balances.
As of March 31, 2019, we expect to recognize approximately 37% of the revenue related to these unsatisfied performance obligations during the remainder of 2019, 35% during 2020, and 28% thereafter.
Assets Recognized from the Costs to Obtain a Contract with a Customer
We recognize an asset for the incremental costs of obtaining a contract with a customer if we expect the benefit of those costs to be longer than one year.
We have determined that certain sales incentive programs meet the requirements to be capitalized.
Capitalized incremental costs related to initial contracts and renewals are amortized over the same period because the commissions paid on both the initial contract and renewals are commensurate with one another.
Total capitalized costs to obtain a contract were immaterial during the periods presented and are included in other long-term assets on our consolidated balance sheets.
Note 3 – Short-term investments
Equity-Method Investments
The carrying value of our equity method investments was $13 million as of March 31, 2019.
Our proportionate share of the income from equity-method investments was not material for the periods presented.
Note 4 – Fair value measurements
We define fair value to be the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date.
When determining the fair value measurements for assets and liabilities required or permitted to be recorded at fair value, we consider the principal or most advantageous market that market participants may use when pricing the asset or liability.
Level 1 – Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities
Level 2 – Inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly
Level 3 – Inputs that are not based on observable market data
We value our available-for-sale short-term investments based on pricing from third party pricing vendors, who may use quoted prices in active markets for identical assets (Level 1 inputs) or inputs other than quoted prices that are observable either directly or indirectly (Level 2 inputs) in determining fair value.
We classify all of our fixed income available-for-sale securities as having Level 2 inputs.
The valuation techniques used to measure the fair value of our financial instruments having Level 2 inputs were derived from non-binding market consensus prices that are corroborated by observable market data, quoted market prices for similar instruments, or pricing models, such as discounted cash flow techniques.
We believe all of these sources reflect the credit risk associated with each of our available-for-sale short-term investments.
Short-term investments available-for-sale consists of debt securities issued by states of the U.S. and political subdivisions of the U.S., corporate debt securities and debt securities issued by U.S. government organizations and agencies.
All of our short-term investments available-for-sale have contractual maturities of less than 60 months.
Our derivatives consist of foreign currency forward contracts.
Our foreign currency forward contracts are valued using an income approach (Level 2) based on the spot rate less the contract rate multiplied by the notional amount.
We consider counterparty credit risk in the valuation of our derivatives.
However, counterparty credit risk did not impact the valuation of our derivatives during the three months ended March 31, 2019.
There were no transfers in or out of Level 1 or Level 2 during the three months ended March 31, 2019.
As of March 31, 2019, our short-term investments did not include sovereign debt from any country other than the United States.
We did not have any items that were measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis at March 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018.
The carrying value of net accounts receivable, accounts payable, and long-term debt contained in the consolidated balance sheets approximates fair value.
Note 5 – Derivative instruments and hedging activities
We recognize all of our derivative instruments as either assets or liabilities in our statement of financial position at fair value.
The accounting for changes in the fair value (i.e., gains or losses) of a derivative instrument depends on whether it has been designated and qualifies as part of a hedging relationship and further, on the type of hedging relationship.
For those derivative instruments that are designated and qualify as hedging instruments, we designate the hedging instrument, based upon the exposure being hedged, as a fair value hedge, cash flow hedge, or a hedge of a net investment in a foreign operation.
We have operations in over 50 countries.
Sales outside of the Americas accounted for approximately 61% and 62% of our net sales during the three months ended March 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively.
Our activities expose us to a variety of market risks, including the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates.
These financial risks are monitored and managed by us as an integral part of our overall risk management program.
We maintain a foreign currency risk management strategy that uses derivative instruments (foreign currency forward contracts) to help protect our earnings and cash flows from fluctuations caused by the volatility in currency exchange rates.
Movements in foreign currency exchange rates pose a risk to our operations and competitive position, in that exchange rate changes may affect our profitability and cash flow, and the business or pricing strategies of our non-U.S. based competitors.
The vast majority of our foreign sales are denominated in the customers’ local currency.
We purchase foreign currency forward contracts as hedges of forecasted sales that are denominated in foreign currencies and as hedges of foreign currency denominated financial assets or liabilities.
These contracts are entered into to help protect against the risk that the eventual dollar-net-cash inflows resulting from such sales or firm commitments will be adversely affected by changes in exchange rates.
We also purchase foreign currency forward contracts as hedges of forecasted expenses that are denominated in foreign currencies.
These contracts are entered into to help protect against the risk that the eventual dollar-net-cash outflows resulting from foreign currency operating and cost of sales expenses will be adversely affected by changes in exchange rates.
We designate foreign currency forward contracts as cash flow hedges of forecasted net sales or forecasted expenses.
In addition, we hedge our foreign currency denominated balance sheet exposures using foreign currency forward contracts that are not designated as hedging instruments.
None of our derivative instruments contain a credit-risk-related contingent feature.
 Cash flow hedges
To help protect against the reduction in value caused by a fluctuation in foreign currency exchange rates of forecasted foreign currency cash flows resulting from international sales over the next one to three years, we have instituted a foreign currency cash flow hedging program.
We hedge portions of our forecasted net sales and forecasted expenses denominated in foreign currencies with forward contracts.
For forward contracts, when the dollar strengthens significantly against the foreign currencies, the change in the present value of future foreign currency cash flows may be offset by the change in the fair value of the forward contracts designated as hedges.
We purchase foreign currency forward contracts for up to 100% of our forecasted exposures in selected currencies (primarily in Euro, Japanese yen, Hungarian forint, British pound, Malaysian ringgit, Chinese yuan, and Korean won) and limit the duration of these contracts to 36 months or less.
For derivative instruments that are designated and qualify as a cash flow hedge, the gain or loss on the derivative is reported as a component of accumulated OCI and reclassified into earnings in the same line item (net sales, operating expenses, or cost of sales) associated with the forecasted transaction and in the same period or periods during which the hedged transaction affects earnings.
Hedge effectiveness of foreign currency forwards designated as cash flow hedges are measured by comparing the hedging instrument’s cumulative change in fair value from inception to maturity to the forecasted transaction’s terminal value.
The contracts in the foregoing table had contractual maturities of 21 months or less and 24 months or less at March 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018, respectively.
At March 31, 2019, we expect to reclassify $7.3 million of gains on derivative instruments from accumulated OCI to net sales during the next twelve months when the hedged international sales occur, $(0.1) million of losses on derivative instruments from accumulated OCI to cost of sales during the next twelve months when the cost of sales are incurred and $(0.1) million of losses on derivative instruments from accumulated OCI to operating expenses during the next twelve months when the hedged operating expenses occur.
Expected amounts are based on derivative valuations at March 31, 2019.
Actual results may vary materially as a result of changes in the corresponding exchange rates subsequent to this date.
Other Derivatives
Other derivatives not designated as hedging instruments consist primarily of foreign currency forward contracts that we use to hedge our foreign denominated net receivable or net payable positions to help protect against the change in value caused by a fluctuation in foreign currency exchange rates.
We typically attempt to hedge up to 90% of our outstanding foreign denominated net receivables or net payables and typically limit the duration of these foreign currency forward contracts to approximately 90 days or less.
The gain or loss on the derivatives as well as the offsetting gain or loss on the hedge item attributable to the hedged risk is recognized in current earnings under the line item “net foreign exchange gain (loss).” As of March 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018, we held foreign currency forward contracts that were not designated as hedging instruments with a notional amount of $42 million and $71 million, respectively.
The following tables present the fair value of derivative instruments on our Consolidated Balance Sheets at March 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018, respectively.

Note 6 – Inventories, net
໿
Note 7 – Intangible assets and goodwill
Software development costs capitalized for the three month periods ended March 31, 2019 and 2018 were $2.4 million and $8.0 million, respectively, and related amortization expense was $6.9 million and $6.2 million, respectively.
Capitalized software development costs for the three month periods ended March 31, 2019 and 2018 included costs related to stock based compensation of $0.1 million and $0.3 million, respectively.
Amortization of capitalized software development costs is computed on an individual product basis for those products available for market and is recognized based on the product’s estimated economic life, generally three to six years.
Acquired technology and other intangible assets are amortized over their useful lives, which range from three to eight years.
Patents are amortized using the straight-line method over their estimated period of benefit, generally 10 to 17 years.
Total intangible assets amortization expenses were $9.0 million and $8.4 million for the three month periods ended March 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively.
Goodwill
The excess purchase price over the fair value of assets acquired is recorded as goodwill.
As we have one operating segment comprised of components with similar economic characteristics, we allocate goodwill to one reporting unit for goodwill impairment testing.
Goodwill is tested for impairment on an annual basis, and between annual tests if indicators of potential impairment exist, using a fair-value-based approach based on the market capitalization of the reporting unit.
Our annual impairment test is performed in the fourth quarter of each year.
 No impairment of goodwill was identified during the three months ended March 31, 2019 or the twelve months ended December 31, 2018.
Note 8 – Leases
We have operating leases for corporate offices, automobiles, and certain equipment.
Our leases have remaining terms of 1 year to 95 years, some of which may include options to extend the leases for up to 9 years, and some of which may include options to terminate the leases within 1 year.
Leases with an initial term of 12 months or less are not recorded on the balance sheet; we recognize lease expense for these leases on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
Amounts related to finance lease activities and income from leasing activities were not material for the periods presented.
As of March 31, 2019, we have additional operating leases, that have not commenced during the period, which were not material.
Note 9 – Income taxes
We account for income taxes under the asset and liability method.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected tax consequences of temporary differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their reported amounts.
Valuation allowances are established when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to amounts which are more likely than not to be realized.
We had a valuation allowance of $80 million at March 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018.
A majority of the valuation allowance is related to the deferred tax assets of National Instruments Hungary Kft.
(“NI Hungary”).
We account for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in our financial statements using prescribed recognition thresholds and measurement attributes for financial statement disclosure of tax positions taken or expected to be taken on our tax returns.
We had $8.0 million and $9.8 million of unrecognized tax benefits at March 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018, respectively, all of which would affect our effective income tax rate if recognized.
We recorded a gross increase in unrecognized tax benefits of $0.2 million for the three month period ended March 31, 2019, as a result of the tax positions taken during this period.
We recorded a gross decrease in unrecognized tax benefits of $2.0 million for the three month period ended March 31, 2019 as a result of closing of open tax years.
As of March 31, 2019, it is reasonably possible that we will recognize tax benefits in the amount of $1.5 million in the next twelve months due to the closing of open tax years.
The nature of the uncertainty is related to deductions taken on returns that have not been examined by the applicable tax authority.
Our continuing policy is to recognize interest and penalties related to income tax matters in income tax expense.
As of March 31, 2019, we had approximately $0.7 million accrued for interest related to uncertain tax positions.
The tax years 2012 through 2019 remain open to examination by the major taxing jurisdictions to which we are subject.
Our provision for income taxes reflected an effective tax rate of 11% and 18% for the three month period ended March 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively.
For the three month period ended March 31, 2019, our effective tax rate was lower than the U.S. federal statutory rate of 21% as a result of an enhanced deduction for certain research and development expenses, profits in foreign jurisdictions with reduced income tax rates, the deduction for foreign-derived deduction eligible income, a decrease in unrecognized tax benefits resulting from the closing of open tax years, the research and development tax credit, and a tax benefit from disqualifying dispositions of equity awards that do not ordinarily result in a tax benefit, offset by the U.S. tax on global intangible low-taxed income and nondeductible officer compensation.
For the three month period ended March 31, 2018, our effective tax rate was lower than the U.S. federal statutory rate of 21% as a result of an enhanced deduction for certain research and development expenses, profits in foreign jurisdictions with reduced income tax rates, the deduction for foreign-derived deduction eligible income, the research and development tax credit, and a tax benefit from disqualifying dispositions of equity awards that do not ordinarily result in a tax benefit, offset by the U.S. tax on global intangible low-taxed income.
Our earnings in Hungary are subject to a statutory tax rate of 9%.
In addition, our research and development activities in Hungary benefit from a tax law in Hungary that provides for an enhanced deduction for qualified research and development expenses.
The tax position of our Hungarian operations resulted in income tax benefits of $1.0 million and $1.7 million for the three month periods ended March 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively.
Earnings from our operations in Malaysia are free of tax under a tax holiday effective January 1, 2013.
This tax holiday expires in 2027.
If we fail to satisfy the conditions of the tax holiday, this tax benefit may be terminated early.
The income tax benefits of the tax holiday for the three months ended March 31, 2019 and March 31, 2018 were approximately $0.5 million and $0.6 million, respectively.
The impact of the tax holiday on a per share basis for each of the three months ended March 31, 2019 and March 31, 2018 was a benefit of $0.01 per share.
No other taxing jurisdictions had a significant impact on our effective tax rate.
We have not entered into any advanced pricing or other agreements with the IRS with regard to any foreign jurisdictions.

Note 11 – Authorized shares of common and preferred stock and stock-based compensation plans
Authorized shares of common and preferred stock
Following approval by the Company’s Board of Directors and stockholders, on May 14, 2013, the Company’s certificate of incorporation was amended to increase the authorized shares of common stock by 180,000,000 shares to a total of 360,000,000 shares.
As a result of this amendment, the total number of shares which the Company is authorized to issue is 365,000,000 shares, consisting of (i) 5,000,000 shares of preferred stock, par value $0.01 per share, and (ii) 360,000,000 shares of common stock, par value $0.01 per share.
Restricted stock plan
Our stockholders approved our 2005 Incentive Plan (the “2005 Plan”) in May 2005.
At the time of approval, 4,050,000 shares of our common stock were reserved for issuance under this plan, as well as the number of shares which had been reserved but not issued under our 1994 Incentive Plan which terminated in May 2005 (the “1994 Plan”), and any shares that returned to the 1994 Plan as a result of termination of options or repurchase of shares issued under such plan.
The 2005 Plan, administered by the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors, provided for granting of incentive awards in the form of restricted stock and RSUs to directors, executive officers and employees of the Company and its subsidiaries.
Awards vest over a three, five or ten-year period, beginning on the date of grant.
Vesting of ten year awards may accelerate based on the Company’s previous year’s earnings and growth but ten year awards cannot accelerate to vest over a period of less than five years.
The 2005 Plan terminated on May 11, 2010, except with respect to outstanding awards previously granted thereunder.
There were 3,362,304 shares of common stock that were reserved but not issued under the 2005 Plan as of May 11, 2010.
Our stockholders approved our 2010 Incentive Plan (the “2010 Plan”) on May 11, 2010.
At the time of approval, 3,000,000 shares of our common stock were reserved for issuance under this plan, as well as the 3,362,304 shares of common stock that were reserved but not issued under the 1994 Plan and the 2005 Plan as of May 11, 2010, and any shares that are returned to the 1994 Plan and the 2005 Plan as a result of the forfeiture or termination of options or RSUs or repurchase of shares issued under these plans.
The 2010 Plan, administered by the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors, provides for granting of incentive awards in the form of restricted stock and RSUs to employees, directors and consultants of the Company and employees and consultants of any parent or subsidiary of the Company.
Awards vest over a three, five or ten-year period, beginning on the date of grant.
Vesting of ten year awards may accelerate based on the Company’s previous year’s earnings and growth but ten year awards cannot accelerate to vest over a period of less than five years.
The 2010 Plan terminated on May 12, 2015, except with respect to the outstanding awards previously granted thereunder.
There were 2,518,416 shares of common stock that were reserved but not issued under the 2010 Plan as of May 12, 2015.
 Our stockholders approved our 2015 Equity Incentive Plan (the “2015 Plan”) on May 12, 2015.
At the time of approval, 3,000,000 shares of our common stock were reserved for issuance under this plan, as well as the 2,518,416 shares of common stock that were reserved but not issued under the 2010 Plan as of May 12, 2015, and any shares that were returned to the 1994, 2005, and the 2010 Plans as a result of the forfeiture or termination of options or RSUs or repurchase of shares issued under these plans.
The 2015 Plan, administered by the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors, provides for the granting of incentive awards in the form of restricted stock and RSUs, to employees, directors and consultants of the Company and employees and consultants of any parent or subsidiary of the Company and such awards may be subject to performance-based vesting conditions.
Awards vest over a three, four, five or ten-year period, beginning on the date of grant.
Vesting of ten year awards may accelerate based on the Company’s previous year’s earnings and growth but ten year awards cannot accelerate to vest over a period of less than five years.
There were 2,705,610 shares available for grant under the 2015 Plan at March 31, 2019.
During the three month period ended March 31, 2019, we granted PRSUs to certain executives under our 2015 Plan.
Refer to the "Summary of Significant Accounting Policies" in Note 1 - Basis of presentation for additional discussion regarding the impact of these new grants on our accounting policies and related estimates.
Employee stock purchase plan
Our employee stock purchase plan permits substantially all domestic employees and employees of designated subsidiaries to acquire our common stock at a purchase price of 85% of the lower of the market price at the beginning or the end of the purchase period.
The plan has quarterly purchase periods generally beginning on February 1, May 1, August 1 and November 1 of each year.
Employees may designate up to 15% of their compensation for the purchase of common stock under this plan.
On May 9, 2017, our stockholders approved an additional 3,000,000 shares for issuance under our employee stock purchase plan.
At March 31, 2019, we had 1,749,934 shares of common stock reserved for future issuance under this plan.
We issued 245,110 shares under this plan in the three months ended March 31, 2019 and the weighted average purchase price of the shares issued was $37.59 per share.
During the three months ended March 31, 2019, we did not make any changes in accounting principles or methods of estimates with respect to such plan.
Authorized Preferred Stock and Preferred Stock Purchase Rights Plan
We have 5,000,000 authorized shares of preferred stock.
On January 21, 2004, our Board of Directors designated 750,000 of these shares as Series A Participating Preferred Stock in conjunction with the adoption of a Preferred Stock Rights Agreement which expired on May 10, 2014.
There were no shares of preferred stock issued and outstanding at March 31, 2019.
Stock repurchases and retirements
From time to time, our Board of Directors has authorized various programs for our repurchase of shares of our common stock depending on market conditions and other factors.
Under the current program, we repurchased 1,035,098 shares of our common stock at a weighted average price per share of $44.83 during the three months ended March 31, 2019.
We did not make any repurchases during the three months ended March 31, 2018.
At March 31, 2019, there were 2,964,902 shares remaining available for repurchase under this program.
This repurchase program does not have an expiration date.
Note 12 – Segment and geographic information
We operate as one operating segment.
Operating segments are defined as components of an enterprise for which separate financial information is evaluated regularly by the chief operating decision maker, who is our chief executive officer, in deciding how to allocate resources and in assessing performance.
Our chief operating decision maker evaluates our financial information and resources and assesses the performance of these resources on a consolidated basis.
Since we operate in one operating segment, all required financial segment information can be found in the condensed consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto.
We sell our products in three geographic regions which consist of Americas; Europe, Middle East, India, and Africa (EMEIA); and Asia-Pacific (APAC).
Our sales to these regions share similar economic characteristics, similar product mix, similar customers, and similar distribution methods.
Revenue from the sale of our products, which are similar in nature, and software maintenance is reflected as total net sales in our Consolidated Statements of Income.
(See Note 2 –Revenue of Notes to consolidated financial statements for total net sales by the major geographic areas in which we operate).
Based on the billing location of the customer, total sales outside the U.S. for the three months ended March 31, 2019 and 2018 were $198 million and $200 million, respectively.
Total property and equipment, net, outside the U.S. was $115 million and $132 million as of March 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018.
See Note 1 - Basis of presentation for additional information regarding the impact of the new lease accounting standard on our consolidated balance sheet.
Note 13 - Debt
On May 9, 2013, we entered into a Loan Agreement (the “Loan Agreement”) with Wells Fargo Bank (the “Lender”).
The Loan Agreement provided for a $50 million unsecured revolving line of credit with a scheduled maturity date of May 9, 2018 (the “Maturity Date”).
On October 29, 2015, we entered into a First Amendment to Loan Agreement (the “Amendment”) with the Lender, which amended our Loan Agreement to among other things, (i) increase the unsecured revolving line of credit from $50 million to $125 million, (ii) extend the Maturity Date of the line of credit from May 9, 2018 to October 29, 2020, and (iii) provide us with an option to request increases to the line of credit of up to an additional $25 million in the aggregate, subject to consent of the Lender and terms and conditions to be mutually agreed between us and the Lender.
On April 27, 2018, we entered into a Second Amendment to Loan Agreement (the "Second Amendment") which amended the Loan Agreement, as amended by the Amendment to, among other things, (i) reduce the revolving line of credit from $125.0 million to $5.0 million, (ii) reduce the letter of credit sublimit under the line of credit from $10.0 million to $5.0 million and (iii) require us and our subsidiaries to comply with certain of the affirmative and negative covenants under the Loan Agreement only if loans are outstanding under the Loan Agreement or if we have not reimbursed any drawing under a letter of credit issued under the Loan Agreement within five business days following the request of the Lender.
The loans bear interest, at our option, at a base rate determined in accordance with the Loan Agreement, plus a spread of 0.0% to 0.50%, or a LIBOR rate plus a spread of 1.13% to 2.00%, in each case with such spread determined based on a ratio of consolidated indebtedness to EBITDA, determined in accordance with the Loan Agreement.
Principal, together with all accrued and unpaid interest, is due and payable on the Maturity Date.
We are also obligated to pay a quarterly commitment fee, payable in arrears, based on the available commitments at a rate of 0.18% to 0.30%, with such rate determined based on the ratio described above.
The Loan Agreement contains customary affirmative and negative covenants.
The affirmative covenants include, among other things, delivery of financial statements, compliance certificates and notices; payment of taxes and other obligations; maintenance of existence; maintenance of properties and insurance; and compliance with applicable laws and regulations.
The negative covenants include, among other things, limitations on indebtedness, liens, mergers, consolidations, acquisitions and sales of assets, investments, changes in the nature of the business, affiliate transactions and certain restricted payments.
The Loan Agreement also requires us to maintain a ratio of consolidated indebtedness to EBITDA equal to or less than 3.25 to 1.00, and a ratio of consolidated EBITDA to interest expense greater than or equal to 3.00 to 1.00, in each case determined in accordance with the Loan Agreement.
As of March 31, 2019, we were in compliance with all applicable covenants in the Loan Agreement.
The Loan Agreement contains customary events of default including, among other things, payment defaults, breaches of covenants or representations and warranties, cross-defaults with certain other indebtedness, bankruptcy and insolvency events, judgment defaults and change in control events, subject to grace periods in certain instances.
Upon an event of default, the lender may declare all or a portion of the outstanding obligations payable by us to be immediately due and payable and exercise other rights and remedies provided for under the Loan Agreement.
Under certain circumstances, a default interest rate will apply on all obligations during the existence of an event of default under the Loan Agreement at a per annum rate of interest equal to 2.00% above the otherwise applicable interest rate.
Proceeds of loans made under the Loan Agreement may be used for working capital and other general corporate purposes.
We may prepay the loans under the Loan Agreement in whole or in part at any time without premium or penalty.
Certain of our existing and future material domestic subsidiaries are required to guaranty our obligations under the Loan Agreement.
As of March 31, 2019, we had no outstanding borrowings under this line of credit.
During the three month periods ended March 31, 2019 and 2018, we incurred no interest expense under this line of credit.
As of March 31, 2019 and March 31, 2018, the weighted-average interest rate on the revolving line of credit was 3.7% and 3.0%, respectively.
Note 14 – Commitments and contingencies
As of March 31, 2019, we had non-cancelable purchase commitments with various suppliers of customized inventory and inventory components totaling approximately $7.1 million over the next twelve months.
As of March 31, 2019, we had no outstanding guarantees for payment of customs and foreign grants, which are generally payable over the next twelve months.
Note 15 – Restructuring
Since the first quarter of 2017, we have been taking steps to reduce our overall employee headcount in an effort to minimize job duplication or evaluate where we should shift and centralize activities, improve efficiencies, and rebalance our resources on higher return activities.
The timing and scope of our headcount reductions will vary.
The restructuring liability of $3.6 million at March 31, 2019 relating to this restructuring activity is recorded in the “accrued compensation” line item of the consolidated balance sheet.
໿
Note 16 – Litigation
We are not currently a party to any material litigation.
However, in the ordinary course of our business, we have in the past, are currently and will likely become involved in various legal proceedings, claims, and regulatory, tax or government inquiries and investigations, and could incur uninsured liability in any one or more of them.
We also periodically receive notifications from various third parties related to alleged infringement of patents or intellectual property rights, commercial disputes or other matters.
No assurances can be given with respect to the extent or outcome of any investigation, litigation or dispute.
Note 17 – Subsequent events
On April 24, 2019, our Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.25 per common share, payable on June 3, 2019, to stockholders of record on May 13, 2019.
ITEM 1.
LEGAL PROCEEDINGS
We are not currently a party to any material litigation.
However, in the ordinary course of our business, we have in the past, are currently and will likely become involved in various legal proceedings, claims, and regulatory, tax or government inquiries and investigations, and could incur uninsured liability in any one or more of them.
We also periodically receive notifications from various third parties related to alleged infringement of patents or intellectual property rights, commercial disputes or other matters.
No assurances can be given with respect to the extent or outcome of any investigation, litigation or dispute.
ITEM 1A.
RISK FACTORS
In addition to the other information set forth in this Form 10-Q, you should carefully consider the risk factors discussed below.
The risks described below are not the only risks that we face.
Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial also may materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, or operating results.
Uncertain Global Economic Conditions Could Materially Adversely Affect Our Business and Results of Operations.
Our operations and performance are sensitive to fluctuations in general economic conditions, both in the U.S. and globally.
Uncertainty about global and regional economic conditions poses a risk to us as businesses may decrease or postpone spending in response to events such as a U.S. government shutdown, the impending Brexit, continued trade tensions between the U.S. and China or other parts of the world, financial market volatility, tariffs or other trade restrictions, government austerity programs, government regulatory actions, negative financial news, geopolitical instability, declines in income or asset values, or other factors.
In particular, during December 2018, we experienced weaker demand for some of our products in the APAC region, particularly for applications in China.
Negative trends or sentiments in worldwide and regional economic conditions have in the past and could again have a material adverse effect on demand for our products and services.
In March 2018, the U.S. imposed steel, aluminum, and other tariffs on imports from various countries.
These tariffs have increased international trade tensions and led to tariffs on U.S. exports to various countries.
Even if resolved, this could have a broad negative impact on the global industrial economy, which could have a material adverse impact on our business and our results of operations.
These factors as well as others we may not contemplate could have a material adverse effect on the spending patterns of businesses including our current and potential customers which could have a material adverse effect on our net sales and our results of operations.
See “Current business outlook” in this Form 10-Q for information regarding recent business conditions.
We Make Significant Investments in New Products that May Not Be Successful or Achieve Expected Returns.
We plan to continue to make significant investments in research, development, and marketing for new and existing products and technologies.
For example, in 2017 we launched LabVIEW NXG, the most recent version of our flagship software application.
We have made and expect to make significant investments in software development related to the new and enhanced features of this product.
These investments involve a number of risks as the commercial success of such efforts depend on many factors, including our ability to anticipate and respond to innovation, achieve the desired technological fit, and be effective with our marketing and distribution efforts.
If our existing or potential customers do not perceive our latest product offerings as providing significant new functionality or value, or if we are late to market with a new product or technology, we may not achieve our expected return on our investments or be able recover the costs expended to develop new product offerings, which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results.
Even if our new products are profitable, our operating margins for new products may not be as high as the margins we have experienced historically.
Our Success Depends on New Product Introductions and Market Acceptance of Our Products.
The market for our products is characterized by rapid technological change, evolving industry standards, changes in customer needs and frequent new product introductions, and is therefore highly dependent upon timely product innovation.
Our success is dependent on our ability to successfully develop and introduce new and enhanced products on a timely basis to replace declining revenues from older products, and on increasing penetration in domestic and international markets.
As has occurred in the past and as may be expected to occur in the future, we have experienced significant delays between the announcement and the commercial availability of new products.
Any significant delay in releasing new products could have a material adverse effect on the ultimate success of a product and other related products and could impede continued sales of predecessor products, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results.
There can be no assurance that we will be able to introduce new products in accordance with announced release dates, that our new products will achieve market acceptance or that any such acceptance will be sustained for any significant period.
Failure of our new products to achieve or sustain market acceptance could have a material adverse effect on our operating results.
Our Reported Financial Results May be Adversely Affected by Changes in Accounting Principles Generally Accepted in the U.S. We prepare our financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S.
These accounting principles are subject to interpretation by the FASB and the Securities and Exchange Commission.
Generally accepted accounting principles and accompanying accounting pronouncements, implementation guidelines and interpretations for many aspects of our business, such as revenue recognition, software capitalization, and income tax uncertainties, are complex and involve subjective judgments by management.
A change in these policies or interpretations could have a significant effect on our reported financial results and our internal controls over financial reporting, may retroactively affect previously reported results, could cause unexpected financial reporting fluctuations, and may require us to make costly changes to our operational processes and accounting systems.
For example, in February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02, Leases, as amended, supersedes nearly all existing U.S. GAAP lease guidance and which became effective for us for our fiscal year beginning January 1, 2019.
(See Note 1 - Basis of presentation and Note 8 - Leases for additional discussion of the accounting changes).
•fluctuations in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar;
•unexpected changes to currency policy or currency restrictions in foreign jurisdictions;
•delays in collecting trade receivable balances from customers in developing economies;
•tariffs and other trade barriers;
•unexpected changes in regulatory requirements;
•fluctuations in local economies;
•disparate and changing employment laws in foreign jurisdictions;
•difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations;
•costs and risks of localizing products for foreign countries;
•government actions throughout the world; and
•the burdens of complying with a wide variety of foreign laws.
Moreover, there can be no assurance that our international sales will continue at existing levels or grow in accordance with our efforts to increase foreign market penetration.
In many foreign countries, particularly in those with developing economies, it is common to engage in business practices that are prohibited by U.S. regulations applicable to us such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act.
Although we have policies and procedures designed to ensure compliance with these laws, there can be no assurance that all of our employees, contractors and agents, including those based in or from countries where practices which violate such U.S. laws may be customary, will not take actions in violation of our policies.
Any violation of foreign or U.S. laws by our employees, contractors or agents, even if such violation is prohibited by our policies, could have a material adverse effect on our business.
We must also comply with various import and export regulations.
The application of these various regulations depends on the classification of our products which can change over time as such regulations are modified or interpreted.
As a result, even if we are currently in compliance with applicable regulations, there can be no assurance that we will not have to incur additional costs or take additional compliance actions in the future.
Failure to comply with these regulations could result in fines or termination of import and export privileges, which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results.
Additionally, the regulatory environment in some countries is very restrictive as their governments try to protect their local economy and value of their local currency against the U.S. dollar.
•the volatility of the Hungarian forint and the Malaysian ringgit relative to the U.S. dollar;
•changing and potentially unstable political environments;
•significant and frequent changes in corporate tax laws;
•difficulty in managing manufacturing operations in foreign countries;
•challenges in expanding capacity to meet increased demand;
•difficulty in achieving or maintaining product quality;
•interruption to transportation flows for delivery of components to us and finished goods to our customers;
•restrictive labor codes; and
•increasing labor costs.
No assurance can be given that our efforts to mitigate these risks will be successful.
Any failure to effectively deal with the risks above could result in an interruption in the operations of our facilities in Hungary or Malaysia which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results.
•burdens of complying with additional or more complex VAT and customs regulations; and
•concentration of inventory increasing the risks associated with fire, natural disasters and logistics disruptions to customer order fulfillment.
Any failure or delay in distribution from our facilities in Hungary and Malaysia could have a material adverse effect on our operating results.
Our Financial Performance is Subject to Risks Associated with Changes in the Value of the U.S. Dollar versus Local Currencies.
The vast majority of our sales outside of the U.S. are denominated in local currencies, and accordingly, the U.S. dollar equivalent of these sales is affected by changes in the foreign currency exchange rates.
If the local currencies in which we sell our products strengthen against the U.S. dollar, we have in the past, and in the future may need to, lower our prices in the local currency to remain competitive in our international markets.
This could have a material adverse effect on our gross and net profit margins.
If the local currencies in which we sell our products weaken against the U.S. dollar and if the local sales prices cannot be raised due to competitive pressures, we will experience a deterioration of our gross and net profit margins.
In the past, we have noted that significant volatility in foreign currency exchange rates in the markets in which we do business has had a significant impact on the revaluation of our foreign currency denominated firm commitments, on our ability to forecast our U.S. dollar equivalent net sales and expenses and on the effectiveness of our hedging programs.
In the past, these dynamics have also adversely affected our net sales growth in international markets and may pose similar challenges in the future.
See “Results of Operations” in this Form 10-Q for further discussion on the effect that changes in the foreign currency exchange rates have had on our operating results.
See “Current business outlook” in this Form 10-Q for information regarding recent business conditions.
Orders With a Value of Greater than One Million Dollars Expose Us to Significant Additional Business and Legal Risks that Could Have a Material Adverse Impact on our Business, Results of Operations and Financial Condition.
We continue to make a concentrated effort to increase our net sales through the pursuit of orders with a value greater than $1.0 million.
These types of orders expose us to significant additional business and legal risks compared to smaller orders.
Our very large customers frequently require contract terms that vary substantially from our standard terms of sale.
At times these orders include terms that impose critical delivery commitments and severe contractual liabilities if we fail to provide the required quantity of products at the required delivery times, impose product acceptance requirements and product performance evaluation requirements which create uncertainty with respect to the timing of our ability to recognize revenue from such orders, allow the customers to cancel or delay orders without liability, require us to develop specific product mitigation plans for product delivery constraints caused by unexpected or catastrophic situations to help assure quick production recovery, and that require most favored customer pricing, significant discounts, extended payment terms and volume rebates.
At times these customers require broad indemnity obligations and large direct and consequential damage provisions in the event we breach our contracts with them.
At times these contracts have supply constraint requirements which mandate that we allocate large product inventories for a specific contract.
These inventory requirements expose us to higher risks of inventory obsolescence and can adversely impact our ability to provide adequate product supply to other customers.
While we attempt to limit the number of contracts that contain the non-standard terms of sale described above and attempt to contractually limit our potential liability under such contracts, we have been, and expect to be, required to agree to some or all of such provisions to secure orders from very large customers and to continue to grow our business.
These arrangements expose us to significant additional legal and operational risks which could result in a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations and financial condition.
In addition, these larger orders are more volatile, are subject to greater discount variability and may contract at a faster pace during an economic downturn.
We attempt to manage these risks but there can be no assurance that we will be successful in our efforts.
Revenue Derived from Large Orders Could Adversely Affect our Gross Margin and Could Lead to Greater Variability in our Quarterly Results.
We define our large order business as orders with a value greater than $100,000.
These orders have been and may continue to be more sensitive to changes in the global industrial economy, subject to greater discount variability and such orders may be pushed-out or reduced at a faster pace during an economic downturn compared to orders valued at less than $100,000.
To the extent that the amount of our net sales derived from large orders increases in future periods, either in absolute dollars or as a percentage of our overall business, our gross margins could decline, and we could experience greater volatility and see a greater negative impact from future downturns in the global industrial economy.
This dynamic may also have an impact on the historical seasonal pattern of our net sales and our results of operations.
These types of orders also make managing inventory levels more difficult as we have in the past and may have to in the future build large quantities of inventory in anticipation of future demand that may not materialize.
 Our Product Revenues are Dependent on Certain Industries and Contractions in these Industries Could Have a Material Adverse Effect on Our Results of Operations.
Sales of our products are dependent on customers in certain industries, particularly the telecommunications, semiconductor, consumer electronics, automotive, energy, automated test equipment, and ADG.
As we have experienced in the past, and as we may continue to experience in the future, downturns characterized by diminished product demand in any one or more of these industries may result in decreased sales and a material adverse effect on our operating results.
We cannot predict when and to what degree contractions in these industries may occur; however, any sharp or prolonged contraction in one or more of these industries could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.
Our Realignment Activities May be Disruptive to Our Operations and Negatively Impact Our Results of Operations.
We are currently implementing changes within our organization designed to enhance our ability to pursue market opportunities, accelerate our technology development initiatives, and improve operational efficiencies.
Specifically, we are in the process of aligning certain aspects of our operations with our strategic focus on industry-specific applications where we believe our product platform can add the most value to our customers.
In the short-term, these actions may lead to business disruptions, decreased productivity and unanticipated employee turnover which may have an adverse impact on our business and results of operations.
Concentrations of Credit Risk and Uncertain Conditions in the Global Financial Markets May Adversely Affect Our Business and Results of Operations.
By virtue of our holdings of cash, investment securities and foreign currency derivatives, we have exposure to many different counterparties, and routinely execute transactions with counterparties in the financial services industry, including commercial banks and investment banks.
Many of these transactions expose us to credit risk in the event of a default of our counterparties.
We continue to monitor the stability of the financial markets, particularly those in the emerging markets.
We can give no assurance that we will not be negatively impacted by any adverse outcomes in those markets.
There can be no assurance that any losses or impairments to the carrying value of our financial assets as a result of defaults by our counterparties would not materially and adversely affect our business, financial position and results of operations.
We Have Established a Budget and Variations From Our Budget Will Affect Our Financial Results.
We have established an operating budget for fiscal 2019.
Our budget was established based on the estimated revenue from sales of our products which are based on anticipated economic conditions in the markets in which we do business as well as the timing and volume of our new products and the expected penetration of both new and existing products in the marketplace.
If demand for our products during the remainder of 2019 is less than the demand we anticipated in setting our fiscal year budget, our operating results could be negatively impacted.
•continued foreign currency fluctuations;
•increased manufacturing costs resulting from component supply shortages or component price fluctuations;
•additional marketing costs for new product introductions or for conferences and tradeshows;
•the timing, cost or outcome of any future intellectual property litigation or commercial disputes;
•unanticipated costs related to acquisitions we may make; or
•increased component costs resulting from vendors increasing their sales prices.
•general market and economic conditions;
•our ability to maintain and grow our business with our very large customers;
•our ability to meet the volume and service requirements of our large customers;
•success in developing and selling new products;
•industry consolidation, including acquisitions by us or our competitors;
•capacity utilization and the efficiency of manufacturing operations;
•timing of our new product introductions;
•new product introductions by competitors;
•product pricing, including the impact of currency exchange rates;
•the ability of competitors to more fully leverage low cost geographies for manufacturing or distribution;
•effectiveness of sales and marketing resources and strategies;
•adequate manufacturing capacity and supply of components and materials;
•strategic relationships with our suppliers;
•product quality and performance;
•protection of our products by effective use of intellectual property laws;
•the financial strength of our competitors;
•the outcome of any future litigation or commercial dispute;
•barriers to entry imposed by competitors with significant market power in new markets; and,
•government actions throughout the world.
There can be no assurance that we will be able to compete successfully in the future.
•fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates;
•changes in global economic conditions;
•changes in the amount of revenue derived from very large orders (including orders from our very large customers) and the pricing, margins, and other terms of such orders;
•changes in the capacity utilization including at our facility in Malaysia;
•changes in the mix of products sold;
•the availability and pricing of components from third parties (especially limited sources);
•the difficulty in maintaining margins, including the higher margins traditionally achieved in international sales;
•changes in pricing policies by us, our competitors or suppliers;
•the timing, cost or outcome of any future intellectual property litigation or commercial disputes;
•delays in product shipments caused by human error or other factors; or,
•disruptions in transportation channels.
Our Revenues are Subject to Seasonal Variations.
In previous years, our revenues have been characterized by seasonality, with revenues typically growing from the first quarter to the second quarter, being relatively constant from the second quarter to the third quarter, growing in the fourth quarter compared to the third quarter and declining in the first quarter of the following year from the fourth quarter of the preceding year.
This historical trend has been affected and may continue to be affected in the future by broad fluctuations in the global industrial economy as well as the timing of new product introductions or any acquisitions.
In addition, revenue derived from very large orders, including those from our very large customers, have had a significant impact on our historical seasonal trends as these orders may be more sensitive to changes in the global industrial economy, may be subject to greater volatility in timing and amount, greater discount variability, lower gross margins, and may contract at a faster pace during economic downturns.
Our Tax Returns and Other Tax Matters are Subject to Examination by the U.S. Internal Revenue Service and Other Tax Authorities and Governmental Bodies and the Results of These Examinations Could Have a Material Adverse Effect on Our Financial Condition.
We account for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in our financial statements using prescribed recognition thresholds and measurement attributes for financial statement disclosure of tax positions taken or expected to be taken on our tax returns.
These uncertain tax positions are subject to examination by the U.S. Internal Revenue Service and other tax authorities.
There can be no assurance as to the outcome of any future examinations.
If the ultimate determination of our taxes owed is for an amount in excess of amounts previously accrued, our operating results, cash flows, and financial condition could be materially adversely affected.
Our tax years 2012 through 2019 remain open to examination by the major taxing jurisdictions to which we are subject.
Our Acquisitions are Subject to a Number of Related Costs and Challenges that Could Have a Material Adverse Effect on Our Business and Results of Operations.
In recent years, we have completed several acquisitions.
Achieving the anticipated benefits of an acquisition depends upon whether the integration of the acquired business, products or technology is accomplished efficiently and effectively.
In addition, successful acquisitions generally require, among other things, integration of product offerings, manufacturing operations and coordination of sales and marketing and research and development efforts.
These difficulties can become more challenging due to the need to coordinate geographically separated organizations, the complexities of the technologies being integrated, and the necessities of integrating personnel with disparate business backgrounds and combining different corporate cultures.
The integration of operations following an acquisition also requires the dedication of management resources, which may distract attention from our day-to-day business and may disrupt key research and development, marketing or sales efforts.
Our inability to successfully integrate any of our acquisitions could harm our business.
The existing products previously sold by entities we have acquired may be of a lesser quality than our products or could contain errors that produce incorrect results on which users rely or cause failure or interruption of systems or processes that could subject us to liability claims that could have a material adverse effect on our operating results or financial position.
Furthermore, products acquired in connection with acquisitions may not gain acceptance in our markets, and we may not achieve the anticipated or desired benefits of such transactions.
Tax Law Changes in Hungary Could Have a Negative Impact on our Effective Tax Rate, Earnings and Results of Operations.
The profit from our Hungarian operations benefits from the fact that it is subject to an effective income tax rate that is lower than the U.S. federal statutory tax rate.
Our earnings in Hungary are subject to a statutory tax rate of 9%.
In addition, effective January 1, 2010, certain qualified research and development expenses in Hungary became eligible for an enhanced tax deduction.
These tax benefits may not be available in future years due to changes in political conditions in Hungary or changes in tax laws in Hungary or in the U.S.
The reduction or elimination of these benefits in Hungary could result in an increase in our future effective income tax rate which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results.
(See Note 9 - Income taxes of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional discussion regarding the impact of these matters on our income taxes).
 Our Income Tax Rate Could be Adversely Affected by the Expiration of a Tax Holiday in Malaysia.
Profits from our manufacturing facility in Penang, Malaysia are free of tax under a 15 year tax holiday effective January 1, 2013.
If we fail to satisfy the conditions of the tax holiday, this tax benefit may be terminated early.
The expiration of the tax holiday in Malaysia could have a material adverse effect on our operating results.
(See Note 9 - Income taxes of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional discussion regarding the impact of this tax holiday on our income taxes).
Our Business is Dependent on Key Suppliers and Distributors and Disruptions in these Businesses Could Adversely Affect Our Business and Results of Operations.
Our manufacturing processes use large volumes of high-quality components and subassemblies supplied by outside sources.
Several of these items are only available through limited sources.
Limited source items purchased include custom application specific integrated circuits, chassis and other components.
We have in the past experienced delays and quality problems in connection with limited source items, and there can be no assurance that these problems will not recur in the future.
Accordingly, our failure to receive items from limited source item suppliers could result in a material adverse effect on our net sales and operating results.
In the event that any of our limited source suppliers experience significant financial or operational difficulties due to adverse global economic conditions or otherwise, our business and operating results would likely be adversely impacted until we are able to secure another source for the required materials.
In some countries, we use distributors to support our sales channels.
In the event that any of our distributors experience significant financial or operational difficulties due to adverse global economic conditions or if we experience disruptions in the use of these distributors, our business and operating results would likely be adversely impacted until we are able to secure another distributor or establish direct sales capabilities in the affected market.
We May Experience Component Shortages that May Adversely Affect Our Business and Result of Operations.
As has occurred in the past and as may be expected to occur in the future, supply shortages of components used in our products, including limited source components, can result in significant additional costs and inefficiencies in manufacturing.
If we are unsuccessful in resolving any such component shortages in a timely manner, we will experience a significant impact on the timing of revenue, a possible loss of revenue, or an increase in manufacturing costs, any of which would have a material adverse impact on our operating results.
We Rely on Management Information Systems and Interruptions in our Information Technology Systems or Cyber-Attacks on our Systems Could Adversely Affect Our Business.
We rely on the efficient and uninterrupted operation of complex information technology systems and networks, including cloud-based and other outsourced services, to operate our business.
We rely on a primary global center for our management information systems and on multiple systems in branches not covered by our global center.
As with any information system, unforeseen issues may arise that could affect our ability to receive adequate, accurate and timely financial information, which in turn could inhibit effective and timely decisions.
Furthermore, it is possible that our global center for information systems or our branch operations could experience a complete or partial shutdown.
A significant system or network disruption could be the result of new system implementations, facility issues, energy blackouts, and computer viruses, cyber-attacks, or security breaches, some of which may remain undetected for an extended period.
Threats to our information technology security can take a variety of forms and individuals or groups of hackers or sophisticated organizations including state-sponsored organizations, may take steps that pose threats to our customers and our infrastructure.
If we were to experience a shutdown, disruption or attack, it would adversely impact our product shipments and net sales, as order processing and product distribution are heavily dependent on our management information systems.
Such an interruption could also result in a loss of our intellectual property or the release of sensitive competitive information or partner, customer or employee personal data.
Any loss of such information could harm our competitive position, result in a loss of customer confidence, and cause us to incur significant costs to remedy the damages caused by the disruptions or security breaches.
In addition, changing laws and regulations governing our responsibility to safeguard private data could result in a significant increase in operating or capital expenditures needed to comply with these new laws or regulations.
Accordingly, our operating results in such periods would be adversely impacted.
From time to time, we have experienced attempts to breach our security and attempts to introduce malicious software into our information technology systems; however, such attacks have not previously resulted in any material damage to us.
We are Subject to Risks Associated with Our Website.
We devote significant resources to maintaining our website, ni.com, as a key marketing, sales and support tool and expect to continue to do so in the future.
Failure to properly maintain our website may interrupt our normal operations, including our ability to provide quotes, process orders, ship products, provide services and support to our customers, bill and track our customers, fulfill contractual obligations and otherwise run our business, which would have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.
We host our website internally.
Any failure to successfully maintain our website or any significant downtime or outages affecting our website could have a material adverse impact on our operating results.
Our Products are Complex and May Contain Bugs, Vulnerabilities, Errors, or Design Flaws.
As has occurred in the past and as may be expected to occur in the future, our hardware products, software products and third-party components or operating systems on which our products are based may contain bugs, vulnerabilities, errors or design flaws.
Our products operate in conjunction with third-party products and components across a broad ecosystem.
As has occurred in the past and as may be expected to occur in the future, our products, or products or components in conjunction with which they operate, may contain design flaws.
These bugs, vulnerabilities, errors or design flaws, or fixes to these issues, may have a negative impact on the performance of our products, which could result in additional costs, liability claims, reduced revenue, or harm to our reputation or competitive position, any of which could have a material adverse impact on our operating results.
Although we maintain insurance, there can be no assurance that such insurance or the contractual limitations used by us to limit our liability will be sufficient to cover or limit any claims which may occur.
We Are Subject to the Risk of Product Liability Claims.
Our products are designed to provide information upon which users may rely.
Our products are also used in “real time” applications requiring extremely rapid and continuous processing and constant feedback.
Such applications give rise to the risk that a failure or interruption of the system or application could result in economic damage, bodily harm or property damage.
We attempt to assure the quality and accuracy of the processes contained in our products, and to limit our product liability exposure through contractual limitations on liability, limited warranties, express disclaimers and warnings as well as disclaimers contained in our “shrink wrap” and electronically displayed license agreements with end-users.
If our products contain errors that produce incorrect results on which users rely or cause failure or interruption of systems or processes, customer acceptance of our products could be adversely affected.
Further, we could be subject to liability claims that could have a material adverse effect on our operating results or financial position.
Although we maintain insurance, there can be no assurance that such insurance or the contractual limitations used by us to limit our liability will be sufficient to cover or limit any claims which may occur.
Compliance With Sections 302 and 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 is Costly and Challenging.
As required by Section 302 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, this Form 10-Q contains our management’s certification of adequate disclosure controls and procedures as of March 31, 2019.
Our most recent annual report on Form 10-K also contains a report by our management on our internal control over financial reporting including an assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2018 and an attestation and report by our external auditors with respect to the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting under Section 404.
While these assessments and reports did not reveal any material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting, compliance with Sections 302 and 404 is required for each future fiscal year end.
We expect that the ongoing compliance with Sections 302 and 404 will continue to be both very costly and very challenging and there can be no assurance that material weaknesses will not be identified in future periods.
Any adverse results from such ongoing compliance efforts could result in a loss of investor confidence in our financial reports and have an adverse effect on our stock price.
Our Business Depends on Our Proprietary Rights and We Have Been Subject to Intellectual Property Litigation.
Our success depends on our ability to obtain and maintain patents and other proprietary rights relative to the technologies used in our principal products.
Despite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights, unauthorized parties may have in the past infringed or violated certain of our intellectual property rights.
We from time to time engage in litigation to protect our intellectual property rights.
In monitoring and policing our intellectual property rights, we have been and may be required to spend significant resources.
We from time to time may be notified that we are infringing certain patent or intellectual property rights of others.
There can be no assurance that any future intellectual property dispute or litigation will not result in significant expense, liability, injunction against the sale of some of our products, and a diversion of management’s attention, any of which may have a material adverse effect on our operating results.
Our Business Depends on the Continued Service of Our Key Management and Technical Personnel.
Our success depends upon the continued contributions of our key management, sales, marketing, research and development and operational personnel including Alex Davern, our Chief Executive Officer, Eric Starkloff, our President and Chief Operating Officer, and other members of our senior management and key technical personnel.
Our key employees may voluntarily terminate their employment with us at any time.
The loss of the services of one or more of our key employees in the future could have a material adverse effect on our operating results.
We also believe our future success will depend upon our ability to attract and retain additional highly skilled management, technical, marketing, research and development, and operational personnel with experience in managing large and rapidly changing companies, as well as training, motivating and supervising employees.
The market for hiring and retaining certain technical personnel, including software engineers, has become more competitive and intense in recent years.
Failure to attract and retain a sufficient number of qualified technical personnel, including software engineers, or retain our key personnel could have a material adverse effect on our operating results.
Our Operations are Subject to a Variety of Environmental Regulations and Costs that May Have a Material Adverse Effect on Our Business and Results of Operations.
We must comply with many different governmental regulations related to the use, storage, discharge and disposal of toxic, volatile or otherwise hazardous chemicals used in our operations in the U.S., Hungary, and Malaysia.
Although we believe that our activities conform to presently applicable environmental regulations, our failure to comply with present or future regulations could result in the imposition of fines, suspension of production or a cessation of operations.
Any such environmental regulations could require us to acquire costly equipment or to incur other significant expenses to comply with such regulations.
Any failure by us to control the use of or adequately restrict the discharge of hazardous substances could subject us to future liabilities.
Provisions in Our Charter Documents and Delaware Law May Delay or Prevent an Acquisition of Us.
Our certificate of incorporation and bylaws and Delaware law contain provisions that could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us without the consent of our Board of Directors.
These provisions include a classified Board of Directors, prohibition of stockholder action by written consent, prohibition of stockholders to call special meetings and the requirement that the holders of at least 80% of our shares approve any business combination not otherwise approved by two-thirds of our Board of Directors.
Delaware law also imposes some restrictions on mergers and other business combinations between us and any holder of 15% or more of our outstanding common stock.
In addition, our Board of Directors has the right to issue preferred stock without stockholder approval, which could be used to dilute the stock ownership of a potential hostile acquirer.
