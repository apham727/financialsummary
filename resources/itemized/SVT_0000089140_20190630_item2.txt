 Item 2.Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Overview 



During the six and three months ended June 30, 2019 and 2018 approximately 9% of the Company’s consolidated revenues were derived from contracts with agencies of the U.S. Government or their prime contractors and their subcontractors. The Company believes that government involvement in military operations overseas will continue to have an impact on the financial results in both the Advanced Technology and Consumer Products markets. While the Company is optimistic in relation to these potential opportunities, it recognizes that sales to the government are affected by defense budgets, the foreign policies of the U.S. and other nations, the level of military operations and other factors, and as such, it is difficult to predict the impact on future financial results. 



The Company’s commercial business is affected by such factors as uncertainties in today’s global economy, global competition, the vitality and ability of the commercial aviation industry to purchase new aircraft, the effects and threats of terrorism, market demand and acceptance both for the Company’s products and its customers’ products which incorporate Company made components. 



The ATG engages in business development efforts in its primary markets and is broadening its activities to include new domestic and foreign markets that are consistent with its core competencies. We believe our business remains particularly well positioned in the strong commercial aircraft market driven by the replacement of older aircraft with more fuel efficient alternatives and the increasing demand for air travel in emerging markets. Although the ATG backlog continues to be strong, actual scheduled shipments may be delayed/changed as a function of the Company’s customers’ final delivery determinations based on changes in the global economy and other factors. 



The CPG consumer products are marketed throughout the United States and in select foreign markets. Consumer sales are moderately seasonal. Sales are direct to consumer, through national and international distributors, and through retailers such as big box, hardware, supermarket, variety, department, discount, gift, drug, outdoors and sporting stores. The CPG also sells knives and tools, principally machetes, bayonets, survival knives and kitchen knives, to various branches of the United States Government which accounted for less than 2% of the Company’s consolidate revenues in the three and six months ended June 30, 2019 and 2018.

Gross margin increased in the six month period ended June 30, 2019 due to the increase in units shipped of approximately $740,000 at the ATG. In addition, the increase is due to average prices and mix of product sold of approximately $230,000 at the ATG and approximately $851,000 at the CPG as compared to the same period of 2018. This is partially offset by a decrease in units shipped of approximately $1,453,000 at the CPG as compared to the same period of 2018.

Gross margin increased in the three month period ended June 30, 2019 due to the increase in units shipped of approximately $473,000 at the ATG. In addition, the increase is due to average prices and mix of product sold of approximately $400,000 at the ATG and approximately $861,000 at the CPG as compared to the same period of 2018. This is partially offset by a decrease in units shipped of approximately $1,389,000 at the CPG as compared to the same period of 2018. 



Selling, General and Administrative Expenses 



Selling, general and administrative (SG&A) increased approximately $661,000 or 18.2% for the six month period ended June 30, 2019 when compared to the same period in 2018. The increase is attributable to employee and employee related wages, bonuses and benefits, primarily executive management, of approximately $305,000; sales promotions and support of approximately $176,000; professional fees of approximately $116,000; media advertising of approximately $86,000, directors’ fees of approximately $55,000 and all other expenses of approximately $8,000 partially offset by lower legal fees of approximately $85,000 as compared to the same six month period of 2018.  



Selling, general and administrative (SG&A) increased approximately $362,000 or 17.9% for the three month period ended June 30, 2019 when compared to the same period in 2018.

Interest Expense 



Interest expense increased by 9.6% and 11.1% in the six and three month periods ended June 30, 2019, respectively, when compared to the same period in 2018. This is primarily due to the higher interest rates on the bank loans and a full year of interest paid on the equipment financing lease obligations. 



Income Taxes 



The Company’s effective tax rate was approximately 17.4% and 19.0% for the six month periods ended June 30, 2019 and 2018, respectively. The Company’s effective tax rate was approximately 17.4% and 20.0% for the three month periods ended June 30, 2019 and 2018, respectively. The effective tax rate in both years reflects federal and state income taxes, permanent non-deductible expenditures, the deduction for foreign-derived intangible income and the federal tax credit for research and development expenditures. 



Net Income 



Net income for the six month period ended June 30, 2019 decreased approximately $226,000. This decrease is primarily the result of increases in revenue at both the ATG and CPG business segments offset by increases in selling, general and administrative expenses at both business segments. Net income for the three month period ended June 30, 2019 increased approximately $7,000, when compared to the same periods in 2018. This increase is primarily the result of increases in revenue at both the ATG and CPG business segments partially offset by increases in selling, general and administrative expenses at both business segments. 



Liquidity and Capital Resources 



The Company’s primary liquidity and capital expenditure requirements relate to working capital needs; primarily inventory, accounts receivable, accounts payable, capital expenditures for property, plant and equipment and principal payments on debt. At June 30, 2019, the Company had working capital of approximately $22,805,000 ($23,141,000 – 2018) of which approximately $1,849,000 ($2,598,000 – 2018) was comprised of cash. The improvement in working capital is attributable to a decrease in number of day’s accounts receivable outstanding, an increase in the number of day’s accounts payable outstanding and an improvement in inventory turns. 



The Company generated approximately $638,000 in cash from operations during the six month period ended June 30, 2019 as compared to a usage of cash of approximately $237,000 during the same period in 2018. Cash was generated primarily through net income of approximately $812,000, adjustments to reconcile net income to net cash of approximately $677,000 and timing of accounts payable of approximately $1,195,000. The primary use of cash for the Company’s operating activities for the six month period ended June 30, 2019 include working capital requirements, mainly an increase in accounts receivables and inventories of approximately $356,000 and $1,780,000, respectively. Cash generated and used in operations is consistent with sales volume, customer expectations and competitive pressures. 



The Company’s primary generation of cash in its financing and investing activities in the six month period ended June 30, 2019 included approximately $601,000 of proceeds from equipment financing. This is offset by the usage of cash due to approximately $274,000 of principal payments on long-term debt, approximately $149,000 for the purchase of treasury shares, as well as capital expenditures of approximately $1,140,000 to increase production requirements at the ATG.

The Company has an equipment loan facility in the amount of $2,500,000 available until November 30, 2019. This line is non-revolving and non-renewable. The loan term for the equipment covered by the agreement is 60 months.

There was approximately $601,000 outstanding at June 30, 2019 and no balance outstanding at December 31, 2018.
