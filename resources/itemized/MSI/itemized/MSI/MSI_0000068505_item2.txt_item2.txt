On January 3, 2019, as partial consideration for the acquisition of VaaS International Holdings ("VaaS"), a company that is a global provider of data and image analytics for vehicle location, we issued 1,802,379 shares of common stock the Company at a fair value of $198 million, inclusive of $38 million related to compensation withheld from the purchase that will be expensed over an average service period of one year, to certain of the former owners of VaaS.

On July 11, 2019 the Company issued 80,702 shares of restricted stock in connection with the acquisition of WatchGuard, Inc., a company that is a U.S. leader in mobile video solutions.
The restricted stock was issued for an aggregate grant-date fair value of $14 million that will be expensed over an average service period of two years.

The sale was completed in reliance on the exemption from registration provided by Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act.
The Company relied on such exemption from registration based in part on representations made by the investment agreement with Silver Lake Partners.
