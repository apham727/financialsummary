1. BASIS OF PRESENTATION 



The accompanying unaudited interim Consolidated Financial Statements of Accenture plc and its controlled subsidiary companies have been prepared pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) for quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and do not include all of the information and note disclosures required by U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“U.S. GAAP”) for complete financial statements. We use the terms “Accenture,” “we” and “our” in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements to refer to Accenture plc and its subsidiaries. These Consolidated Financial Statements should therefore be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes thereto for the fiscal year ended August 31, 2018 included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC on October 24, 2018. 



The accompanying unaudited interim Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP, which requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect amounts reported in the Consolidated Financial Statements and accompanying disclosures. Although these estimates are based on management’s best knowledge of current events and actions that we may undertake in the future, actual results may differ from those estimates. The Consolidated Financial Statements reflect all adjustments of a normal, recurring nature that are, in the opinion of management, necessary for a fair presentation of results for these interim periods. The results of operations for the three and six months ended February 28, 2019 are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for the fiscal year ending August 31, 2019.



On March 13, 2018, Accenture Holdings plc merged with and into Accenture plc, with Accenture plc as the surviving entity. As a result, all of the assets and liabilities of Accenture Holdings plc were acquired by Accenture plc, and Accenture Holdings plc ceased to exist. In connection with this internal merger, shareholders of Accenture Holdings plc (other than Accenture entities that held shares of Accenture Holdings plc), who primarily consisted of current and former members of Accenture Leadership and their permitted transferees, received one Class A ordinary share of Accenture plc for each share of Accenture Holdings plc that they owned, and Accenture plc redeemed all Class X ordinary shares of Accenture plc owned by such shareholders. 



Allowances for Client Receivables 



As of February 28, 2019 and August 31, 2018, total allowances recorded for client receivables were $53,616 and $49,913, respectively. 



Depreciation and Amortization 



Depreciation expense was $110,635 and $213,348 for the three and six months ended February 28, 2019, respectively, and $107,445 and $213,596 for the three and six months ended February 28, 2018, respectively. As of February 28, 2019 and August 31, 2018, total accumulated depreciation was $2,027,164 and $1,862,098, respectively. Deferred transition amortization expense was $68,209 and $137,088 for the three and six months ended February 28, 2019, respectively, and $71,288 and $153,142 for the three and six months ended February 28, 2018, respectively. See Note 6 (Goodwill and Intangible Assets) to these Consolidated Financial Statements for intangible asset amortization balances. 



Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements



Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) No. 2014-09 (“Topic 606”)



On September 1, 2018, we adopted FASB ASU No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606), which replaced most existing revenue recognition guidance. The core principle of Topic 606 is that an entity should recognize revenue for the transfer of goods or services equal to the amount that it expects to be entitled to receive for those goods or services. Topic 606 has been applied to contracts that were not completed as of September 1, 2018. Results for reporting periods beginning after September 1, 2018 are presented under Topic 606, while prior period amounts are not adjusted and continue to be reported in accordance with our historic accounting. See Note 2 (Revenues) to these Consolidated Financial Statements for further details. 



In connection with the adoption of Topic 606, we are now presenting total revenues and no longer reporting revenues before reimbursements. Prior period results have been revised to reflect this change in presentation. As a result of this change, for the three and six months ended February 28, 2018, both total revenues and cost of services

(Unaudited)



decreased by $158,594 and $328,774, respectively, for hardware/software resale previously included in reimbursements. This change had no impact on operating income. 



The impact of adopting the new standard was not material to our Consolidated Financial Statements. The primary impacts included additional disclosure about the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from client contracts, including judgments and changes in estimates. Upon adoption, we recorded a decrease to retained earnings of $6,451, net of a tax impact of $3,071, as of September 1, 2018.



The impact of adopting the new standard for the three and six months ended February 28, 2019 was an increase to revenues of approximately $6.9 million and $19.4 million, respectively. The impact on our balance sheet as of February 28, 2019 was not material with the exception of the classification of $2.2 billion of receivables and $571.8 million of contract assets, which were previously classified as Unbilled services, net. 



FASB ASU No. 2016-16 



On September 1, 2018, we adopted FASB ASU No. 2016-16, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Intra-Entity Transfers of Assets Other Than Inventory, which requires an entity to recognize the income tax consequences of intra-entity transfers, other than inventory, when the transfer occurs. Upon adoption, we recorded deferred tax assets and an increase in retained earnings of $2,144,427, and we will recognize incremental income tax expense as these deferred tax assets are utilized. Our fiscal 2019 annual effective tax rate is expected to be approximately 3.3% higher due to the adoption. The adoption had no impact on cash flows. 



The impact of adoption as of September 1, 2018 of FASB ASU No. 2014-09 (Topic 606) and No. 2016-16 (Topic 740) on our Consolidated Balance Sheets was as follows: 



[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]



FASB ASU No. 2017-07 



On September 1, 2018, we adopted FASB ASU No. 2017-07, Compensation-Retirement Benefits (Topic 715): Improving the Presentation of Net Periodic Pension Cost and Net Periodic Postretirement Benefit Cost. The new guidance amends certain presentation and disclosure requirements for employers with defined benefit pension and post-retirement medical plans. The standard requires the service cost component of the net benefit cost to be in the same line item as other compensation in operating income and the other components of net benefit cost to be presented outside of operating income on a retrospective basis. Upon adoption, we reclassified $13 million and $26 million for the three and six months ended February 28, 2018, respectively and $58 million for fiscal 2018 of operating expenses to non-operating expense to conform with the fiscal 2019 treatment of these expenses.

FASB ASU No. 2016-01 



On September 1, 2018, we adopted FASB ASU No. 2016-01, Financial Instruments-Overall (Subtopic 825-10): Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities, which amends certain aspects of recognition, measurement, presentation and disclosure of financial instruments. The standard requires investments previously accounted for under the cost method of accounting to be measured at fair value with changes in fair value recognized in net income. Investments in equity securities that do not have readily determinable fair values will be measured at cost, less any impairment, plus or minus changes resulting from observable price changes in orderly transactions. We adopted this standard using the prospective method. The adoption did not have a material impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements. 



New Accounting Pronouncement



The following standard, issued by the FASB, will result in a change in practice and will have a financial impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements:



[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]



2. REVENUES



We account for revenue in accordance with Topic 606, which we adopted on September 1, 2018 using the modified retrospective method. 



Performance Obligations 



A performance obligation is a promise in a contract to transfer a distinct good or service to the client and is the unit of accounting in Topic 606. A contract’s transaction price is allocated to each distinct performance obligation and recognized as revenue when, or as, the performance obligation is satisfied. For contracts with multiple performance obligations, we allocate the contract’s transaction price to each performance obligation based on the relative standalone selling price. The primary method used to estimate standalone selling price is the expected cost plus a margin approach, under which we forecast our expected costs of satisfying a performance obligation and then add an appropriate margin for that distinct good or service based on margins for similar services sold on a standalone basis. While determining relative standalone selling price and identifying separate performance obligations require judgment, generally relative standalone selling prices and the separate performance obligations are readily identifiable as we sell those performance obligations unaccompanied by other performance obligations. Contract modifications are routine in the performance of our contracts. Contracts are often modified to account for changes in the contract specifications, requirements or duration. If a contract modification results in the addition of performance obligations priced at a standalone selling price or if the post-modification services are distinct from the services provided prior to the modification, the modification is accounted for separately. If the modified services are not distinct, they are accounted for as part of the existing contract. 



Our revenues are derived from contracts for outsourcing services, technology integration consulting services and non-technology consulting services. These contracts have different terms based on the scope, performance obligations and complexity of the engagement, which frequently require us to make judgments and estimates in recognizing revenues. We have many types of contracts, including time-and-materials contracts, fixed-price contracts, fee-per-transaction contracts and contracts with multiple fee types.  



13

ACCENTURE PLC



NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (continued)



(In thousands of U.S. dollars, except share and per share amounts or as otherwise disclosed)



(Unaudited)



The nature of our contracts gives rise to several types of variable consideration, including incentive fees. Many contracts include incentives or penalties related to costs incurred, benefits produced or adherence to schedules that may increase the variability in revenues and margins earned on such contracts. These variable amounts generally are awarded or refunded upon achievement of or failure to achieve certain performance metrics, milestones or cost targets and can be based upon client discretion. We include these variable fees in the estimated transaction price when there is a basis to reasonably estimate the amount of the fee and it is not probable a significant reversal of revenue will occur. These estimates reflect the expected value of the variable fee and are based on an assessment of our anticipated performance, historical experience and other information available at the time.  



Our performance obligations are satisfied over time as work progresses or at a point in time. The majority of our revenues are recognized over time based on the extent of progress towards satisfying our performance obligations. The selection of the method to measure progress towards completion requires judgment and is based on the contract and the nature of the services to be provided. 



Outsourcing Contracts  



Our outsourcing contracts typically span several years. Revenues are generally recognized on outsourcing contracts over time because our clients benefit from the services as they are performed. Outsourcing contracts require us to provide a series of distinct services each period over the contract term. Revenues from unit-priced contracts are recognized as transactions are processed. When contractual billings represent an amount that corresponds directly with the value provided to the client (e.g., time-and-materials contracts), revenues are recognized as amounts become billable in accordance with contract terms. 



Technology Integration Consulting Services 



Revenues from contracts for technology integration consulting services where we design/redesign, build and implement new or enhanced systems and related processes for our clients are recognized over time as control of the system is transferred continuously to the client. Contracts for technology integration consulting services generally span six months to two years. Generally, revenue is recognized using costs incurred to date relative to total estimated costs at completion to measure progress toward satisfying our performance obligations. Revenues, including estimated fees, are recorded proportionally as costs are incurred. Incurred cost represents work performed, which corresponds with, and thereby best depicts, the transfer of control to the client. 



Non-Technology Integration Consulting Services 



Our contracts for non-technology integration consulting services are typically less than a year in duration. Revenues are generally recognized over time as our clients benefit from the services as they are performed, or the contract includes termination provisions enabling payment for performance completed to date. When contractual billings represent an amount that corresponds directly with the value provided to the client (e.g. time-and-materials contracts), revenues are recognized as amounts become billable in accordance with contract terms. Revenues from fixed-price contracts are generally recognized using costs incurred to date relative to total estimated costs at completion to measure progress toward satisfying our performance obligations. Incurred cost represents work performed, which corresponds with, and thereby best depicts, the transfer of control to the client. For non-technology integration consulting contracts which do not qualify to recognize revenue over time, we recognize revenues at a point in time when we satisfy our performance obligations and the client obtains control of the promised good or service. 



Remaining Performance Obligations 



On February 28, 2019, we had approximately $19 billion of remaining performance obligations. Our remaining performance obligations represent the amount of transaction price for which work has not been performed and revenue has not been recognized. The majority of our contracts are terminable by the client on short notice with little or no termination penalties, and some without notice. Under Topic 606, only the non-cancelable portion of these contracts is included in our performance obligations. Additionally, our performance obligations only include variable consideration if we assess it is probable that a significant reversal of cumulative revenue recognized will not occur when the uncertainty is resolved. Based on the terms of our contracts, a significant portion of what we consider contract bookings is not included in our remaining performance obligations. We expect to recognize approximately 57% of our remaining performance obligations as revenue in fiscal 2019, an additional 24% in fiscal 2020, and the balance thereafter. 



See Note 11 (Segment Reporting) to these Consolidated Financial Statements for our disaggregated revenues.

(Unaudited)



Contract Estimates 



Estimates of total contract revenues and costs are continuously monitored over the life of our contracts, and recorded revenues and cost estimates are subject to revision as the contract progresses. If at any time the estimate of contract profitability indicates an anticipated loss on a technology integration consulting contract, we recognize the loss in the quarter it first becomes probable and reasonably estimable.  



Adjustments in contract estimates related to performance obligations satisfied or partially satisfied in prior periods increased our revenues by approximately $37 million and $38 million for the three and six months ended February 28, 2019, respectively. No adjustment on any one contract was material to our Consolidated Financial Statements for the three and six months ended February 28, 2019. 



Contract Balances 



The timing of revenue recognition, billings and cash collections results in Receivables, Contract assets, and Deferred revenues (Contract liabilities) on our Consolidated Balance Sheet. Amounts are billed as work progresses in accordance with agreed-upon contractual terms, either at periodic intervals (e.g., monthly or quarterly) or upon achievement of contractual milestones. Our receivables are rights to consideration that are conditional only upon the passage of time as compared to our contract assets, which are rights to consideration conditional upon additional factors. When we bill or receive payments from our clients before revenue is recognized, we record Contract liabilities. Contract assets and liabilities are reported on our Consolidated Balance Sheet on a contract-by-contract basis at the end of each reporting period. 



For some outsourcing contracts, we receive payments for transition or set-up activities, which are deferred and recognized as revenue as the services are provided. These advance payments are typically not a significant financing component because they are used to meet working capital demands in the early stages of a contract and to protect us from the other party failing to complete its obligations under the contract. Deferred transition revenues were $587,356 and $581,395 as of February 28, 2019 and August 31, 2018, respectively, and are included in Non-current deferred revenues. Costs related to these activities are also deferred and are expensed as the services are provided. Generally, deferred amounts are protected in the event of early termination of the contract and are monitored regularly for impairment. Impairment losses are recorded when projected remaining undiscounted operating cash flows of the related contract are not sufficient to recover the carrying amount of contract assets. Deferred transition costs were $702,404 and $690,868 as of February 28, 2019 and August 31, 2018, respectively, and are included in Deferred contract costs. 



The following table provides information about the balances of our Receivables, Contract assets and Contract liabilities (Deferred revenues):



[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]



Changes in the contract asset and liability balances during the six months ended February 28, 2019, were a result of normal business activity and not materially impacted by any other factors. 



Revenues recognized during the three and six months ended February 28, 2019 that were included in Deferred revenues as of November 30, 2018 and September 1, 2018 were $1.5 billion and $2.4 billion, respectively.

Dividends 



Our dividend activity during the six months ended February 28, 2019 was as follows: 



[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]



The payment of the cash dividends also resulted in the issuance of an immaterial number of additional restricted share units to holders of restricted share units.



Subsequent Event 



On March 26, 2019, the Board of Directors of Accenture plc declared a semi-annual cash dividend of $1.46 per share on its Class A ordinary shares for shareholders of record at the close of business on April 11, 2019 payable on May 15, 2019. The payment of the cash dividend will result in the issuance of an immaterial number of additional restricted share units to holders of restricted share units.



8. FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS 



Derivatives 



In the normal course of business, we use derivative financial instruments to manage foreign currency exchange rate risk. Our derivative financial instruments consist of deliverable and non-deliverable foreign currency forward contracts. 



Cash Flow Hedges 



For a cash flow hedge, the effective portion of the change in estimated fair value of a hedging instrument is recorded in Accumulated other comprehensive loss as a separate component of Shareholders’ Equity and is reclassified into Cost of services in the Consolidated Income Statements during the period in which the hedged transaction is recognized. For information related to derivatives designated as cash flow hedges that were reclassified into Cost of services during the three and six months ended February 28, 2019 and 2018, as well as those expected to be reclassified into Cost of services in the next 12 months, see Note 4 (Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss) to these Consolidated Financial Statements. 



Other Derivatives 



Realized gains or losses and changes in the estimated fair value of foreign currency forward contracts that have not been designated as hedges were net losses of $28,945 and $77,928 for the three and six months ended February 28, 2019, respectively, and net gains of $56,316 and $46,783 for the three and six months ended February 28, 2018, respectively. Gains and losses on these contracts are recorded in Other income (expense), net in the Consolidated Income Statements and are offset by gains and losses on the related hedged items.

Fair Value of Derivative Instruments 



The notional and fair values of all derivative instruments were as follows: 



[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]



We utilize standard counterparty master agreements containing provisions for the netting of certain foreign currency transaction obligations and for the set-off of certain obligations in the event of an insolvency of one of the parties to the transaction. In the Consolidated Balance Sheets, we record derivative assets and liabilities at gross fair value. The potential effect of netting derivative assets against liabilities under the counterparty master agreements was as follows: 



[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]



Equity Securities Without Readily Determinable Fair Values 



We hold investments in equity securities that do not have readily determinable fair values. We record these investments at cost and remeasure them to fair value based on certain observable price changes or impairment events as they occur. The carrying amount of these investments was $117,728 as of February 28, 2019. Prior to the adoption of FASB ASU No. 2016-01, these investments were accounted for under the cost method. For additional information, see Note 1 (Basis of Presentation) to these Consolidated Financial Statements.

9. INCOME TAXES 



On December 22, 2017, the United States enacted the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the “Tax Act”), which significantly changed U.S. tax law. The Tax Act lowered the U.S. statutory federal income tax rate from 35% to 21%, effective January 1, 2018, resulting in a blended U.S. statutory federal income tax rate of 25.7% for our fiscal year ended August 31, 2018. In the three months ended February 28, 2018, we recognized tax expense of $136,742, primarily to remeasure our net deferred tax assets at the new, lower rates. In the three months ended May 31, 2018, we recorded additional tax expense of $40,927 resulting from our continued analysis of the Tax Act. Our analysis and accounting for the Tax Act is complete. 



We apply an estimated annual effective tax rate to our year-to-date operating results to determine the interim provision for income tax expense. In addition, we recognize taxes related to unusual or infrequent items or resulting from a change in judgment regarding a position taken in a prior year as discrete items in the interim period in which the event occurs. 



Our effective tax rates for the three months ended February 28, 2019 and February 28, 2018 were 17.1% and 26.1%, respectively. Our effective tax rates for the six months ended February 28, 2019 and 2018 were 18.6% and 23.0%, respectively. Excluding tax expense associated with the enactment of the Tax Act, the effective tax rates would have been 15.1% and 18.0% for the three and six months ended February 28, 2018, respectively. The effective tax rate for the three months ended February 28, 2019 was higher primarily due to lower tax benefits from share-based payments and higher expense from the adoption of FASB ASU No. 2016-16, partially offset by a decrease in prior year tax liabilities. The effective tax rate for the six months ended February 28, 2019 was higher primarily due to lower tax benefits from share-based payments and higher expense from the adoption of FASB ASU No. 2016-16, partially offset by higher final determinations of prior year taxes. For additional information, see Note 1 (Basis of Presentation) to these Consolidated Financial Statements. 



10. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES 



Commitments 



We have either the right to purchase at fair value or, if certain events occur, may be required to purchase at fair value outstanding shares of our SinnerSchrader AG subsidiary. As of February 28, 2019 and August 31, 2018, we have reflected the fair value of approximately $43,000 and $47,000, respectively, related to redeemable common stock of the subsidiary in Other accrued liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. 



Indemnifications and Guarantees 



In the normal course of business and in conjunction with certain client engagements, we have entered into contractual arrangements through which we may be obligated to indemnify clients with respect to certain matters. 



As of February 28, 2019 and August 31, 2018, our aggregate potential liability to our clients for expressly limited guarantees involving the performance of third parties was approximately $685,000 and $782,000, respectively, of which all but approximately $141,000 and $130,000, respectively, may be recovered from the other third parties if we are obligated to make payments to the indemnified parties as a consequence of a performance default by the other third parties. For arrangements with unspecified limitations, we cannot reasonably estimate the aggregate maximum potential liability, as it is inherently difficult to predict the maximum potential amount of such payments, due to the conditional nature and unique facts of each particular arrangement. 



To date, we have not been required to make any significant payment under any of the arrangements described above. We have assessed the current status of performance/payment risk related to arrangements with limited guarantees, warranty obligations, unspecified limitations and/or indemnification provisions and believe that any potential payments would be immaterial to the Consolidated Financial Statements, as a whole. 



Legal Contingencies 



As of February 28, 2019, we or our present personnel had been named as a defendant in various litigation matters. We and/or our personnel also from time to time are involved in investigations by various regulatory or legal authorities concerning matters arising in the course of our business around the world. Based on the present status of these matters, management believes the range of reasonably possible losses in addition to amounts accrued, net of insurance recoveries, will not have a material effect on our results of operations or financial condition.
