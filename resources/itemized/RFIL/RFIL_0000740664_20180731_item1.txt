NOTES TO UNAUDITED CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 

Note 1 - Unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial statements 

The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements of RF Industries, Ltd. and its divisions and three wholly-owned subsidiaries (collectively, hereinafter the “Company”) have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America for interim financial information and with the instructions to Form 10-Q.
Accordingly, they do not include all of the information and footnotes required by accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America for complete financial statements.
In the opinion of management, all adjustments, which are normal and recurring, have been included in order to make the information not misleading.
Information included in the consolidated balance sheet as of October 31, 2017 has been derived from, and certain terms used herein are defined in, the audited consolidated financial statements of the Company as of October 31, 2017 included in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K (“Form 10-K”) for the year ended October 31, 2017 that was previously filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”).
Operating results for the three- and nine-months ended July 31, 2018 are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for the year ending October 31, 2018.
The unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and footnotes thereto included in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended October 31, 2017.
Principles of consolidation 

The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements include the accounts of RF Industries, Ltd., Cables Unlimited, Inc. (“Cables Unlimited”), Comnet Telecom Supply, Inc. (“Comnet”), and Rel-Tech Electronics, Inc. (“Rel-Tech”), wholly-owned subsidiaries of RF Industries, Ltd. All intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.
Revenue recognition 


Recent accounting standards 


In February 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) No.
2016-02, Leases.
This ASU requires lessees to recognize most leases on their balance sheets related to the rights and obligations created by those leases.
The ASU also requires additional qualitative and quantitative disclosures related to the nature, timing and uncertainty of cash flows arising from leases.
The guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, and interim periods within those fiscal years.
Early adoption is permitted.
The Company is currently evaluating the impact the adoption of this new standard will have on its Consolidated Financial Statements.
In January 2017, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No.
2017-04, Intangibles-Goodwill and Other, which simplifies the accounting for goodwill impairments by eliminating step 2 from the goodwill impairment test.
Instead, if “the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, an impairment loss shall be recognized in an amount equal to that excess, limited to the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit.” The guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019.
Early adoption is permitted.
The Company is currently evaluating the impact the adoption of this new standard will have on its Consolidated Financial Statements.
In March 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No.
2016-09, Compensation – Stock Compensation.
The new standard modified several aspects of the accounting and reporting for employee share-based payments and related tax accounting impacts, including the presentation in the statements of operations and cash flows of certain tax benefits or deficiencies and employee tax withholdings, as well as the accounting for award forfeitures over the vesting period.
One provision within this pronouncement requires that excess income tax benefits and tax deficiencies related to share-based payments be recognized within income tax expense in the statement of income, rather than within additional paid-in capital on the balance sheet.
The Company adopted this provision in the first quarter of fiscal 2018.
The adoption of this provision was applied prospectively.
The impact to the Company's results of operations related to this provision for the nine month period ended July 31, 2018 was the recognition of an income tax benefit of $163,000 within income tax expense, resulting in a 2.4% reduction to the effective tax rate versus if the standard had not been adopted.
The impact of this provision on the Company's future results of operations will depend in part on the market prices for the Company's shares on the dates there are taxable events related to share awards.
In connection with another provision within this pronouncement, the Company has elected to account for forfeitures as they occur rather than estimate expected forfeitures, with the change being applied prospectively.
The adoption of this and other provisions within the pronouncement did not have a material impact on the Company’s consolidated financial statements.
Note 2 - Discontinued operations  

For the three and nine months ended July 31, 2018, the Company did not recognize any royalty income.
For the three and nine months ended July 31, 2017, the Company recognized approximately $34,000 and $162,000 of royalty income, respectively, for RadioMobile, which amounts of which have been included within discontinued operations.
During March 2016, the Company announced the shutdown of its Bioconnect division, which comprised the entire operations of the Medical Cabling and Interconnect segment.
The closure is part of the Company’s ongoing plan to close or dispose of underperforming divisions that are not part of the Company’s core operations.
For the three and nine months ended July 31, 2017, the Company recognized approximately $0 and $10,000 of income from sale of equipment for the Bioconnect division, respectively, which amounts have been included within discontinued operations.
Note 3 - Inventories and major vendors 



One vendor accounted for 46% of inventory purchases for the three months ended July 31, 2018.
This same vendor accounted for 41% of inventory purchases for the nine months ended July 31, 2018.
One vendor accounted for 11% of inventory purchases for the three months ended July 31, 2017.
No vendor accounted for greater than 10% of inventory purchases for the nine months ended July 31, 2017.
The Company has arrangements with these vendors to purchase products based on purchase orders periodically issued by the Company.
Note 4 - Other current assets 



Long-term portion of notes receivable of $0 and $21,000 is recorded in other assets at July 31, 2018 and October 31, 2017, respectively.
Note 5 - Accrued expenses and other long-term liabilities 



Accrued receipts represent purchased inventory for which invoices have not been received.
Level 1 - Quoted prices for identical instruments in active markets; 

Level 2 - Quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not active, and model-derived valuations in which all significant inputs and significant value drivers are observable in active markets; and 

Level 3 - Valuations derived from valuation techniques in which one or more significant inputs or significant value drivers are unobservable.
The contingent consideration liability represents future earn-out liability that we may be required to pay in conjunction with the acquisition of Rel-Tech and Comnet.
The Company estimates the fair value of the earn-out liability using a probability-weighted scenario of estimated qualifying earn-out gross profit related to Rel-Tech and EBITDA related to Comnet calculated at net present value (level 3 of the fair value hierarchy).
In August 2018, the earn-out liability to Rel-Tech of $210,000 was paid.
Note 6 - Earnings per share 

Basic earnings per share is computed by dividing net income by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period.
Diluted earnings per share is computed by dividing net income by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding increased by the effects of assuming that other potentially dilutive securities (such as stock options) outstanding during the period had been exercised and the treasury stock method had been applied.
Potentially dilutive securities totaling 0 and 812,244 for the three months ended July 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively, and 245,328 and 1,104,837 for the nine months ended July 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively, were excluded from the calculation of diluted per share amounts because of their anti-dilutive effect.
Note 7 - Stock-based compensation and equity transactions 

The Company’s current stock incentive plan provides for the granting of qualified and nonqualified options to the Company’s officers, directors and employees.
The Company satisfies the exercise of options by issuing previously unissued common shares.
On July 17, 2017, the Company granted 100,000 incentive stock options to its newly hired President and Chief Executive Officer.
These options, which expire in ten years from the date of grant, vested as to 10,000 shares on the date of grant, and the balance thereafter vests as to 10,000 shares per annum over the remaining nine years of the grant.
On December 13, 2017, the Company granted 80,000 incentive stock options to an employee.
These options vested 8,000 shares on the date of grant, and the balance vests as to 8,000 shares per year thereafter on each of the next nine anniversaries of December 13, 2017, and expire ten years from date of grant.
No other options were granted to Company employees during the three and nine months ended July 31, 2018 and 2017.
Expected volatilities are based on historical volatility of the Company’s stock price and other factors.
The Company used the historical method to calculate the expected life of the 2018 and 2017 option grants.
The expected life represents the period of time that options granted are expected to be outstanding.
The risk-free rate is based on the U.S. Treasury rate with a maturity date corresponding to the options’ expected life.
The dividend yield is based upon the historical dividend yield.
Company stock option plans 









As of July 31, 2018, $305,000 of expense with respect to nonvested share-based arrangements has yet to be recognized but is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of 6.02 years.
Non-employee directors receive $50,000 annually, which is paid one-half in cash and one-half through the grant of non-qualified stock options to purchase shares of the Company’s common stock.
During the quarter ended January 31, 2018, the Company granted each of its five non-employee directors 37,927 non-qualified stock options.
The number of stock options granted to each director was determined by dividing $25,000 by the fair value of a stock option grant using the Black-Scholes model ($0.659 per share).
These options vest ratably over fiscal year 2018 and expires five year from the date of grant.
During the quarter ended July 31, 2018, the Company did not grant any options.
Stock option expense 

During the nine months ended July 31, 2018 and 2017, stock-based compensation expense totaled $189,000 and $161,000, respectively.
During the three months ended July 31, 2018 and 2017, stock-based compensation expense totaled $57,000 and $62,000, respectively.
For the nine months ended July 31, 2018 and 2017, stock-based compensation classified in cost of sales amounted to $0 and $9,000, respectively, and stock-based compensation classified in selling and general expense amounted to $189,000 and $152,000, respectively.
Note 8 - Concentrations of credit risk 

Financial instruments that potentially subject the Company to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of cash and cash equivalents and accounts receivable.
The Company maintains its cash and cash equivalents with high-credit quality financial institutions.
At July 31, 2018, the Company had cash and cash equivalent balances in excess of federally insured limits in the amount of approximately $10.5 million.
One customer who is a distributor, accounted for approximately 56% of the Company’s net sales for the nine-month period ended July 31, 2018.
This same customer accounted for approximately 51% of the Company’s net sales for the three-month period ended July 31, 2018.
At July 31, 2018, this customer’s accounts receivable balance accounted for approximately 53% of the total net accounts receivable balance.
For the nine-month period ended July 31, 2017, two customers, a distributor and data center solutions provider accounted for approximately 18% and 13% of the Company’s net sales, respectively.
These same two customers accounted for approximately 22% and 11% of the Company’s net sales, respectively, for the three months ended July 31, 2017.
At July 31, 2017, these customers’ accounts receivable balances accounted for approximately 26% and 10% of the Company’s total net accounts receivable balance, respectively.
Although these customers have been on-going major customers of the Company, the written agreements with these customers do not have any minimum purchase obligations and they could stop buying the Company’s products at any time and for any reason.
A reduction, delay or cancellation of orders from these customers or the loss of these customers could significantly reduce the Company’s future revenues and profits.
Note 9 - Segment information 


The RF Connector and Cable Assembly segment consisted of one division and the Custom Cabling Manufacturing and Assembly segment was composed of three divisions.
The four divisions that met the quantitative thresholds for segment reporting are Connector and Cable Assembly, Cables Unlimited, Comnet and Rel-Tech.
The specific customers are different for each division; however, there is some overlapping of product sales to them.
The methods used to distribute products are similar within each division aggregated.
Management identifies the Company’s segments based on strategic business units that are, in turn, based along market lines.
These strategic business units offer products and services to different markets in accordance with their customer base and product usage.
For segment reporting purposes, the Connector and Cable Assembly division constitutes the RF Connector and Cable Assembly segment, and the Cables Unlimited, Comnet and Rel-Tech divisions constitute the Custom Cabling Manufacturing and Assembly segment.
As reviewed by the Company’s chief operating decision maker, the Company evaluates the performance of each segment based on income or loss before income taxes.
The Company charges depreciation and amortization directly to each division within the segment.
Accounts receivable, inventory, property and equipment, goodwill and intangible assets are the only assets identified by segment.
Except as discussed above, the accounting policies for segment reporting are the same for the Company as a whole.
Note 10 - Income taxes 

On December 22, 2017, the U.S. President signed the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the “Tax Act”).
The Tax Act, among other things, lowered the U.S. corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21% effective January 1, 2018.
Consequently, we adjusted our net deferred tax liability as of October 31, 2017 by $41,000 to reflect the estimated impact of the Tax Act.
While we have substantially completed our provisional analysis of the income tax effects of the Tax Act and recorded a reasonable estimate of such effects, the net one-time charge related to the Tax Act may differ, possibly materially, due to, among other things, further refinement of our calculations, changes in interpretations and assumptions that we have made, additional guidance that may be issued by the U.S. Government, and actions and related accounting policy decisions we may take as a result of the Tax Act.
We will complete our analysis over a one-year measurement period ending December 22, 2018, and any adjustments during this measurement period will be included in net earnings from continuing operations as an adjustment to income tax expense in the reporting period when such adjustments are determined.
The Company uses an estimated annual effective tax rate, which is based on expected annual income, statutory tax rates and tax planning opportunities available in the various jurisdictions in which the Company operates, to determine its quarterly provision (benefit) for income taxes.
Certain significant or unusual items are separately recognized in the quarter in which they occur and can be a source of variability in the effective tax rates from quarter to quarter.
The Company had no unrecognized tax benefits as of July 31, 2018 and October 31, 2017.
The total balance of accrued interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions was $0 as of July 31, 2018 and October 31, 2017.
The Company recognizes interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions, if any, as a component of income tax expense and the accrued interest and penalties, if any, are included in deferred and other long-term liabilities in the Company's condensed consolidated balance sheets.
There were no material interest or penalties included in income tax expense for the nine months ended July 31, 2018 or 2017.
Note 11 - Intangible assets 



Amortization expense for the nine-months ended July 31, 2018 and the year ended October 31, 2017 was $415,000 and $589,000, respectively.
The weighted-average amortization period for the amortizable intangible assets is 9.48 years.
Note 12 - Commitments 

The Company currently leases its corporate headquarters and RF connector and cable assembly manufacturing facilities in San Diego, California.
On June 5, 2017, the Company entered into a fifth amendment to its lease for its facility in San Diego, California.
As a result, the Company now leases a total of approximately 21,908 square feet of office, warehouse and manufacturing space at its San Diego location.
The term of the lease expires on July 31, 2022, and the rental payments under the lease currently are $22,721 per month.
The San Diego lease also requires the payment of the Company’s pro rata share of real estate taxes and insurance, maintenance and other operating expenses related to the facilities.
Comnet’s current monthly rent expense under the leases is $8,542 per month for these facilities.
The amended lease expires in September 2022.
Rel-Tech’s current net monthly rent expense under the lease is $8,707 per month for these facilities.
The new lease expires in August 2019.
The aggregate monthly rental for all of the Company’s facilities currently is approximately $53,000 per month, plus utilities, maintenance and insurance.
Note 13 - Cash dividend and declared dividends 

The Company paid dividends of $0.02 per share during the three months ended July 31, 2018 and 2017 for a total of $185,000 and $177,000, respectively.
The Company paid dividends of $0.06 per share during the nine months ended July 31, 2018 and 2017 for a total of $544,000 and $530,000, respectively.
Note 14 - Subsequent events 

On September 5, 2018, the Board of Directors of the Company declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.02 per share to be paid on October 15, 2018 to stockholders of record on September 30, 2018.
Item 1A.
Risk Factors 

The discussion of our business and operations should be read together with the risk factors contained in Item 1A of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended October 31, 2017 filed with the SEC, which describe various risks and uncertainties to which we are or may become subject.
These risks and uncertainties have the potential to affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, strategies or prospects in a material and adverse manner.
