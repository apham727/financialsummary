Forward-Looking Statements
This report contains a number of forward-looking statements relative to our future plans and our expectations concerning our business and the industries we serve.
These forward-looking statements are based on assumptions about a number of important factors, and involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from estimates contained in the forward-looking statements.
Some of the risks that are foreseen by management are outlined within Part II Item 1A.
Risk Factors of this report and in Part I Item 1A.
Risk Factors of our 2017 10-K.
Readers are strongly encouraged to review those sections closely in conjunction with MD&A.
As we have not completed the valuation analysis and calculations necessary to finalize the required purchase price allocations, which may include allocations to goodwill and other intangible assets such as trademarks and trade names, developed technology, noncompetition agreements, and customer-related assets, the expected impact of the Forte acquisition is based on estimates for the amortization of acquired intangible assets.
Because of the inherent uncertainties in making such estimates, the actual impact of Forte on our financial performance for 2018 and beyond may vary from our current expectations as we work through our integration efforts and complete the Forte purchase accounting.
We undertake no duty to update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events, or otherwise.
