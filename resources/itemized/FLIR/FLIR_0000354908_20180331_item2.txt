Consolidated Operating Results
The following discussion of operating results provides an overview of our operations by addressing key elements in our Consolidated Statements of Income.
The “Segment Operating Results” section that follows describes the contributions of each of our business segments to our consolidated revenue and earnings from operations.
Given the nature of our business, we believe revenue and earnings from operations (including operating margin percentage) are most relevant to an understanding of our performance at a segment level.
Additionally, at the segment level we disclose backlog, which represents orders received for products or services for which a sales agreement is in place and delivery is expected within twelve months.
Backlog is not an absolute indicator of future revenue because a portion of the orders in backlog could be canceled at the customer's discretion.
While the backlog is subject to order cancellations, we have not historically experienced a significant number of order cancellations.
The timing of orders, scheduling of backlog, and fluctuations in demand in various regions of the world can give rise to quarter to quarter and year over year fluctuations in the mix of revenue.
Consequently, year over year comparisons for any given quarter may not be indicative of comparisons using longer time periods.
Excluding the divestiture of the Consumer and SMB Security business, we currently expect total annual revenue for 2018 to be higher than 2017 revenue, however, unexpected changes in economic conditions from key customer markets or other major unanticipated events may cause total revenue, and the mix of revenue between our segments, to vary from quarter to quarter during the year.
International sales accounted for 48.7 percent and 45.5 percent of total revenue for the quarters ended March 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively.
The proportion of our international revenue compared to total revenue will fluctuate from quarter to quarter due to normal variation in order activity across various regions as well as specific factors that may affect one region and not another.
Overall, we anticipate that revenue from international sales will continue to comprise a significant percentage of total revenue.
Cost of goods sold.
Cost of goods sold for the three months ended March 31, 2018 were $221.7 million, compared to cost of goods sold for the three months ended March 31, 2017 of $215.5 million.
The year over year increase in cost of goods sold is primarily related to higher revenues in 2018.
Gross profit.
Gross profit for the quarter ended March 31, 2018, was $217.9 million compared to $191.3 million for the same quarter last year.
Gross margin, defined as gross profit divided by revenue, increased from 47.0 percent in the first quarter of 2017 to 49.6 percent in the first quarter of 2018.
The increase in gross margin for the three month period was primarily due to favorable product mix.
Research and development expenses.
Research and development expenses for the first quarter of 2018 totaled $44.6 million, compared to $42.0 million in the first quarter of 2017.
Research and development expenses as a percentage of revenue were 10.1 percent for the three months ended March 31, 2018 and 10.3 percent for the three months ended March 31, 2017.
We have, and will continue to have, fluctuations in quarterly spending depending on product development needs and overall business spending priorities and believe that annual spending levels are most indicative of our commitment to research and development.
Over the past five annual periods through December 31, 2017, our annual research and development expenses have varied between 8.5 percent and 9.9 percent of revenue, and we currently expect these expenses to remain within that range, on an annual basis, for the foreseeable future.
Selling, general, and administrative expenses.
Selling, general, and administrative expenses were $107.7 million and $90.3 million for the quarters ended March 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively.
The increase in selling, general, and administrative expenses in the first quarter of 2018 is primarily attributed to a $15.0 million accrual recorded in the period for the anticipated costs of a regulatory settlement described further in Note 16, "Contingencies" to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8.
Selling, general, and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue were 24.5 percent and 22.2 percent for the quarters ended March 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively.
Over the past five annual periods through December 31, 2017, our annual selling, general and administrative expenses have varied between 19.4 percent and 21.7 percent of revenue, and excluding the impact of the $15.0 million accrual described above, we currently expect these expenses to remain within that range, on an annual basis, for the foreseeable future.
Loss on sale of business.
During the first quarter of 2018, we recorded an additional pre-tax loss on the sale of our Consumer and SMB Security businesses of $10.2 million.
See Note 19, "Business Acquisitions and Divestitures," to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 for additional information.
Interest expense.
Interest expense for the three months ended March 31, 2018, was $4.1 million, compared to $4.5 million for the same period of 2017.
Interest expense in 2018 was primarily associated with the $425 million aggregate principal amount of our 3.125 percent senior unsecured notes.
Interest expense for the same period in 2017 was primarily associated with the $425 million aggregate principal amount of our 3.125 percent senior unsecured notes and amounts drawn under our credit facility.
There were no drawings on our credit facility for the 2018 period.
Income taxes.
Our income tax provision of $15.4 million for the three month period ended March 31, 2018, represents an effective tax rate of 28.2 percent.
Our income tax provision for the three month period ended March 31, 2017 was $13.0 million, which represented an effective tax rate of 23.4 percent.
The effective tax rate for the three months ended March 31, 2018 is higher than the United States Federal tax rate of 21 percent mainly due to state taxes, higher tax rates applied to income earned in foreign jurisdictions, accruals for non-deductible penalties, and other discrete items, offset by the effect of federal, foreign and state tax credits and excess tax benefits from stock compensation.
In 2016, we recorded discrete tax charges totaling $39.6 million related to the January 11, 2016, announcement from the European Commission of a decision concluding that certain rules under Belgian tax legislation were deemed to be incompatible with European Union regulations on state aid.
As a result of this decision, the European Commission directed the Belgian Government to recover past taxes from certain entities, reflective of disallowed state aid, which impacts one of our international subsidiaries.
The Belgian Government announced they have appealed this decision and filed action for an annulment in the General Court of the European Union, and in July 2016 we filed a separate appeal with the General Court of the European Union.
In accordance with FASB ASC Topic 740, “Income Taxes,” we recorded discrete tax expense of $39.6 million during 2016, related to this matter and on January 10, 2017, received tax assessments from the Belgium government for a similar amount, which we have classified as current taxes payable on the Consolidated Balance Sheet as of March 31, 2018.
We have filed a complaint against the Belgian tax assessments, and the result of this complaint, the appeal with the General Court of the European Union, new
information received from the Belgian Government, or other future events may cause the income tax provision associated with the decision to be entirely or partially reversed.
At March 31, 2018, we held the euro equivalent of $37.6 million in a restricted cash account.
Those amounts, or portions thereof, could become unrestricted depending on the outcome of this matter.
Segment Operating Results
Industrial
Industrial business unit revenue for the quarter ended March 31, 2018, increased by 10.3 percent compared to the same period of 2017.
The increase in revenue for the three-month period was predominately attributable to strength in the Instruments handheld market, UAS, and sales to OEMs.
The increase in earnings from operations for the three months ended March 31, 2018, compared to the same periods of 2017, was primarily due to the higher revenue.
Government and Defense
Government and Defense business unit revenue for the quarter ended March 31, 2018, increased by 15.3 percent compared to the same period of 2017.
The increase in revenue for the quarter ended March 31, 2018, compared to the same period of 2017 was driven by increase in sales in airborne gimbals and higher HRC demand in the Middle East.
The increase in earnings from operations for the three-month period ended March 31, 2018, compared to the same periods in 2017, was primarily due to higher revenues and favorable product mix.
The decrease in backlog is due to timing of major bookings and shipments.
Commercial
Commercial business unit revenue for the quarter ended March 31, 2018, decreased by 3.7 percent compared to the same period of 2017.
The decrease in revenue for the three-month period ended March 31, 2018 was predominately due to the divestitures of our Consumer and SMB Security businesses during the period ended March 31, 2018, partially offset by higher marine electronics sales.
The increase in earnings from operations for the three months ended March 31, 2018, compared to the same periods of 2017, was due to favorable product mix, led by marine electronics.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
At March 31, 2018, we had a total of $452.1 million in cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash, $137.4 million of which resided in the United States and $314.7 million at our foreign subsidiaries, compared to cash and cash equivalents at December 31, 2017, of $519.1 million, of which $228.9 million resided in the United States and $290.2 million at our foreign subsidiaries.
At March 31, 2018, the restricted cash balance was $37.6 million and we had no amounts designated as restricted cash at December 31, 2017.
The decrease in cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash during the three months ended March 31, 2018, was primarily due to share repurchases of $95.0 million, dividend payments of $22.2 million, a business acquisition of $7.1 million, minority interest investments of $9.5 million and capital expenditures of $7.1 million, partially offset by cash provided from operations of $43.2 million, cash received from the sale of our Consumer and SMB Security businesses of $25.9 million and proceeds of $3.5 million from shares issued under our stock compensation plans.
Cash provided by operating activities during the three months ended March 31, 2018, totaled $43.2 million, which primarily consisted of net earnings, adjusted for depreciation and amortization, stock-based compensation, other non-cash items and changes in working capital.
Cash generated by investing activities for the three months ended March 31, 2018, totaled $2.3 million, which consisted of $25.9 million from the sale of our Consumer and SMB Security businesses, partially offset by a business acquisition and minority interest investments and capital expenditures in the ordinary course of business.
Cash used by financing activities for the three months ended March 31, 2018, totaled $114.0 million, which primarily consisted of cash used for the repurchase of shares of our common stock and the payment of quarterly dividends.
On February 8, 2011, we entered into a Credit Agreement (“Credit Agreement”) with Bank of America, N.A., U.S. Bank National Association, JPMorgan Chase Bank N.A.
and other Lenders.
The Credit Agreement provides for a $200 million, five-year revolving line of credit.
On April 5, 2013, the Credit Agreement was amended to extend the maturity of the revolving credit facility from April 8, 2016 to April 5, 2018, in addition to incorporating a $150 million term loan facility maturing April 5, 2019.
On May 31, 2016, the Credit Agreement was further amended to increase the borrowing capacity to $500 million and to extend the maturity of the revolving credit facility from April 5, 2018 to May 31, 2021.
The amendment also incorporated a revised schedule of fees and interest rate spreads.
We have the right, subject to certain conditions, including approval of additional commitments by qualified lenders, to increase the revolving line of credit under the Credit Agreement by an additional $200 million until May 31, 2021.
The Credit Agreement allows us and certain designated subsidiaries to borrow in United States dollars, European euros, Swedish kronor, British pound sterling, Japanese yen, Canadian dollars, Australian dollars, and other agreed upon currencies.
Interest rates under the Credit Agreement are determined based on the type of borrowing.
Interest associated with borrowings can be based on either the prime lending rate of Bank of America, N.A.
or the published Eurocurrency rate (i.e.
LIBOR).
The borrowings have an applicable margin that ranges from 0.125 percent to 2.125 percent depending on the applicable base rate and our consolidated total leverage ratio.
Including the respective spreads, the one-month Eurocurrency-based borrowing rate was 3.252 percent per
annum and the prime lending-based borrowing rate was 5.125 percent per annum at March 31, 2018.
The Credit Agreement requires us to pay a commitment fee on the amount of unused revolving commitments at a rate, based on our total leverage ratio, which ranges from 0.150 percent to 0.300 percent of unused revolving commitments.
At March 31, 2018, the commitment fee on the amount of unused revolving credit was 0.175 percent per annum.
The Credit Agreement contains two financial covenants that require the maintenance of a total leverage ratio and an interest coverage ratio, with which the Company was in compliance at March 31, 2018.
The credit facilities available under the Credit Agreement are unsecured.
We had $14.9 million of letters of credit outstanding under the Credit Agreement at March 31, 2018, which reduced the total available revolving credit under the Credit Agreement.
In June 2016, we issued $425 million aggregate principal amount of our 3.125 percent senior unsecured notes due June 15, 2021 (the “Notes”).
The net proceeds from the issuance of the Notes were approximately $421.0 million, after deducting underwriting discounts and offering expenses, which are being amortized over a period of five years.
Interest on the Notes is payable semiannually in arrears on December 15 and June 15.
The proceeds from the Notes were used to repay our 3.75 percent senior unsecured notes that were due September 1, 2016, and are being used for general corporate purposes, which include working capital and capital expenditure needs, business acquisitions, and repurchases of our common stock.
On February 8, 2017, our Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to 15.0 million shares of our outstanding common stock.
This authorization will expire on February 8, 2019.
During the three months ended March 31, 2018, we entered into an accelerated share repurchase program at a notional amount of $50.0 million under which we received 0.8 million shares in March 2018 and will be settled on June 4, 2018.
The repurchases were under the February 2017 authorization.
As of March 31, 2018, a total of 1.7 million shares have been repurchased under the February 8, 2017 authorization.
 New tax legislation, commonly referred to as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the “Tax Act”), was enacted on December 22, 2017.
In accordance with the Tax Act, we have accrued $66.5 million of United States taxes payable on all previously undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries, estimated to be approximately $1.0 billion as of December 31, 2017.
We have also recorded deferred tax liabilities of $15.1 million for state and foreign taxes estimated to be due upon distribution of all accumulated earnings by our foreign subsidiaries.
We have not provided United States, state or foreign income taxes for earnings generated after January 1, 2018 by certain subsidiaries outside the United States as we currently intend to reinvest the earnings in operations and other activities outside of the United States indefinitely.
Should we subsequently elect to repatriate such foreign earnings, we would need to accrue and pay state and foreign income taxes, thereby reducing the amount of our cash.
United States taxes would generally not be payable due to changes made by the Tax Act.
We believe that our existing cash combined with the cash we anticipate generating from operating activities, and our available credit facilities and financing available from other sources will be sufficient to meet our cash requirements for the next twelve months.
We do not have any significant commitments nor are we aware of any significant events or conditions that are likely to have a material impact on our liquidity or capital resources.
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
As of March 31, 2018, we leased our non-owned facilities under operating lease agreements.
We also leased certain operating machinery and equipment and office equipment under operating lease agreements.
Except for these operating lease agreements, we do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are likely to have a material current or future effect on our financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures, or capital resources.
Recent Accounting Pronouncements
Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements
In February 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued Accounting Standards Update ("ASU") No.
2016-02, “Leases (Topic 842)” (“ASU 2016-02”).
The amendments in this update require the identification of arrangements that should be accounted for as leases by lessees.
In general, for lease arrangements exceeding a twelve month term, these arrangements must now be recognized as assets and liabilities on the balance sheet of the lessee.
ASU 2016-02 requires the use of the modified retrospective method, which will require adjustment to all comparative periods presented in the consolidated financial statements.
ASU 2016-02 is effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2018, with early adoption permitted, and the Company currently intends to adopt ASU 2016-02 on January 1, 2019.
The Company is assessing the impact ASU 2016-02 will have on its consolidated financial statements and expects that the primary impact upon adoption will be the recognition, on a discounted basis, of its minimum commitments under noncancelable operating leases on its consolidated balance sheets resulting in the recording of right of use assets and lease obligations.
Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates
Preparation of the financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the period.
Management believes the most complex and sensitive judgments, because of their significance to the consolidated financial statements, result primarily from the need to make estimates about the effects of matters that are inherently uncertain.
The Company has updated its revenue recognition policy in connection with the adoption of ASC 606 as further described in Note 2, "Revenue" to the accompanying consolidated financial statements.
Readers should also refer to Management's Discussion and Analysis and the critical accounting policies and its use of estimates as reported in Note 1, "Nature of Business and Significant Accounting Policies" and Note 13, "Contingencies" of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in the Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2017.
Actual results in these areas could differ materially from management's estimates.
There have been no significant changes in the Company's assumptions regarding critical accounting estimates during the first three months of 2018.
Contractual Obligations
There were no material changes to the Company's contractual obligations outside the ordinary course of its business during the quarter ended March 31, 2018.
Contingencies
See Note 16, "Contingencies," of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a description of an ongoing lawsuit filed by Raytheon Company against FLIR Systems, Inc. and its subsidiary, FLIR Commercial Systems, Inc., the disclosure of certain matters by the Company to the United States Department of State Office of Defense Trade Controls Compliance, communications to the Company from the United States Department of Commerce Bureau of Industry and Security, and the Company's current estimates of the range of potential loss associated with quality concerns identified by the Company regarding certain SkyWatch Surveillance Towers.
ITEM 2.UNREGISTERED SALES OF EQUITY SECURITIES AND USE OF PROCEEDS
