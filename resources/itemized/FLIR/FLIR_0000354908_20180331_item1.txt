NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Note 1.Basis of Presentation
The accompanying consolidated financial statements of FLIR Systems, Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries (the “Company”) are unaudited and have been prepared pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission.
In the opinion of management, these statements have been prepared on the same basis as the audited consolidated financial statements and include all adjustments, consisting of only normal recurring adjustments, necessary for a fair presentation of the Company’s consolidated financial position and results of operations for the interim periods.
Certain information and footnote disclosures normally included in financial statements prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States have been condensed or omitted pursuant to such rules and regulations.
These consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the Company’s audited consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto included in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2017.
The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of FLIR Systems, Inc. and its wholly owned subsidiaries.
All significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated.
The results of operations for the interim periods presented are not necessarily indicative of the operating results to be expected for any subsequent interim period or for the year ending December 31, 2018.
Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements
FASB ASU No.
2014-09, "Revenue - Revenue from Contracts with Customers" ("ASU 2014-09").
Effective January 1, 2018, the Company adopted ASU 2014-09 and all the related amendments ("new revenue standard" or "ASC 606") using the modified retrospective method to those contracts not yet completed as of January 1, 2018.
As a result, the Company recognized the cumulative effect of initially applying the new revenue standard as an adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings in the amount of approximately $1.0 million as of January 1, 2018.
The comparative information has not been restated and continues to be reported under the accounting standards in effect for those periods.
The Company expects the impact of the adoption of the new standard to be immaterial to net income on an ongoing basis.
FASB ASU No.
2016-16, "Intra-Entity Transfers of Assets Other Than Inventory" ("ASU 2016-16").
Effective January 1, 2018, the Company adopted ASU 2016-16, which eliminates the exception of recognizing, at the time of transfer, current and deferred income taxes for intra-entity asset transfers other than inventory.
This new standard has been applied on a modified retrospective transition basis with an adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings in the amount of approximately $5.6 million as of January 1, 2018.

NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)
Revenue Recognition
The Company designs, markets and sells products primarily as commercial, off-the-shelf products.
Certain customers request different system configurations, based on standard options or accessories that the Company offers.
Revenue is recognized upon transfer of control of promised products or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration the Company expects to receive in exchange for those products or services.
The Company regularly enters into contracts that can include various combinations of products and services, which are generally capable of being distinct and accounted for as separate performance obligations.
In such situations, contract values are allocated to each performance obligation based on its relative estimated standalone selling price.
The vast majority of the Company's revenues are recognized at a point in time when goods are transferred to a customer.
However, for certain contracts that include highly customized components, if performance does not create an asset with an alternative use and termination for convenience clauses provide an enforceable right to payment for performance completed to date, revenue is recognized over time as the performance obligation is satisfied.
The following table presents the Company’s revenues disaggregated by geographical region and operating segment for the three-month periods ended March 31, 2018 and 2017 (in thousands).
Revenue includes certain shipping and handling costs and is stated net of third party agency fees.
Shipping and handling costs associated with outbound freight after control over a product has transferred to a customer are accounted for as a fulfillment cost and are in included in cost of goods sold.
Revenue is recognized net of allowances for returns and net of taxes collected from customers which are subsequently remitted to governmental authorities.
Contract Balances
The timing of revenue recognition, billings and cash collections results in billed accounts receivable, unbilled receivables and deferred revenue and advance payments from customers on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.
Contract assets and liabilities are reported on a contract-by-contract basis.
The Company had no material deferred contract costs recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheet as of March 31, 2018.
FLIR SYSTEMS, INC.

Contract Balances - (Continued)
Remaining Performance Obligations
Remaining performance obligations related to ASC 606 represent the aggregate transaction price allocated to performance obligations with an original contract term greater than one year which are fully or partially unsatisfied at the end of the period.
While the remaining performance obligation disclosure is similar in concept to backlog, the definition of remaining performance obligations excludes contracts that provide the customer with the right to cancel or terminate for convenience with no substantial penalty, even if historical experience indicates the likelihood of cancellation or termination is remote.
The Company has elected to exclude contracts with customers with an original term of one year or less from remaining performance obligations while these contracts are included within backlog.
As of March 31, 2018, the aggregate amount of the transaction price allocated to remaining performance obligations was approximately $50.3 million.
The Company expects to recognize revenue on approximately 53 percent of the remaining performance obligations over the next 12 months, and the remainder recognized thereafter.
Stock Incentive Plans
FLIR SYSTEMS, INC.
NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)
Note 3.Stock-based Compensation - (Continued)
Employee Stock Purchase Plan
The Company has an Employee Stock Purchase Plan (the “ESPP”) which allows employees to purchase shares of the Company’s common stock at 85 percent of the fair market value at the lower of either the date of enrollment or the purchase date.
The ESPP provides for six-month offerings commencing on May 1 and November 1 of each year with purchases on April 30 and October 31 of each year.
Shares purchased under the ESPP must be held by employees for a period of at least 18 months after the date of purchase.
As of March 31, 2018, the Company had approximately $35.6 million of total unrecognized stock-based compensation costs, net of estimated forfeitures, to be recognized over a weighted average period of 2.00 years.
Note 4.Net Earnings Per Share
The effect of stock-based compensation awards for the three months ended March 31, 2017 that aggregated 18,000 shares have been excluded for purposes of diluted earnings per share since the effect of their inclusion would have been anti-dilutive.
There were no shares excluded for the three months ended March 31, 2018.
FLIR SYSTEMS, INC.
NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)
Note 5.Fair Value of Financial Instruments
Level 1 – quoted prices in active markets for identical securities as of the reporting date;
Level 2 – other significant directly or indirectly observable inputs, including quoted prices for similar securities, interest rates, prepayment speeds, credit risk, and observable market prices for identical instruments that are traded in less active markets; and
Level 3 – significant inputs that are generally less observable than objective sources, including our own assumptions in determining fair value.
The factors or methodology used for valuing securities are not necessarily an indication of the risk associated with investing in those securities.
The Company had $66.2 million and $140.7 million of cash equivalents at March 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017, respectively, which were primarily investments in money market funds and overnight deposits.
The Company has categorized its cash equivalents as a Level 1 financial asset, measured at fair value based on quoted prices in active markets of identical assets.
All cash equivalents are in instruments that are convertible to cash daily.
The fair value of the Company’s foreign currency contracts as of March 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017, are disclosed in Note 6, "Derivative Financial Instruments," and are based on Level 2 inputs.
The fair value of the Company’s senior unsecured notes as described in Note 14, "Long-Term Debt," is approximately $422.6 million and $427.5 million based upon Level 2 inputs at March 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017, respectively.
At March 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017, the Company had no other borrowings outstanding under the revolving credit facility described in Note 14.
The Company does not have any other significant financial assets or liabilities that are measured at fair value.
Note 6.
Derivative Financial Instruments
Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Risk
The Company enters into foreign currency forward contracts not formally designated as hedges to manage the consolidated exchange rate risk associated with the remeasurement of non-functional currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities.
Changes in fair value of foreign currency forward contracts are recognized in income at the end of each reporting period based on the difference between the contract rate and the spot rate.
In general, these gains and losses are offset in the Consolidated Statements of Income by the reciprocal gains and losses from the underlying assets or liabilities which originally gave rise to the exposure.
The net amount of the gains and losses related to derivative instruments recorded in other income, net for the three months ended March 31, 2018 and 2017 were net losses of $4.7 million and $1.0 million, respectively.
At March 31, 2018, the Company’s foreign currency forward contracts, in general, had maturities of three months or less.

Accounts receivable are net of an allowance for doubtful accounts of $8.1 million and $7.6 million at March 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017, respectively.
Note 9.
Property and Equipment
Property and equipment are net of accumulated depreciation of $315.5 million and $306.2 million at March 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017, respectively.
In August 2017, the Company announced a realignment of its business operations into three reportable operating segments effective as of January 1, 2018.
This reorganization requires that the Company reassign its reported goodwill as of January 1, 2018 to its new reportable segments based on the relative fair value of the respective operating segments at that time.
The Company is in the process of performing this valuation analysis which is expected to be finalized by June 30, 2018.
Subsequent to the reallocation of goodwill, an impairment test of each new reporting unit is required to be performed, and a potential impairment could be deemed to exist as a result of this process.
The Company will record any such potential impairment, if identified, during the fiscal quarter ending June 30, 2018.
See Note 18, "Operating Segments and Related Information" of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on the three new reportable operating segments.
Note 11.
Intangible Assets
Intangible assets are net of accumulated amortization of $90.8 million and $84.5 million at March 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017, respectively.
FLIR SYSTEMS, INC.
NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)
On February 8, 2011, the Company entered into a credit agreement with Bank of America, N.A., U.S. Bank National Association, JPMorgan Chase Bank N.A.
and other lenders, as amended on April 5, 2013, October 27, 2015 and May 31, 2016 (the "Credit Agreement") which provides for a $500 million revolving line of credit.
At March 31, 2018, the Company had no amounts outstanding under its revolving credit facility and had $14.9 million of letters of credit outstanding governed by the facility, which reduces the total available revolving credit under the Credit Agreement to $485.1 million.

Long-Term Debt
In June 2016, the Company issued $425 million aggregate principal amount of its 3.125 percent senior unsecured notes due June 15, 2021 (the “2016 Notes”).
The net proceeds from the issuance of the 2016 Notes were approximately $421.0 million, after deducting underwriting discounts and offering expenses, which are being amortized over a period of five years.
Interest on the 2016 Notes is payable semiannually in arrears on December 15 and June 15.
The proceeds from the 2016 Notes were used to repay the principal amount of the notes issued in August 2011 and outstanding in July 2016 and are being used for general corporate purposes, including working capital and capital expenditure needs, business acquisitions and repurchases of the Company’s common stock.
FLIR SYSTEMS, INC.
NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)
Note 15.Shareholders’ Equity - (Continued)
During the three months ended March 31, 2018, the Company repurchased 1.7 million shares of the Company's common stock through open market transactions and entered into an accelerated share repurchase program at a notional amount of $50.0 million under which the Company received 0.8 million shares in March 2018.
The repurchases were under the February 2017 authorization by the Company's Board of Directors which authorized the repurchase of up to 15.0 million shares of the Company's outstanding common stock.
This authorization expires in February 2019.
On March 9, 2018, the Company paid a dividend of $0.16 per share on its outstanding common stock to the shareholders of record as of the close of business on February 23, 2018.

Raytheon Litigation
FLIR Systems, Inc. and its subsidiary, FLIR Commercial Systems, Inc. (formerly known as Indigo Systems Corporation) (together, the “FLIR Parties”), were named in a lawsuit filed by Raytheon Company (“Raytheon”) on March 2, 2007, in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Texas.
Raytheon's complaint, as amended, asserted claims for tortious interference, patent infringement, trade secret misappropriation, unfair competition, breach of contract, and fraudulent concealment.
The FLIR Parties filed an answer to the complaint on September 2, 2008, in which they denied all material allegations.
On October 27, 2010, the FLIR Parties and Raytheon entered into a settlement agreement that resolved the patent infringement claims (the "Patent Claims") pursuant to which the FLIR Parties paid $3 million to Raytheon and entitles the FLIR Parties to certain license rights in the patents that were the subject of the Patent Claims.
On October 28, 2014, a four-week trial began with respect to Raytheon's remaining claims of misappropriations of trade secrets and claims related to 31 alleged trade secrets.
On November 24, 2014, a jury in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Texas rejected Raytheon’s claims and determined that 27 of the alleged trade secrets were not in fact trade secrets and that neither of the FLIR Parties infringed any of the trade secrets claimed and awarded Raytheon no damages.
On March 31, 2016, the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Texas issued a Final Judgment denying Raytheon’s claims and awarding FLIR court costs and denying each of Raytheon’s and FLIR’s Renewed Motions for Judgment as a Matter of Law and denying FLIR’s Amended Rule 54(d) Motion for Attorneys’ Fees and Costs Under the Texas Theft Liability Act.
On April 29, 2016, Raytheon filed a Notice of Appeal to the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit of the denial by the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Texas of Raytheon’s Renewed Motion for Judgment as a Matter of Law, or in the Alternative, Motion for New Trial.
On May 11, 2016, the FLIR Parties filed a Notice of Appeal to the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit of the Order of the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Texas Denying the FLIR Parties’ Amended Rule 54(d) Motion for Attorneys’ Fees and Costs under the Texas Theft Liability Act, the Order Denying the FLIR Parties’ Renewed Motion For Judgment as a Matter Of Law, and the Final Judgment to the extent it denied the FLIR Parties Attorneys’ Fees and Costs under the Texas Theft Liability Act.
The United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit heard the matter on January 12, 2018 and a decision is expected later this year.
The matter remains ongoing and is subject to appeal.
The Company is unable to estimate the amount or range of potential loss or recovery, if any, which might result if the final determination of this matter is favorable or unfavorable, but an adverse ruling on the merits of the original claims against the FLIR Parties, while remote, could be material.

Matters Involving the United States Department of State and Department of Commerce
As part of the Consent Agreement DDTC acknowledged that the Company voluntarily disclosed certain alleged Arms Export Control Act and ITAR violations, which are resolved pursuant to the Consent Agreement, cooperated in, and instituted a number of compliance program improvements during the course of DDTC's review.
In May 2017, the Company submitted an initial notification to DDTC regarding potential violations related to certain export classifications obtained through the commodity jurisdiction process and a final voluntary disclosure in August 2017.
DDTC acknowledged the notification and at the request of DDTC, the Company executed a tolling agreement for this matter, suspending the statute of limitations through July 2018.
This matter was not resolved pursuant to the Consent Agreement identified above and remains under review.
The Company is unable to reasonably estimate the time it may take to resolve these matters or the amount or range of potential loss, penalty or other government action, if any, that may be incurred in connection with these matters.
However, an unfavorable outcome could result in substantial fines and penalties or loss or suspension of export privileges or of particular authorizations that could be material to the Company’s financial position, results of operations or cash flows in and following the period in which such an outcome becomes estimable or known.

SkyWatch Product Quality Matters
In March 2016, the Company learned of potential quality concerns with respect to as many as 315 Level III and Level IV SkyWatch Surveillance Towers sold by FLIR and companies acquired by FLIR from 2002 through 2014.
The Company notified customers who purchased the affected SkyWatch Towers of the potential concerns and, as a precautionary measure, also temporarily suspended production of all Level III and Level IV SkyWatch Towers pending the completion of its review and the implementation of any necessary remedial measures.
During the quarter ended June 30, 2017, the Company identified the cause of these quality issues and began testing certain remedial solutions to repair the affected SkyWatch Towers.
Testing of the remedial solution for certain of the product variations affected was also completed during the quarter ended June 30, 2017.
Subsequent to the aforementioned identification and testing, customers who purchased the product configurations for which a remedial solution has been identified and tested were notified of their options to request modifications to their fielded units.
While there still remains uncertainty related to estimating the costs associated with a potential remedy and number of units which may require such remedy, the Company currently estimates the range of potential loss to be between $6.3 million and $14 million.
As no single amount within the range is a better estimate than any other amount within the range, the Company has recorded a liability of $6.3 million as of March 31, 2018.
Factors underlying this estimated range of loss may change from time to time, and actual results may vary significantly from this estimate.
Other Matters
The Company is also subject to other legal and administrative proceedings, investigations, claims and litigation arising in the ordinary course of business not specifically identified above.
In these identified matters and others not specifically identified, the Company records a liability with respect to a matter when management believes it is both probable that a liability has been incurred and the Company can reasonably estimate the amount of the loss.
The Company believes it has recorded adequate provisions for any probable and estimable losses for matters in existence on the date hereof.
The Company reviews these provisions to reflect the impact of negotiations, settlements, rulings, advice of legal counsel and other information and events pertaining to a particular matter.
While the outcome of each of these matters is currently not determinable, the Company does not expect that the ultimate resolution of any such matter will individually have a material adverse effect on the Company’s financial position, results of operations or cash flows.
The costs to resolve all such matters may in the aggregate have a material adverse effect on the Company’s financial position, results of operations or cash flows.
 The effective tax rate for the three months ended March 31, 2018, is higher than the United States Federal tax rate of 21.0 percent mainly due to state taxes, higher tax rates applied to income earned in foreign jurisdictions, accruals for non-deductible penalties, and other discrete items, offset by the effect of federal, foreign and state tax credits and excess tax benefits from stock compensation.
New tax legislation, commonly referred to as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the “Tax Act”), was enacted on December 22, 2017.
In connection with the Company's initial analysis of the impact of the Tax Act, the Company recorded provisional net tax expense of $94.4 million for the period ended December 31, 2017.
This amount consists of net expense of $66.5 million for the transition tax and net expense of $12.8 million for the remeasurement of the Company's net deferred tax assets using the reduced United States tax rate.
In addition, the Company also recorded net tax expense of $15.1 million for state income and foreign taxes estimated to be due upon distribution of approximately $1.0 billion of previously undistributed foreign earnings no longer permanently reinvested as of December 31, 2017.
These provisional amounts may be impacted by the need for further analysis and future clarification and guidance regarding available tax accounting methods and elections, earnings and profits computations, foreign tax credit calculations, and state tax conformity to federal tax changes.
As of March 31, 2018, the Company has not completed the accounting for the tax effects of the Tax Act described above and there have been no material changes to estimated amounts.

 Note 17.
Income Taxes - (Continued)
As of March 31, 2018, the Company had approximately $65.2 million of unrecognized tax benefits, all of which would affect the Company’s effective tax rate if recognized.
The Company anticipates approximately $1.8 million of its net unrecognized tax benefits will be recognized within 12 months as the result of settlements or effective settlements with various tax authorities, the closure of certain audits and the lapse of the applicable statute of limitations.
The Company classifies interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in the income tax provision.
As of March 31, 2018, the Company had $6.4 million of accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits that are recorded as current and non-current accrued income taxes on the Consolidated Balance Sheet.
In 2016, the Company recorded discrete tax charges totaling $39.6 million related to the January 11, 2016 announcement from the European Commission of a decision concluding that certain rules under Belgian tax legislation were deemed to be incompatible with European Union regulations on state aid.
As a result of this decision, the European Commission directed the Belgian Government to recover past taxes from certain entities, reflective of disallowed state aid, which impacts one of the Company’s international subsidiaries.
The Belgian Government announced they have appealed this decision and filed action for an annulment in the General Court of the European Union, and in July 2016 the Company filed a separate appeal with the General Court of the European Union.
In accordance with FASB ASC Topic 740, “Income Taxes,” the Company recorded discrete tax expense of $39.6 million during 2016, related to this matter and on January 10, 2017, received tax assessments from the Belgium government for a similar amount, which the Company has classified as current taxes payable on the Consolidated Balance Sheet as of March 31, 2018.
The Company has filed a complaint against the Belgian tax assessments, and the result of this complaint, the appeal with the General Court of the European Union, new information received from the Belgian Government, or other future events may cause the income tax provision associated with the decision to be entirely or partially reversed.
At March 31, 2018, the Company held the euro equivalent of $37.6 million in a restricted cash account.
Those amounts, or portions thereof, could become unrestricted depending on the outcome of this matter.

ITEM 1A.
RISK FACTORS
The following are important factors that could cause actual results or events to differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statements made by or on behalf of the Company.
If we are unable to adequately respond to these risks and uncertainties, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected.
Additionally, we cannot be certain or give any assurance that any actions taken to reduce known risks and uncertainties will be effective.
Risks, Uncertainties and Other Factors Related to Our Business
We depend on the United States government for a material portion of our business and changes in government spending could adversely affect our business
Substantial uncertainty exists in the spending levels and priorities of the United States government, particularly with respect to military expenditures.
Continued and further reductions in military spending could have a material adverse effect on our results from operations.
As a United States government supplier, we are subject to a number of procurement rules and regulations
Operating margins may be negatively impacted by reduction in sales or by a change in the mix of products sold
Our expense levels are based, in part, on our expectations regarding future sales and these expenses are largely fixed in the short term.
Some expenses, such as those related to research and development activities, would likely be maintained in the event of a sales downturn in order to maintain and enhance the long-term competitiveness of the Company.
We maintain inventories of finished goods, components and raw materials at levels we believe are necessary to meet anticipated sales.
Accordingly, we may not be able to reduce our costs in a timely manner to compensate for any unexpected shortfall between forecasted and actual sales.
Any significant shortfall of sales may result in us carrying higher levels of inventories of finished goods, components and raw materials thereby increasing our risk of inventory obsolescence and corresponding inventory write-downs and write-offs.
Our fixed costs, including facilities and information technology costs, compliance and public company costs, and depreciation and amortization related to previous acquisitions and capital expenditures, are significant and are difficult to reduce in the short term.
Our operating margins vary by product and substantial changes in the mix of products sold could also have a negative impact on our operating margins.
We may experience impairment in the value of our tangible and intangible assets
Our industry is subject to rapid changes in technology, which may result in unexpected obsolescence or impairment of our assets.
Our intangible assets, including goodwill, represent a significant portion of our total assets.
Most of these intangibles are the result of acquisitions in which the purchase price exceeded the value of the tangible assets acquired.
We amortize certain of these intangibles over their anticipated useful life and review goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment annually or more frequently if warranted by events.
To date we have not experienced any impairment of our intangible assets, but there can be no assurance that we will not experience such impairment in the future.
In addition, certain of our tangible assets such as inventory and machinery and equipment may experience impairment in their value as a result of such events as the introduction of new products, changes in technology or changes in customer demand patterns.
We depreciate our machinery and equipment at levels we believe are adequate; however, there can be no assurance that there will not be a future impairment that may have a material impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
Unfavorable results of legal proceedings could materially adversely affect us
We are subject to various legal proceedings and claims that have arisen out of the ordinary conduct of our business and are not yet resolved, and additional claims may arise in the future.
Results of legal proceedings cannot be predicted with certainty.
Regardless of merit, litigation may be both time-consuming and disruptive to our operations and could cause significant expense and diversion of management attention.
From time to time, we are involved in lawsuits concerning intellectual property, torts, contracts, shareholder litigation, administrative and regulatory proceedings and other matters, as well as governmental inquiries and investigations, the outcomes of which may be significant to our results of operations and may limit our ability to engage in our business activities.
In recognition of these considerations, we have and may in the future enter into material settlements to avoid ongoing costs and efforts in defending or pursuing a matter.
Should we fail to prevail in certain matters, or should several of these matters be resolved against us in the same reporting period, we may be faced with significant monetary damages or injunctive relief against us that could adversely affect our business, financial condition, operating results and cash flows.
While we have insurance related to our business operations, it may not apply to or fully cover liabilities we incur as a result of these lawsuits.
We record accruals for liabilities where we believe a loss to be probable and reasonably estimable.
However, our actual costs may differ materially from these estimates.
We face risks from international sales and business activities
•the imposition of and changes to governmental licensing restrictions and controls impacting our technology and products;
•restrictions and prohibitions on the export of technology and products, including recent changes in regulation prohibiting the sale of certain of our products to certain end users without a license;
•international trade restrictions;
•difficulty in collecting receivables and governmental restrictions with respect to currency;
•inadequate protection of intellectual property;
•labor union activities;
•changes in tariffs and taxes;
•restrictions on repatriation of earnings;
•restriction on the importation and exportation of goods and services;
•risks, costs, impacts and obligations associated with the United States Foreign Corrupt Practices Act ("FCPA"), and other anti-bribery and anti-corruption laws applicable to us, and laws applicable to global trade and United States exports and
costs and penalties from violations of such laws and related regulations, including the costs associated with required remedial and other increased compliance activity;
•difficulties in staffing and managing international operations; and
•political and economic instability.
Some of these factors recently have had an adverse impact on our sales and operations and increased the Company’s cost of doing business and subjected the business to additional rules, policies and procedures that impacted the operation of the Company.
No assurance can be given that these factors will not have a material adverse effect on our future international sales and operations and, consequently, on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
Furthermore, compliance with complex foreign and U.S. laws and regulations that apply to our international operations increases our cost of doing business both in the United States and in international jurisdictions.
These regulations include import and export laws, anti-competition laws, anti-corruption laws, such as the FCPA and the U.K.
Bribery Act, and other local laws prohibiting corrupt payments to governmental officials, data privacy requirements, tax laws, and accounting, internal control and disclosure requirements.
For example, on April 8, 2015, the Company and the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) entered into an agreement through entry of an Order Instituting Cease-and-Desist Proceedings Pursuant to Section 21C of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, Making Findings, and Imposing a Cease-and-Desist Order (the “SEC Order”).
The SEC Order settled charges under the FCPA with respect to incidents of improper travel and gifts involving FLIR’s Middle East operation.
Pursuant to the SEC Order, the Company is obligated to “cease and desist” from committing any future violations of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.
Violations of these laws and regulations could result in civil and criminal fines, penalties and sanctions against us, our officers or our employees, prohibitions on the conduct of our business and on our ability to offer our products and services in one or more countries, and could also materially affect our reputation, business and results of operations.
In certain foreign jurisdictions, there is a higher risk of fraud or corruption and greater difficulty in maintaining effective internal controls and compliance programs.
Further, although we have implemented and continue to implement policies and procedures designed to promote compliance with applicable laws and regulations, there can be no assurance that our employees, contractors or agents will not violate our policies or applicable laws and regulations.
In addition, our international contracts may include industrial cooperation agreements requiring specific in-country purchases, investments, manufacturing agreements or other financial obligations, known as offset obligations, and may provide for penalties if we fail to meet such requirements.
The impact of these factors is difficult to predict, but one or more of them could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations, or cash flows.
We face risks from currency fluctuations
Historically, currency fluctuations have affected our operating results.
Changes in the value of foreign currencies in which our sales or costs incurred are denominated have in the past caused, and could in the future cause, fluctuations in our operating results.
We seek to reduce our exposure to currency fluctuations by denominating, where possible, our international sales in United States dollars, by balancing expenses and revenues in various currencies and by undertaking limited hedging of forecasted currency exposures.
With respect to international sales denominated in United States dollars, a decrease in the value of foreign currencies relative to the United States dollar could make our products less price competitive.
We may not be successful in obtaining the necessary export licenses to conduct operations abroad and the United States government may prevent proposed sales to foreign governments and customers
Export licenses and other authorizations are required from United States government agencies under the ITAR, the Export Administration Regulation (“EAR”), the Office of Foreign Assets Control (“OFAC”) Regulations, the Trading with the Enemy Act of 1917, the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (“IEEPA”), the Arms Export Control Act of 1976 (“AECA”), and other similar laws and regulations for the sale, use and export of many of our products and related data and services.
Thermal and infrared products and technical data have been subject to the ITAR and EAR, historically under United States Munitions List (“USML”) Category XII and Commerce Control List (“CCL”) Category 6.
Recently, the United States Government’s export reform effort resulted in the transition of various Company products from the USML to the CCL, shifting the licensing requirements and restrictions for products regulated by the Department of Commerce under the EAR.
This transition has increased the licensing requirements and restrictions on some products and reduced the requirements and restrictions on others.
We can give no assurance that we will be successful in obtaining the necessary licenses from the United States Department of State or Department of Commerce required to conduct our business as presently or historically conducted.
Although we have taken actions and continue to take additional actions necessary to implement policies and procedures to promote an improved compliance culture and programs, there is no guarantee that our actions will be effective or that government agencies will not view our actions and programs with heightened scrutiny, including as a result of events outside the Company’s control.
As a result, we may receive more restrictive provisos or limitations on new license requests, wholesale denials of our license requests, suspensions or terminations of our existing licenses, or delays in receiving new licenses resulting from requests for follow-up information, due diligence requests or additional limitations on our sale to third parties.
We can give no assurance that we will be successful in obtaining necessary licenses required to facilitate our international business.
Failures to obtain or delays in obtaining licenses may prevent or limit our ability to market, sell, export, or transfer our products outside the United States and has had and could continue to have a material adverse effect on our business and our operating results.
General economic conditions may adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition
Our operations and performance depend significantly on worldwide economic conditions and their impact on levels of capital investment and consumer spending.
Economic factors that could adversely influence demand for the Company’s products include
In recent years, our performance has been negatively impacted by reduced spending by United States government agencies, global economic weakness, and the Eurozone crisis.
Continuation of the conditions that led to reduced spending and potential further reductions in spending globally by either consumers or government agencies could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
Our primary markets are volatile and unpredictable
•the timing, number and size of orders from, and shipments to, our customers, as well as the relative mix of those orders;
•variations in the volume of orders for a particular product or product line in a particular fiscal quarter;
•the size and timing of new contract awards;
•the timing of the release of government funds for procurement of our products; and
•the timing of orders and shipments within a given fiscal quarter.
•the seasonal pattern of contracting by the United States government and certain foreign governments;
•the desire of customers to take delivery of equipment prior to fiscal year ends due to funding considerations; and
•the tendency of commercial enterprises to utilize fully annual capital budgets prior to expiration.
Competition in our markets is intense and our failure to compete effectively could adversely affect our business
Competition in the markets for our products is intense.
The speed with which companies can identify new applications for thermal imaging, develop products to meet those needs and supply commercial quantities at low prices to the market are important competitive factors.
We believe the principal competitive factors in our markets are product performance, price, customer service and training, product reputation, and effective marketing and sales efforts.
Many of our competitors have greater financial, technical, research and development, and marketing resources than we do.
All of these factors, as well as the potential for increased competition from new market entrants, require us to continue to invest in, and focus on, research and development and new product innovation.
No assurance can be given that we will be able to compete effectively in the future and a failure to do so could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
Our products may suffer from defects or errors leading to substantial product liability, damage or warranty claims
We include complex system designs and components in our products that may contain errors or defects, particularly when we incorporate new technology into our products or release new versions.
If any of our products are defective, we might be required to redesign or recall those products or pay substantial damages or warranty claims.
Such an event could result in significant expenses including expenses arising from product liability and warranty claims.
It also could disrupt sales and affect our reputation and that of our products, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
As we expand our presence into new markets, we may face increased exposure to product liability claims.
We maintain product liability insurance but cannot be certain that it will be sufficient or will continue to be available on acceptable terms.
Amounts included in our backlog may not result in actual revenues or translate into profits
Many contracts are subject to cancellation or suspension on short notice at the discretion of the customer, and the contracts in our backlog are subject to changes in the scope of services to be provided as well as adjustments to the costs relating to the contract.
We have historically experienced variances in the components of backlog related to delivery delays or cancellations resulting from customer-specific circumstances, external market factors and economic factors beyond our control, and we may experience more
delays or cancellations in the future.
Accordingly, there is no assurance that backlog will actually be realized.
If our backlog fails to materialize, we could experience a reduction in revenues and a decline in profitability, which could result in a deterioration of our financial position and liquidity.
Risks, Uncertainties and Other Factors Related to Our Technology and Intellectual Property
Our inability to protect our intellectual property and proprietary rights and avoid infringing the rights of others could harm our competitive position and our business
Our ability to compete successfully and achieve future revenue growth depends, in part, on our ability to protect our proprietary technology and operate without infringing the rights of others.
To accomplish this, we rely on a combination of patent, trademark, copyright and trade secret laws, confidentiality agreements and contractual provisions to protect our proprietary rights.
Many of our proprietary rights are held in confidence as trade secrets and are not covered by patents, making them more difficult to protect.
Although we currently hold worldwide patents covering certain aspects of our technologies and products, and we are actively pursuing additional patents, we cannot be certain that we will obtain additional patents or trademarks on our technology, products and trade names.
Furthermore, we cannot be certain that our patents or trademarks will not be challenged or circumvented by our competitors or that measures taken by us to protect our proprietary rights will adequately deter their misappropriation or disclosure.
Any failure by us to protect our intellectual property could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
Moreover, because intellectual property does not necessarily prevent our competitors from entering the markets we serve, there can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain our competitive advantage or that our competitors will not develop capabilities equal or superior to ours.
Litigation over patents and other intellectual property is common in our industry.
We have been the subject of patent and other intellectual property litigation in the past and cannot be sure that we will not be subject to such litigation in the future.
Similarly, there exists the possibility we will assert claims in litigation to protect our intellectual property.
Lawsuits defending or prosecuting intellectual property claims and related legal and administrative proceedings could result in substantial expense to us and significant diversion of effort of our personnel.
An adverse determination in a patent suit or in any other proceeding in which we are a party could subject us to significant liabilities, result in the loss of intellectual property rights we claim or impact our competitive position.
Additionally, an adverse determination could require us to seek licenses from third parties.
If such licenses are not available on commercially reasonable terms or at all, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.
Our future success will depend on our ability to respond to the rapid technological change in the markets in which we compete, our ability to introduce new or enhanced products and enter into new markets
The markets in which we compete are characterized by rapid technological developments and frequent new product introductions, enhancements and modifications.
Our ability to develop new products and technologies that anticipate changing customer requirements, reduce costs and otherwise retain or enhance our competitive position in existing and new markets will be an important factor in our future results from operations.
We will continue to make substantial capital expenditures and incur significant research and development costs to improve our manufacturing capability, reduce costs, and develop and introduce new products and enhancements.
If we fail to develop and introduce new products and technologies in a timely manner, our business, financial condition and results of operations would be adversely affected.
In addition, we cannot be certain that our new products and technologies will be successful or that customers will accept any of our new products.
Our business could be negatively impacted by cybersecurity threats and other security threats and technology disruptions
We face certain security threats and technology disruptions, including threats to our information technology infrastructure, attempts to gain access to our or our customers’ proprietary or classified information, threats to the physical security of our facilities and employees, threats of terrorism events, and failures of our technology tools and systems.
We are subject to laws and rules issued by various agencies concerning safeguarding and maintaining infrastructure and physical security and information confidentiality.
Our information technology networks and related systems are critical to the operation of our business and essential to our ability to successfully perform day-to-day operations.
We are also involved with information technology systems for certain customers and other third parties, for which we face similar security threats as for our own.
In particular, cybersecurity threats-which include, but are not limited to, computer viruses, spyware and malware, attempts to access information, denial of service attacks and other electronic security breaches-are persistent and evolve quickly.
Such threats have increased in frequency, scope and potential impact
in recent years.
Further, a variety of technological tools and systems, including both company-owned information technology and technological services provided by outside parties, support our critical functions.
These technologies, as well as our products, are subject to failure and the user’s inability to have such technologies properly supported, updated, expanded or integrated into other technologies and may contain open source and third party software which may unbeknownst to us contain defects or viruses that pose unintended risks to our customers.
These risks if not effectively mitigated or controlled could materially harm our business or reputation.
While we believe that we have implemented appropriate measures and controls, there can be no assurance that such actions will be sufficient to prevent disruptions to critical systems, unauthorized release of confidential information or corruption of data.
We require user names and passwords in order to access our information technology systems.
We use encryption and authentication technologies designed to secure the transmission and storage of data and prevent access to our data or accounts.
These security measures are subject to third-party security breaches, employee error, malfeasance, faulty password management or other irregularities.
For example, third parties may attempt to induce by fraud employees or customers into disclosing user names, passwords or other sensitive information, which may in turn be used to access our information technology systems.
These security systems cannot provide absolute security.
To the extent we were to experience a breach of our systems and were unable to protect sensitive data, such a breach could materially damage business partner and customer relationships, and curtail or otherwise impact the use of our information technology systems.
Moreover, if a security breach of our information technology system affects our computer systems or results in the release of personally identifiable or other sensitive information of customers, business partners, employees and other third parties, our reputation and brand could be materially damaged, use of our products and services could decrease, and we could be exposed to a risk of loss, litigation and potential liability.
Although we have in the past and continue to be subject to cybersecurity threats and other security threats and technology disruptions, to date none has had a material impact on our business, financial condition or results of operations.
Nonetheless, in the future, these types of events could disrupt our operations and customer and other third party information technology systems.
They also could require significant management attention and resources, negatively impact our reputation among our customers and the public and challenge our eligibility for future work on sensitive or classified systems, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
Risks, Uncertainties and Other Factors Related to Our Corporate Structure and Organization
Our future success depends in part on attracting and retaining key senior management and qualified technical, sales and other personnel
Our future success depends in part on the efforts and continued services of our key executives and our ability to attract and retain qualified technical, sales and other personnel.
Significant competition exists for such personnel and we cannot assure the retention of our key executives, technical and sales personnel or our ability to attract, integrate and retain other such personnel that may be required in the future.
We cannot assure that employees will not leave and subsequently compete against us.
If we are unable to attract and retain key personnel, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.
We must successfully manage a complex global organization
As we have grown, the size and scope of our worldwide operations have also increased substantially.
We currently design, manufacture and market numerous product lines in locations worldwide.
Significant management time and effort is required to manage effectively the increased complexity of the business and our failure to successfully do so could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
Our inability to continue to manufacture our products at one or more of our facilities as a result of, for example, a prolonged power outage, earthquake, fire or other natural disaster, or labor or political unrest, could prevent us from supplying products to our customers and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
We may be unable to integrate successfully recent or future acquisitions into our operations, thereby disrupting our business and harming our financial condition and results of operations
We have made twelve acquisitions of various sizes in the past five years.
The integration of businesses, personnel, product lines and technologies can be difficult, time consuming and subject to significant risks.
For example, we could lose key personnel from
companies that we acquire, incur unanticipated costs, lose major sources of revenue, fail to integrate critical technologies, suffer business disruptions, fail to capture anticipated synergies, fail to establish satisfactory internal controls, or incur unanticipated liabilities.
Any of these difficulties could disrupt our ongoing business, distract our management and employees, increase our expenses and decrease our revenue.
We frequently evaluate strategic opportunities available to us and it is likely that we will make additional acquisitions in the future.
Such acquisitions may vary in size and complexity.
Any future acquisitions are subject to the risks described above.
Furthermore, we might assume or incur additional debt or issue additional equity securities to pay for future acquisitions.
Additional debt may negatively impact our results and increase our financial risk, and the issuance of any additional equity securities could dilute our then existing shareholders’ ownership.
No assurance can be given that we will realize anticipated benefits of any future acquisitions, or that any such acquisition or investment will not have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
We have indebtedness as a result of the issuance of our 3.125 percent senior unsecured notes (the “Notes”) and borrowings against our unsecured credit facility, and we are subject to certain restrictive covenants under our unsecured credit facility and the indenture governing the Notes which may limit our operational and financial flexibility
Our ability to meet our debt service obligations and comply with the financial covenants under our credit facility will be dependent upon our future performance, which will be subject to financial, business and other factors affecting our operations, many of which are beyond our control.
Our inability to meet our debt service obligations or comply with the required covenants could result in a default under the credit facility or indenture.
In the event of any such default, under the credit facility, the lenders thereunder could elect to declare all outstanding debt, accrued interest and fees under the facility to be due and immediately payable.
In the event of any such default under our indenture, either the trustee or the holders of at least 25 percent of the outstanding principal amount of the Notes could declare the principal amount of all of the Notes to be due and payable immediately.
We may not be able to refinance our indebtedness on favorable terms, if at all, which could materially and adversely affect our liquidity and our ongoing results of operations.
Our ability to refinance indebtedness, including the Notes, will depend in part on our operating and financial performance, which, in turn, is subject to prevailing economic conditions and to financial, business, legislative, regulatory and other factors beyond our control.
In addition, prevailing interest rates or other factors at the time of refinancing could increase our interest expense.
A refinancing of our indebtedness, including the Notes, could also require us to comply with more onerous covenants and further restrict our business operations.
Our inability to refinance our indebtedness or to do so upon favorable terms could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows, and make us vulnerable to adverse industry and general economic conditions.
We are effectively self-insured against many potential liabilities
Changes in our effective income tax rate may have an adverse effect on our results of operations
We are subject to taxes in the United States and numerous foreign jurisdictions, including Belgium, where a number of our subsidiaries are organized.
Due to economic and political conditions, tax rates in various jurisdictions may be subject to significant change.
Our future effective tax rate could be affected by changes in the mix of earnings in countries with different statutory tax rates, changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities, changes in the enforcement environment, and changes in tax laws or their interpretations, in the United States and in foreign jurisdictions.
For example, in January 2016, the European Commission announced a decision concluding that certain rules under Belgian tax legislation are deemed to be incompatible with European Union regulations on state aid.
As a result of this decision, the European Commission has directed the Belgian Government to recover past taxes from certain entities, reflective of disallowed state aid, which impacts one of the Company’s international subsidiaries.
The Belgian Government announced they have appealed this decision and filed action for an annulment in the General Count of the European Union, and in July 2016 the Company filed a separate appeal with the General Court of the European Union.
The Company recorded discrete tax expense of $39.6 million during 2016 related to this matter and on January 10, 2017, received tax assessments from the Belgium government for a similar amount.
The Company has filed a complaint against the Belgian tax assessments, and the result of this complaint, the appeal with the General Court of the European Union, new information received from the Belgian Government, or other future events may cause the income tax provision associated with the decision to be entirely or partially reversed.
At March 31, 2018, we held the euro equivalent of $37.6 million in a restricted account.
Those amounts, or portions thereof, could become unrestricted based on a similar fact pattern.
•the jurisdictions in which profits are determined to be earned and taxed;
•the resolution of issues arising from tax audits with various tax authorities;
•changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities;
•adjustments to estimated taxes upon finalization of various tax returns;
•increases in expenses not deductible for tax purposes;
•changes in available tax credits;
•changes in share-based compensation expense;
•changes in tax laws or the interpretation of such tax laws and changes in generally accepted accounting principles;
•the repatriation of earnings from outside the United States for which we have not previously provided for United States taxes.
Any significant increase in our future effective tax rates could adversely impact net income for future periods.
In addition, the United States Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) and other tax authorities regularly examine our income tax returns.
Our financial condition and results of operations could be adversely impacted if any assessments resulting from the examination of our income tax returns by the IRS or other taxing authorities are not resolved in our favor.
New tax legislation, commonly referred to as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the “Tax Act”), was enacted on December 22, 2017.
The Tax Act, among other things, (i) permanently reduces the US corporate income tax rate to 21% beginning in 2018, (ii) provides for a five year period of 100% bonus depreciation followed by a phase-down of the bonus depreciation percentage, and (iii) provides for more general changes to the taxation of corporations, including changes to the deductibility of interest expense, the adoption of a modified territorial tax system, assessing a repatriation tax or “toll-charge” on undistributed earnings and profits of US-owned foreign corporations, and introducing certain anti-base erosion provisions.
The long-term impact of the Tax Act on the general economy cannot be reliably predicted at this time and will require rule-making and interpretation in a number of areas.
The Tax Act requires complex computations not previously required by U.S. tax law.
As such, the application of certain accounting guidance is currently evolving.
Further, compliance with the Tax Act and the accounting for certain provisions require accumulation of information not previously required or regularly produced.
As a result, we have provided a provisional estimate on the effect of the Tax Act in our financial statements.
As additional interpretative guidance is issued by the applicable authorities, we will
continue our analysis on the application of the Tax Act and will revise our current estimates in future periods.
The revisions to our current estimates could materially affect our results of operations, cash flow and financial position.
State of Oregon law and our charter documents contain provisions that could discourage or prevent a potential takeover, even if the transaction would benefit our shareholders
Other companies may seek to acquire or merge with us.
An acquisition or merger of our Company could result in benefits to our shareholders, including an increase in the value of our common stock.
Some provisions of our Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws, including our ability to issue preferred stock without further action by our shareholders, as well as provisions of the State of Oregon law, may discourage, delay or prevent a merger or acquisition that a shareholder may consider favorable.
