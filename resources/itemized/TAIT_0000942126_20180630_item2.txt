Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 



Use of Estimates - Management has made a number of estimates and assumptions relating to the reporting of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities to prepare our condensed consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. These estimates have a significant impact on our valuation and reserve accounts relating to the allowance for sales returns, doubtful accounts, inventory reserves and deferred income taxes. Actual results could differ from these estimates. 



Revenue Recognition – Revenue is recognized upon shipment of the products, which is when legal transfer of title occurs and control of the product is transferred to the customer. Reserves for sales allowances and customer returns are established based upon historical experience and our estimates of future returns. Sales returns for the three months ended June 30, 2018 and 2017 were $1,000 and $36,000, respectively and for the six months ended June 30, 2018 and 2017 were $3,000 and $148,000, respectively. The allowance for sales returns and doubtful accounts at June 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017 aggregated $43,000 and $40,000, respectively. 



Inventory – Inventory, consisting principally of products held for resale, is recorded at the lower of cost (determined using the first in-first out method) or net realizable value. We had inventory balances in the amount of $4,546,000 and $4,990,000 at June 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017, respectively, which is presented net of valuation allowances of $7,946,000 and $7,848,000, respectively. We evaluate inventories to identify excess, high-cost, slow-moving or other factors rendering inventories as unmarketable at normal profit margins. Due to the complexity of managing and maintaining a large inventory of product offerings, estimates are made regarding adjustments to the cost of inventories. Based on our assumptions about future demand and market conditions, inventories are carried at the lower of cost or net realizable value. If our assumptions about future demand change, or market conditions are less favorable than those projected, additional write-downs of inventories may be required. In any case, actual amounts could be different from those estimated. 



Overview 



We are primarily focused on supplying ODM products for our OEM customer’s multi-year turn-key projects. We also distribute discrete semiconductors, commodity Integrated Circuits (ICs), optoelectronic devices and passive components to other electronic distributors, CEMs and OEMs, who incorporate them in their products. 



Our core strategy has shifted to primarily focus on higher margin ODM Projects that require custom products designed for specific applications to OEM customers, and away from actively marketing our superstore strategy of maintaining a vast quantity of electronic components to fill customer orders immediately from available stock held in inventory. As a result, we expect our components inventory will be more passively marketed and distributed online for clearance through our internet sales portal, however at potentially lower rates due to the pricing pressures normally attributed with online shopping.

Index  



In accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, we have classified inventory as a current asset in our June 30, 2018, condensed consolidated financial statements representing approximately 49% of current assets and 34% of total assets. However, if all or a substantial portion of the inventory was required to be immediately liquidated, the inventory would not be as readily marketable or liquid as other items included or classified as a current asset, such as cash. We cannot assure you that demand in the discrete semiconductor market will increase and that market conditions will improve. Therefore, it is possible that further declines in our carrying values of inventory may result. 



Our gross profit margins are subject to a number of factors, including product demand, the relative strength of the U.S. dollar, provisions for inventory reserves, our ability to purchase inventory at favorable prices and our sales product mix. 



Results of Operations 



Second quarter of 2018 versus 2017. 



Net sales in the second quarter of 2018 totaled $2,150,000 versus $1,773,000 in the comparable period for 2017, an increase of $377,000 or 21.3% over the same period last year. The increase was driven by an increase of ODM project sales volume. 



Gross profit for the second quarter of 2018 was $979,000 versus $757,000 in the comparable period for 2018, and gross margin percentage of net sales was 45.5% in the second quarter of 2018 versus 42.7% in the comparable period for 2017. The gross profit increase was driven by an increase of ODM project sales unit pricing. 



Selling, general and administrative expenses in the second quarter of 2018 totaled $550,000 versus $542,000 in the comparable period for 2017. The increase was driven by increased professional fees incurred for engineering services for our products. 



Other income, net of other expense, in the second quarter of 2018 was $29,000 versus $31,000 in the comparable period for 2017. Other income was primarily derived from the rental income of excess office space at our headquarters in Valencia, CA. 



Income tax provision was $1,000 for the second quarter of 2018 and 2017, as we do not expect significant taxable income for the year ending December 31, 2018. 



Net income was $399,000 for the second quarter of 2018 versus $215,000 in the comparable period for 2017, an increase of $184,000 resulting from the reasons discussed above. 



Six Months Ended June 30, 2018 versus Six Months Ended June 30, 2017. 



Net sales in the six months ended June 30, 2018 was $3,805,000 versus $3,940,000 in the comparable period for 2017, a decrease of $135,000 or 3.4% over the same period last year. The decrease was driven by a decrease in demand for ODM components. 



Gross profit for the six months ended June 30, 2018 was $1,633,000 versus $1,630,000 in the comparable period for 2017, and gross margin percentage of net sales was approximately 42.9% for the six months ended June 30, 2018 and 41.4% for 2017, respectively. 



Selling, general and administrative expenses in the six months ended June 30, 2018 totaled $1,110,000 versus $1,082,000 in the comparable period for 2017. 



Interest expense, net of interest income, was $4,000 for the six months ended June 30, 2018 versus $20,000 in the comparable period for 2017. The decrease was driven by the reduction of outstanding debt obligations. See Note 4. 



Other income, net of other losses, in the six months ended June 30, 2017 was $77,000 versus $60,000 in the comparable period for 2017. Other income was primarily derived from the rental income of excess office space at our headquarters in Valencia, CA. 



Income tax provision was $3,000 for the six months ended June 30, 2018 versus $1,000 in 2017, as we do not expect significant taxable income for the year ending December 31, 2018. 



Net income was $458,000 for the six months ended June 30, 2018 versus $514,000 in the comparable period for 2017, a decrease of $56,000 resulting from the reasons discussed above.

Liquidity and Capital Resources 



We have financed our operations with funds generated from operating activities and borrowings under our revolving credit facility. 



Cash flows provided by operating activities were $785,000 as opposed to $70,000 in the six months ended June 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively. The increase of $715,000 in cash flows provided by operations compared with the prior period resulted from changes in operating assets and liabilities, primarily from inventory, accounts payables and accounts receivables compared to the prior period. 



Cash flows used for investing activities were $0 and $118,000 for the six months ended June 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively. 



Cash flows used for financing activities were $760,000 and $236,000 for the six months ended June 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively. 



Inventory is included in current assets; however, it will take over one year for the inventory to turn. Hence, inventory would not be as readily marketable or liquid as other items included in current assets, such as cash. 



We believe that funds generated from, or used in operations, in addition to existing cash balances are likely to be sufficient to finance our working capital and capital expenditure requirements for the foreseeable future. If these funds are not sufficient, we may secure new sources of short-term commercial loans, asset-based lending on accounts receivables or issue debt or equity securities. 



Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 



As of August 14, 2018, we had no off-balance sheet arrangements.
