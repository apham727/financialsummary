Notes to financial statements 



1. Description of business, including segment and geographic area information 



We design, make and sell semiconductors to electronics designers and manufacturers all over the world. We have two reportable segments, which are established along major categories of products as follows: 



•  



Analog – consisting of the following product lines: Power, Signal Chain and High Volume. 



•  



Embedded Processing – consisting of the following product lines: Connected Microcontrollers and Processors. 



We report the results of our remaining business activities in Other. Other includes operating segments that do not meet the quantitative thresholds for individually reportable segments and cannot be aggregated with other operating segments. Other includes DLP® products, calculators and custom ASIC products. 



Our centralized manufacturing and support organizations, such as facilities, procurement and logistics, provide support to our operating segments, including those in Other. Costs incurred by these organizations, including depreciation, are charged to the segments on a per-unit basis. Consequently, depreciation expense is not an independently identifiable component within the segments’ results and, therefore, is not provided. 



Segment information 



 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 



Geographic area information 



The following geographic area information includes revenue based on product shipment destination. The revenue information is not necessarily indicative of the geographic area in which the end applications containing our products are ultimately consumed because our products tend to be shipped to the locations where our customers manufacture their products. Specifically, many of our products are shipped to our customers in China who may include these parts in the manufacture of their own end products, which they may in turn export to their customers around the world.

2. Basis of presentation and significant accounting policies and practices 



Basis of presentation 



The consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (GAAP) and on the same basis as the audited financial statements included in our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018, except for the effects of adopting Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No. 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842). The Consolidated Statements of Income, Comprehensive Income and Cash Flows for the periods ended June 30, 2019 and 2018, and the Consolidated Balance Sheet as of June 30, 2019, are not audited but reflect all adjustments that are of a normal recurring nature and are necessary for a fair statement of the results of the periods shown. Certain information and note disclosures normally included in annual consolidated financial statements have been omitted pursuant to the rules and regulations of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. Because the consolidated interim financial statements do not include all of the information and notes required by GAAP for a complete set of financial statements, they should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and notes included in our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018. The results for the three- and six-month periods are not necessarily indicative of a full year’s results.  



Significant accounting policies and practices 



Leases 



We determine if an arrangement is a lease at inception. Leases are included in other long-term assets, accrued expenses and other liabilities, and other long-term liabilities on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. 



Lease assets represent our right to use underlying assets for the lease term, and lease liabilities represent our obligations to make lease payments over the lease term. On the commencement date, leases are evaluated for classification, and assets and liabilities are recognized based on the present value of lease payments over the lease term. We use our incremental borrowing rate based on the information available at commencement in determining the present value of lease payments. Operating lease expense is generally recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term. Our lease values include options to extend or not to terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain that we will exercise such options. 



We have agreements with lease and non-lease components, which are accounted for as a single lease component. Leases with a lease term of 12 months or less are not recorded on the balance sheet; we recognize lease expense for these leases on a straight-line basis over the lease term. 



Earnings per share (EPS) 



We use the two-class method for calculating EPS because the restricted stock units (RSUs) we grant are participating securities containing non-forfeitable rights to receive dividend equivalents. Under the two-class method, a portion of net income is allocated to RSUs and excluded from the calculation of income allocated to common stock, as shown in the table below.  



Computation and reconciliation of earnings per common share are as follows (shares in millions): 



 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 



7 



TEXAS INSTRUMENTS INCORPORATED AND SUBSIDIARIES  



 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 



Potentially dilutive securities representing 7 million and 5 million shares of common stock that were outstanding during the second quarters of 2019 and 2018, and 9 million and 5 million shares outstanding during the first six months of 2019 and 2018, respectively, were excluded from the computation of diluted earnings per common share during these periods because their effect would have been anti-dilutive. 



Derivatives and hedging 



We use derivative financial instruments to manage exposure to foreign exchange risk. These instruments are primarily forward foreign currency exchange contracts, which are used as economic hedges to reduce the earnings impact that exchange rate fluctuations may have on our non-U.S. dollar net balance sheet exposures. Gains and losses from changes in the fair value of these forward foreign currency exchange contracts are credited or charged to OI&E. We do not apply hedge accounting to our foreign currency derivative instruments. 



In connection with the issuance of long-term debt, we may use financial derivatives such as treasury-rate lock agreements that are recognized in AOCI and amortized over the life of the related debt. The results of these derivative transactions have not been material. 



We do not use derivatives for speculative or trading purposes. 



Fair values of financial instruments 



The fair values of our derivative financial instruments were not material as of June 30, 2019. Our investments in cash equivalents, short-term investments and certain long-term investments, as well as our deferred compensation liabilities, are carried at fair value. The carrying values for other current financial assets and liabilities, such as accounts receivable and accounts payable, approximate fair value due to the short maturity of such instruments. As of June 30, 2019, the carrying value of long-term debt, including the current portion, was $5.81 billion, and the estimated fair value was $6.14 billion. The estimated fair value is measured using broker-dealer quotes, which are Level 2 inputs. See Note 4 for a description of fair value and the definition of Level 2 inputs. 



Changes in accounting standards – adopted standards for current period 



ASU No. 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842) 



We adopted ASU No. 2016-02, Leases (ASC 842) effective January 1, 2019, using the modified retrospective transition method applied to leases existing at, or entered into after, the adoption date. The reported results for 2019 reflect the application of the new accounting guidance, while the reported results for prior periods are not adjusted and continue to be reported in accordance with our historical accounting under ASC 840, Leases. In addition, we elected the package of practical expedients permitted under the transition guidance that allowed us to apply prior conclusions related to lease definition, classification and initial direct costs. 



The adoption of the new standard resulted in the recognition of $229 million of lease liabilities with corresponding lease assets as of January 1, 2019. The standard did not materially impact our results of operations and had no impact on cash flows. 



Other standards 



The following standards were also adopted:

Changes in accounting standards – standards not yet adopted 



ASU No. 2016-13, Financial Instruments – Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments 



This standard requires entities to use a current lifetime expected credit loss methodology to measure impairments of certain financial assets. Using this methodology will result in earlier recognition of losses than under the current incurred loss approach, which requires waiting to recognize a loss until it is probable of being incurred. Credit losses relating to available-for-sale debt securities will be recorded through an allowance for credit losses rather than as a reduction to the amortized cost basis of the securities. We plan to adopt this standard when effective, beginning January 1, 2020, applying the guidance on a modified retrospective basis. We are currently evaluating the potential impact of this standard, but we do not expect it to have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations. 



Other standards 



We are evaluating the impact of the following standards, but we do not expect them to have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations. We plan to adopt these standards as of their effective dates.

3. Income taxes 



Our estimated annual effective tax rate is about 16%, which does not include discrete tax items. This differs from the 21% statutory corporate tax rate due to the effect of U.S. tax benefits.  



Provision for income taxes is based on the following: 



 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 



4. Valuation of debt and equity investments and certain liabilities 



Debt and equity investments measured at fair value 



Available-for-sale debt investments and trading securities are stated at fair value, which is generally based on market prices or broker quotes. See Fair-value considerations below. Unrealized gains and losses from available-for-sale debt securities are recorded as an increase or decrease, net of taxes, in AOCI on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. Other-than-temporary impairments on available-for-sale debt securities are recorded in OI&E in our Consolidated Statements of Income. 



We classify certain mutual funds as trading securities. These mutual funds hold a variety of debt and equity investments intended to generate returns that offset changes in certain deferred compensation liabilities. We record changes in the fair value of these mutual funds and the related deferred compensation liabilities in SG&A. 



Other equity investments 



Our other investments include equity-method investments and non-marketable equity investments, which are not measured at fair value. These investments consist of interests in venture capital funds and other non-marketable equity securities. Gains and losses from equity-method investments are recognized in OI&E based on our ownership share of the investee’s financial results. 



Non-marketable equity securities are measured at cost with adjustments for observable changes in price or impairments. Gains and losses on non-marketable equity investments are recognized in OI&E.

TEXAS INSTRUMENTS INCORPORATED AND SUBSIDIARIES  



Details of our investments are as follows: 



 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 



As of June 30, 2019 and December 31, 2018, unrealized gains and losses associated with our available-for-sale investments were not material. We did not recognize any credit losses related to available-for-sale investments for the first six months of 2019 and 2018. 



Proceeds from sales, redemptions and maturities of short-term available-for-sale investments were $200 million and $1.38 billion for the second quarters of 2019 and 2018, respectively, and $1.78 billion and $2.83 billion for the first six months of 2019 and 2018, respectively. Gross realized gains and losses from these sales were not material. 



The following table presents the aggregate maturities of our available-for-sale debt investments as of June 30, 2019: 



 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 



There were no other-than-temporary declines and impairments in the values of our debt investments in the first six months of 2019 or 2018. 



Fair-value considerations 



We measure and report certain financial assets and liabilities at fair value on a recurring basis. Fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. 



The three-level hierarchy discussed below indicates the extent and level of judgment used to estimate fair-value measurements. 



•  



Level 1 – Uses unadjusted quoted prices that are available in active markets for identical assets or liabilities as of the reporting date. 



•  



Level 2 – Uses inputs other than Level 1 that are either directly or indirectly observable as of the reporting date through correlation with market data, including quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets and quoted prices in markets that are not active. Level 2 also includes assets and liabilities that are valued using models or other pricing methodologies that do not require significant judgment since the input assumptions used in the models, such as interest rates and volatility factors, are corroborated by readily observable data. We utilize a third-party data service to provide Level 2 valuations. We verify these valuations for reasonableness relative to unadjusted quotes obtained from brokers or dealers based on observable prices for similar assets in active markets.

The following are our assets and liabilities that were accounted for at fair value on a recurring basis. These tables do not include cash on hand, assets held by our postretirement plans, or assets and liabilities that are measured at historical cost or any basis other than fair value. 



 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 



5. Goodwill and acquisition-related intangibles 



Goodwill was $4.36 billion as of June 30, 2019 and December 31, 2018. There was no impairment of goodwill during the first six months of 2019 or 2018. 



The components of acquisition-related intangibles are as follows: 



 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 



Acquisition charges 



Acquisition charges represent the ongoing amortization of intangible assets resulting from the acquisition of National Semiconductor Corporation. These amounts are included in Other for segment reporting purposes, consistent with how management measures the performance of its segments. 



Amortization of acquisition-related intangibles was $80 million and $79 million for the second quarters of 2019 and 2018, respectively, and $159 million for the first six months of both 2019 and 2018. Fully amortized assets are written off against accumulated amortization. 



6. Postretirement benefit plans 



Expense related to defined benefit and retiree health care benefit plans is as follows:

7. Debt and lines of credit 



Short-term borrowings 



We maintain a line of credit to support commercial paper borrowings, if any, and to provide additional liquidity through bank loans. As of June 30, 2019, we had a variable-rate revolving credit facility from a consortium of investment-grade banks that allows us to borrow up to $2 billion until March 2024. The interest rate on borrowings under this credit facility, if drawn, is indexed to the applicable London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR). As of June 30, 2019, our credit facility was undrawn, and we had no commercial paper outstanding. 



Long-term debt 



In the first quarter of 2019, we issued an aggregate principal amount of $750 million of fixed-rate, long-term debt due in 2039. We incurred $7 million of issuance and other related costs. We received $743 million in proceeds, net of the original issuance discount, to be used for general corporate purposes. 



Long-term debt outstanding is as follows: 



 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 



Interest and debt expense was $44 million and $30 million for the second quarters of 2019 and 2018, respectively, and $82 million and $53 million for the first six months of 2019 and 2018, respectively. This was net of the amortized discounts, premiums and issuance costs. Capitalized interest was not material.

9. Leases 



We conduct certain operations in leased facilities and also lease a portion of our data processing and other equipment. In addition, certain long-term supply agreements to purchase industrial gases are accounted for as operating leases. Lease agreements frequently include renewal provisions and require us to pay real estate taxes, insurance and maintenance costs.  



Our leases are included as a component of the following balance sheet lines: 



 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 



Details of our operating leases are as follows: 



 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 



The following table presents the maturities of lease liabilities as of June 30, 2019: 



 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 



10. Contingencies 



Indemnification guarantees 



We routinely sell products with an intellectual property indemnification included in the terms of sale. Historically, we have had only minimal, infrequent losses associated with these indemnities. Consequently, we cannot reasonably estimate any future liabilities that may result. 



Warranty costs/product liabilities 



We accrue for known product-related claims if a loss is probable and can be reasonably estimated. During the periods presented, there have been no material accruals or payments regarding product warranty or product liability. Historically, we have experienced a low rate of payments on product claims. Although we cannot predict the likelihood or amount of any future claims, we do not believe they will have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or liquidity. Our stated warranties for semiconductor products obligate us to repair, replace or credit the purchase price of a covered product back to the buyer. Product claim consideration may exceed the price of our products.

TEXAS INSTRUMENTS INCORPORATED AND SUBSIDIARIES  



General 



We are subject to various legal and administrative proceedings. Although it is not possible to predict the outcome of these matters, we believe that the results of these proceedings will not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or liquidity.  



11. Supplemental financial information 



Restructuring charges/other 



Restructuring charges/other are included in Other for segment reporting purposes. Changes in accrued restructuring balances are as follows: 



 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 



The restructuring accrual balances are reported as a component of either accrued expenses and other liabilities or other long-term liabilities on our Consolidated Balance Sheets, depending on the expected timing of payment. 



In April 2019, we sold our manufacturing facility in Greenock, Scotland. 



Details on amounts reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), net of taxes, to net income 



Our Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income include items that have been recognized within net income during the second quarters and first six months of 2019 and 2018. The table below details where these transactions are recorded in our Consolidated Statements of Income.
