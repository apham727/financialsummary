Qualitative and Quantitative Disclosures about Market Risk 

Foreign Currency 

We have foreign operations in The Netherlands, Sweden, Germany, China, Portugal, Canada and Mexico, which expose the Company to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations due to transactions denominated in Euros, Swedish Krona, Chinese Renminbi, Canadian dollar and Mexican pesos, respectively.
We continuously evaluate our foreign currency risk and will take action from time to time in order to best mitigate these risks.
A hypothetical 10% change in the value of the U.S. dollar in relation to our most significant foreign currency exposures would have had an impact of approximately $3,200 on our first quarter 2018 sales.
This amount is not indicative of the hypothetical net earnings impact due to partially offsetting impacts on cost of sales and operating expenses in those currencies.
We estimate that foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations during the quarter ended March 31, 2018 increased sales in comparison to quarter ended March 31, 2017 by approximately $4,000.
We translate all assets and liabilities of our foreign operations, where the U.S. dollar is not the functional currency, at the period-end exchange rate and translate sales and expenses at the average exchange rates in effect during the period.
The net effect of these translation adjustments is recorded in the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements as Comprehensive Income.
The translation adjustment was a gain of approximately $600 and $700 for the first quarter of 2018 and 2017, respectively.
Translation adjustments are not adjusted for income taxes as they relate to permanent investments in our foreign subsidiaries.
Net foreign currency transaction gains and losses included in other income, net amounted to a loss of $138 and $70 for the first quarter of 2018 and 2017, respectively.
A hypothetical 10% change in the value of the U.S. dollar in relation to our most significant foreign currency net assets would have had an impact of approximately $6,300 on our foreign net assets as of March 31, 2018.
Interest Rates 

Interest rates on our Revolving Facility are based on the LIBOR plus a margin of 1.00% to 2.25% (currently 1.50%) or the Prime Rate plus a margin of 0% to 1.25% (currently 0.50%), in each case depending on the Companys ratio of total funded indebtedness to Consolidated EBITDA.
We use interest rate derivatives to add stability to interest expense and to manage our exposure to interest rate movements.
We primarily use interest rate swaps as part of our interest rate risk management strategy.
Interest rate swaps designated as cash flow hedges involve the receipt of variable amounts from a counterparty in exchange for the Company making fixed-rate payments over the life of the agreements without exchange of the underlying notional amount.
During October 2013, the Company entered into two interest rate swaps with a combined notional of $25,000 (representing 50% of the Term Loan balance at that time) that amortize quarterly to a notional of $6,673 at maturity.
The notional amount changes over time as loan payments are made.
As a requirement of the debt refinance, one of the swaps was liquidated.
In February 2017, we entered into three interest rate swaps with a combined notional of $40,000 that matures in February 2022.
As of March 31, 2018, we had $63,462 outstanding under the Revolving Facility, of which $43,985 is currently being hedged.
Refer to Note 10 of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information about our outstanding debt.
A hypothetical one percentage point (100 basis points) change in the Base Rate on the $18,943 of unhedged floating rate debt outstanding at March 31, 2018 would have an impact of approximately $49 on our interest expense for the first quarter 2018.

Controls and Procedures 

Conclusion regarding the effectiveness of disclosure controls and procedures 

Our management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer (principal accounting officer), evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act)) as of March 31, 2018.
Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.
Management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives and management necessarily applies its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures.
Based on managements evaluation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of March 31, 2018, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that, as of such date, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective.
Changes in internal control over financial reporting 

The Company implemented a financial reporting system, Hyperion Financial Management (HFM), as part of a multi-year plan to integrate and upgrade our systems and processes.
The implementation occurred in phases throughout 2017 and was substantially completed in the fourth quarter of 2017.
The Company utilized and relied on HFM during the first quarter of 2018.
As a result of the HFM implementation, certain changes to our processes and procedures have and will continue to occur.
These changes will result in changes to our internal control over financial reporting.
While HFM is designed to strengthen our internal financial controls by automating certain manual processes and standardizing business processes and reporting across our organization, management will continue to evaluate and monitor our internal controls as each of the affected areas evolve.
During the quarter ended March 31, 2018, with the exception of the addition of the Maval OE Steering business, there have been no other changes in our internal control over financial reporting that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
Note regarding acquisition 

In making our assessment of the Companys internal control over financial reporting as of March 31, 2018, we have excluded the operations of the Maval OE Steering business.
We are currently assessing the control environment of this acquired business.
Our consolidated financial statements reflect the Maval OE Steering business results of operations from January 19, 2018.
