are long and the time from being selected for the solution development to full rate production can be longer, yet we believe we are building a scalable foundation which can deliver strong returns on those investments.
Operating Results
Quarter ended March 31, 2018 compared to quarter ended March 31, 2017
Table of Contents
Sales to U.S. customers were 53% of total sales for the quarter compared with 54% for the same period last year, with the balance of sales to customers primarily in Europe, Canada and Asia.
The overall increase in revenue was due to an 18% volume increase and a 7% favorable currency impact.
Non-GAAP Measures
EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are provided for information purposes only and are not measures of financial performance under GAAP.
Management believes the presentation of these financial measures reflecting non-GAAP adjustments provides important supplemental information in evaluating the operating results of the Company as distinct from results that include items that are not indicative of ongoing operating results; in particular, those charges and credits that are not directly related to operating unit performance, and that are not a helpful measure of the performance of our underlying business particularly in light of their unpredictable nature.
This non-GAAP disclosure has limitations as an analytical tool, should not be viewed as a substitute for net income determined in accordance with GAAP, and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of the Companys results as reported under GAAP, nor is it necessarily comparable to non-GAAP performance measures that may be presented by other companies.
In addition, supplemental presentation should not be construed as an inference that the Companys future results will be unaffected by similar adjustments to net income determined in accordance with GAAP.
Table of Contents
The Company believes EBITDA is often a useful measure of a Companys operating performance and is a significant basis used by the Companys management to measure the operating performance of the Companys business because EBITDA excludes charges for depreciation, amortization and interest expense that have resulted from our debt financings, as well as our provision for income tax expense.
EBITDA is frequently used as one of the bases for comparing businesses in the Companys industry.
The Company also believes that Adjusted EBITDA provides helpful information about the operating performance of its business.
Adjusted EBITDA excludes stock compensation expense, as well as certain income or expenses which are not indicative of the ongoing performance of the Company.
EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA do not represent and should not be considered as an alternative to net income, operating income, net cash provided by operating activities or any other measure for determining operating performance or liquidity that is calculated in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
The Companys liquidity position as measured by cash and cash equivalents decreased by $2,587 to a balance of $13,003 at March 31, 2018 from December 31, 2017.
The decrease in operating cash flows during the first quarter of 2018 compared to 2017 is due to increased working capital needs, related to both the acquisition of the Mavel OE Steering business, and organic growth.
The significant cash used in investing activities in 2018 reflects the acquisition the Mavel OE Steering business during the quarter.
Also during the first quarter of 2018, purchases of property and equipment were $2,222 compared to $1,288 for the first quarter of 2017.
Capital expenditures are expected to increase throughout 2018 to support our new contract wins along with our continued IT infrastructure enhancements.
The change in cash used in financing activities reflects the 2018 use of the revolver to partially finance the acquisition of the Mavel OE Steering business.
Also, during the first quarter of 2018, we made payments of $4,350 for our Revolving Facility, including $1,850 to completely pay off our foreign revolver.
At March 31, 2018, we had $63,462 of obligations under the Revolving Facility.
The Credit Agreement contains certain financial covenants related to minimum interest coverage and total leverage ratio at the end of each quarter.
The Credit Agreement also includes other covenants and restrictions, including limits on the amount
