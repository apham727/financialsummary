Qualitative and Quantitative Disclosures about Market Risk
Foreign Currency
We have foreign operations in The Netherlands, Sweden, Germany, China, Portugal, Czech Republic, Canada and Mexico, which expose the Company to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations due to transactions denominated in Euros, Swedish Krona, Chinese Renminbi, Czech Krona, Canadian dollar and Mexican pesos, respectively.
We continuously evaluate our foreign currency risk and will take action from time to time in order to best mitigate these risks.
A hypothetical 10% change in the value of the U.S. dollar in relation to our most significant foreign currency exposures would have had an impact of approximately $3,100 on our third quarter 2018 sales and $9,700 on our sales for the nine months ended September 30, 2018.
This amount is not indicative of the hypothetical net earnings impact due to partially offsetting impacts on cost of sales and operating expenses in those currencies.
We estimate that foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations during the quarter ended September 30, 2018 decreased sales in comparison to quarter ended September 30, 2017 by approximately $700.
For the nine months ended September 30, 2018 we estimate that foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations increased sales by approximately $5,500 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2017.
We translate all assets and liabilities of our foreign operations, where the U.S. dollar is not the functional currency, at the period-end exchange rate and translate sales and expenses at the average exchange rates in effect during the period.
The net effect of these translation adjustments is recorded in the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements as Comprehensive Income.
The translation adjustment was a loss of approximately $300 and a gain of approximately $1,800 for the third quarter of 2018 and 2017, respectively.
For the nine months ended September 30, 2018 and 2017, the translation adjustment was a loss of approximately $2,100 and a gain of approximately $5,600, respectively.
Translation adjustments are not adjusted for income taxes as they relate to permanent investments in our foreign subsidiaries.
Net foreign currency transaction gains and losses included in other income, net amounted to approximately a gain of $20 and a loss of $100 for the third quarter of 2018 and 2017, respectively.
For the nine months ended September 30, 2018 and 2017, net foreign currency transaction gains and losses included in other income, net were approximately a gain of $200 and a loss of $300, respectively.
A hypothetical 10% change in the value of the U.S. dollar in relation to our most significant foreign currency net assets would have had an impact of approximately $6,100 on our foreign net assets as of September 30, 2018.
Interest Rates
Interest rates on our Revolving Facility are based on the LIBOR plus a margin of 1.00% to 2.25% (currently 1.50%) or the Prime Rate plus a margin of 0% to 1.25% (currently 0.50%), in each case depending on the CompanyÂ’s ratio of total funded indebtedness to Consolidated EBITDA.
We use interest rate derivatives to add stability to interest expense and to manage our exposure to interest rate movements.
We primarily use interest rate swaps as part of our interest rate risk management strategy.
Interest rate swaps designated as cash flow hedges involve the receipt of variable amounts from a counterparty in exchange for the Company making fixed-rate payments over the life of the agreements without exchange of the underlying notional amount.
During October 2013, the Company entered into two interest rate swaps with a combined notional of $25,000 that amortized quarterly to a notional of $6,673 at the September 2018 maturity.
Neither of these interest rate swaps is currently active, one was liquidated as part of the 2016 debt refinancing and the other matured in September 2018.
In February 2017, we entered into three interest rate swaps with a combined notional of $40,000 that matures in February 2022 As of September 30, 2018, we had $62,480 outstanding under the Revolving Facility, of which $40,000 is currently being hedged.
Refer to Note 10 of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information about our outstanding debt.
A hypothetical one percentage point (100 basis points) change in the Base Rate on the $22,480 of unhedged floating rate debt outstanding at September 30, 2018 would have an impact of approximately $60 on our interest expense for the third quarter 2018 and $200 on our interest expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2018.
