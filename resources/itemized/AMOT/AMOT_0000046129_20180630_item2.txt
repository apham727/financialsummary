Readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these forward- looking statements as a prediction of actual results. Any forward-looking statement speaks only as of the date on which it is made. New risks and uncertainties arise over time, and it is not possible for us to predict the occurrence of those matters or the manner in which they may affect us. The Company has no obligation or intent to release publicly any revisions to any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events, or otherwise. 



New risk factors emerge from time to time and it is not possible for management to predict all such risk factors, nor can it assess the impact of all such risk factors on its business or the extent to which any factor, or combination of factors, may cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statements. The Companys expectations, beliefs and projections are believed to have a reasonable basis; however, the Company makes no assurance that expectations, beliefs or projections will be achieved.

Non-GAAP Measures 



EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are provided for information purposes only and are not measures of financial performance under GAAP. 



Management believes the presentation of these financial measures reflecting non-GAAP adjustments provides important supplemental information in evaluating the operating results of the Company as distinct from results that include items that are not indicative of ongoing operating results; in particular, those charges and credits that are not directly related to operating unit performance, and that are not a helpful measure of the performance of our underlying business particularly in light of their unpredictable nature. This non-GAAP disclosure has limitations as an analytical tool, should not be viewed as a substitute for net income determined in accordance with GAAP, and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of the Companys results as reported under GAAP, nor is it necessarily comparable to non-GAAP performance measures that may be presented by other companies. In addition, supplemental presentation should not be construed as an inference that the Companys future results will be unaffected by similar adjustments to net income determined in accordance with GAAP. 



The Company believes EBITDA is often a useful measure of a Companys operating performance and is a significant basis used by the Companys management to measure the operating performance of the Companys business because EBITDA excludes charges for depreciation, amortization and interest expense that have resulted from our debt financings, as well as our provision for income tax expense. EBITDA is frequently used as one of the bases for comparing businesses in the Companys industry. 



The Company also believes that Adjusted EBITDA provides helpful information about the operating performance of its business. Adjusted EBITDA excludes stock compensation expense, as well as certain income or expenses which are not indicative of the ongoing performance of the Company. EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA do not represent and should not be considered as an alternative to net income, operating income, net cash provided by operating activities or any other measure for determining operating performance or liquidity that is calculated in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.

Liquidity and Capital Resources 



The Companys liquidity position as measured by cash and cash equivalents decreased by $261 to a balance of $15,329 at June 30, 2018 from December 31, 2017. 





Operating cash flow is flat for the six months ended June 30, 2018 compared to 2017. The increase in net income in 2018 is offset by increases in working capital needs due to the Maval OE Steering business acquisition and Company growth. 



The significant cash used in investing activities in 2018 reflects the acquisition the Maval OE Steering business during the quarter. Also during the six months ended June 30, 2018, purchases of property and equipment were $5,555 compared to $2,677 for the six months ended June 30, 2017. Capital expenditures are expected to increase throughout 2018 to support our new contract wins along with our continued IT infrastructure enhancements. The Company expects to invest between $13 million and $16 million in capital expenditures during 2018. 



The change in cash used in financing activities reflects the 2018 use of the revolver to partially finance the acquisition of the Maval OE Steering business. During the second quarter 2018, we utilized our foreign revolver to make a $1,500 capital investment into our Changzhou operation to fund expansion and future capital spending in support of recently announced contract wins. During the six months ended June 30, 2018, we made payments of $2,500 for our Revolving Facility obligation compared to $6,000 for the same period in 2017. At June 30, 2018, we had $64,982 of obligations under the Revolving Facility. 



The Credit Agreement contains certain financial covenants related to minimum interest coverage and total leverage ratio at the end of each quarter. The Credit Agreement also includes other covenants and restrictions, including limits on the amount of additional indebtedness, and restrictions on the ability to merge, consolidate or sell all or substantially all our assets. We were in compliance with all covenants at June 30, 2018. 



As of June 30, 2018, the amount available to borrow under the Credit Agreement was approximately $60,018. 



There were no additional borrowings for the China Facility balance for during the six months ended June 30, 2018 from December 31, 2017. The balance at June 30, 2018 was $453 (RMB 3,000), and the available borrowings were approximately $1,058 (RMB 7,000).
