ITEM 1A.
RISK FACTORS
Refer to the description of the risk factors associated with our business previously disclosed in Item 1A of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended January 27, 2019.
There have been no material changes from the risk factors previously described under Item 1A of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended January 27, 2019 and Item 1A of our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended April 28, 2019.
Before you buy our common stock, you should know that making such an investment involves some risks including, but not limited to, the risks described in Item 1A of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended January 27, 2019 and Item 1A of our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended April 28, 2019.
Additionally, any one of those risks could harm our business, financial condition and results of operations, which could cause our stock price to decline.
Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also impair our business operations.
ITEM 2.
UNREGISTERED SALES OF EQUITY SECURITIES AND USE OF PROCEEDS
Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities
Beginning August 2004, our Board of Directors authorized us to repurchase our stock.
Since the inception of our share repurchase program, we have repurchased an aggregate of 260 million shares under our share repurchase program for a total cost of $7.08 billion through July 28, 2019.
All shares delivered from these repurchases have been placed into treasury stock.
As of July 28, 2019, we were authorized to repurchase additional shares of our common stock up to $7.24 billion through December 2022.
The repurchases can be made in the open market, in privately negotiated transactions, or in structured share repurchase programs, and can be made in one or more larger repurchases.
The program does not obligate NVIDIA to acquire any particular amount of common stock and the program may be suspended at any time at our discretion.
We previously communicated our intent to return $3.00 billion to shareholders by the end of fiscal year 2020, including $700 million in share repurchases made during the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2019.
In the first half of fiscal year 2020, we returned $195 million in quarterly cash dividends.
We had no share repurchases during the first half of fiscal year 2020.
We intend to return the remaining $2.11 billion through a combination of share repurchases and cash dividends.
We do not expect to repurchase shares prior to the close of the acquisition of Mellanox, and therefore the intended repurchases may extend into fiscal year 2021.
Restricted Stock Unit Share Withholding
We also withhold common stock shares associated with net share settlements to cover tax withholding obligations upon the vesting of restricted stock unit awards under our employee equity incentive program.
During the second quarter of fiscal year 2020, we withheld approximately 0.3 million shares at a total cost of $50 million through net share settlements.
During the first half of fiscal year 2020, we withheld approximately 1.5 million shares at a total cost of $261 million through net share settlements.
Refer to Note 4 of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion regarding our equity incentive plans.
