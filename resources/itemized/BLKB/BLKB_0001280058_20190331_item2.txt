Four-Point Growth Strategy
1.Deliver Integrated and Open Solutions in the Cloud
During the first quarter of 2019, we announced the U.S. launch of Blackbaud Peer-to-Peer Fundraising, powered by JustGiving.
This new solution enables all social good organizations to empower supporters to fundraise on their behalf.
The launch elevates our peer-to-peer portfolio by providing our best-in-class cloud solution at no subscription cost.
We also introduced Blackbaud Purchase Cards integrated with Expense Management in Financial Edge NXT providing social good organizations with an efficient and convenient alternative to traditional procurement methods and paper-based payables processes such as checks, purchase orders, and invoices.
The result for our customers is decentralized daily purchasing while implementing and monitoring the right controls in a scalable way, enabling them to realize benefits such as reductions in procurement cycle time, increased savings through supplier discounts, and working capital and cash flow improvements.
We continue to progress in our early adopter program for our new Cloud Solution for Faith Communities with our first wave of early adopter customers now live on our Church Management Solution using it to run their day-to-day operations in close collaboration with our product teams.
The market response to our expanded Education Management portfolio for Higher Education has been positive, with Blackbaud SKY enabling us to extend our proven K-12 Private School solutions up-market.
Our Education Management portfolio consists of Student Information, Learning Management, Tuition Management as well as Financial Edge NXT and Raiser's Edge NXT.
We continue to build on our partnership with Microsoft to jointly-develop, co-market and co-sell innovative software technology that will advance the industry.
Our first jointly-developed solution, Nonprofit Resource Management, is currently in development, and we are working in close collaboration with early adopters.
First Quarter 2019 Form 10-Q23
Blackbaud, Inc.
Selling modern, integrated cloud-solutions that are purpose-built for our customers' needs is a key competitive differentiator for our sales teams.
We spent much of 2018 working to simplify our program and refine our methodology and approach in a uniform way to better enable our salespeople with process and practice.
In the second half of 2018, we ramped our direct sales hiring more significantly than in the past and those new hires are progressing well towards targeted productivity.
We expect to continue making investments during the remainder of 2019 and beyond.
During the first quarter of 2019, we implemented a common sales leadership framework across the Company, providing our sales managers with best practice tools and training necessary to be successful.
With the sales structure transformation now largely done, the focus going forward will be adding additional sales headcount and improving productivity.
3.Expand TAM into Near Adjacencies through Acquisitions and Product Investments
We are continuing to expand our total addressable market ("TAM") into new and near adjacencies with acquisitions and product investments.
In January 2019, we added another half-billion dollars in TAM when we completed our acquisition of YourCause, an industry leader in enterprise corporate social responsibility and employee engagement technology.
Adding YourCause’s capabilities in workplace giving and volunteering to Blackbaud’s cloud software platform, data intelligence, services and expertise in philanthropy and engagement is expected to drive effectiveness for companies and the broader social good community.
Our TAM now stands at over $10 billion, and we remain active in the evaluation of opportunities to further expand our addressable market through acquisitions and internal product development.
We are focused on operational efficiency to strengthen the business and position us for long-term success.
We continue to execute a comprehensive workplace and workforce strategy, driving towards a more scalable operating model that creates efficiency and consistency in how we execute through infrastructure investments, productivity initiatives, and organizational re-alignments.
We have continued executing against our workplace strategy, working to replace and upgrade some of our existing offices and expand our footprint into new locations for customer facing roles.
This has been a multi-year program for us, and we expect to be largely complete by the end of 2019.
The increase in total revenue during the three months ended March 31, 2019, when compared to the same period in 2018, was primarily driven by growth in recurring revenue as we continue to see positive demand from customers across our portfolio of cloud-based solutions.
The acquisitions of Reeher and YourCause, which occurred after March 31, 2018, also contributed to the increases in recurring and total revenue.
As expected, one-time services and other revenue declined $5.6 million during the three months ended March 31, 2019 due to our continued shift in focus towards selling cloud-based subscription solutions.
In general, our cloud-based solutions include integrated analytics, training and payments services, and require less implementation services and little to no customization services.
We are also selling more subscription-based contracts for professional services and services embedded in our renewable cloud-based solution contracts.
As a result, we continue to expect one-time services and other revenue to decline.
24First Quarter 2019 Form 10-Q
Blackbaud, Inc.
Income from operations decreased during the three months ended March 31, 2019, when compared to the same period in 2018.
The positive impact of growth in total revenue driven by recurring subscriptions was offset primarily by investments we are making in our sales organization and innovation, which we expect to continue in 2019 and beyond.
Increases in stock-based compensation of $2.6 million, employee severance of $2.5 million, rent expense of $1.6 million, restructuring costs of $1.1 million and amortization of intangible assets from business combinations of $1.1 million also negatively impacted income from operations during the three months ended March 31, 2019.
The increase in stock-based compensation expense was primarily driven by an increase in the grant date fair value of our annual equity awards granted to employees during the first quarter of 2019, when compared to the grant date fair value of the awards granted during the same period in 2018.
The increase in rent expense was primarily associated with the lease for our New Headquarters Facility in Charleston, South Carolina, which commenced in April 2018.
Customer retention
Our recurring revenue contracts are generally for a term of three years at contract inception with one to three-year renewals thereafter.
We anticipate a continued decrease in maintenance contract renewals as we transition our solution portfolio and maintenance customers from a perpetual license-based model to a cloud-based subscription delivery model.
In the long term, we also anticipate an increase in recurring subscription contract renewals as we continue focusing on innovation, quality and the integration of our cloud-based solutions, which we believe will provide value-adding capabilities to better address our customers' needs.
Due primarily to these factors, we believe a recurring revenue customer retention measure that combines recurring subscription, maintenance and service customer contracts provides a better representation of our customers' overall behavior.
For the twelve months ended March 31, 2019, approximately 92% of our customers with recurring revenue contracts were retained.
This customer retention rate is unchanged from our rate for the full year ended December 31, 2018 and modestly lower than our historical customer retention rates driven by our efforts to rationalize our portfolio of solutions and migrate customers from legacy solutions towards our next generation cloud-based solutions.
We are investing in innovation and our customer success program, which we believe will increase customer retention over the long-term.
Balance sheet and cash flow
At March 31, 2019, our cash and cash equivalents were $25.2 million and the carrying amount of our debt under the 2017 Credit Facility was $583.6 million.
Our net leverage ratio was 2.98 to 1.00.
During the three months ended March 31, 2019, we used $10.0 million in cash for operations, had a net increase in our borrowings of $196.3 million, which was primarily used to finance the acquisition of YourCause, returned $5.9 million to stockholders by way of dividends and had aggregate cash outlays of $12.5 million for purchases of property and equipment and capitalized software development costs.
Adoption of new lease accounting standard
On January 1, 2019, we adopted ASU 2016-02, using the transition method that allowed us to initially apply the guidance at the adoption date of January 1, 2019 without adjusting comparative periods presented.
Adopting ASU 2016-02 had a material impact on our consolidated balance sheet as as we recognized lease liabilities and ROU assets for those leases classified as operating leases.
The impacts of adoption are reflected in the financial information herein.
For additional information regarding the impact of our adoption of ASU 2016-02, see See Notes 2 and 10 of our consolidated financial statements in this report.

Blackbaud, Inc.
Results of Operations
Comparison of the three months ended March 31, 2019 and 2018
We have included the results of operations of YourCause in our consolidated results of operations from the date of acquisition.
We determined that the YourCause acquisition was not a material business combination; therefore, separate presentation of revenue and earnings since the acquisition date are not required nor included herein.
Operating results
Recurring revenue is comprised of fees for the use of our subscription-based software solutions, which includes providing access to cloud-based solutions, hosting services, online training programs, subscription-based analytic services, such as donor acquisitions and data enrichment, and payment services.
Recurring revenue also includes fees from maintenance services for our on-premises solutions, services included in our renewable subscription contracts, subscription-based contracts for professional services and variable transaction revenue associated with the use of our solutions.
Cost of recurring revenue is primarily comprised of compensation costs for customer support and production IT personnel, third-party contractor expenses, third-party royalty and data expenses, hosting expenses, allocated depreciation, facilities and IT support costs, amortization of intangible assets from business combinations, amortization of software development costs, transaction-based costs related to payments services including remittances of amounts due to third-parties and other costs incurred in providing support and recurring services to our customers.
We continue to experience growth in sales of our cloud-based solutions as we meet the demand of our customers that increasingly prefer cloud-based subscription offerings with integrated analytics, training and payment services.
Recurring subscription contracts are typically for a term of three years at contract inception with one to three-year renewals thereafter.
We intend to continue focusing on innovation, quality and integration of our cloud-based solutions, which we believe will drive future revenue growth.
The increase in recurring revenue during the three months ended March 31, 2019, when compared to the same period in 2018, was primarily due to positive demand across our portfolio of cloud-based solutions as revenue from subscriptions increased $21.8 million.
The inclusion of Reeher and YourCause contributed to the increase in recurring revenue as both acquisitions were completed after March 31, 2018.
We also saw increases in revenue from subscription-based professional services as well as services embedded in our renewable cloud-based solution contracts.
These favorable impacts from subscriptions were partially offset by a decrease in maintenance revenue of $4.5 million during the three months ended March 31, 2019, when compared to the same period in 2018.
The decrease in maintenance revenue was primarily related to our efforts to migrate customers from legacy on-premises solutions onto our solutions powered by Blackbaud SKY, our modern cloud platform.
The increase in cost of recurring revenue during the three months ended March 31, 2019, when compared to the same period in 2018, was primarily due to increases in transaction-based costs of $4.3 million, related to payment services integrated in our cloud-based solutions, allocations of depreciation, facilities and IT support costs of $2.5 million, compensation costs of $2.4 million, data center costs of $2.0 million and amortization of software development costs of $1.0 million.
The growth in compensation costs was primarily attributable to an increasing portion of our resources now providing subscription-based professional services as opposed to one-time.
The inclusion of Reeher and YourCause also contributed to the increase in cost of recurring revenue during the three months ended March 31, 2019 when compared
26First Quarter 2019 Form 10-Q
Blackbaud, Inc.
to the same period in 2018.
The increase in amortization of software development costs was primarily due to investments made on innovation, quality and the integration of our cloud-based solutions.
The decrease in recurring gross margin for the three months ended March 31, 2019, when compared to the same period in 2018, was primarily the result of incremental costs associated with our continued shift toward cloud-based solutions, including compensation costs, hosting and data center costs, and amortization of software development costs, as well as a one-time third-party refund related to our integrated payment services during the three months ended March 31, 2018 that did not recur in 2019.
One-time services and other revenue is comprised of fees for one-time consulting, analytic and onsite training services, as well as revenue from the sale of our software sold under perpetual license arrangements, fees from user conferences and third-party software referral fees.
Cost of one-time services and other is primarily comprised of compensation costs for professional services and onsite training personnel, other costs incurred in providing onsite customer training, third-party contractor expenses, data expense incurred to perform one-time analytic services, third-party software royalties, costs of user conferences, allocated depreciation, facilities and IT support costs and amortization of intangible assets from business combinations.
One-time services and other revenue decreased during the three months ended March 31, 2019, when compared to the same period in 2018, primarily due to decreases in one-time consulting revenue of $3.8 million and analytics revenue of $1.0 million.
We expect that the shift in our go-to-market strategy towards cloud-based subscription offerings, which generally include integrated analytics and require less implementation and customization services, will continue to negatively impact one-time services and other revenue.
We also continue to sell more subscription-based contracts for professional services and services embedded in our renewable cloud-based solution contracts, both of which are recorded as recurring revenue.
Cost of one-time services and other decreased during the three months ended March 31, 2019, when compared to the same period in 2018, primarily due to a decrease in compensation costs of $3.0 million, which is in line with the ongoing shift in our go-to-market strategy as discussed above as an increasing portion of our resources are now providing subscription-based professional services as opposed to one-time.
One-time services and other gross margin decreased during the three months ended March 31, 2019, when compared to the same period in 2018, as the declines in one-time consulting revenue and higher margin analytics revenue associated with the shift in our go-to-market strategy outpaced the reductions in costs of one-time services and other discussed above.
This is a trend we expect to continue in the near term as we complete the transition of our solution portfolio to a cloud-based subscription delivery model.

Operating expenses
Sales, marketing, and customer success expense includes compensation costs, variable-sales commissions, travel-related expenses, advertising and marketing materials, public relations costs, variable reseller commissions and allocated depreciation, facilities and IT support costs.
We continue to make investments to drive sales effectiveness, which is a component of our four-point growth strategy.
The increase in sales, marketing and customer success expense in dollars and as a percentage of total revenue during the three months ended March 31, 2019, when compared to the same period in 2018, was primarily due to increases in compensation costs of $6.5 million and commissions expense of $1.3 million.
Compensation costs increased as a result of our efforts during the second half of 2018 to increase our direct sales force and we expect to continue making investments during the remainder of 2019 and beyond.
These incremental investments are intended to address the large market opportunity that we see for ourselves and fuel future revenue growth.
In addition, compensation costs increased due to incremental headcount associated with the inclusion of Reeher and YourCause.
The increase in commission expense was primarily driven by an increase in commissionable sales.
Research and development expense includes compensation costs for engineering and product management personnel, third-party contractor expenses, software development tools and other expenses related to developing new solutions, upgrading and enhancing existing solutions, and allocated depreciation, facilities and IT support costs.
We continue to make investments to deliver integrated and open solutions in the cloud, which is a component of our four-point growth strategy.
The increase in research and development expense in dollars and as a percentage of total revenue during the three months ended March 31, 2019, when compared to the same period in 2018, was primarily due to increases in compensation costs of $3.3 million and third-party contractor expenses of $1.1 million.
The increases in compensation costs were primarily associated with the inclusion of Reeher's and YourCause's engineering resources.
The incremental third-party contractor expenses were intended to help drive our solution development efforts, including our new Cloud Solutions for Faith Communities and Higher Education and the Integrated Cloud Initiative for Nonprofits.
The increase in research and development expense dollars was partially offset by an increase in the amount of software development costs that were required to be capitalized under the internal-use software guidance.
We expect that the amount of software development costs capitalized will continue to increase modestly in the near-term as we make investments in innovation, quality and the integration of our solutions, which we believe will drive long-term revenue growth.
28First Quarter 2019 Form 10-Q
Blackbaud, Inc.
General and administrative expense consists primarily of compensation costs for general corporate functions, including senior management, finance, accounting, legal, human resources and corporate development, third-party professional fees, insurance, allocated depreciation, facilities and IT support costs, acquisition-related expenses and other administrative expenses.
The increase in general and administrative expense in dollars and as a percentage of total revenue during the three months ended March 31, 2019, when compared to the same period in 2018, was primarily due to increases in rent expense of $1.5 million, associated with the lease for our New Headquarters Facility in Charleston, South Carolina, which commenced in April 2018, and compensation costs of $0.8 million.
The increase in compensation costs was primarily related to stock-based compensation and our acquisition of YourCause.
Restructuring
During 2017, in an effort to further our organizational objectives including, improved operating efficiency, customer outcomes and employee satisfaction, we initiated a multi-year plan to consolidate and relocate some of our existing offices to highly modern and more collaborative workspaces with short-term financial commitments.
These workspaces are also more centrally located for our employees and closer to our customers and prospects.
Restructuring costs incurred prior to our adoption of ASU 2016-02 on January 1, 2019 consisted primarily of costs to terminate lease agreements, contractual lease payments, net of estimated sublease income, upon vacating space as part of the plan, as well as insignificant costs to relocate affected employees and write-off facilities-related fixed assets that we would no longer use.
Upon adoption of ASU 2016-02 at January 1, 2019, we reduced our operating lease ROU assets recognized at transition by the carrying amounts of the restructuring liabilities for certain leased office spaces that we ceased using prior to December 31, 2018.
See additional details below.
Restructuring costs incurred during the three months ended March 31, 2019 consisted primarily of operating lease ROU asset impairment costs and, to a lesser extent, write-offs of facilities-related fixed assets that we will no longer use.
We currently expect to incur before-tax restructuring costs associated with these activities of between $8.5 million and $9.5 million, of which $7.3 million has been incurred as of March 31, 2019, with substantially all of the remaining costs expected to be incurred by the end of 2019.
These restructuring activities are currently expected to result in improved operating efficiencies and future annual before-tax savings of between $5.0 million and $6.0 million beginning in 2020.
First Quarter 2019 Form 10-Q29
Blackbaud, Inc.
Interest expense increased during the three months ended March 31, 2019, when compared to the same period in 2018, primarily due to increases in our average daily borrowings related to our acquisitions of Reeher in April 2018 and YourCause in January 2019.
Also contributing to the increases in interest expense during the three months ended March 31, 2019 were modest increases in our weighted average effective interest rates.
Deferred revenue
To the extent that our customers are billed for our solutions and services in advance of delivery, we record such amounts in deferred revenue.
Our recurring revenue contracts are generally for a term of three years at contract inception with one to three-year renewals thereafter, billed annually in advance and non-cancelable.
We generally invoice our customers with recurring revenue contracts in annual cycles 30 days prior to the end of the contract term.
Deferred revenue from recurring revenue contracts decreased modestly during the three months ended March 31, 2019, primarily due to less customer contract renewals due to the timing of customer budget cycles.
Historically, we have an increase in customer contract renewals near the beginning of our third quarter resulting in lower deferred revenue at the end of our first quarter.
Deferred revenue from one-time services and other increased during the three months ended March 31, 2019, primarily due to a modest increase in onsite training sales.
We have acquired businesses whose net tangible assets include deferred revenue.
In accordance with GAAP reporting requirements, we recorded write-downs of deferred revenue from customer arrangements predating the acquisition to fair value, which resulted in lower recorded deferred revenue as of the acquisition date than the actual amounts paid in advance for solutions and services under those customer arrangements.
Therefore, our deferred revenue after an acquisition will not reflect the full amount of deferred revenue that would have been reported if the acquired deferred revenue was
30First Quarter 2019 Form 10-Q
Blackbaud, Inc.
not written down to fair value.
Further explanation of this impact is included below under the caption "Non-GAAP financial measures".
We compute the year-to-date income tax provision by applying the estimated annual effective tax rate to the year-to-date pre-tax income or loss and adjusting for discrete tax items in the period.
Our effective income tax rate can be more or less volatile based on the amount of pre-tax income or loss.
For example, the impact of discrete items and non-deductible expenses on our effective tax rate is greater when our pre-tax income is lower.
The increase in our effective income tax rate during the three months ended March 31, 2019, when compared to the same period in 2018, was partially attributable to the impact of discrete tax benefits on a pre-tax loss for the quarter as compared to pre-tax income for the same period in 2018.
The increase in our effective income tax rate during the three months ended March 31, 2019, when compared to the same period in 2018, was also due to a decrease in the discrete benefit to income tax expense relating to stock-based compensation.
The impact was attributable to a decrease in the market price for shares of our common stock, when compared to the same period in 2018, as reported by Nasdaq.
Most of our equity awards are granted during our first quarter and vest in subsequent years during the same quarter.
First Quarter 2019 Form 10-Q31
Blackbaud, Inc.
Non-GAAP financial measures
The operating results analyzed below are presented on a non-GAAP basis.
We use non-GAAP revenue, non-GAAP gross profit, non-GAAP gross margin, non-GAAP income from operations, non-GAAP operating margin, non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share internally in analyzing our operational performance.
Accordingly, we believe these non-GAAP measures are useful to investors, as a supplement to GAAP measures, in evaluating our ongoing operational performance.
While we believe these non-GAAP measures provide useful supplemental information, non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered in isolation from, or as a substitute for, financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP.
In addition, these non-GAAP financial measures may not be completely comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies due to potential differences in the exact method of calculation between companies.
We have acquired businesses whose net tangible assets include deferred revenue.
In accordance with GAAP reporting requirements, we recorded write-downs of deferred revenue under arrangements predating the acquisition to fair value, which resulted in lower recognized revenue than the contributed purchase price until the related obligations to provide services under such arrangements are fulfilled.
Therefore, our GAAP revenues after the acquisitions will not reflect the full amount of revenue that would have been reported if the acquired deferred revenue was not written down to fair value.
The non-GAAP measures described below reverse the acquisition-related deferred revenue write-downs so that the full amount of revenue booked by the acquired companies is included, which we believe provides a more accurate representation of a revenue run-rate in a given period and, therefore, will provide more meaningful comparative results in future periods.
The non-GAAP financial measures discussed below exclude the impact of certain transactions because we believe they are not directly related to our operating performance in any particular period, but are for our long-term benefit over multiple periods.
We believe that these non-GAAP financial measures reflect our ongoing business in a manner that allows for meaningful period-to-period comparisons and analysis of trends in our business.

Blackbaud, Inc.
Non-GAAP free cash flow is defined as operating cash flow less capital expenditures, including costs required to be capitalized for software development, and capital expenditures for property and equipment.
First Quarter 2019 Form 10-Q33
Blackbaud, Inc.
Non-GAAP organic revenue growth
In addition, we discuss non-GAAP organic revenue growth, non-GAAP organic revenue growth on a constant currency basis and non-GAAP organic recurring revenue growth, in analyzing our performance.
We believe that these non-GAAP measures are useful to investors, as a supplement to GAAP measures, for evaluating the periodic growth of our business on a consistent basis.
Each of these measures of non-GAAP organic revenue growth excludes incremental acquisition-related revenue attributable to companies acquired in the current fiscal year.
For companies, if any, acquired in the immediately preceding fiscal year, each of these non-GAAP organic revenue growth measures reflects presentation of full year incremental non-GAAP revenue derived from such companies as if they were combined throughout the prior period, and they include the non-GAAP revenue attributable to those companies, as if there were no acquisition-related write-downs of acquired deferred revenue to fair value as required by GAAP.
In addition, each of these non-GAAP organic revenue growth measures excludes prior period revenue associated with divested businesses.
The exclusion of the prior period revenue is to present the results of the divested businesses within the results of the combined company for the same period of time in both the prior and current periods.
We believe this presentation provides a more comparable representation of our current business’ organic revenue growth and revenue run-rate.
34First Quarter 2019 Form 10-Q
Blackbaud, Inc.
Seasonality
Our revenues normally fluctuate as a result of certain seasonal variations in our business.
Our transaction revenue has historically been at its lowest in the first quarter due to the timing of customer fundraising initiatives and events.
Our revenue from payment services has historically increased during the fourth quarter due to year-end giving.
Our revenue from professional services has historically been lower in the first quarter when many of those services commence and in the fourth quarter due to the holiday season.
As a result of these and other factors, our total revenue has historically been lower in the first quarter than in the remainder of our fiscal year, with the fourth quarter historically achieving the highest total revenue.
Our expenses, however, do not vary significantly as a result of these factors, but do fluctuate on a quarterly basis due to varying timing of expenditures.
Our cash flow from operations normally fluctuates quarterly due to the combination of the timing of customer contract renewals including renewals associated with customers of acquired companies, delivery of professional services and occurrence of customer events, the payment of bonuses, as well as merit-based salary increases, among other factors.
Historically, due to lower revenues in our first quarter, combined with the payment of bonuses from the prior year in our first quarter, our cash flow from operations has been lowest in our first quarter, and due to the timing of customer contract renewals, many of which take place at or near the beginning of our third quarter, our cash flow from operations has been lower in our second quarter as compared to our third and fourth quarters.
Partially offsetting these favorable drivers of cash flow from operations in our third and fourth quarters are merit-based salary increases, which are generally effective in April each year.
In addition, deferred revenues can vary on a seasonal basis for the same reasons.
These patterns may change as a result of the continued shift to online giving, growth in volume of transactions for which we process payments, or as a result of acquisitions, new market opportunities, new solution introductions or other factors.
Our cash flow from financing is negatively impacted in our first quarter when most of our equity awards vest, as we pay taxes on behalf of our employees related to the settlement or exercise of equity awards.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
First Quarter 2019 Form 10-Q35
Blackbaud, Inc.
At March 31, 2019, our total cash and cash equivalents balance included approximately $13.4 million of cash that was held by operations outside the U.S.
While these funds may not be needed to fund our U.S. operations for at least the next twelve months, if we need these funds, we may be required to accrue and pay taxes to repatriate the funds.
We currently do not intend nor anticipate a need to repatriate our cash held outside the U.S.
Operating cash flow
Working capital changes are composed of changes in accounts receivable, prepaid expenses and other assets, trade accounts payable, accrued expenses and other liabilities, and deferred revenue.
Cash flow from operations associated with working capital decreased $7.6 million during the three months ended March 31, 2019, when compared to the same period in 2018, primarily due to an increase in the collection of customer account balances in 2018.
Fluctuations in the timing of vendor payments also contributed to the decrease in cash flow from operations associated with working capital.
Investing cash flow
Net cash used in investing activities of $121.9 million increased by $103.9 million during the three months ended March 31, 2019, when compared to the same period in 2018.
During the three months ended March 31, 2019, we used net cash of $109.4 million, for our acquisition of YourCause, compared to $5.0 million spent on similar investments during the same period in 2018.
We used $11.3 million for software development costs, which was up $4.2 million from cash spent during the same period in 2018.
The increase in cash outlays for software development costs was primarily driven by development activities related to our cloud-based solutions, including our Church Management Solution, as well as development activities for Blackbaud SKY, our modern cloud platform.
We also spent $1.2 million of cash for purchases of property and equipment during the three months ended March 31, 2019, which was down $4.6 million from cash spent during the same period in 2018.
The higher cash outlays for property and equipment during the same period in 2018 was primarily driven by leasehold improvements for our New Headquarters Facility in Charleston, South Carolina.
Financing cash flow
During the three months ended March 31, 2019, we had a net increase in borrowings of $196.3 million, which was primarily used to finance our acquisition of YourCause.
Historically, due to lower revenues in our first quarter, combined with the payment of bonuses from the prior year in our first quarter, our cash flow from operations has been lowest in our first quarter.
We paid $18.4 million to satisfy tax obligations of employees upon settlement or exercise of equity awards during the three months ended March 31, 2019 compared to $22.5 million during the same period in 2018.
The amount of taxes paid by us on the behalf of employees related to the settlement or exercise of equity awards varies from period to period based upon the timing of grants and vesting, employee exercise decisions, as well as the market price for shares of our common stock at the time of settlement.
Most of our equity awards currently vest in our first quarter.
In addition, during the three months ended March 31, 2019, we paid dividends of $5.9 million, which was relatively consistent with the comparable period of 2018.
Cash used in financing activities associated with changes in restricted cash due to customers increased $191.8 million during the three months ended March 31, 2019 when compared to the same period in 2018, as the amount of restricted cash held and payable by us to customers as of December 31, 2017 was significantly larger than at the same date in 2018.
36First Quarter 2019 Form 10-Q
Blackbaud, Inc.
We have drawn on our credit facility from time to time to help us meet financial needs, such as financing for business acquisitions.
At March 31, 2019, our available borrowing capacity under the 2017 Credit Facility was $98.4 million.
The 2017 Credit Facility matures in June 2022.
At March 31, 2019, the carrying amount of our debt under the 2017 Credit Facility was $583.6 million.
Our average daily borrowings during the three months ended March 31, 2019 were $557.5 million.
Commitments and contingencies
The term loan under the 2017 Credit Facility and our other debt require periodic principal payments.
The balance of the term loans and any amounts drawn on the revolving credit loans are due upon maturity of the 2017 Credit Facility in June 2022.
The total liability for uncertain tax positions as of March 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018, was $4.7 million and $3.7 million, respectively.
Our accrued interest and penalties related to tax positions taken on our tax returns was $1.0 million and $0.7 million as of March 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018, respectively.
In February 2019, our Board of Directors approved our annual dividend rate of $0.48 per share to be made in quarterly payments.
Dividends at this annual rate would aggregate to $23.5 million assuming 49.0 million shares of common stock

are outstanding, although dividends are not guaranteed and our Board of Directors may decide, in its absolute discretion, to change or suspend dividend payments at any time for any reason.
Our ability to continue to declare and pay dividends quarterly this year and beyond might be restricted by, among other things, the terms of the 2017 Credit Facility, general economic conditions and our ability to generate adequate operating cash flow.
On April 30, 2019, our Board of Directors declared a second quarter dividend of $0.12 per share payable on June 14, 2019 to stockholders of record on May 28, 2019.
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
As of March 31, 2019, we did not have any off-balance sheet arrangements as defined in Item 303(a)(4)(ii) of Regulation S-K promulgated by the SEC that have, or are reasonably likely to have, a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in our financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that is material to investors.
Foreign Currency Exchange Rates
Approximately 13% of our total revenue for the three months ended March 31, 2019 was generated from operations outside the U.S. We do not have significant operations in countries in which the economy is considered to be highly inflationary.
Our consolidated financial statements are denominated in U.S. dollars and, accordingly, changes in the exchange rate between foreign currencies and the U.S. dollar will affect the translation of our subsidiaries’ financial results into U.S. dollars for purposes of reporting our consolidated financial results.
The accumulated currency translation adjustment, recorded within accumulated other comprehensive loss as a component of stockholders’ equity, was a loss of $2.0 million as of March 31, 2019 and a loss of $6.6 million as of December 31, 2018.
The vast majority of our contracts are entered into by our U.S. or U.K. entities.
The contracts entered into by the U.S. entity are almost always denominated in U.S. dollars or Canadian dollars, and contracts entered into by our U.K., Australian and Irish subsidiaries are generally denominated in British Pounds, Australian dollars and Euros, respectively.
Historically, as the U.S. dollar weakened, foreign currency translation resulted in an increase in our revenues and expenses denominated in non-U.S. currencies.
Conversely, as the U.S. dollar strengthened, foreign currency translation resulted in a decrease in our revenue and expenses denominated in non-U.S. currencies.
During the three months ended March 31, 2019, foreign translation resulted in a decrease in our revenues and expenses denominated in non-U.S. currencies.
Though we have exposure to fluctuations in currency exchange rates, primarily those between the U.S. dollar and both the British Pound and Canadian dollar, the impact has generally not been material to our consolidated results of operations or financial position.
For the three months ended March 31, 2019, the fluctuation in foreign currency exchange rates reduced our total revenue by $1.7 million and our income from operations by an insignificant amount.
We will continue monitoring such exposure and take action as appropriate.
To determine the impacts on revenue (or income from operations) from fluctuations in currency exchange rates, current period revenues (or income from operations) from entities reporting in foreign currencies were translated into U.S. dollars using the comparable prior year period's weighted average foreign currency exchange rates.
These impacts are non-GAAP financial information and are not in accordance with, or an alternative to, information prepared in accordance with GAAP.

There have been no significant changes in our critical accounting policies and estimates during the three months ended March 31, 2019 as compared to those disclosed in “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018.
