ITEM 3.
QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK
We have market rate sensitivity for interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates.
Interest Rate Risk
Our variable rate debt is our primary financial instrument with market risk exposure for changing interest rates.
We manage our variable rate interest rate risk through a combination of short-term and long-term borrowings and the use of derivative instruments entered into for hedging purposes.
Our interest rate exposure includes LIBOR rates.
The Financial Conduct Authority in the U.K. has stated that it plans to phase out LIBOR by the end of calendar year 2021.
We do not currently anticipate a significant impact to our financial position or results of operations as a result of this action as we expect that our financial contracts currently indexed to LIBOR will either expire or be modified before the phase out occurs.
Due to the nature of our debt, the materiality of the fair values of the derivative instruments and the highly liquid, short-term nature and level of our cash and cash equivalents as of September 30, 2019, we believe that the risk of exposure to changing interest rates for those positions is immaterial.
There were no significant changes in how we manage interest rate risk between December 31, 2018 and September 30, 2019.
Foreign Currency Risk
For a discussion of our exposure to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, see “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Foreign Currency Exchange Rates” in this report.
