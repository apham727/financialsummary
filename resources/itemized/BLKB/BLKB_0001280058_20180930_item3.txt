ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK



We have market rate sensitivity for interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates.



Interest Rate Risk



Our variable rate debt is our primary financial instrument with market risk exposure for changing interest rates. We manage our variable rate interest rate risk through a combination of short-term and long-term borrowings and the use of derivative instruments entered into for hedging purposes. Due to the nature of our debt, the materiality of the fair values of the derivative instruments and the highly liquid, short-term nature and level of our cash and cash equivalents as of September 30, 2018, we believe that the risk of exposure to changing interest rates for those positions is immaterial. There were no significant changes in how we manage interest rate risk between December 31, 2017 and September 30, 2018. 



Foreign Currency Risk



For a discussion of our exposure to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, see “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Foreign Currency Exchange Rates” in this report.
