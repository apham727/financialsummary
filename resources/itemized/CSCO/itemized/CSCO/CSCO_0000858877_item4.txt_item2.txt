Item 2.Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds





On September 13, 2001, we announced that our Board of Directors had authorized a stock repurchase program.
The remaining authorized amount for stock repurchases under this program, including the additional authorization, is approximately $12.7 billion, with no termination date.
For the majority of restricted stock units granted, the number of shares issued on the date the restricted stock units vest is net of shares withheld to meet applicable tax withholding requirements.
Although these withheld shares are not issued or considered common stock repurchases under our stock repurchase program and therefore are not included in the preceding table, they are treated as common stock repurchases in our financial statements as they reduce the number of shares that would have been issued upon vesting (see Note 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements).
