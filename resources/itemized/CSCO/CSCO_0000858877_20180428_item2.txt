MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued)



Three Months Ended April 28, 2018 Compared with Three Months Ended April 29, 2017



In the third quarter of fiscal 2018, we saw broad strength across the business and delivered strong revenue growth and solid margins. We remain focused on accelerating innovation across our portfolio, and we believe that we have made continued progress on our strategic priorities. Our product revenue reflected growth in Infrastructure Platforms, Applications and Security, and we continued to make progress in the transition of our business model to increased software and subscriptions. We continue to operate in a challenging and highly competitive environment, which has negatively impacted routing products within our Infrastructure Platforms product category. We continued to see weakness in the service provider market and we expect ongoing uncertainty in that area. While the overall environment remains uncertain, we continue to aggressively invest in priority areas with the objective of driving profitable growth over the long term. 



Total revenue increased by 4% compared with the third quarter of fiscal 2017. Within total revenue, product revenue increased by 5% and service revenue increased by 3%. Total gross margin decreased by 0.7 percentage points, driven primarily by unfavorable impacts from pricing, higher memory costs and higher amortization expense from purchased intangible assets, partially offset by productivity improvements. As a percentage of revenue, research and development, sales and marketing, and general and administrative expenses, collectively, increased by 0.6 percentage points. Operating income as a percentage of revenue decreased by 1.4 percentage points. Diluted earnings per share increased by 12%, driven by a 7% increase in net income and a decrease in diluted share count of 201 million shares.



In terms of our geographic segments, revenue from the Americas increased $115 million, EMEA revenue increased by $282 million, and revenue in our APJC segment increased by $126 million. These increases reflect broad strength across several countries within these segments. The “BRICM” countries experienced product revenue growth of 5% in the aggregate, driven by increased product revenue in the emerging countries of Russia, Brazil, India and China of 28%, 22%, 5% and 4%, respectively, partially offset by a product revenue decline of 16% in Mexico.



From a customer market standpoint, we experienced solid product revenue growth in the commercial market and to a lesser extent in the enterprise and public sector markets. Product revenue in the service provider market continued to decline with ongoing uncertainty in that area. 



From a product category perspective, the product revenue increase of 5% was driven by a 2% product revenue increase in Infrastructure Platforms and solid product revenue growth in Applications and Security, which grew by 19% and 11%, respectively. We saw broad strength across the portfolio with the exception of routing related to the weakness in the service provider market.

Nine Months Ended April 28, 2018 Compared with Nine Months Ended April 29, 2017 



Total revenue increased 2%, with product revenue increasing 1% and service revenue increasing 2%. Total gross margin decreased by 1.0 percentage points due to unfavorable impacts from pricing and a $127 million legal and indemnification settlement charge, partially offset by productivity benefits and favorable product mix. As a percentage of revenue, research and development, sales and marketing, and general and administrative expenses collectively increased by 0.2 percentage points. Operating income as a percentage of revenue decreased by 0.3 percentage points. We had a net loss of $3.7 billion and a net loss per share of $0.76, primarily due to the $11.1 billion provisional tax expense related to the enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the “Tax Act”), comprised of $8.9 billion of U.S. transition tax, $1.2 billion of foreign withholding tax, and $1.0 billion of net deferred tax assets re-measurement.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES



The preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires us to make judgments, assumptions, and estimates that affect the amounts reported in the Consolidated Financial Statements and accompanying notes. Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended July 29, 2017, as updated as applicable in Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements herein, describes the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements. The accounting policies described below are significantly affected by critical accounting estimates. Such accounting policies require significant judgments, assumptions, and estimates used in the preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements, and actual results could differ materially from the amounts reported based on these policies.



Revenue Recognition 





•Persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists. Contracts, Internet commerce agreements, and customer purchase orders are generally used to determine the existence of an arrangement.



•Delivery has occurred. Shipping documents and customer acceptance, when applicable, are used to verify delivery. For software, delivery is considered to have occurred upon unrestricted license access and license term commencement, when applicable.



•The fee is fixed or determinable. We assess whether the fee is fixed or determinable based on the payment terms associated with the transaction and whether the sales price is subject to refund or adjustment.



•Collectibility is reasonably assured. We assess collectibility based primarily on the creditworthiness of the customer as determined by credit checks and analysis, as well as the customer’s payment history.



In instances where final acceptance of the product, system, or solution is specified by the customer, revenue is deferred until all acceptance criteria have been met. When a sale involves multiple deliverables, such as sales of products that include services, the multiple deliverables are evaluated to determine the unit of accounting, and the entire fee from the arrangement is allocated to each unit of accounting based on the relative selling price. Revenue is recognized when the revenue recognition criteria for each unit of accounting are met. For hosting arrangements, we recognize revenue ratably over the hosting period, while usage revenue is recognized based on utilization. Software subscription revenue is deferred and recognized ratably over the subscription term upon delivery of the first product and commencement of the term. 



The amount of revenue recognized in a given period is affected by our judgment as to whether an arrangement includes multiple deliverables and, if so, our valuation of the units of accounting. Our multiple element arrangements may contain only deliverables within the scope of Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 605, Revenue Recognition, deliverables within the scope of ASC 985-605, Software-Revenue Recognition, or a combination of both. According to the accounting guidance prescribed in ASC 605, we use vendor-specific objective evidence of selling price (VSOE) for each of those units, when available. We determine VSOE based on our normal pricing and discounting practices for the specific product or service when sold separately. In determining VSOE, we require that a substantial majority of the historical standalone transactions have the selling prices for a product or service fall within a reasonably narrow pricing range, generally evidenced by approximately 80% of such historical standalone transactions falling within plus or minus 15% of the median rates. When VSOE does not exist, we apply the selling price hierarchy to applicable multiple-deliverable arrangements. Under the selling price hierarchy, third-party evidence of selling price (TPE) will be considered if VSOE does not exist, and estimated selling price (ESP) will be used if neither VSOE nor TPE is available. Generally, we are not able to determine TPE because our go-to-market strategy differs from that of others in our markets, and the extent of our proprietary technology varies among comparable products or services from those of our peers. In determining ESP, we apply significant judgment as we weigh a variety of factors, based on the characteristics of the deliverable. We typically arrive at an ESP for a product or service that is not sold separately by considering company-specific factors such as geographies, competitive landscape, internal costs, profitability objectives, pricing practices used to establish bundled pricing, and existing portfolio pricing and discounting. 



As our business and offerings evolve over time, our pricing practices may be required to be modified accordingly, which could result in changes in selling prices, including both VSOE and ESP, in subsequent periods. 



We make sales to distributors which we refer to as two-tier sales to the end customer. Revenue from two-tier distributors is recognized based on a sell-through method using point-of-sale information provided by these distributors. Distributors participate in various cooperative marketing and other incentive programs, and we maintain estimated accruals and allowances for these programs. If actual credits received by distributors under these programs were to deviate significantly from our estimates, which are based on historical experience, our revenue could be adversely affected.

Allowances for Receivables and Sales Returns









The allowance for doubtful accounts is based on our assessment of the collectibility of customer accounts. We regularly review the adequacy of these allowances by considering internal factors such as historical experience, credit quality and age of the receivable balances as well as external factors such as economic conditions that may affect a customer’s ability to pay as well as historical and expected default frequency rates, which are published by major third-party credit-rating agencies and are updated on a quarterly basis. We also consider the concentration of receivables outstanding with a particular customer in assessing the adequacy of our allowances for doubtful accounts. If a major customer’s creditworthiness deteriorates, if actual defaults are higher than our historical experience, or if other circumstances arise, our estimates of the recoverability of amounts due to us could be overstated, and additional allowances could be required, which could have an adverse impact on our operating results.



The allowance for credit loss on financing receivables is also based on the assessment of collectibility of customer accounts. We regularly review the adequacy of the credit allowances determined either on an individual or a collective basis. When evaluating the financing receivables on an individual basis, we consider historical experience, credit quality and age of receivable balances, and economic conditions that may affect a customer’s ability to pay. When evaluating financing receivables on a collective basis, we use expected default frequency rates published by a major third-party credit-rating agency as well as our own historical loss rate in the event of default, while also systematically giving effect to economic conditions, concentration of risk and correlation. Determining expected default frequency rates and loss factors associated with internal credit risk ratings, as well as assessing factors such as economic conditions, concentration of risk, and correlation, are complex and subjective. Our ongoing consideration of all these factors could result in an increase in our allowance for credit loss in the future, which could adversely affect our operating results. Both accounts receivable and financing receivables are charged off at the point when they are considered uncollectible.



A reserve for future sales returns is established based on historical trends in product return rates. The reserve for future sales returns was $122 million as of each of April 28, 2018 and July 29, 2017, and was recorded as a reduction of our accounts receivable and revenue. If the actual future returns were to deviate from the historical data on which the reserve had been established, our revenue could be adversely affected. 



Inventory Valuation and Liability for Purchase Commitments with Contract Manufacturers and Suppliers



Inventory is written down based on excess and obsolete inventories, determined primarily by future demand forecasts. Inventory write-downs are measured as the difference between the cost of the inventory and market, based upon assumptions about future demand, and are charged to the provision for inventory, which is a component of our cost of sales. At the point of the loss recognition, a new, lower cost basis for that inventory is established, and subsequent changes in facts and circumstances do not result in the restoration or increase in that newly established cost basis.



We record a liability for firm, noncancelable, and unconditional purchase commitments with contract manufacturers and suppliers for quantities in excess of our future demand forecasts consistent with the valuation of our excess and obsolete inventory.

CISCO SYSTEMS, INC.



MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued)



Our provision for inventory was $42 million and $52 million for the first nine months of fiscal 2018 and 2017, respectively. The provision for the liability related to purchase commitments with contract manufacturers and suppliers was $77 million and $111 million for the first nine months of fiscal 2018 and 2017, respectively. If there were to be a sudden and significant decrease in demand for our products, or if there were a higher incidence of inventory obsolescence because of rapidly changing technology and customer requirements, we could be required to increase our inventory write-downs, and our liability for purchase commitments with contract manufacturers and suppliers, and accordingly our profitability, could be adversely affected. We regularly evaluate our exposure for inventory write-downs and the adequacy of our liability for purchase commitments. Inventory and supply chain management remain areas of focus as we balance the need to maintain supply chain flexibility to help ensure competitive lead times with the risk of inventory obsolescence, particularly in light of current macroeconomic uncertainties and conditions and the resulting potential for changes in future demand forecast. 



Loss Contingencies and Product Warranties



We are subject to the possibility of various losses arising in the ordinary course of business. We consider the likelihood of impairment of an asset or the incurrence of a liability, as well as our ability to reasonably estimate the amount of loss, in determining loss contingencies. An estimated loss contingency is accrued when it is probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated. We regularly evaluate information available to us to determine whether such accruals should be made or adjusted and whether new accruals are required. 



Third parties, including customers, have in the past and may in the future assert claims or initiate litigation related to exclusive patent, copyright, trademark, and other intellectual property rights to technologies and related standards that are relevant to us. These assertions have increased over time as a result of our growth and the general increase in the pace of patent claims assertions, particularly in the United States. If any infringement or other intellectual property claim made against us by any third party is successful, or if we fail to develop non-infringing technology or license the proprietary rights on commercially reasonable terms and conditions, our business, operating results, and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected.



In fiscal 2014, we recorded a charge to product cost of sales of $655 million resulting from failures related to products containing memory components manufactured by a single supplier between 2005 and 2010. We perform regular assessments of the sufficiency of this liability and reduced the amount by $74 million and $164 million in fiscal 2016 and fiscal 2015, respectively based on updated analyses. During the second quarter of fiscal 2017, we further reduced the liability by $141 million to reflect lower than expected defects, actual usage history, and estimated lower future remediation costs as more of the impacted products age and near the end of the support period covered by the remediation program. In addition, during the second quarter of fiscal 2017, we recorded a $125 million charge to product cost of sales related to the expected remediation costs for anticipated failures in future periods of a widely-used component sourced from a third party which is included in several of our products. The liabilities related to the supplier component remediation matters as of April 28, 2018 and July 29, 2017 were $98 million and $174 million, respectively. 



Estimating these liabilities is complex and subjective, and if we experience changes in a number of underlying assumptions and estimates such as a change in claims compared with our expectations, or if the cost of servicing these claims is different than expected, our estimated liabilities for these matters may be impacted.



Our products are generally covered by a warranty for periods ranging from 90 days to five years, and for some products we provide a limited lifetime warranty. We accrue for warranty costs as part of our cost of sales based on associated material costs, technical support labor costs, and associated overhead. Material cost is estimated based primarily upon historical trends in the volume of product returns within the warranty period and the cost to repair or replace the equipment. Technical support labor cost is estimated based primarily upon historical trends in the rate of customer cases and the cost to support the customer cases within the warranty period. Overhead cost is applied based on estimated time to support warranty activities.



If we experience an increase in warranty claims compared with our historical experience, or if the cost of servicing warranty claims is greater than expected, our profitability could be adversely affected.



Fair Value Measurements



Our fixed income and publicly traded equity securities, collectively, are reflected in the Consolidated Balance Sheets at a fair value of $47.7 billion as of April 28, 2018, compared with $58.8 billion as of July 29, 2017. Our fixed income investment portfolio as of April 28, 2018 consisted primarily of high quality investment-grade securities. See Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

CISCO SYSTEMS, INC.



MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued)







The inputs and fair value are reviewed for reasonableness, may be further validated by comparison to publicly available information, and could be adjusted based on market indices or other information that management deems material to its estimate of fair value. The assessment of fair value can be difficult and subjective. However, given the relative reliability of the inputs we use to value our investment portfolio, and because substantially all of our valuation inputs are obtained using quoted market prices for similar or identical assets, we do not believe that the nature of estimates and assumptions affected by levels of subjectivity and judgment was material to the valuation of the investment portfolio as of April 28, 2018. Level 3 assets do not represent a significant portion of our total assets measured at fair value on a recurring basis as of April 28, 2018 and July 29, 2017.



Other-than-Temporary Impairments 



We recognize an impairment charge when the declines in the fair values of our fixed income or publicly traded equity securities below their cost basis are judged to be other than temporary. The ultimate value realized on these securities, to the extent unhedged, is subject to market price volatility until they are sold.



If the fair value of a debt security is less than its amortized cost, we assess whether the impairment is other than temporary. An impairment is considered other than temporary if (i) we have the intent to sell the security, (ii) it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the security before recovery of its entire amortized cost basis, or (iii) we do not expect to recover the entire amortized cost of the security. If an impairment is considered other than temporary based on (i) or (ii) described in the prior sentence, the entire difference between the amortized cost and the fair value of the security is recognized in earnings. If an impairment is considered other than temporary based on condition (iii), the amount representing credit loss, defined as the difference between the present value of the cash flows expected to be collected and the amortized cost basis of the debt security, will be recognized in earnings, and the amount relating to all other factors will be recognized in other comprehensive income (OCI). In estimating the amount and timing of cash flows expected to be collected, we consider all available information, including past events, current conditions, the remaining payment terms of the security, the financial condition of the issuer, expected defaults, and the value of underlying collateral.



For publicly traded equity securities, we consider various factors in determining whether we should recognize an impairment charge, including the length of time and extent to which the fair value has been less than our cost basis, the financial condition and near-term prospects of the issuer, and our intent and ability to hold the investment for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in market value.



We also have investments in privately held companies, some of which are in the startup or development stages. As of April 28, 2018, our investments in privately held companies were $969 million, compared with $983 million as of July 29, 2017, and were included in other assets. We monitor these investments for events or circumstances indicative of potential impairment, and we make appropriate reductions in carrying values if we determine that an impairment charge is required, based primarily on the financial condition and near-term prospects of these companies. These investments are inherently risky because the markets for the technologies or products these companies are developing are typically in the early stages and may never materialize.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued)



Goodwill and Purchased Intangible Asset Impairments



Our methodology for allocating the purchase price relating to purchase acquisitions is determined through established valuation techniques. Goodwill represents a residual value as of the acquisition date, which in most cases results in measuring goodwill as an excess of the purchase consideration transferred plus the fair value of any noncontrolling interest in the acquired company over the fair value of net assets acquired, including contingent consideration. We perform goodwill impairment tests on an annual basis in the fourth fiscal quarter and between annual tests in certain circumstances for each reporting unit. The assessment of fair value for goodwill and purchased intangible assets is based on factors that market participants would use in an orderly transaction in accordance with the new accounting guidance for the fair value measurement of nonfinancial assets.



The goodwill recorded in the Consolidated Balance Sheets as of April 28, 2018 and July 29, 2017 was $31.7 billion and $29.8 billion, respectively. In response to changes in industry and market conditions, we could be required to strategically realign our resources and consider restructuring, disposing of, or otherwise exiting businesses, which could result in an impairment of goodwill. There was no impairment of goodwill in each of the first nine months of fiscal 2018 and 2017. 



The fair value of acquired technology and patents, as well as acquired technology under development, is determined at acquisition date primarily using the income approach, which discounts expected future cash flows to present value. The discount rates used in the present value calculations are typically derived from a weighted-average cost of capital analysis and then adjusted to reflect risks inherent in the development lifecycle as appropriate. We consider the pricing model for products related to these acquisitions to be standard within the high-technology communications industry, and the applicable discount rates represent the rates that market participants would use for valuation of such intangible assets.



We make judgments about the recoverability of purchased intangible assets with finite lives whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that an impairment may exist. Recoverability of purchased intangible assets with finite lives is measured by comparing the carrying amount of the asset to the future undiscounted cash flows the asset is expected to generate. We review indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment annually or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired. If the asset is considered to be impaired, the amount of any impairment is measured as the difference between the carrying value and the fair value of the impaired asset. Assumptions and estimates about future values and remaining useful lives of our purchased intangible assets are complex and subjective. They can be affected by a variety of factors, including external factors such as industry and economic trends, and internal factors such as changes in our business strategy and our internal forecasts. 



Our impairment charges related to purchased intangible assets were $1 million and $42 million for the first nine months of fiscal 2018 and 2017, respectively. Our ongoing consideration of all the factors described previously could result in additional impairment charges in the future, which could adversely affect our net income. 



Income Taxes





The Tax Act, enacted on December 22, 2017, lowered the U.S. federal corporation income tax rate from 35% to 21% effective January 1, 2018, while also imposing a mandatory one-time transition tax on accumulated earnings of foreign subsidiaries. During the nine months ended April 28, 2018, we recorded a provisional tax expense of $11.1 billion related to the Tax Act, comprised of $8.9 billion of U.S. transition tax, $1.2 billion of foreign withholding tax and $1.0 billion of DTA re-measurement.

CISCO SYSTEMS, INC.



MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued)



Significant judgment is required in evaluating our uncertain tax positions and determining our provision for income taxes. Although we believe our reserves are reasonable, no assurance can be given that the final tax outcome of these matters will not be different from that which is reflected in our historical income tax provisions and accruals. We adjust these reserves in light of changing facts and circumstances, such as the closing of a tax audit or the refinement of an estimate. To the extent that the final tax outcome of these matters is different than the amounts recorded, such differences will impact the provision for income taxes in the period in which such determination is made. The provision for income taxes includes the impact of reserve provisions and changes to reserves that are considered appropriate, as well as the related net interest and penalties.



Significant judgment is also required in determining any valuation allowance recorded against deferred tax assets. In assessing the need for a valuation allowance, we consider all available evidence, including past operating results, estimates of future taxable income, and the feasibility of tax planning strategies. In the event that we change our determination as to the amount of deferred tax assets that can be realized, we will adjust our valuation allowance with a corresponding impact to the provision for income taxes in the period in which such determination is made.



Our provision for income taxes is subject to volatility and could be adversely impacted by earnings being lower than anticipated in countries that have lower tax rates and higher than anticipated in countries that have higher tax rates; by changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities; by changes to domestic manufacturing deduction laws, regulations, or interpretations thereof; by expiration of or lapses in tax incentives; by transfer pricing adjustments, including the effect of acquisitions on our legal structure; by tax effects of nondeductible compensation; by tax costs related to intercompany realignments; by changes in accounting principles; or by changes in tax laws and regulations, treaties, or interpretations thereof, including changes to the taxation of earnings of our foreign subsidiaries, the deductibility of expenses attributable to foreign income, and the foreign tax credit rules. Significant judgment is required to determine the recognition and measurement attributes prescribed in the accounting guidance for uncertainty in income taxes. The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), an international association comprised of 35 countries, including the United States, has made changes to numerous long-standing tax principles. There can be no assurance that these changes, once adopted by countries, will not have an adverse impact on our provision for income taxes. As a result of certain of our ongoing employment and capital investment actions and commitments, our income in certain countries is subject to reduced tax rates. Our failure to meet these commitments could adversely impact our provision for income taxes. In addition, we are subject to the continuous examination of our income tax returns by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and other tax authorities. We regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes. There can be no assurance that the outcomes from these continuous examinations will not have an adverse impact on our operating results and financial condition.

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS



Revenue











Three Months Ended April 28, 2018 Compared with Three Months Ended April 29, 2017



Total revenue increased by 4%. Product revenue increased by 5% and service revenue increased by 3%. The increase in total revenue reflected growth across each of our geographic segments. The emerging countries of BRICM, in the aggregate, experienced 5% product revenue growth, with increases in Russia, Brazil, China and India partially offset by a decrease in Mexico. 



In addition to the impact of macroeconomic factors, including a reduced IT spending environment and reductions in spending by government entities, revenue by segment in a particular period may be significantly impacted by several factors related to revenue recognition, including the complexity of transactions such as multiple-element arrangements; the mix of financing arrangements provided to channel partners and customers; and final acceptance of the product, system, or solution, among other factors. In addition, certain customers tend to make large and sporadic purchases, and the revenue related to these transactions may also be affected by the timing of revenue recognition, which in turn would impact the revenue of the relevant segment. As has been the case in certain emerging countries from time to time, customers require greater levels of financing arrangements, service, and support, and these activities may occur in future periods, which may also impact the timing of the recognition of revenue.



Nine Months Ended April 28, 2018 Compared with Nine Months Ended April 29, 2017 



Total revenue increased by 2%. Product revenue increased by 1% and service revenue increased by 2%. Our total revenue reflected growth across each of our geographic segments. Product revenue for the emerging countries of BRICM, in the aggregate, experienced 2% product revenue growth, with increases in Brazil, Russia and China partially offset by decreases in the other two BRICM countries.

Product Revenue by Groups of Similar Products









Infrastructure Platforms



Three Months Ended April 28, 2018 Compared with Three Months Ended April 29, 2017



The Infrastructure Platforms product category represents our core networking offerings related to switching, routing, wireless, and the data center. Infrastructure Platforms revenue increased by 2%, or $171 million, with strength across the portfolio with the exception of routing. Switching returned to growth with revenue growth in our data center and campus switching. Revenue growth from our campus switching was driven by our intent-based networking Catalyst 9000 Series. We also experienced solid revenue growth from wireless products driven by Meraki as well as our Wave 2 offerings. Our revenue from data center had strong double digit growth driven by higher sales of server products and our hyperconverged data center offering, HyperFlex. We had a decrease in sales of routing products driven by continued weakness in the service provider market. 



Nine Months Ended April 28, 2018 Compared with Nine Months Ended April 29, 2017



Revenue from the Infrastructure Platforms product category was flat as the increases in sales of switching, data center and wireless products were offset by the decreased revenue in routing. Within switching, we experienced an increase in sales of data center switches, driven by strength in our Application Centric Infrastructure (ACI) portfolio. Revenue from campus switching decreased modestly but we saw solid momentum with our intent-based networking Catalyst 9000 Series. We experienced strong revenue growth in our data center products driven by higher sales of server products and HyperFlex and solid revenue growth from wireless products. The decrease in routing revenue was driven by continued weakness in the service provider market and a slowdown in enterprise routing sales.

Applications



Three Months Ended April 28, 2018 Compared with Three Months Ended April 29, 2017



The Applications product category includes our collaboration offerings (unified communications, Cisco TelePresence and conferencing) as well as the Internet of Things (IoT) and analytics software offerings from AppDynamics and Jasper. Revenue in our Applications product category increased by 19%, or $209 million, driven by increased revenue in Telepresence endpoints, unified communications infrastructure and analytics from our fiscal 2017 acquisition of AppDynamics. We continue to increase the amount of deferred revenue and the proportion of recurring revenue related to our Applications product category. 



Nine Months Ended April 28, 2018 Compared with Nine Months Ended April 29, 2017



Revenue in our Applications product category increased by 10%, or $344 million, with analytics from our fiscal 2017 acquisition of AppDynamics driving the majority of the increase along with revenue increases across our collaboration offerings.



Security



Three Months Ended April 28, 2018 Compared with Three Months Ended April 29, 2017



Revenue in our Security product category increased 11%, or $56 million, driven by higher sales of unified threat management, advanced threat and web security products. We continue to increase the amount of deferred revenue and the proportion of recurring revenue related to our Security product category.



Nine Months Ended April 28, 2018 Compared with Nine Months Ended April 29, 2017



Revenue in our Security product category increased 8%, or $131 million, driven by higher sales of unified threat management, web security and advanced threat security products. 



Other Products



The decrease in revenue from our Other Products category for the third quarter and first nine months of fiscal 2018 as compared to the corresponding periods of fiscal 2017 was primarily driven by a decrease in revenue from Service Provider Video Software and Solutions (“SPVSS”). 



On May 1, 2018, we announced a definitive agreement to sell the SPVSS business. We expect this transaction to close in the first quarter of fiscal 2019 subject to regulatory approvals and customary closing conditions.

Service Revenue by Segment







Three Months Ended April 28, 2018 Compared with Three Months Ended April 29, 2017



Service revenue increased 3%. Technical support services revenue increased by 3% and advanced services revenue increased by 6%. Technical support services revenue had solid growth in the APJC and EMEA segments and increased modestly in our Americas segment. The increase in technical support services revenue was driven by an increase in software and solution support offerings. Advanced services revenue, which relates to professional services for specific customer network needs, had solid revenue growth in the EMEA and Americas segments and increased to a lesser extent in our APJC segment.



Nine Months Ended April 28, 2018 Compared with Nine Months Ended April 29, 2017



Service revenue increased across all geographic segments. Technical support services revenue increased by 2% and advanced services increased by 4%. Technical support services revenue had solid growth in APJC and increased to a lesser extent in our Americas and EMEA segments. Advanced services revenue had solid growth in the EMEA segment and increased to a lesser extent in our Americas and APJC segments.

Product Gross Margin







 (1) Productivity includes overall manufacturing-related costs, such as component costs, warranty expense, provision for inventory, freight, logistics, shipment volume, and other items not categorized elsewhere.



Three Months Ended April 28, 2018 Compared with Three Months Ended April 29, 2017



Product gross margin decreased by 0.7 percentage points driven by unfavorable impacts from product pricing, higher memory costs and higher amortization expense from purchased intangible assets, partially offset by productivity improvements. 



The negative pricing impact was driven by typical market factors and impacted each of our geographic segments and customer markets. Productivity improvements were driven by value engineering efforts (e.g. component redesign, board configuration, test processes, and transformation processes), lower warranty expenses and continued operational efficiency in manufacturing operations. Our productivity continued to be negatively impacted by an increase in the cost of certain memory components which are currently constrained. We expect the higher costs on these memory components to continue to impact productivity in the near term.



Nine Months Ended April 28, 2018 Compared with Nine Months Ended April 29, 2017



Product gross margin decreased by 1.2 percentage points due largely to unfavorable impacts from product pricing and a charge of $127 million to product cost of sales recorded in the first nine months of fiscal 2018 related to legal and indemnification settlements, partially offset by productivity benefits and a favorable product mix. 



The negative pricing impact was driven by typical market factors and impacted each of our geographic segments and customer markets. While productivity was positive to overall product gross margin, the benefit was lower than the prior year as these improvements were adversely impacted by an increase in the cost of certain memory components which are currently constrained. In addition, productivity was negatively impacted by decreases in revenue of certain Infrastructure Platforms offerings which limited our ability to generate cost savings. Productivity improvements were driven by value engineering efforts, lower warranty expenses and continued operational efficiency in manufacturing operations. Our product gross margin was also negatively impacted by higher amortization expense from purchased intangible assets.

Service Gross Margin



Three Months Ended April 28, 2018 Compared with Three Months Ended April 29, 2017



Our service gross margin percentage decreased by 0.9 percentage points due to increased headcount-related costs and, to a lesser extent, unfavorable mix and increased delivery costs. These cost impacts were partially offset by the resulting benefit to gross margin of higher sales volume in both advanced services and technical support services.



Our service gross margin normally experiences some fluctuations due to various factors such as the timing of contract initiations and renewals, our strategic investments in headcount, and the resources we deploy to support the overall service business. Another factor is the mix of service offerings, as the gross margin from our advanced services is typically lower than the gross margin from technical support services.



Nine Months Ended April 28, 2018 Compared with Nine Months Ended April 29, 2017



Service gross margin percentage decreased by 0.6 percentage points due largely to increased headcount-related costs and, to a lesser extent, unfavorable mix and increased delivery costs. These cost impacts were partially offset by the resulting benefit to gross margin of higher sales volume in both advanced services and technical support services.



Gross Margin by Segment







 (1) The unallocated corporate items include the effects of amortization and impairments of acquisition-related intangible assets, share-based compensation expense, significant litigation settlements and other contingencies, charges related to asset impairments and restructurings, and certain other charges. We do not allocate these items to the gross margin for each segment because management does not include such information in measuring the performance of the operating segments. 



Three Months Ended April 28, 2018 Compared with Three Months Ended April 29, 2017



The Americas segment experienced a slight gross margin percentage decrease due to negative impacts from pricing and product mix, partially offset by productivity improvements. The unfavorable mix impact was driven by our products within the Infrastructure Platforms product category. 



The gross margin percentage decrease in our EMEA segment was due primarily to negative impacts from pricing and mix partially offset by productivity improvements. Lower service gross margin also contributed to the decrease in the gross margin in this geographic segment.



Our APJC segment gross margin percentage decreased slightly due primarily to lower service gross margin. Product gross margin in this segment increased due to productivity improvements and favorable mix, partially offset by negative impacts from pricing.

We experienced a slight gross margin percentage increase in our Americas segment due to productivity improvements partially offset by unfavorable impacts from pricing. 



The gross margin percentage decrease in our EMEA segment was due primarily to the negative impacts from pricing and an unfavorable product mix partially offset by productivity improvements. Lower service gross margin also contributed to the decrease in the gross margin in this geographic segment.



The APJC segment gross margin percentage decreased due primarily to negative impacts from pricing and, to a lesser extent, an unfavorable product mix, partially offset by productivity improvements. Lower service gross margin also contributed to the decrease in the gross margin in this geographic segment.

















Sales and Marketing Expenses



Sales and marketing expenses increased in the third quarter of fiscal 2018, as compared with the third quarter of fiscal 2017, due to increases in headcount-related expenses, discretionary spending and contracted services and, to a lesser extent, higher share-based compensation expense and higher acquisition-related costs.



Sales and marketing expenses were flat in the first nine months of fiscal 2018, as compared with the first nine months of fiscal 2017, as the increases in headcount-related expenses, share-based compensation expense and acquisition-related costs substantially offset decreases in contracted services and discretionary spending.

Share-Based Compensation Expense







The increase in share-based compensation expense in the third quarter and first nine months of fiscal 2018, as compared with the corresponding periods of fiscal 2017, was due primarily to higher restructuring charges and higher expense related to equity awards assumed with respect to our recent acquisitions. 



Amortization of Purchased Intangible Assets







Amortization of purchased intangible assets increased for the third quarter of fiscal 2018, as compared with the third quarter of fiscal 2017, due to amortization of purchased intangible assets from our recent acquisitions.



Amortization of purchased intangible assets increased for the first nine months of fiscal 2018, as compared with the first nine months of fiscal 2017, due to amortization of purchased intangible assets from our recent acquisitions, partially offset by the impact of the impairment charges in the prior period.

Restructuring and Other Charges



Fiscal 2018 Plan. We initiated a restructuring plan in the third quarter of fiscal 2018 in order to realign our organization and enable further investment in key priority areas, with estimated pretax charges of approximately $300 million. In connection with this restructuring plan, we incurred charges of $82 million in the third quarter and first nine months of fiscal 2018. These aggregate pretax charges are primarily cash based and consist of employee severance and other one-time termination benefits, and other associated costs. We expect this restructuring plan to be substantially completed in fiscal 2019.



Fiscal 2017 Plan. In the third quarter and first nine months of fiscal 2017, we incurred restructuring and other charges of $70 million and $614 million, respectively, which were related primarily to employee severance charges for employees impacted by the restructuring action announced in August 2016. We extended this restructuring action to include an additional $150 million of estimated additional pretax charges for employee severance and other one-time termination benefits. We have completed this restructuring action and have incurred cumulative charges of $1.0 billion as of April 28, 2018. 



We expect to reinvest substantially all of the cost savings from these restructuring actions in our key priority areas. As a result, the overall cost savings from these restructuring actions are not expected to be material for future periods.



Operating Income







For the third quarter of fiscal 2018, as compared with the third quarter of fiscal 2017, operating income decreased by 1% and as a percentage of revenue operating income decreased by 1.4 percentage points. These decreases resulted primarily from a gross margin percentage decrease and an increase in operating expenses.



For the first nine months of fiscal 2018, as compared with the first nine months of fiscal 2017, operating income was flat and as a percentage of revenue operating income decreased by 0.3 percentage points. These changes resulted primarily from a gross margin percentage decrease (driven primarily by unfavorable impacts from pricing and a charge of $127 million for legal and indemnification settlements partially offset by productivity benefits) and a decrease in restructuring and other charges.



Interest and Other Income (Loss), Net







Interest income increased driven by higher yields on our portfolio. The increase in interest expense was driven by the impact of higher effective interest rates.

The change in total net gains (losses) on available-for-sale investments was primarily attributable to higher realized gains on publicly traded equity securities and lower impairment charges on publicly traded equity securities, partially offset by higher realized losses on fixed income securities as a result of market conditions and the timing of sales of these securities.



The change in net gains (losses) on investments in privately held companies was primarily due to lower realized gains on investments in privately held companies partially offset by lower impairment charges on investments in privately held companies.



The change in other gains (losses), net was primarily driven by net favorable foreign exchange impacts partially offset by higher donations.

Provision for Income Taxes 



On December 22, 2017, the Tax Act was enacted. The Tax Act significantly revises the U.S. corporate income tax by, among other things, lowering the statutory corporate income tax rate (“federal tax rate”) from 35% to 21% effective January 1, 2018, implementing a modified territorial tax system, and imposing a mandatory one-time transition tax on accumulated earnings of foreign subsidiaries. As a fiscal-year taxpayer, certain provisions of the Tax Act impact us in fiscal 2018, including the change in the federal tax rate and the one-time transition tax, while other provisions will be effective at the beginning of fiscal 2019, including the implementation of a modified territorial tax system and other changes to how foreign earnings are subject to U.S. tax, and elimination of the domestic manufacturing deduction. 



As a result of the decrease in the federal tax rate from 35% to 21% effective January 1, 2018, we have computed our income tax expense for the July 28, 2018 fiscal year using a blended federal tax rate of 27%. The 21% federal tax rate will apply to our fiscal year ending July 27, 2019 and each year thereafter. We must remeasure our deferred tax assets and liabilities ("DTA") using the federal tax rate that will apply when the related temporary differences are expected to reverse.



As of December 31, 2017, we had approximately $75 billion in undistributed earnings for certain foreign subsidiaries. These undistributed earnings are subject to the U.S. mandatory one-time transition tax and are eligible to be repatriated to the U.S. without additional U.S. tax under the Tax Act. We have historically asserted our intention to indefinitely reinvest foreign earnings in certain foreign subsidiaries. We have reevaluated our historic assertion as a result of enactment of the Tax Act and no longer consider these earnings to be indefinitely reinvested in our foreign subsidiaries. As a result of this change in assertion, we recorded a $1.2 billion tax expense for foreign withholding tax in the second quarter of fiscal 2018. In the third quarter of fiscal 2018, we repatriated $67 billion of foreign subsidiary earnings to the U.S. and paid foreign withholding tax of $1.2 billion. We also paid approximately $100 million of other one-time foreign taxes as a result of the Tax Act. 



In the third quarter of fiscal 2018, the Company recorded adjustments to the provisional amounts related to the U.S. transition tax on accumulated earnings of foreign subsidiaries and re-measurement of net DTA. During the nine months ended April 28, 2018, we recorded a provisional tax expense of $11.1 billion related to the Tax Act, comprised of $8.9 billion of U.S. transition tax, $1.2 billion of foreign withholding tax (discussed above), and $1.0 billion re-measurement of net DTA. We plan to pay the transition tax in installments over eight years in accordance with the Tax Act. The $1.2 billion foreign withholding tax was paid in February 2018. The Tax Act is discussed more fully in Note 16 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.



The provision for income taxes resulted in an effective tax rate of 17.3% for the third quarter of fiscal 2018 compared with 21.2% for the third quarter of fiscal 2017, a net 3.9 percentage point decrease for the third quarter of fiscal 2018 as compared with the third quarter of fiscal 2017. The decrease in the effective tax rate was primarily due to a decrease in the provisional one-time transition tax on accumulated earnings of foreign subsidiaries and a provision to tax return true-up tax benefit related to the U.S. federal research tax credit in the third quarter of fiscal 2018 as compared to the third quarter of fiscal 2017.



The provision for income taxes resulted in an effective tax rate of 139.1% for the first nine months of fiscal 2018 as compared with 21.1% for the first nine months of fiscal 2017, a net 118.0 percentage point increase for the first nine months of fiscal 2018 as compared with the first nine months of fiscal 2017. The increase in the effective tax rate was primarily due to the mandatory one-time transition tax on accumulated earnings of foreign subsidiaries, foreign withholding tax, and DTA re-measurement during the first nine months of fiscal 2018.



As a result of the adoption of the new accounting standard on share-based compensation, our effective tax rate will increase or decrease based upon the tax effect of the difference between the share-based compensation expenses and the benefits taken on the company's tax returns. We recognize excess tax benefits on a discrete basis and therefore anticipate the effective tax rate to vary from quarter to quarter depending on our share price in each period.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES



The following sections discuss the effects of changes in our balance sheet, our capital allocation strategy including stock repurchase program and dividends, our contractual obligations, and certain other commitments and activities on our liquidity and capital resources.



Balance Sheet and Cash Flows







The decrease in cash and cash equivalents and investments in the first nine months of fiscal 2018 was primarily driven by cash returned to shareholders in the form of repurchases of common stock of $11.6 billion under the stock repurchase program and cash dividends of $4.4 billion; a net decrease in debt of $5.5 billion; net cash paid for acquisitions of $2.8 billion; and capital expenditures of $0.6 billion. These uses of cash were partially offset by cash provided by operating activities of $9.6 billion.



Our total in cash and cash equivalents and investments held by various foreign subsidiaries was $6.9 billion and $67.5 billion as of April 28, 2018 and July 29, 2017, respectively. The balance of cash and cash equivalents and investments available in the United States as of April 28, 2018 and July 29, 2017 was $47.5 billion and $3.0 billion, respectively. 



During the nine months ended April 28, 2018, as a result of the Tax Act, all historical undistributed foreign subsidiary earnings through December 31, 2017 were subject to a mandatory one-time transition tax, which resulted in a provisional tax expense of $8.9 billion. We plan to pay the transition tax in installments over eight years in accordance with the Tax Act. Approximately $0.7 billion is payable in less than one year; $1.4 billion is payable between 1 to 3 years; another $1.4 billion is payable between 3 to 5 years; and the remaining $5.4 billion is payable in more than 5 years. In the third quarter of fiscal 2018, we repatriated $67 billion of historical undistributed foreign subsidiary earnings to the U.S. and paid foreign withholding tax of $1.2 billion. We also paid approximately $100 million of other one-time foreign taxes as a result of the Tax Act. Future repatriation of cash and other property held by our foreign subsidiaries will generally not be subject to U.S. federal tax. As we evaluate the impact of the Tax Act and the future cash needs of our global operations, we may revise the amount of foreign earnings considered to be permanently reinvested in our foreign subsidiaries. 



We maintain an investment portfolio of various holdings, types, and maturities. We classify our investments as short-term investments based on their nature and their availability for use in current operations. We believe the overall credit quality of our portfolio is strong, with our cash equivalents and our fixed income investment portfolio consisting primarily of high quality investment-grade securities. We believe that our strong cash and cash equivalents and investments position allows us to use our cash resources for strategic investments to gain access to new technologies, for acquisitions, for customer financing activities, for working capital needs, and for the repurchase of shares of common stock and payment of dividends as discussed below.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued)



Free Cash Flow and Capital Allocation  As part of our capital allocation strategy, we intend to return a minimum of 50% of our free cash flow annually to our shareholders through cash dividends and repurchases of common stock.







We expect that cash provided by operating activities may fluctuate in future periods as a result of a number of factors, including fluctuations in our operating results, the rate at which products are shipped during the quarter (which we refer to as shipment linearity), the timing and collection of accounts receivable and financing receivables, inventory and supply chain management, deferred revenue, and the timing and amount of tax and other payments. For additional discussion, see “Part II, Item 1A. Risk Factors” in this report.



We consider free cash flow to be a liquidity measure that provides useful information to management and investors because of our intent to return a stated percentage of free cash flow to shareholders in the form of dividends and stock repurchases. We further regard free cash flow as a useful measure because it reflects cash that can be used to, among other things, invest in our business, make strategic acquisitions, repurchase common stock, and pay dividends on our common stock, after deducting capital investments. A limitation of the utility of free cash flow as a measure of financial performance and liquidity is that the free cash flow does not represent the total increase or decrease in our cash balance for the period. In addition, we have other required uses of cash, including repaying the principal of our outstanding indebtedness. Free cash flow is not a measure calculated in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles and should not be regarded in isolation or as an alternative for net income provided by operating activities or any other measure calculated in accordance with such principles, and other companies may calculate free cash flow in a different manner than we do. 







Any future dividends are subject to the approval of our Board of Directors. 



On February 14, 2018, our Board of Directors authorized a $25 billion increase to the stock repurchase program. The remaining authorized amount for stock repurchases under this program, including the additional authorization, is approximately $25.1 billion, with no termination date. We expect to utilize this remaining authorized amount for stock repurchases over the next 15 to 21 months.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued)







Our accounts receivable net, as of April 28, 2018 decreased by approximately 17%, as compared with the end of fiscal 2017, primarily due to product billings being more linear and the amount and timing of service billings in the third quarter of fiscal 2018 compared with the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017.







Inventory as of April 28, 2018 increased by 18% from our inventory balance at the end of fiscal 2017. The increase in inventory was due to higher levels of manufactured finished goods in support of current order activity and an increase in raw materials due to securing memory supply which is currently constrained. 



Our finished goods consist of distributor inventory and deferred cost of sales and manufactured finished goods. Distributor inventory and deferred cost of sales are related to unrecognized revenue on shipments to distributors and retail partners as well as shipments to customers. Manufactured finished goods consist primarily of build-to-order and build-to-stock products.







Purchase commitments with contract manufacturers and suppliers increased by approximately 34% compared to the end of fiscal 2017. On a combined basis, inventories and purchase commitments with contract manufacturers and suppliers increased by 30% compared with the end of fiscal 2017. 



We record a liability, included in other current liabilities, for firm, noncancelable, and unconditional purchase commitments for quantities in excess of our future demand forecasts consistent with the valuation of our excess and obsolete inventory. As of April 28, 2018, the liability for these purchase commitments was $163 million, compared with $162 million as of July 29, 2017, and was included in other current liabilities.



Inventory and supply chain management remain areas of focus as we balance the need to maintain supply chain flexibility to help ensure competitive lead times with the risk of inventory obsolescence because of rapidly changing technology and customer requirements. We believe the amount of our inventory and purchase commitments is appropriate for our revenue levels.

Financing Receivables Our financing arrangements include leases, loans, and financed service contracts. Lease receivables include sales-type and direct-financing leases. Arrangements related to leases are generally collateralized by a security interest in the underlying assets. Our loan receivables include customers financing purchases of our hardware, software and services and also may include additional funds for other costs associated with network installation and integration of our products and services. We also provide financing to certain qualified customers for long-term service contracts, which primarily relate to technical support services. The majority of the revenue from these financed service contracts is deferred and is recognized ratably over the period during which the services are performed. Financing receivables increased by 2%. We expect to continue to expand the use of our financing programs in the near term.



Financing Guarantees In the normal course of business, third parties may provide financing arrangements to our customers and channel partners under financing programs. The financing arrangements to customers provided by third parties are related to leases and loans and typically have terms of up to three years. In some cases, we provide guarantees to third parties for these lease and loan arrangements. The financing arrangements to channel partners consist of revolving short-term financing provided by third parties, generally with payment terms ranging from 60 to 90 days. In certain instances, these financing arrangements result in a transfer of our receivables to the third party. The receivables are derecognized upon transfer, as these transfers qualify as true sales, and we receive payments for the receivables from the third party based on our standard payment terms. 



The volume of channel partner financing was $20.7 billion and $19.7 billion for the first nine months of fiscal 2018 and 2017, respectively. These financing arrangements facilitate the working capital requirements of the channel partners, and in some cases, we guarantee a portion of these arrangements. The balance of the channel partner financing subject to guarantees was $1.0 billion as of each of April 28, 2018 and July 29, 2017. We could be called upon to make payments under these guarantees in the event of nonpayment by the channel partners or end-user customers. Historically, our payments under these arrangements have been immaterial. Where we provide a guarantee, we defer the revenue associated with the channel partner and end-user financing arrangement in accordance with revenue recognition policies, or we record a liability for the fair value of the guarantees. In either case, the deferred revenue is recognized as revenue when the guarantee is removed. As of April 28, 2018, the total maximum potential future payments related to these guarantees was approximately $303 million, of which approximately $122 million was recorded as deferred revenue.

Borrowings







Interest is payable semiannually on each class of the senior fixed-rate notes, each of which is redeemable by us at any time, subject to a make-whole premium. Interest is payable quarterly on the floating-rate notes. We were in compliance with all debt covenants as of April 28, 2018.



Commercial Paper We have a short-term debt financing program in which up to $10.0 billion is available through the issuance of commercial paper notes. We use the proceeds from the issuance of commercial paper notes for general corporate purposes. We had no commercial paper notes outstanding as of April 28, 2018 and $3.2 billion commercial paper notes outstanding as of July 29, 2017.

Deferred product revenue increased 11% primarily due to increased deferrals related to recurring software and subscription offers. The portion of product deferred revenue related to recurring software and subscription offers grew 29% on a year-over-year basis to $5.6 billion as of April 28, 2018. Security and Applications continued to experience strong product deferred revenue growth during the period. The 3% decrease in deferred service revenue was driven by the impact of ongoing amortization of deferred service revenue. 



Contractual Obligations



Operating Leases 



We lease office space in many U.S. locations. Outside the United States, larger leased sites include sites in Belgium, Canada, China, Germany, India, Israel, Japan, Mexico, Poland and the United Kingdom. We also lease equipment and vehicles. The future minimum lease payments under all of our noncancelable operating leases with an initial term in excess of one year as of April 28, 2018 were $1.2 billion.



Other Commitments



In connection with our acquisitions, we have agreed to pay certain additional amounts contingent upon the achievement of certain agreed-upon technology, development, product, or other milestones or the continued employment with us of certain employees of the acquired entities. See Note 12 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.



Other Funding Commitments We also have certain funding commitments primarily related to our investments in privately held companies and venture funds, some of which are based on the achievement of certain agreed-upon milestones, and some of which are required to be funded on demand. The funding commitments were $212 million as of April 28, 2018, compared with $216 million as of July 29, 2017.



Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements



We consider our investments in unconsolidated variable interest entities to be off-balance sheet arrangements. In the ordinary course of business, we have investments in privately held companies including venture funds and provide financing to certain customers. Certain of these investments are considered to be variable interest entities. We evaluate on an ongoing basis our investments in these privately held companies and customer financings, and we have determined that as of April 28, 2018 there were no material unconsolidated variable interest entities.



On an ongoing basis, we reassess our investments in privately held companies and customer financings to determine if they are variable interest entities and if we would be regarded as the primary beneficiary pursuant to the applicable accounting guidance. As a result of this ongoing assessment, we may be required to make additional disclosures or consolidate these entities. Because we may not control these entities, we may not have the ability to influence these events.

We provide financing guarantees, which are generally for various third-party financing arrangements extended to our channel partners and end-user customers. We could be called upon to make payments under these guarantees in the event of nonpayment by the channel partners or end-user customers. See the previous discussion of these financing guarantees under “Financing Receivables and Guarantees.”



Securities Lending



We periodically engage in securities lending activities with certain of our available for sale investments. These transactions are accounted for as a secured lending of the securities, and the securities are typically loaned only on an overnight basis. The average daily balance of securities lending for the nine months ended April 28, 2018 and April 29, 2017 was $0.3 billion and $0.8 billion, respectively. We require collateral equal to at least 102% of the fair market value of the loaned security and that the collateral be in the form of cash or liquid, high-quality assets. We engage in these secured lending transactions only with highly creditworthy counterparties, and the associated portfolio custodian has agreed to indemnify us against collateral losses. As of April 28, 2018 and July 29, 2017, we had no outstanding securities lending transactions. We believe these arrangements do not present a material risk or impact to our liquidity requirements. 



Liquidity and Capital Resource Requirements





Item 2.Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds











On September 13, 2001, we announced that our Board of Directors had authorized a stock repurchase program. On February 14, 2018, our Board of Directors authorized a $25 billion increase to the stock repurchase program. The remaining authorized amount for stock repurchases under this program, including the additional authorization, is approximately $25.1 billion, with no termination date.



For the majority of restricted stock units granted, the number of shares issued on the date the restricted stock units vest is net of shares withheld to meet applicable tax withholding requirements. Although these withheld shares are not issued or considered common stock repurchases under our stock repurchase program and therefore are not included in the preceding table, they are treated as common stock repurchases in our financial statements as they reduce the number of shares that would have been issued upon vesting (see Note 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements).
