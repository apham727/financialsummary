Three Months Ended April 27, 2019 Compared with Three Months Ended April 28, 2018

In the third quarter of fiscal 2019, we had strong performance across the business and delivered strong revenue growth, margins and operating cash flow.
We remain focused on accelerating innovation across our portfolio, and we believe that we have made continued progress on our strategic priorities.
Our product revenue reflected growth in Infrastructure Platforms, Applications and Security, and we continued to make progress in the transition of our business model to increased software and subscriptions.
Notwithstanding the third quarter fiscal 2019 results, we continue to operate in a challenging and highly competitive environment.
While the overall environment remains uncertain, we continue to aggressively invest in priority areas with the objective of driving profitable growth over the long term.
Total revenue increased by 4% compared with the third quarter of fiscal 2018.
Within total revenue, product revenue increased by 4% and service revenue increased by 2%.
In the second quarter of fiscal 2019, on October 28, 2018, we completed the sale of our SPVSS business.
Total revenue for the third quarter of fiscal 2019 increased 6% not including revenue from the SPVSS business in the prior year period.
Total gross margin increased by 0.8 percentage points, driven by productivity improvements partially offset by unfavorable impacts from pricing and mix.
Our gross margin also benefited from the sale of our lower margin SPVSS business during the second quarter of fiscal 2019.
As a percentage of revenue, research and development, sales and marketing, and general and administrative expenses decreased by 0.4 percentage points.
Operating income as a percentage of revenue increased by 2.0 percentage points.
Diluted earnings per share increased by 23%, driven by a 13% increase in net income and a decrease in diluted share count of 429 million shares.
In terms of our geographic segments, revenue from the Americas increased $534 million, driven in large part by product revenue growth in the United States.
EMEA revenue increased by $75 million, led by a product revenue growth in the United Kingdom.
Revenue in our APJC segment decreased by $114 million, led by a product revenue decline in China.
The “BRICM” countries experienced a product revenue decline of 15% in the aggregate, driven by decreased product revenue in the emerging countries of Russia, China, India, Mexico and Brazil of 25%, 21%, 10%, 6% and 5%, respectively.
From a customer market standpoint, we experienced product revenue growth in the public sector, enterprise and commercial markets, partially offset by a product revenue decline in the service provider market.
From a product category perspective, total product revenue, not including SPVSS products in the prior year period, increased 7% year over year.
The increase was driven by a 5% product revenue increase in Infrastructure Platforms, solid product revenue growth in Applications of 9%, and strong growth in Security of 21%.

Nine Months Ended April 27, 2019 Compared with Nine Months Ended April 28, 2018 

Total revenue increased 5%, with product revenue increasing 7% and service revenue increasing 2%.
Total gross margin increased by 0.4 percentage points.
As a percentage of revenue, research and development, sales and marketing, and general and administrative expenses collectively decreased by 2.0 percentage points due to lower general and administrative expenses.
General and administrative expenses decreased due to a benefit from the $400 million litigation settlement with Arista in the first quarter of fiscal 2019.
Operating income as a percentage of revenue increased by 2.8 percentage points.
The net loss and net loss per share in the prior year period were driven by the one-time transition tax on accumulated earnings of foreign subsidiaries, foreign withholding taxes, and re-measurement of net deferred tax assets and liabilities recorded during the first nine months of fiscal 2018 as related to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES

The preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires us to make judgments, assumptions, and estimates that affect the amounts reported in the Consolidated Financial Statements and accompanying notes.
Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended July 28, 2018, as updated as applicable in Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements herein, describes the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements.
The accounting policies described below are significantly affected by critical accounting estimates.
Such accounting policies require significant judgments, assumptions, and estimates used in the preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements, and actual results could differ materially from the amounts reported based on these policies.
Revenue Recognition 

In May 2014, the FASB issued ASC 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, a new accounting standard related to revenue recognition.
ASC 606 supersedes nearly all U.S. GAAP on revenue recognition and eliminated industry-specific guidance.
The underlying principle of ASC 606 is to recognize revenue when a customer obtains control of promised goods or services at an amount that reflects the consideration that is expected to be received in exchange for those goods or services.
ASC 606 primarily impacted our revenue recognition for software arrangements and sales to two-tier distributors.
In both areas, the new standard accelerates the recognition of revenue.
We enter into contracts with customers that can include various combinations of products and services which are generally distinct and accounted for as separate performance obligations.
As a result, our contracts may contain multiple performance obligations.
We determine whether arrangements are distinct based on whether the customer can benefit from the product or service on its own or together with other resources that are readily available and whether our commitment to transfer the product or service to the customer is separately identifiable from other obligations in the contract.
We classify our hardware, perpetual software licenses, and SaaS as distinct performance obligations.
Term software licenses represent multiple obligations, which include software licenses and software maintenance.
In transactions where we deliver hardware or software, we are typically the principal and we record revenue and costs of goods sold on a gross basis.
We recognize revenue upon transfer of control of promised goods or services in a contract with a customer in an amount that reflects the consideration we expect to receive in exchange for those products or services.
Transfer of control occurs once the customer has the contractual right to use the product, generally upon shipment or once delivery and risk of loss has transferred to the customer.
Transfer of control can also occur over time for software maintenance and services as the customer receives the benefit over the contract term.
Our hardware and perpetual software licenses are distinct performance obligations where revenue is recognized upfront upon transfer of control.
Term software licenses include multiple performance obligations where the term licenses are recognized upfront upon transfer of control, with the associated software maintenance revenue recognized ratably over the contract term as services and software updates are provided.
SaaS arrangements have one distinct performance obligation which is satisfied over time with revenue recognized ratably over the contract term as the customer consumes the services.
On our product sales, we record consideration from shipping and handling on a gross basis within net product sales.
We record our revenue net of any associated sales taxes.
Revenue is allocated among these performance obligations in a manner that reflects the consideration that we expect to be entitled to for the promised goods or services based on standalone selling prices (SSP).
SSP is estimated for each distinct performance obligation and judgment may be required in their determination.
The best evidence of SSP is the observable price of a product or service when we sell the goods separately in similar circumstances and to similar customers.
In instances where SSP is not directly observable, we determine SSP using information that may include market conditions and other observable inputs.
We apply judgment in determining the transaction price as we may be required to estimate variable consideration when determining the amount of revenue to recognize.
Variable consideration includes various rebate, cooperative marketing, and other incentive programs that we offer to our distributors, partners and customers.
When determining the amount of revenue to recognize, we estimate the expected usage of these programs, applying the expected value or most likely estimate and update the estimate at each reporting period as actual utilization becomes available.
We also consider the customers' right of return in determining the transaction price, where applicable.
If actual credits received by distributors under these programs were to deviate significantly from our estimates, which are based on historical experience, our revenue could be adversely affected.
See Notes 2 and 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more details.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued)

Allowances for Receivables and Sales Returns




The allowance for doubtful accounts is based on our assessment of the collectibility of customer accounts.
We regularly review the adequacy of these allowances by considering internal factors such as historical experience, credit quality and age of the receivable balances as well as external factors such as economic conditions that may affect a customer’s ability to pay as well as historical and expected default frequency rates, which are published by major third-party credit-rating agencies and are updated on a quarterly basis.
We also consider the concentration of receivables outstanding with a particular customer in assessing the adequacy of our allowances for doubtful accounts.
If a major customer’s creditworthiness deteriorates, if actual defaults are higher than our historical experience, or if other circumstances arise, our estimates of the recoverability of amounts due to us could be overstated, and additional allowances could be required, which could have an adverse impact on our operating results.
The allowance for credit loss on financing receivables is also based on the assessment of collectibility of customer accounts.
We regularly review the adequacy of the credit allowances determined either on an individual or a collective basis.
When evaluating the financing receivables on an individual basis, we consider historical experience, credit quality and age of receivable balances, and economic conditions that may affect a customer’s ability to pay.
When evaluating financing receivables on a collective basis, we use expected default frequency rates published by a major third-party credit-rating agency as well as our own historical loss rate in the event of default, while also systematically giving effect to economic conditions, concentration of risk and correlation.
Determining expected default frequency rates and loss factors associated with internal credit risk ratings, as well as assessing factors such as economic conditions, concentration of risk, and correlation, are complex and subjective.
Our ongoing consideration of all these factors could result in an increase in our allowance for credit loss in the future, which could adversely affect our operating results.
Both accounts receivable and financing receivables are charged off at the point when they are considered uncollectible.
A reserve for future sales returns is established based on historical trends in product return rates.
The reserve for future sales returns as of April 27, 2019 and July 28, 2018 was $82 million and $123 million, respectively, and was recorded as a reduction of our accounts receivable and revenue.
If the actual future returns were to deviate from the historical data on which the reserve had been established, our revenue could be adversely affected.
Inventory Valuation and Liability for Purchase Commitments with Contract Manufacturers and Suppliers

Inventory is written down based on excess and obsolete inventories, determined primarily by future demand forecasts.
Inventory write-downs are measured as the difference between the cost of the inventory and market, based upon assumptions about future demand, and are charged to the provision for inventory, which is a component of our cost of sales.
At the point of the loss recognition, a new, lower cost basis for that inventory is established, and subsequent changes in facts and circumstances do not result in the restoration or increase in that newly established cost basis.
We record a liability for firm, noncancelable, and unconditional purchase commitments with contract manufacturers and suppliers for quantities in excess of our future demand forecasts consistent with the valuation of our excess and obsolete inventory.
Our provision for inventory was $55 million and $42 million for the first nine months of fiscal 2019 and 2018, respectively.
The provision for the liability related to purchase commitments with contract manufacturers and suppliers was $65 million and $77 million for the first nine months of fiscal 2019 and 2018, respectively.
If there were to be a sudden and significant decrease in demand for our products, or if there were a higher incidence of inventory obsolescence because of rapidly changing technology and customer requirements, we could be required to increase our inventory write-downs, and our liability for purchase commitments with contract manufacturers and suppliers, and accordingly our profitability, could be adversely affected.
We regularly evaluate our exposure for inventory write-downs and the adequacy of our liability for purchase commitments.

Loss Contingencies and Product Warranties

We are subject to the possibility of various losses arising in the ordinary course of business.
We consider the likelihood of impairment of an asset or the incurrence of a liability, as well as our ability to reasonably estimate the amount of loss, in determining loss contingencies.
An estimated loss contingency is accrued when it is probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated.
We regularly evaluate information available to us to determine whether such accruals should be made or adjusted and whether new accruals are required.
Third parties, including customers, have in the past and may in the future assert claims or initiate litigation related to exclusive patent, copyright, trademark, and other intellectual property rights to technologies and related standards that are relevant to us.
These assertions have increased over time as a result of our growth and the general increase in the pace of patent claims assertions, particularly in the United States.
If any infringement or other intellectual property claim made against us by any third party is successful, or if we fail to develop non-infringing technology or license the proprietary rights on commercially reasonable terms and conditions, our business, operating results, and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected.
Our products are generally covered by a warranty for periods ranging from 90 days to five years, and for some products we provide a limited lifetime warranty.
We accrue for warranty costs as part of our cost of sales based on associated material costs, technical support labor costs, and associated overhead.
Material cost is estimated based primarily upon historical trends in the volume of product returns within the warranty period and the cost to repair or replace the equipment.
Technical support labor cost is estimated based primarily upon historical trends in the rate of customer cases and the cost to support the customer cases within the warranty period.
Overhead cost is applied based on estimated time to support warranty activities.
If we experience an increase in warranty claims compared with our historical experience, or if the cost of servicing warranty claims is greater than expected, our profitability could be adversely affected.
Impairment of Investments 

We recognize an impairment charge when the declines in the fair values of our available-for-sale debt investments below their cost basis are judged to be other than temporary.
The ultimate value realized on these securities, to the extent unhedged, is subject to market price volatility until they are sold.
If the fair value of a debt security is less than its amortized cost, we assess whether the impairment is other than temporary.
An impairment is considered other than temporary if (i) we have the intent to sell the security, (ii) it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the security before recovery of its entire amortized cost basis, or (iii) we do not expect to recover the entire amortized cost of the security.
If an impairment is considered other than temporary based on (i) or (ii) described in the prior sentence, the entire difference between the amortized cost and the fair value of the security is recognized in earnings.
If an impairment is considered other than temporary based on condition (iii), the amount representing credit loss, defined as the difference between the present value of the cash flows expected to be collected and the amortized cost basis of the debt security, will be recognized in earnings, and the amount relating to all other factors will be recognized in other comprehensive income (OCI).
In estimating the amount and timing of cash flows expected to be collected, we consider all available information, including past events, current conditions, the remaining payment terms of the security, the financial condition of the issuer, expected defaults, and the value of underlying collateral.
We hold non-marketable equity and other investments, some of which are in the startup or development stages.
As of April 27, 2019, our non-marketable equity and other investments were $1.3 billion, compared with $1.1 billion as of July 28, 2018, and were included in other assets.
We monitor these investments for events or circumstances indicative of potential impairment, and we make appropriate reductions in carrying values if we determine that an impairment charge is required, based primarily on the financial condition and near-term prospects of these companies.
These investments are inherently risky because the markets for the technologies or products these companies are developing are typically in the early stages and may never materialize.
Goodwill and Purchased Intangible Asset Impairments

Our methodology for allocating the purchase price relating to purchase acquisitions is determined through established valuation techniques.
Goodwill represents a residual value as of the acquisition date, which in most cases results in measuring goodwill as an excess of the purchase consideration transferred plus the fair value of any noncontrolling interest in the acquired company over the fair value of net assets acquired, including contingent consideration.
We perform goodwill impairment tests on an annual basis in the fourth fiscal quarter and between annual tests in certain circumstances for each reporting unit.
The assessment of fair value for goodwill and purchased intangible assets is based on factors that market participants would use in an orderly transaction in accordance with the new accounting guidance for the fair value measurement of nonfinancial assets.
Table of Contents 

CISCO SYSTEMS, INC.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued)

The goodwill recorded in the Consolidated Balance Sheets as of April 27, 2019 and July 28, 2018 was $33.5 billion and $31.7 billion, respectively.
In response to changes in industry and market conditions, we could be required to strategically realign our resources and consider restructuring, disposing of, or otherwise exiting businesses, which could result in an impairment of goodwill.
There was no impairment of goodwill in each of the first nine months of fiscal 2019 and 2018.
The fair value of acquired technology and patents, as well as acquired technology under development, is determined at acquisition date primarily using the income approach, which discounts expected future cash flows to present value.
The discount rates used in the present value calculations are typically derived from a weighted-average cost of capital analysis and then adjusted to reflect risks inherent in the development lifecycle as appropriate.
We consider the pricing model for products related to these acquisitions to be standard within the high-technology communications industry, and the applicable discount rates represent the rates that market participants would use for valuation of such intangible assets.
We make judgments about the recoverability of purchased intangible assets with finite lives whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that an impairment may exist.
Recoverability of purchased intangible assets with finite lives is measured by comparing the carrying amount of the asset to the future undiscounted cash flows the asset is expected to generate.
We review indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment annually or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired.
If the asset is considered to be impaired, the amount of any impairment is measured as the difference between the carrying value and the fair value of the impaired asset.
Assumptions and estimates about future values and remaining useful lives of our purchased intangible assets are complex and subjective.
They can be affected by a variety of factors, including external factors such as industry and economic trends, and internal factors such as changes in our business strategy and our internal forecasts.
There were no impairment charges related to purchased intangible assets for the first nine months of fiscal 2019 and $1 million of such impairment charges for the first nine months of fiscal 2018.
Our ongoing consideration of all the factors described previously could result in additional impairment charges in the future, which could adversely affect our net income.
Income Taxes


On December 22, 2017, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the "Tax Act") was enacted.
The Tax Act significantly revises the U.S. corporate income tax by, among other things, lowering the statutory corporate income tax rate (“federal tax rate”) from 35% to 21% effective January 1, 2018, implementing a modified territorial tax system, and imposing a mandatory one-time transition tax on accumulated earnings of foreign subsidiaries.
As a result of the Tax Act enactment, we recorded a provisional tax expense of $10.4 billion in fiscal 2018.
In the second quarter of fiscal 2019, we completed our accounting relating to the Tax Act and recorded an additional $58 million tax expense.
The total tax charge as the result of the Tax Act is $10.5 billion, consisting of $8.2 billion of tax expense for the U.S. transition tax on accumulated earnings of foreign subsidiaries, $1.2 billion of foreign withholding tax, and $1.1 billion of tax expense for DTA re-measurement.
The tax expense related to the U.S. transition tax on accumulated earnings in foreign subsidiaries is net of a $0.9 billion benefit related to U.S. taxation of deemed foreign dividends in the transition fiscal year.
This benefit may be reduced or eliminated in future legislation.
If such legislation is enacted, we will record the impact of the legislation in the quarter of enactment.
Significant judgment is required in evaluating our uncertain tax positions and determining our provision for income taxes.
Although we believe our reserves are reasonable, no assurance can be given that the final tax outcome of these matters will not be different from that which is reflected in our historical income tax provisions and accruals.
We adjust these reserves in light of changing facts and circumstances, such as the closing of a tax audit or the refinement of an estimate.
To the extent that the final tax outcome of these matters is different than the amounts recorded, such differences will impact the provision for income taxes in the period in which such determination is made.
The provision for income taxes includes the impact of reserve provisions and changes to reserves that are considered appropriate, as well as the related net interest and penalties.
Significant judgment is also required in determining any valuation allowance recorded against deferred tax assets.
In assessing the need for a valuation allowance, we consider all available evidence, including past operating results, estimates of future taxable income, and the feasibility of tax planning strategies.
In the event that we change our determination as to the amount of deferred tax assets that can be realized, we will adjust our valuation allowance with a corresponding impact to the provision for income taxes in the period in which such determination is made.

CISCO SYSTEMS, INC.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued)

Our provision for income taxes is subject to volatility and could be adversely impacted by earnings being lower than anticipated in countries that have lower tax rates and higher than anticipated in countries that have higher tax rates; by changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities; by changes to domestic manufacturing deduction, foreign-derived intangible income, global intangible low-tax income and base erosion and anti-abuse tax laws, regulations, or interpretations thereof; by expiration of or lapses in tax incentives; by transfer pricing adjustments, including the effect of acquisitions on our legal structure; by tax effects of nondeductible compensation; by tax costs related to intercompany realignments; by changes in accounting principles; or by changes in tax laws and regulations, treaties, or interpretations thereof, including changes to the taxation of earnings of our foreign subsidiaries, the deductibility of expenses attributable to foreign income, and the foreign tax credit rules.
Significant judgment is required to determine the recognition and measurement attributes prescribed in the accounting guidance for uncertainty in income taxes.
The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), an international association comprised of 36 countries, including the United States, has made changes to numerous long-standing tax principles.
There can be no assurance that these changes, once adopted by countries, will not have an adverse impact on our provision for income taxes.
As a result of certain of our ongoing employment and capital investment actions and commitments, our income in certain countries is subject to reduced tax rates.
Our failure to meet these commitments could adversely impact our provision for income taxes.
In addition, we are subject to the continuous examination of our income tax returns by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and other tax authorities.
We regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes.
There can be no assurance that the outcomes from these continuous examinations will not have an adverse impact on our operating results and financial condition.

Total revenue increased by 4%.
Product revenue increased by 4% and service revenue increased by 2%.
Total revenue reflected growth in the Americas and EMEA segments while revenue declined in the APJC segment.
Product revenue for the emerging countries of BRICM, in the aggregate, experienced a 15% product revenue decline, with decreases across each of these countries.
In addition to the impact of macroeconomic factors, including a reduced IT spending environment and reductions in spending by government entities, revenue by segment in a particular period may be significantly impacted by several factors related to revenue recognition, including the complexity of transactions such as multiple performance obligations; the mix of financing arrangements provided to channel partners and customers; and final acceptance of the product, system, or solution, among other factors.
In addition, certain customers tend to make large and sporadic purchases, and the revenue related to these transactions may also be affected by the timing of revenue recognition, which in turn would impact the revenue of the relevant segment.
As has been the case in certain emerging countries from time to time, certain customers require greater levels of financing arrangements, service, and support, and these activities may occur in future periods, which may also impact the timing of the recognition of revenue.
Nine Months Ended April 27, 2019 Compared with Nine Months Ended April 28, 2018

The decrease in revenue from our Other Products category for the third quarter and first nine months of fiscal 2019, compared to the corresponding periods of fiscal 2018, was primarily driven by a decrease in revenue from the SPVSS business which we divested on October 28, 2018.
Service Revenue by Segment

Service revenue not including the SPVSS business in the prior year period increased by 3%.
Service revenue increased across all geographic segments.
Nine Months Ended April 27, 2019 Compared with Nine Months Ended April 28, 2018 

Service revenue increased 2%, driven by an increase in software and solution support offerings.
Service revenue increased in the Americas and EMEA segments, partially offset by decreased revenue in our APJC segment.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued)

Product Gross Margin



 (1) Productivity includes overall manufacturing-related costs, such as component costs, warranty expense, provision for inventory, freight, logistics, shipment volume, and other items not categorized elsewhere.
Three Months Ended April 27, 2019 Compared with Three Months Ended April 28, 2018

Product gross margin increased by 1.0 percentage point driven by productivity improvements, partially offset by unfavorable impacts from product pricing and product mix.
Our product gross margin also benefited from the sale of our lower margin SPVSS business during the second quarter of fiscal 2019.
Productivity improvements were driven by cost reductions including value engineering efforts (e.g.
component redesign, board configuration, test processes and transformation processes) and continued operational efficiency in manufacturing operations.
The negative pricing impact, which was lower than the year-over-year impact we experienced in the third quarter of fiscal 2018, was driven by typical market factors and impacted each of our geographic segments and customer markets.
The unfavorable product mix impact was driven by our products within the Infrastructure Platforms product category.
Our product gross margin also benefited from lower amortization expense from purchased intangible assets related to the divestiture of the SPVSS business on October 28, 2018.
Nine Months Ended April 27, 2019 Compared with Nine Months Ended April 28, 2018 

Product gross margin increased by 0.7 percentage points driven by productivity improvements, partially offset by unfavorable impacts from product pricing and product mix.
Our product gross margin also benefited from the sale of our lower margin SPVSS business during the second quarter of fiscal 2019.
A charge of $127 million to product cost of sales recorded in the first nine months of fiscal 2018 related to legal and indemnification settlements also contributed to the increase.
Service Gross Margin

Three Months Ended April 27, 2019 Compared with Three Months Ended April 28, 2018

Our service gross margin percentage increased by 0.5 percentage points due to higher sales volume, partially offset by increased delivery costs.
Our service gross margin normally experiences some fluctuations due to various factors such as the timing of contract initiations and renewals, our strategic investments in headcount, and the resources we deploy to support the overall service business.
Another factor is the mix of service offerings, as the gross margin from our advanced services is typically lower than the gross margin from technical support services.
Nine Months Ended April 27, 2019 Compared with Nine Months Ended April 28, 2018 

Service gross margin percentage decreased by 0.1 percentage points due to increased headcount-related costs and increased delivery costs.
These cost impacts were partially offset by the resulting benefit to gross margin of higher sales volume.

Gross Margin by Segment



 (1) The unallocated corporate items include the effects of amortization and impairments of acquisition-related intangible assets, share-based compensation expense, significant litigation settlements and other contingencies, charges related to asset impairments and restructurings, and certain other charges.
We do not allocate these items to the gross margin for each segment because management does not include such information in measuring the performance of the operating segments.
Amounts may not sum and percentages may not recalculate due to rounding.
Three Months Ended April 27, 2019 Compared with Three Months Ended April 28, 2018

We experienced a gross margin percentage increase in our Americas segment due to productivity improvements partially offset by unfavorable impacts from pricing and mix.
The unfavorable product mix impact was driven by our products within the Infrastructure Platforms product category.
Product gross margin in our EMEA segment increased due to productivity improvements, partially offset by negative impacts from pricing and mix.
The APJC segment gross margin percentage decrease was due to negative impacts from pricing, partially offset by productivity improvements.
The gross margin percentage for a particular segment may fluctuate, and period-to-period changes in such percentages may or may not be indicative of a trend for that segment.
Nine Months Ended April 27, 2019 Compared with Nine Months Ended April 28, 2018 

The Americas segment had a gross margin percentage increase driven by productivity improvements, partially offset by unfavorable impacts from pricing and mix.
The gross margin percentage increase in our EMEA segment was due to productivity improvements, partially offset by negative impacts from pricing.
The APJC segment gross margin percentage decrease was due to negative impacts from pricing.

Effect of Foreign Currency



Share-Based Compensation Expense



Three Months Ended April 27, 2019 Compared with Three Months Ended April 28, 2018

The decrease in share-based compensation expense was due primarily to higher forfeitures.
Nine Months Ended April 27, 2019 Compared with Nine Months Ended April 28, 2018 

The decrease in share-based compensation expense was due primarily to higher forfeitures, partially offset by higher restructuring charges.
Amortization of Purchased Intangible Assets



The decrease in amortization of purchased intangible assets in the third quarter and first nine months of fiscal 2019, as compared with the corresponding periods of fiscal 2018, was due largely to the purchased intangible assets related to the divestiture of SPVSS business on October 28, 2018, partially offset by amortization from our recent acquisitions.
Restructuring and Other Charges

We initiated a restructuring plan during fiscal 2018 in order to realign our organization and enable further investment in key priority areas, with estimated pretax charges of approximately $600 million.
In connection with this restructuring plan, we incurred charges of $18 million and $282 million for the third quarter and first nine months of fiscal 2019, respectively, and have incurred cumulative charges of $390 million since inception.
We expect this restructuring plan to be substantially completed in the first half of fiscal 2020.
We incurred restructuring and other charges of $82 million and $332 million for the third quarter and first nine months of fiscal 2018, respectively, in connection with restructuring plans initiated during fiscal 2018 and fiscal 2017.
Table of Contents 

CISCO SYSTEMS, INC.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued)

These charges were primarily cash-based and consisted of employee severance and other one-time termination benefits, and other associated costs.
We expect to reinvest substantially all of the cost savings from these restructuring actions in our key priority areas.
As a result, the overall cost savings from these restructuring actions are not expected to be material for future periods.

Interest and Other Income (Loss), Net



Interest income decreased, driven by a decrease in the average balance of cash and available-for-sale debt investments.
The decrease in interest expense was driven by a lower average debt balance, partially offset by the impact of higher effective interest rates.

The total change in net gains (losses) on available-for-sale debt investments was primarily attributable to lower realized losses as a result of market conditions, and the timing of sales of these investments.
The total change in net gains (losses) on marketable equity investments was attributable to market value fluctuations and the timing of recognition of gains and losses.
The change in net gains (losses) on non-marketable equity and other investments was primarily due to higher realized and unrealized gains and lower impairment charges.
The change in other gains (losses), net was primarily driven by higher donation expense in the prior year, partially offset by net unfavorable foreign exchange impacts.
Nine Months Ended April 27, 2019 Compared with Nine Months Ended April 28, 2018

The change in net gains (losses) on non-marketable equity and other investments was primarily due to higher unrealized gains and lower impairment charges partially offset by lower realized gains.
The change in other gains (losses), net was driven by higher donation expense in the prior year, and favorable foreign exchange impacts.
Provision for Income Taxes 

Three Months Ended April 27, 2019 Compared with Three Months Ended April 28, 2018

The provision for income taxes resulted in an effective tax rate of 15.8% for the third quarter of fiscal 2019 compared with 17.3% for the third quarter of fiscal 2018.
The decrease in the effective tax rate was primarily due to a decrease in the U.S. federal tax rate from 27% to 21% as the result of enactment of Tax Act, partially offset by a provisional tax adjustment recorded in the third quarter of fiscal 2018 relating to U.S transition tax on accumulated earnings of foreign subsidiaries and re-measurement of net DTA.
Our effective tax rate will increase or decrease based upon the tax effect of the difference between the share-based compensation expenses and the benefits taken on the company's tax returns.
We recognize excess tax benefits on a discrete basis and therefore anticipate the effective tax rate to vary from quarter to quarter depending on our share price in each period.
Nine Months Ended April 27, 2019 Compared with Nine Months Ended April 28, 2018 

The provision for income taxes resulted in an effective tax rate of 13.4% for the first nine months of fiscal 2019 compared with 139.1% for the first nine months of fiscal 2018.
The decrease in the effective tax rate was primarily due to the one-time transition tax on accumulated earnings of foreign subsidiaries, foreign withholding tax, and DTA re-measurement recorded during the first nine months of fiscal 2018.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

The following sections discuss the effects of changes in our balance sheet, our capital allocation strategy including stock repurchase program and dividends, our contractual obligations, and certain other commitments and activities on our liquidity and capital resources.
Balance Sheet and Cash Flows



The decrease in cash and cash equivalents and investments in the first nine months of fiscal 2019 was primarily driven by cash returned to shareholders in the form of repurchases of common stock of $16.0 billion under the stock repurchase program and cash dividends of $4.5 billion; net cash paid for acquisitions and divestitures of $2.2 billion; a net decrease in debt of $2.0 billion and capital expenditures of $0.7 billion.
These uses of cash were partially offset by cash provided by operating activities of $11.9 billion and timing of settlements of investments and other of $1.8 billion.
In addition to cash requirements in the normal course of business, approximately $0.7 billion of the U.S. transition tax on accumulated earnings for foreign subsidiaries is payable in less than one year.
Additionally, $4.5 billion of long-term debt and approximately $3.3 billion of commercial paper notes outstanding at April 27, 2019 will mature within the next 12 months from the balance sheet date.
See further discussion of liquidity under “Liquidity and Capital Resource Requirements” below.
We maintain an investment portfolio of various holdings, types, and maturities.
We classify our investments as short-term investments based on their nature and their availability for use in current operations.
We believe the overall credit quality of our portfolio is strong, with our cash equivalents and our available-for-sale debt investment portfolio consisting primarily of high quality investment-grade securities.
We believe that our strong cash and cash equivalents and investments position allows us to use our cash resources for strategic investments to gain access to new technologies, for acquisitions, for customer financing activities, for working capital needs, and for the repurchase of shares of common stock and payment of dividends as discussed below.
Free Cash Flow and Capital Allocation As part of our capital allocation strategy, we intend to return a minimum of 50% of our free cash flow annually to our shareholders through cash dividends and repurchases of common stock.
We expect that cash provided by operating activities may fluctuate in future periods as a result of a number of factors, including fluctuations in our operating results, the rate at which products are shipped during the quarter (which we refer to as shipment linearity), the timing and collection of accounts receivable and financing receivables, inventory and supply chain management, deferred revenue, and the timing and amount of tax and other payments.
For additional discussion, see “Part II, Item 1A.
Risk Factors” in this report.
Table of Contents 

CISCO SYSTEMS, INC.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued)

We consider free cash flow to be a liquidity measure that provides useful information to management and investors because of our intent to return a stated percentage of free cash flow to shareholders in the form of dividends and stock repurchases.
We further regard free cash flow as a useful measure because it reflects cash that can be used to, among other things, invest in our business, make strategic acquisitions, repurchase common stock, and pay dividends on our common stock, after deducting capital investments.
A limitation of the utility of free cash flow as a measure of financial performance and liquidity is that the free cash flow does not represent the total increase or decrease in our cash balance for the period.
In addition, we have other required uses of cash, including repaying the principal of our outstanding indebtedness.
Free cash flow is not a measure calculated in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles and should not be regarded in isolation or as an alternative for net cash provided by operating activities or any other measure calculated in accordance with such principles, and other companies may calculate free cash flow in a different manner than we do.
On February 13, 2019, our Board of Directors authorized a $15 billion increase to the stock repurchase program.
The remaining authorized amount for stock repurchases under this program, including the additional authorization, is approximately $18 billion, with no termination date.
Our accounts receivable net, as of April 27, 2019 decreased by approximately 32%, as compared with the end of fiscal 2018, primarily due to product and service billings being more linear in the third quarter of fiscal 2019 compared with the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018.
Inventory as of April 27, 2019 decreased by 18% from our inventory balance at the end of fiscal 2018.
The decrease in inventory was due primarily to lower deferred cost of sales related to the adoption of ASC 606 in the beginning of our first quarter of fiscal 2019.

CISCO SYSTEMS, INC.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued)

We purchase components from a variety of suppliers and use several contract manufacturers to provide manufacturing services for our products.
During the normal course of business, in order to manage manufacturing lead times and help ensure adequate component supply, we enter into agreements with contract manufacturers and suppliers that allow them to procure inventory based upon criteria as defined by us or that establish the parameters defining our requirements and our commitment to securing manufacturing capacity.
Purchase commitments with contract manufacturers and suppliers decreased 14% compared to the end of fiscal 2018.
On a combined basis, inventories and purchase commitments with contract manufacturers and suppliers decreased by 15% compared with the end of fiscal 2018.
Inventory and supply chain management remain areas of focus as we balance the need to maintain supply chain flexibility to help ensure competitive lead times with the risk of inventory obsolescence because of rapidly changing technology and customer requirements.
We believe the amount of our inventory and purchase commitments is appropriate for our revenue levels.
Financing Receivables Our financing arrangements include leases, loans, and financed service contracts.
Lease receivables include sales-type and direct-financing leases.
Arrangements related to leases are generally collateralized by a security interest in the underlying assets.
Our loan receivables include customer financing for purchases of our hardware, software and services and also may include additional funds for other costs associated with network installation and integration of our products and services.
We also provide financing to certain qualified customers for long-term service contracts, which primarily relate to technical support services.
The majority of the revenue from these financed service contracts is deferred and is recognized ratably over the period during which the services are performed.
Financing receivables increased by 1%.
We expect to continue to expand the use of our financing programs in the near term.
Financing Guarantees In the normal course of business, third parties may provide financing arrangements to our customers and channel partners under financing programs.
The financing arrangements to customers provided by third parties are related to leases and loans and typically have terms of up to three years.
In some cases, we provide guarantees to third parties for these lease and loan arrangements.
The financing arrangements to channel partners consist of revolving short-term financing provided by third parties, generally with payment terms ranging from 60 to 90 days.
In certain instances, these financing arrangements result in a transfer of our receivables to the third party.
The receivables are derecognized upon transfer, as these transfers qualify as true sales, and we receive payments for the receivables from the third party based on our standard payment terms.

CISCO SYSTEMS, INC.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued)

The volume of channel partner financing was $21.7 billion and $20.7 billion for the first nine months of fiscal 2019 and 2018, respectively.
These financing arrangements facilitate the working capital requirements of the channel partners, and in some cases, we guarantee a portion of these arrangements.
The balance of the channel partner financing subject to guarantees was $1.3 billion and $1.0 billion as of April 27, 2019 and July 28, 2018, respectively.
We could be called upon to make payments under these guarantees in the event of nonpayment by the channel partners or end-user customers.
Historically, our payments under these arrangements have been immaterial.
Where we provide a guarantee, we defer the revenue associated with the channel partner and end-user financing arrangement in accordance with revenue recognition policies, or we record a liability for the fair value of the guarantees.
In either case, the deferred revenue is recognized as revenue when the guarantee is removed.
As of April 27, 2019, the total maximum potential future payments related to these guarantees was approximately $240 million, of which approximately $81 million was recorded as deferred revenue.
Borrowings



Interest is payable semiannually on each class of the senior fixed-rate notes, each of which is redeemable by us at any time, subject to a make-whole premium.
Interest is payable quarterly on the floating-rate notes.
We were in compliance with all debt covenants as of April 27, 2019.
Commercial Paper We have a short-term debt financing program in which up to $10.0 billion is available through the issuance of commercial paper notes.
We use the proceeds from the issuance of commercial paper notes for general corporate purposes.
We had $3.3 billion in commercial paper notes outstanding as of April 27, 2019 and no commercial paper notes outstanding as of July 28, 2018.
Table of Contents 

CISCO SYSTEMS, INC.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued)




Deferred revenue decreased primarily due to the adoption of ASC 606 in the beginning of our first quarter of fiscal 2019.
Of the total deferred revenue decrease related to ASC 606 of $2.8 billion, $2.6 billion relates to deferred product revenue and $0.2 billion relates to deferred service revenue.
Of the adjustment to deferred product revenue, $1.3 billion related to our recurring software and subscription offers, $0.6 billion related to two-tier distribution, and the remainder related to non-recurring software and other adjustments.
Contractual Obligations

Operating Leases 

We lease office space in many U.S. locations.
Outside the United States, larger leased sites include sites in Australia, Belgium, Canada, China, Germany, India, Japan, Mexico, Poland and the United Kingdom.
We also lease equipment and vehicles.
The future minimum lease payments under all of our noncancelable operating leases with an initial term in excess of one year as of April 27, 2019 were $1.2 billion.
Transition Tax Payable 

The income tax payable outstanding as of April 27, 2019 for the U.S. transition tax on accumulated earnings for foreign subsidiaries is $7.4 billion.
Approximately $0.7 billion is payable in less than one year; $1.3 billion is payable between 1 to 3 years; $1.9 billion is payable between 3 to 5 years; and the remaining $3.5 billion is payable in more than 5 years.
See Note 17 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
Other Commitments

In connection with our acquisitions, we have agreed to pay certain additional amounts contingent upon the achievement of certain agreed-upon technology, development, product, or other milestones or the continued employment with us of certain employees of the acquired entities.
See Note 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
Other Funding Commitments We also have certain funding commitments primarily related to our non-marketable equity and other investments, some of which are based on the achievement of certain agreed-upon milestones, and some of which are required to be funded on demand.
The funding commitments were $345 million as of April 27, 2019, compared with $223 million as of July 28, 2018.

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements

We consider our investments in unconsolidated variable interest entities to be off-balance sheet arrangements.
In the ordinary course of business, we have non-marketable equity and other investments and provide financing to certain customers.
Certain of these investments are considered to be variable interest entities.
We evaluate on an ongoing basis our non-marketable equity and other investments and customer financings, and we have determined that as of April 27, 2019 there were no material unconsolidated variable interest entities.
On an ongoing basis, we reassess our non-marketable equity and other investments and customer financings to determine if they are variable interest entities and if we would be regarded as the primary beneficiary pursuant to the applicable accounting guidance.
As a result of this ongoing assessment, we may be required to make additional disclosures or consolidate these entities.
Because we may not control these entities, we may not have the ability to influence these events.
We provide financing guarantees, which are generally for various third-party financing arrangements extended to our channel partners and end-user customers.
We could be called upon to make payments under these guarantees in the event of nonpayment by the channel partners or end-user customers.
See the previous discussion of these financing guarantees under “Financing Receivables and Guarantees.”

Liquidity and Capital Resource Requirements


Item 3.Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk

Our financial position is exposed to a variety of risks, including interest rate risk, equity price risk, and foreign currency exchange risk.
Interest Rate Risk

Available-for-Sale Debt Investments We maintain an investment portfolio of various holdings, types, and maturities.
Our primary objective for holding available-for-sale debt investments is to achieve an appropriate investment return consistent with preserving principal and managing risk.
At any time, a sharp rise in market interest rates could have a material adverse impact on the fair value of our available-for-sale debt investment portfolio.
Conversely, declines in interest rates, including the impact from lower credit spreads, could have a material adverse impact on interest income for our investment portfolio.
We may utilize derivative instruments designated as hedging instruments to achieve our investment objectives.
We had no outstanding hedging instruments for our available-for-sale debt investments as of April 27, 2019.
Our available-for-sale debt investments are held for purposes other than trading.
Our available-for-sale debt investments are not leveraged as of April 27, 2019.
We monitor our interest rate and credit risks, including our credit exposures to specific rating categories and to individual issuers.
We believe the overall credit quality of our portfolio is strong.
Financing Receivables As of April 27, 2019, our financing receivables had a carrying value of $9.9 billion, compared with $9.8 billion as of July 28, 2018.
As of April 27, 2019, a hypothetical 50 basis points (“BPS”) increase or decrease in market interest rates would change the fair value of our financing receivables by a decrease or increase of approximately $0.1 billion, respectively.
Debt As of April 27, 2019, we had $20.5 billion in principal amount of senior notes outstanding, which consisted of $0.5 billion floating-rate notes and $20.0 billion fixed-rate notes.
The carrying amount of the senior notes was $20.4 billion, and the related fair value based on market prices was $21.6 billion.
As of April 27, 2019, a hypothetical 50 BPS increase or decrease in market interest rates would change the fair value of the fixed-rate debt, excluding the $4.5 billion of hedged debt, by a decrease or increase of approximately $0.5 billion, respectively.
However, this hypothetical change in interest rates would not impact the interest expense on the fixed-rate debt that is not hedged.
Equity Price Risk

Marketable Equity Investments.
The fair value of our marketable equity investments is subject to market price volatility.
We may hold equity securities for strategic purposes or to diversify our overall investment portfolio.
These equity securities are held for purposes other than trading.
To manage our exposure to changes in the fair value of certain equity securities, we may enter into equity derivatives designated as hedging instruments.
As of April 27, 2019, the total fair value of our investments in marketable equity securities was $5 million.
Non-marketable Equity and Other Investments These investments are recorded in other assets in our Consolidated Balance Sheets.
As of April 27, 2019, the total carrying amount of our investments in non-marketable equity and other investments was $1.3 billion, compared with $1.1 billion at July 28, 2018.
Some of these companies in which we invested are in the startup or development stages.
These investments are inherently risky because the markets for the technologies or products these companies are developing are typically in the early stages and may never materialize.
We could lose our entire investment in these companies.
Our evaluation of non-marketable equity and other investments is based on the fundamentals of the businesses invested in, including, among other factors, the nature of their technologies and potential for financial return.
Foreign Currency Exchange Risk



We conduct business globally in numerous currencies.
The direct effect of foreign currency fluctuations on revenue has not been material because our revenue is primarily denominated in U.S. dollars.
However, if the U.S. dollar strengthens relative to other currencies, such strengthening could have an indirect effect on our revenue to the extent it raises the cost of our products to non-U.S. customers and thereby reduces demand.
A weaker U.S. dollar could have the opposite effect.
However, the precise indirect effect of currency fluctuations is difficult to measure or predict because our revenue is influenced by many factors in addition to the impact of such currency fluctuations.
We also enter into foreign exchange forward and option contracts to reduce the short-term effects of foreign currency fluctuations on receivables and payables that are denominated in currencies other than the functional currencies of the entities.
The market risks associated with these foreign currency receivables, investments, and payables relate primarily to variances from our forecasted foreign currency transactions and balances.
We do not enter into foreign exchange forward or option contracts for speculative purposes.
Item 4.Controls and Procedures

Evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures.
Based on our management’s evaluation (with the participation of our principal executive officer and principal financial officer), as of the end of the period covered by this report, our principal executive officer and principal financial officer have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, (the “Exchange Act”)) are effective to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in Securities and Exchange Commission rules and forms and is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.
Changes in internal control over financial reporting.
There was no change in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) during our third quarter of fiscal 2019 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

Item 1.Legal Proceedings 

For a description of our material pending legal proceedings, see Note 13 "Commitments and Contingencies—(g) Legal Proceedings" of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 1 of this Form 10-Q.
Item 1A.Risk Factors

Set forth below and elsewhere in this report and in other documents we file with the SEC are descriptions of the risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ materially from the results contemplated by the forward-looking statements contained in this report.
The descriptions below include any material changes to and supersede the description of the risk factors affecting our business previously disclosed in “Part I, Item 1A.
Risk Factors” of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended July 28, 2018.
OUR OPERATING RESULTS MAY FLUCTUATE IN FUTURE PERIODS, WHICH MAY ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR STOCK PRICE 


 • Fluctuations in demand for our products and services, especially with respect to service providers and Internet businesses, in part due to changes in the global economic environment

 • Changes in sales and implementation cycles for our products and reduced visibility into our customers’ spending plans and associated revenue

 • Our ability to maintain appropriate inventory levels and purchase commitments

 • Price and product competition in the communications and networking industries, which can change rapidly due to technological innovation and different business models from various geographic regions

 • The overall movement toward industry consolidation among both our competitors and our customers

 • The introduction and market acceptance of new technologies and products, and our success in new and evolving markets, and in emerging technologies, as well as the adoption of new standards

 • The transformation of our business to deliver more software and subscription offerings where revenue is recognized over time

 • Variations in sales channels, product costs, mix of products sold, or mix of direct sales and indirect sales

 • The timing, size, and mix of orders from customers

 • Manufacturing and customer lead times

 • Fluctuations in our gross margins, and the factors that contribute to such fluctuations, as described below

 • The ability of our customers, channel partners, contract manufacturers and suppliers to obtain financing or to fund capital expenditures, especially during a period of global credit market disruption or in the event of customer, channel partner, contract manufacturer or supplier financial problems

 • Actual events, circumstances, outcomes, and amounts differing from judgments, assumptions, and estimates used in determining the values of certain assets (including the amounts of related valuation allowances), liabilities, and other items reflected in our Consolidated Financial Statements

 • How well we execute on our strategy and operating plans and the impact of changes in our business model that could result in significant restructuring charges

 • Our ability to achieve targeted cost reductions

 • Benefits anticipated from our investments in engineering, sales, service, and marketing

 • Changes in tax laws or accounting rules, or interpretations thereof

As a consequence, operating results for a particular future period are difficult to predict, and, therefore, prior results are not necessarily indicative of results to be expected in future periods.
Any of the foregoing factors, or any other factors discussed elsewhere herein, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition that could adversely affect our stock price.
OUR OPERATING RESULTS MAY BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY UNFAVORABLE ECONOMIC AND MARKET CONDITIONS AND THE UNCERTAIN GEOPOLITICAL ENVIRONMENT 


 • Reduced demand for our products as a result of continued constraints on IT-related capital spending by our customers, particularly service providers, and other customer markets as well

 • Increased price competition for our products, not only from our competitors but also as a consequence of customers disposing of unutilized products

 • Risk of excess and obsolete inventories

 • Risk of supply constraints

 • Risk of excess facilities and manufacturing capacity

 • Higher overhead costs as a percentage of revenue and higher interest expense

The global macroeconomic environment has been challenging and inconsistent.
Instability in the global credit markets, the impact of uncertainty regarding global central bank monetary policy, the instability in the geopolitical environment in many parts of the world including as a result of the pending United Kingdom “Brexit” withdrawal from the European Union, the current economic challenges in China, including global economic ramifications of Chinese economic difficulties, and other disruptions may continue to put pressure on global economic conditions.
If global economic and market conditions, or economic conditions in key markets, remain uncertain or deteriorate further, we may experience material impacts on our business, operating results, and financial condition.
Our operating results in one or more segments may also be affected by uncertain or changing economic conditions particularly germane to that segment or to particular customer markets within that segment.
For example, emerging countries in the aggregate experienced a decline in product orders in certain prior periods.
In addition, reports of certain intelligence gathering methods of the U.S. government could affect customers’ perception of the products of IT companies which design and manufacture products in the United States.
Trust and confidence in us as an IT supplier is critical to the development and growth of our markets.
Impairment of that trust, or foreign regulatory actions taken in response to reports of certain intelligence gathering methods of the U.S. government, could affect the demand for our products from customers outside of the United States and could have an adverse effect on our operating results.
WE HAVE BEEN INVESTING AND EXPECT TO CONTINUE TO INVEST IN KEY PRIORITY AND GROWTH AREAS AS WELL AS MAINTAINING LEADERSHIP IN INFRASTRUCTURE PLATFORMS AND IN SERVICES, AND IF THE RETURN ON THESE INVESTMENTS IS LOWER OR DEVELOPS MORE SLOWLY THAN WE EXPECT, OUR OPERATING RESULTS MAY BE HARMED 

We expect to realign and dedicate resources into key priority and growth areas, such as Security and Applications, while also focusing on maintaining leadership in Infrastructure Platforms and in Services.
However, the return on our investments may be lower, or may develop more slowly, than we expect.
If we do not achieve the benefits anticipated from these investments (including if our selection of areas for investment does not play out as we expect), or if the achievement of these benefits is delayed, our operating results may be adversely affected.
OUR REVENUE FOR A PARTICULAR PERIOD IS DIFFICULT TO PREDICT, AND A SHORTFALL IN REVENUE MAY HARM OUR OPERATING RESULTS 

As a result of a variety of factors discussed in this report, our revenue for a particular quarter is difficult to predict, especially in light of a challenging and inconsistent global macroeconomic environment and related market uncertainty.
Our revenue may grow at a slower rate than in past periods or decline as it did in the first quarter of fiscal 2018, and in certain prior periods on a year-over-year basis.
Our ability to meet financial expectations could also be adversely affected if the nonlinear sales pattern seen in some of our past quarters recurs in future periods.
We have experienced periods of time during which shipments have exceeded net bookings or manufacturing issues have delayed shipments, leading to nonlinearity in shipping patterns.
In addition to making it difficult to predict revenue for a particular period, nonlinearity in shipping can increase costs, because irregular shipment patterns result in periods of underutilized capacity and periods in which overtime expenses may be incurred, as well as in potential additional inventory management-related costs.
In addition, to the extent that manufacturing issues and any related component shortages result in delayed shipments in the future, and particularly in periods in which our contract manufacturers are operating at higher levels of capacity, it is possible that revenue for a quarter could be adversely affected if such matters occur and are not remediated within the same quarter.
The timing of large orders can also have a significant effect on our business and operating results from quarter to quarter, primarily in the United States and in emerging countries.
From time to time, we receive large orders that have a significant effect on our operating results in the period in which the order is recognized as revenue.
The timing of such orders is difficult to predict, and the timing of revenue recognition from such orders may affect period to period changes in revenue.
As a result, our operating results could vary materially from quarter to quarter based on the receipt of such orders and their ultimate recognition as revenue.
Inventory management remains an area of focus.
We have experienced longer than normal manufacturing lead times in the past which have caused some customers to place the same order multiple times within our various sales channels and to cancel the duplicative orders upon receipt of the product, or to place orders with other vendors with shorter manufacturing lead times.
Such multiple ordering (along with other factors) or risk of order cancellation may cause difficulty in predicting our revenue and, as a result, could impair our ability to manage parts inventory effectively.
In addition, our efforts to improve manufacturing lead-time performance may result in corresponding reductions in order backlog.
A decline in backlog levels could result in more variability and less predictability in our quarter-to-quarter revenue and operating results.
In addition, when facing component supply-related challenges we have increased our efforts in procuring components in order to meet customer expectations, which in turn contribute to an increase in purchase commitments.
Increases in our purchase commitments to shorten lead times could also lead to excess and obsolete inventory charges if the demand for our products is less than our expectations.
We plan our operating expense levels based primarily on forecasted revenue levels.
These expenses and the impact of long-term commitments are relatively fixed in the short term.
A shortfall in revenue could lead to operating results being below expectations because we may not be able to quickly reduce these fixed expenses in response to short-term business changes.
Any of the above factors could have a material adverse impact on our operations and financial results.
WE EXPECT GROSS MARGIN TO VARY OVER TIME, AND OUR LEVEL OF PRODUCT GROSS MARGIN MAY NOT BE SUSTAINABLE 


 • Changes in customer, geographic, or product mix, including mix of configurations within each product group

 • Introduction of new products, including products with price-performance advantages, and new business models including the transformation of our business to deliver more software and subscription offerings

 • Our ability to reduce production costs

 • Entry into new markets or growth in lower margin markets, including markets with different pricing and cost structures, through acquisitions or internal development

 • Sales discounts

 • Increases in material, labor or other manufacturing-related costs, which could be significant especially during periods of supply constraints such as those impacting the market for memory components

 • Excess inventory and inventory holding charges

 • Obsolescence charges

 • Changes in shipment volume

 • The timing of revenue recognition and revenue deferrals

 • Increased cost (including those caused by tariffs), loss of cost savings or dilution of savings due to changes in component pricing or charges incurred due to inventory holding periods if parts ordering does not correctly anticipate product demand or if the financial health of either contract manufacturers or suppliers deteriorates

 • Lower than expected benefits from value engineering

 • Increased price competition, including competitors from Asia, especially from China

 • Changes in distribution channels

 • Increased warranty costs

 • Increased amortization of purchased intangible assets, especially from acquisitions

 • How well we execute on our strategy and operating plans

Changes in service gross margin may result from various factors such as changes in the mix between technical support services and advanced services, as well as the timing of technical support service contract initiations and renewals and the addition of personnel and other resources to support higher levels of service business in future periods.
SALES TO THE SERVICE PROVIDER MARKET ARE ESPECIALLY VOLATILE, AND WEAKNESS IN ORDERS FROM THIS INDUSTRY MAY HARM OUR OPERATING RESULTS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION 

Sales to the service provider market have been characterized by large and sporadic purchases, especially relating to our router sales and sales of certain other Infrastructure Platforms and Applications products, in addition to longer sales cycles.
Service provider product orders decreased in the third quarter of fiscal 2019, and in certain prior periods, and at various times in the past we have experienced significant weakness in product orders from service providers.
Product orders from the service provider market could continue to decline and, as has been the case in the past, such weakness could persist over extended periods of time given fluctuating market conditions.
Sales activity in this industry depends upon the stage of completion of expanding network infrastructures; the availability of funding; and the extent to which service providers are affected by regulatory, economic, and business conditions in the country of operations.
Weakness in orders from this industry, including as a result of any slowdown in capital expenditures by service providers (which may be more prevalent during a global economic downturn, or periods of economic, political or regulatory uncertainty), could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, and financial condition.
Such slowdowns may continue or recur in future periods.
Orders from this industry could decline for many reasons other than the competitiveness of our products and services within their respective markets.
For example, in the past, many of our service provider customers have been materially and adversely affected by slowdowns in the general economy, by overcapacity, by changes in the service provider market, by regulatory developments, and by constraints on capital availability, resulting in business failures and substantial reductions in spending and expansion plans.
These conditions have materially harmed our business and operating results in the past, and some of these or other conditions in the service provider market could affect our business and operating results in any future period.
Finally, service provider customers typically have longer implementation cycles; require a broader range of services, including design services; demand that vendors take on a larger share of risks; often require acceptance provisions, which can lead to a delay in revenue recognition; and expect financing from vendors.
All these factors can add further risk to business conducted with service providers.
DISRUPTION OF OR CHANGES IN OUR DISTRIBUTION MODEL COULD HARM OUR SALES AND MARGINS 

If we fail to manage distribution of our products and services properly, or if our distributors’ financial condition or operations weaken, our revenue and gross margins could be adversely affected.
A substantial portion of our products and services is sold through our channel partners, and the remainder is sold through direct sales.
Our channel partners include systems integrators, service providers, other resellers, and distributors.
Systems integrators and service providers typically sell directly to end users and often provide system installation, technical support, professional services, and other support services in addition to network equipment sales.
Systems integrators also typically integrate our products into an overall solution, and a number of service providers are also systems integrators.
Distributors stock inventory and typically sell to systems integrators, service providers, and other resellers.
We refer to sales through distributors as our two-tier system of sales to the end customer.
These distributors are generally given business terms that allow them to return a portion of inventory, receive credits for changes in selling prices, and participate in various cooperative marketing programs.
If sales through indirect channels increase, this may lead to greater difficulty in forecasting the mix of our products and, to a degree, the timing of orders from our customers.
Historically, we have seen fluctuations in our gross margins based on changes in the balance of our distribution channels.
Although variability to date has not been significant, there can be no assurance that changes in the balance of our distribution model in future periods would not have an adverse effect on our gross margins and profitability.
• We compete with some of our channel partners, including through our direct sales, which may lead these channel partners to use other suppliers that do not directly sell their own products or otherwise compete with them

 • Some of our channel partners may demand that we absorb a greater share of the risks that their customers may ask them to bear

 • Some of our channel partners may have insufficient financial resources and may not be able to withstand changes and challenges in business conditions

 • Revenue from indirect sales could suffer if our distributors’ financial condition or operations weaken

In addition, we depend on our channel partners globally to comply with applicable regulatory requirements.
To the extent that they fail to do so, that could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, and financial condition.
Further, sales of our products outside of agreed territories can result in disruption to our distribution channels.
THE MARKETS IN WHICH WE COMPETE ARE INTENSELY COMPETITIVE, WHICH COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR ACHIEVEMENT OF REVENUE GROWTH 

The markets in which we compete are characterized by rapid change, converging technologies, and a migration to networking and communications solutions that offer relative advantages.
These market factors represent a competitive threat to us.
We compete with numerous vendors in each product category.
The overall number of our competitors providing niche product solutions may increase.
Also, the identity and composition of competitors may change as we increase our activity in newer product areas, and in key priority and growth areas.
For example, as products related to network programmability, such as SDN products, become more prevalent, we expect to face increased competition from companies that develop networking products based on commoditized hardware, referred to as "white box" hardware, to the extent customers decide to purchase those product offerings instead of ours.
In addition, the growth in demand for technology delivered as a service enables new competitors to enter the market.
As we continue to expand globally, we may see new competition in different geographic regions.
In particular, we have experienced price-focused competition from competitors in Asia, especially from China, and we anticipate this will continue.
Our competitors include Amazon Web Services LLC; Arista Networks, Inc.; ARRIS Group, Inc.; Check Point Software Technologies Ltd.; Dell Technologies Inc.; Extreme Networks, Inc.; F5 Networks, Inc.; FireEye, Inc.; Fortinet, Inc.; Hewlett-Packard Enterprise Company; Huawei Technologies Co., Ltd.; Juniper Networks, Inc.; Lenovo Group Limited; LogMeIn, Inc.; Microsoft Corporation; New Relic, Inc.; Nokia Corporation; Nutanix, Inc.; Palo Alto Networks, Inc.; Symantec Corporation; Ubiquiti Networks, Inc.; VMware, Inc. and Zoom Video Communications, Inc.; among others.
Some of our competitors compete across many of our product lines, while others are primarily focused in a specific product area.
Barriers to entry are relatively low, and new ventures to create products that do or could compete with our products are regularly formed.
In addition, some of our competitors may have greater resources, including technical and engineering resources, than we do.
As we expand into new markets, we will face competition not only from our existing competitors but also from other competitors, including existing companies with strong technological, marketing, and sales positions in those markets.
We also sometimes face competition from resellers and distributors of our products.
Companies with which we have strategic alliances in some areas may be competitors in other areas, and in our view this trend may increase.
For example, the enterprise data center is undergoing a fundamental transformation arising from the convergence of technologies, including computing, networking, storage, and software, that previously were segregated.
Due to several factors, including the availability of highly scalable and general purpose microprocessors, ASICs offering advanced services, standards based protocols, cloud computing and virtualization, the convergence of technologies within the enterprise data center is spanning multiple, previously independent, technology segments.
Also, some of our current and potential competitors for enterprise data center business have made acquisitions, or announced new strategic alliances, designed to position them to provide end-to-end technology solutions for the enterprise data center.
As a result of all of these developments, we face greater competition in the development and sale of enterprise data center technologies, including competition from entities that are among our long-term strategic alliance partners.
Companies that are strategic alliance partners in some areas of our business may acquire or form alliances with our competitors, thereby reducing their business with us.
• The ability to sell successful business outcomes 

 • The ability to provide a broad range of networking and communications products and services

 • Product performance

 • Price

 • The ability to introduce new products, including providing continuous new customer value and products with price-performance advantages

 • The ability to reduce production costs

 • The ability to provide value-added features such as security, reliability, and investment protection

 • Conformance to standards

 • Market presence

 • The ability to provide financing

 • Disruptive technology shifts and new business models

We also face competition from customers to which we license or supply technology and suppliers from which we transfer technology.
The inherent nature of networking requires interoperability.
As such, we must cooperate and at the same time compete with many companies.
Any inability to effectively manage these complicated relationships with customers, suppliers, and strategic alliance partners could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, and financial condition and accordingly affect our chances of success.
OUR INVENTORY MANAGEMENT RELATING TO OUR SALES TO OUR TWO-TIER DISTRIBUTION CHANNEL IS COMPLEX, AND EXCESS INVENTORY MAY HARM OUR GROSS MARGINS 

We must manage our inventory relating to sales to our distributors effectively, because inventory held by them could affect our results of operations.
Our distributors may increase orders during periods of product shortages, cancel orders if their inventory is too high, or delay orders in anticipation of new products.
They also may adjust their orders in response to the supply of our products and the products of our competitors that are available to them, and in response to seasonal fluctuations in end-user demand.
Our distributors are generally given business terms that allow them to return a portion of inventory, receive credits for changes in selling price, and participate in various cooperative marketing programs.
Inventory management remains an area of focus as we balance the need to maintain strategic inventory levels to ensure competitive lead times against the risk of inventory obsolescence because of rapidly changing technology and customer requirements.
When facing component supply-related challenges, we have increased our efforts in procuring components in order to meet customer expectations.
If we ultimately determine that we have excess inventory, we may have to reduce our prices and write down inventory, which in turn could result in lower gross margins.
SUPPLY CHAIN ISSUES, INCLUDING FINANCIAL PROBLEMS OF CONTRACT MANUFACTURERS OR COMPONENT SUPPLIERS, OR A SHORTAGE OF ADEQUATE COMPONENT SUPPLY OR MANUFACTURING CAPACITY THAT INCREASED OUR COSTS OR CAUSED A DELAY IN OUR ABILITY TO FULFILL ORDERS, COULD HAVE AN ADVERSE IMPACT ON OUR BUSINESS AND OPERATING RESULTS, AND OUR FAILURE TO ESTIMATE CUSTOMER DEMAND PROPERLY MAY RESULT IN EXCESS OR OBSOLETE COMPONENT SUPPLY, WHICH COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR GROSS MARGINS 


 • Any financial problems of either contract manufacturers or component suppliers could either limit supply or increase costs

 • Reservation of manufacturing capacity at our contract manufacturers by other companies, inside or outside of our industry, could either limit supply or increase costs

 • Industry consolidation occurring within one or more component supplier markets, such as the semiconductor market, could either limit supply or increase costs

A reduction or interruption in supply; a significant increase in the price of one or more components; a failure to adequately authorize procurement of inventory by our contract manufacturers; a failure to appropriately cancel, reschedule, or adjust our requirements based on our business needs; or a decrease in demand for our products could materially adversely affect our business, operating results, and financial condition and could materially damage customer relationships.
Furthermore, as a result of binding price or purchase commitments with suppliers, we may be obligated to purchase components at prices that are higher than those available in the current market.
In the event that we become committed to purchase components at prices in excess of the current market price when the components are actually used, our gross margins could decrease.
We have experienced longer than normal lead times in the past.
Although we have generally secured additional supply or taken other mitigation actions when significant disruptions have occurred, if similar situations occur in the future, they could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition.
See the risk factor above entitled “Our revenue for a particular period is difficult to predict, and a shortfall in revenue may harm our operating results.” 

Our growth and ability to meet customer demands depend in part on our ability to obtain timely deliveries of parts from our suppliers and contract manufacturers.
We have experienced component shortages in the past, including shortages caused by manufacturing process issues, that have affected our operations.
We may in the future experience a shortage of certain component parts as a result of our own manufacturing issues, manufacturing issues at our suppliers or contract manufacturers, capacity problems experienced by our suppliers or contract manufacturers including capacity or cost problems resulting from industry consolidation, or strong demand in the industry for those parts.
Growth in the economy is likely to create greater pressures on us and our suppliers to accurately project overall component demand and component demands within specific product categories and to establish optimal component levels and manufacturing capacity, especially for labor-intensive components, components for which we purchase a substantial portion of the supply, or the re-ramping of manufacturing capacity for highly complex products.
During periods of shortages or delays the price of components may increase, or the components may not be available at all, and we may also encounter shortages if we do not accurately anticipate our needs.
We may not be able to secure enough components at reasonable prices or of acceptable quality to build new products in a timely manner in the quantities or configurations needed.
Accordingly, our revenue and gross margins could suffer until other sources can be developed.
Our operating results would also be adversely affected if, anticipating greater demand than actually develops, we commit to the purchase of more components than we need, which is more likely to occur in a period of demand uncertainties such as we are currently experiencing.
There can be no assurance that we will not encounter these problems in the future.
Although in many cases we use standard parts and components for our products, certain components are presently available only from a single source or limited sources, and a global economic downturn and related market uncertainty could negatively impact the availability of components from one or more of these sources, especially during times such as we have recently seen when there are supplier constraints based on labor and other actions taken during economic downturns.
We may not be able to diversify sources in a timely manner, which could harm our ability to deliver products to customers and seriously impact present and future sales.
• New markets in which we participate may grow quickly, which may make it difficult to quickly obtain significant component capacity

 • As we acquire companies and new technologies, we may be dependent, at least initially, on unfamiliar supply chains or relatively small supply partners

 • We face competition for certain components that are supply-constrained, from existing competitors, and companies in other markets

Manufacturing capacity and component supply constraints could continue to be significant issues for us.
We purchase components from a variety of suppliers and use several contract manufacturers to provide manufacturing services for our products.
During the normal course of business, in order to improve manufacturing lead-time performance and to help ensure adequate component supply, we enter into agreements with contract manufacturers and suppliers that either allow them to procure inventory based upon criteria as defined by us or that establish the parameters defining our requirements.
In certain instances, these agreements allow us the option to cancel, reschedule, and adjust our requirements based on our business needs prior to firm orders being placed.
When facing component supply-related challenges we have increased our efforts in procuring components in order to meet customer expectations, which in turn contributes to an increase in purchase commitments.
Increases in our purchase commitments to shorten lead times could also lead to excess and obsolete inventory charges if the demand for our products is less than our expectations.
If we fail to anticipate customer demand properly, an oversupply of parts could result in excess or obsolete components that could adversely affect our gross margins.
For additional information regarding our purchase commitments with contract manufacturers and suppliers, see Note 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
WE DEPEND UPON THE DEVELOPMENT OF NEW PRODUCTS AND ENHANCEMENTS TO EXISTING PRODUCTS, AND IF WE FAIL TO PREDICT AND RESPOND TO EMERGING TECHNOLOGICAL TRENDS AND CUSTOMERS’ CHANGING NEEDS, OUR OPERATING RESULTS AND MARKET SHARE MAY SUFFER 

The markets for our products are characterized by rapidly changing technology, evolving industry standards, new product introductions, and evolving methods of building and operating networks.
Our operating results depend on our ability to develop and introduce new products into existing and emerging markets and to reduce the production costs of existing products.
Many of our strategic initiatives and investments we have made, and our architectural approach, are designed to enable the increased use of the network as the platform for automating, orchestrating, integrating, and delivering an ever-increasing array of IT-based products and services.
For example, in June 2017 we announced our Catalyst 9000 series of switches which represent the initial foundation of our intent-based networking capabilities.
Other current initiatives include our focus on security; the market transition related to digital transformation and IoT; the transition in cloud; and the move towards more programmable, flexible and virtual networks.
The process of developing new technology, including intent-based networking, more programmable, flexible and virtual networks, and technology related to other market transitions— such as security, digital transformation and IoT, and cloud— is complex and uncertain, and if we fail to accurately predict customers’ changing needs and emerging technological trends our business could be harmed.
We must commit significant resources, including the investments we have been making in our priorities to developing new products before knowing whether our investments will result in products the market will accept.
In particular, if our model of the evolution of networking does not emerge as we believe it will, or if the industry does not evolve as we believe it will, or if our strategy for addressing this evolution is not successful, many of our strategic initiatives and investments may be of no or limited value.
For example, if we do not introduce products related to network programmability, such as software-defined-networking products, in a timely fashion, or if product offerings in this market that ultimately succeed are based on technology, or an approach to technology, that differs from ours, such as, for example, networking products based on “white box” hardware, our business could be harmed.
Similarly, our business could be harmed if we fail to develop, or fail to develop in a timely fashion, offerings to address other transitions, or if the offerings addressing these other transitions that ultimately succeed are based on technology, or an approach to technology, different from ours.
In addition, our business could be adversely affected in periods surrounding our new product introductions if customers delay purchasing decisions to qualify or otherwise evaluate the new product offerings.
Our strategy is to lead our customers in their digital transition with solutions that deliver greater agility, productivity, security and other advanced network capabilities, and that intelligently connect nearly everything that can be connected.
Over the last few years, we have been transforming our business to move from selling individual products and services to selling products and services integrated into architectures and solutions, and we are seeking to meet the evolving needs of customers which include offering our products and solutions in the manner in which customers wish to consume them.
As a part of this transformation, we continue to make changes to how we are organized and how we build and deliver our technology, including changes in our business models with customers.
If our strategy for addressing our customer needs, or the architectures and solutions we develop do not meet those needs, or the changes we are making in how we are organized and how we build and deliver or technology is incorrect or ineffective, our business could be harmed.
Furthermore, we may not execute successfully on our vision or strategy because of challenges with regard to product planning and timing, technical hurdles that we fail to overcome in a timely fashion, or a lack of appropriate resources.
This could result in competitors, some of which may also be our strategic alliance partners, providing those solutions before we do and loss of market share, revenue, and earnings.
In addition, the growth in demand for technology delivered as a service enables new competitors to enter the market.
The success of new products depends on several factors, including proper new product definition, component costs, timely completion and introduction of these products, differentiation of new products from those of our competitors, and market acceptance of these products.
There can be no assurance that we will successfully identify new product opportunities, develop and bring new products to market in a timely manner, or achieve market acceptance of our products or that products and technologies developed by others will not render our products or technologies obsolete or noncompetitive.
The products and technologies in our other product categories and key priority and growth areas may not prove to have the market success we anticipate, and we may not successfully identify and invest in other emerging or new products.
CHANGES IN INDUSTRY STRUCTURE AND MARKET CONDITIONS COULD LEAD TO CHARGES RELATED TO DISCONTINUANCES OF CERTAIN OF OUR PRODUCTS OR BUSINESSES, ASSET IMPAIRMENTS AND WORKFORCE REDUCTIONS OR RESTRUCTURINGS

In response to changes in industry and market conditions, we may be required to strategically realign our resources and to consider restructuring, disposing of, or otherwise exiting businesses.
Any resource realignment, or decision to limit investment in or dispose 

of or otherwise exit businesses, may result in the recording of special charges, such as inventory and technology-related write-offs, workforce reduction or restructuring costs, charges relating to consolidation of excess facilities, or claims from third parties who were resellers or users of discontinued products.
Our estimates with respect to the useful life or ultimate recoverability of our carrying basis of assets, including purchased intangible assets, could change as a result of such assessments and decisions.
Although in certain instances our supply agreements allow us the option to cancel, reschedule, and adjust our requirements based on our business needs prior to firm orders being placed, our loss contingencies may include liabilities for contracts that we cannot cancel with contract manufacturers and suppliers.
Further, our estimates relating to the liabilities for excess facilities are affected by changes in real estate market conditions.
Additionally, we are required to perform goodwill impairment tests on an annual basis and between annual tests in certain circumstances, and future goodwill impairment tests may result in a charge to earnings.
We initiated a restructuring plan in the third quarter of fiscal 2018 and expanded it in the first quarter of fiscal 2019.
The implementation of this restructuring plan may be disruptive to our business, and following completion of the restructuring plan our business may not be more efficient or effective than prior to implementation of the plan.
Our restructuring activities, including any related charges and the impact of the related headcount restructurings, could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, and financial condition.
OVER THE LONG TERM WE INTEND TO INVEST IN ENGINEERING, SALES, SERVICE AND MARKETING ACTIVITIES, AND THESE INVESTMENTS MAY ACHIEVE DELAYED, OR LOWER THAN EXPECTED, BENEFITS WHICH COULD HARM OUR OPERATING RESULTS 

While we intend to focus on managing our costs and expenses, over the long term, we also intend to invest in personnel and other resources related to our engineering, sales, service and marketing functions as we realign and dedicate resources on key priority and growth areas, such as Security and Applications, and we also intend to focus on maintaining leadership in Infrastructure Platforms and in Services.
We are likely to recognize the costs associated with these investments earlier than some of the anticipated benefits, and the return on these investments may be lower, or may develop more slowly, than we expect.
If we do not achieve the benefits anticipated from these investments, or if the achievement of these benefits is delayed, our operating results may be adversely affected.
OUR BUSINESS SUBSTANTIALLY DEPENDS UPON THE CONTINUED GROWTH OF THE INTERNET AND INTERNET-BASED SYSTEMS 

A substantial portion of our business and revenue depends on growth and evolution of the Internet, including the continued development of the Internet and the anticipated market transitions, and on the deployment of our products by customers who depend on such continued growth and evolution.
To the extent that an economic slowdown or uncertainty and related reduction in capital spending adversely affect spending on Internet infrastructure, including spending or investment related to anticipated market transitions, we could experience material harm to our business, operating results, and financial condition.
Because of the rapid introduction of new products and changing customer requirements related to matters such as cost-effectiveness and security, we believe that there could be performance problems with Internet communications in the future, which could receive a high degree of publicity and visibility.
Because we are a large supplier of networking products, our business, operating results, and financial condition may be materially adversely affected, regardless of whether or not these problems are due to the performance of our own products.
Such an event could also result in a material adverse effect on the market price of our common stock independent of direct effects on our business.
WE HAVE MADE AND EXPECT TO CONTINUE TO MAKE ACQUISITIONS THAT COULD DISRUPT OUR OPERATIONS AND HARM OUR OPERATING RESULTS 



 • Diversion of management’s attention from normal daily operations of the business and the challenges of managing larger and more widespread operations resulting from acquisitions

 • Potential difficulties in completing projects associated with in-process research and development intangibles

 • Difficulties in entering markets in which we have no or limited direct prior experience and where competitors in such markets have stronger market positions

 • Initial dependence on unfamiliar supply chains or relatively small supply partners

 • Insufficient revenue to offset increased expenses associated with acquisitions

 • The potential loss of key employees, customers, distributors, vendors and other business partners of the companies we acquire following and continuing after announcement of acquisition plans


 • Issue common stock that would dilute our current shareholders’ percentage ownership

 • Use a substantial portion of our cash resources, or incur debt

 • Significantly increase our interest expense, leverage and debt service requirements if we incur additional debt to pay for an acquisition

 • Assume liabilities

 • Record goodwill and intangible assets that are subject to impairment testing on a regular basis and potential periodic impairment charges

 • Incur amortization expenses related to certain intangible assets

 • Incur tax expenses related to the effect of acquisitions on our legal structure

 • Incur large and immediate write-offs and restructuring and other related expenses

 • Become subject to intellectual property or other litigation

Mergers and acquisitions of high-technology companies are inherently risky and subject to many factors outside of our control, and no assurance can be given that our previous or future acquisitions will be successful and will not materially adversely affect our business, operating results, or financial condition.
Failure to manage and successfully integrate acquisitions could materially harm our business and operating results.
Prior acquisitions have resulted in a wide range of outcomes, from successful introduction of new products and technologies to a failure to do so.
Even when an acquired company has already developed and marketed products, there can be no assurance that product enhancements will be made in a timely fashion or that pre-acquisition due diligence will have identified all possible issues that might arise with respect to such products.
From time to time, we have made acquisitions that resulted in charges in an individual quarter.
These charges may occur in any particular quarter, resulting in variability in our quarterly earnings.
In addition, our effective tax rate for future periods is uncertain and could be impacted by mergers and acquisitions.
Risks related to new product development also apply to acquisitions.
See the risk factors above, including the risk factor entitled “We depend upon the development of new products and enhancements to existing products, and if we fail to predict and respond to emerging technological trends and customers’ changing needs, our operating results and market share may suffer” for additional information.
ENTRANCE INTO NEW OR DEVELOPING MARKETS EXPOSES US TO ADDITIONAL COMPETITION AND WILL LIKELY INCREASE DEMANDS ON OUR SERVICE AND SUPPORT OPERATIONS 

As we focus on new market opportunities and key priority and growth areas, we will increasingly compete with large telecommunications equipment suppliers as well as startup companies.
Several of our competitors may have greater resources, including technical and engineering resources, than we do.
Additionally, as customers in these markets complete infrastructure deployments, they may require greater levels of service, support, and financing than we have provided in the past, especially in emerging countries.
Demand for these types of service, support, or financing contracts may increase in the future.
There can be no assurance that we can provide products, service, support, and financing to effectively compete for these market opportunities.
Further, provision of greater levels of services, support and financing by us may result in a delay in the timing of revenue recognition.
In addition, entry into other markets has subjected and will subject us to additional risks, particularly to those markets, including the effects of general market conditions and reduced consumer confidence.
For example, as we add direct selling capabilities globally to meet changing customer demands, we will face increased legal and regulatory requirements.
INDUSTRY CONSOLIDATION MAY LEAD TO INCREASED COMPETITION AND MAY HARM OUR OPERATING RESULTS 

There has been a trend toward industry consolidation in our markets for several years.
We expect this trend to continue as companies attempt to strengthen or hold their market positions in an evolving industry and as companies are acquired or are unable to continue operations.
For example, some of our current and potential competitors for enterprise data center business have made acquisitions, or announced new strategic alliances, designed to position them with the ability to provide end-to-end technology solutions for the enterprise data center.
Companies that are strategic alliance partners in some areas of our business may acquire or form alliances with our competitors, thereby reducing their business with us.
We believe that industry consolidation may result in stronger competitors that are better able to compete as sole-source vendors for customers.
This could lead to more variability in our operating results and could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, and financial condition.
Furthermore, particularly in the service provider market, rapid consolidation will lead to fewer customers, with the effect that loss of a major customer could have a material impact on results not anticipated in a customer marketplace composed of more numerous participants.
PRODUCT QUALITY PROBLEMS COULD LEAD TO REDUCED REVENUE, GROSS MARGINS, AND NET INCOME 

We produce highly complex products that incorporate leading-edge technology, including both hardware and software.
Software typically contains bugs that can unexpectedly interfere with expected operations.
There can be no assurance that our pre-shipment testing programs will be adequate to detect all defects, either ones in individual products or ones that could affect numerous shipments, which might interfere with customer satisfaction, reduce sales opportunities, or affect gross margins.
From time to time, we have had to replace certain components and provide remediation in response to the discovery of defects or bugs in products that we had shipped.
There can be no assurance that such remediation, depending on the product involved, would not have a material impact.
An inability to cure a product defect could result in the failure of a product line, temporary or permanent withdrawal from a product or market, damage to our reputation, inventory costs, or product reengineering expenses, any of which could have a material impact on our revenue, margins, and net income.
For example, in the second quarter of fiscal 2017 we recorded a charge to product cost of sales of $125 million related to the expected remediation costs for anticipated failures in future periods of a widely-used component sourced from a third party which is included in several of our products, and in the second quarter of fiscal 2014 we recorded a pre-tax charge of $655 million related to the expected remediation costs for certain products sold in prior fiscal years containing memory components manufactured by a single supplier between 2005 and 2010.
DUE TO THE GLOBAL NATURE OF OUR OPERATIONS, POLITICAL OR ECONOMIC CHANGES OR OTHER FACTORS IN A SPECIFIC COUNTRY OR REGION COULD HARM OUR OPERATING RESULTS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION


 • Foreign currency exchange rates

 • Political or social unrest

 • Economic instability or weakness or natural disasters in a specific country or region, including the current economic challenges in China and global economic ramifications of Chinese economic difficulties; instability as a result of Brexit; environmental protection measures, trade protection measures such as tariffs, and other legal and regulatory requirements, some of which may affect our ability to import our products, to export our products from, or sell our products in various countries or affect our ability to procure components

 • Political considerations that affect service provider and government spending patterns

 • Health or similar issues, such as a pandemic or epidemic

 • Difficulties in staffing and managing international operations

 • Adverse tax consequences, including imposition of withholding or other taxes on our global operations

WE ARE EXPOSED TO THE CREDIT RISK OF SOME OF OUR CUSTOMERS AND TO CREDIT EXPOSURES IN WEAKENED MARKETS, WHICH COULD RESULT IN MATERIAL LOSSES 

Most of our sales are on an open credit basis, with typical payment terms of 30 days in the United States and, because of local customs or conditions, longer in some markets outside the United States.
We monitor individual customer payment capability in granting such open credit arrangements, seek to limit such open credit to amounts we believe the customers can pay, and maintain reserves we believe are adequate to cover exposure for doubtful accounts.
Beyond our open credit arrangements, we have also experienced demands for customer financing and facilitation of leasing arrangements.
We expect demand for customer financing to continue, and recently we have been experiencing an increase in this demand as the credit markets have been impacted by the challenging and inconsistent global macroeconomic environment, including increased demand from customers in certain emerging countries.
We believe customer financing is a competitive factor in obtaining business, particularly in serving customers involved in significant infrastructure projects.
Our loan financing arrangements may include not only financing the acquisition of our products and services but also providing additional funds for other costs associated with network installation and integration of our products and services.
Our exposure to the credit risks relating to our financing activities described above may increase if our customers are adversely affected by a global economic downturn or periods of economic uncertainty.
Although we have programs in place that are designed to monitor and mitigate the associated risk, including monitoring of particular risks in certain geographic areas, there can be no assurance that such programs will be effective in reducing our credit risks.
In the past, there have been significant bankruptcies among customers both on open credit and with loan or lease financing arrangements, particularly among Internet businesses and service providers, causing us to incur economic or financial losses.
There can be no assurance that additional losses will not be incurred.
Although these losses have not been material to date, future losses, if incurred, could harm our business and have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition.
A portion of our sales is derived through our distributors.
These distributors are generally given business terms that allow them to return a portion of inventory, receive credits for changes in selling prices, and participate in various cooperative marketing programs.
We maintain estimated accruals and allowances for such business terms.
However, distributors tend to have more limited financial resources than other resellers and end-user customers and therefore represent potential sources of increased credit risk, because they may be more likely to lack the reserve resources to meet payment obligations.
Additionally, to the degree that turmoil in the credit markets makes it more difficult for some customers to obtain financing, those customers’ ability to pay could be adversely impacted, which in turn could have a material adverse impact on our business, operating results, and financial condition.
Our portfolio includes available-for-sale debt investments and equity investments, the values of which are subject to market price volatility to the extent unhedged.
Available-for-sale debt investments are recorded on our Consolidated Balance Sheets at fair value with unrealized gains or losses reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), net of tax.
If such investments suffer market price declines, as we experienced with some of our investments in the past, we may recognize in earnings the decline in the fair value of our investments below their cost basis when the decline is judged to be other than temporary.
Securities classified as marketable equity are recorded on our Consolidated Balance Sheets at fair value with gains or losses recorded to interest and other income (loss), net.
Our non-marketable equity and other investments are subject to risk of loss of investment capital.
These investments are inherently risky because the markets for the technologies or products they have under development are typically in the early stages and may never materialize.
We could lose our entire investment in these companies.
For information regarding the market risks associated with the fair value of portfolio investments and interest rates, refer to the section titled “Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.” 

WE ARE EXPOSED TO FLUCTUATIONS IN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES THAT COULD NEGATIVELY IMPACT OUR FINANCIAL RESULTS AND CASH FLOWS 

Because a significant portion of our business is conducted outside the United States, we face exposure to adverse movements in foreign currency exchange rates.
These exposures may change over time as business practices evolve, and they could have a material adverse impact on our financial results and cash flows.
Historically, our primary exposures have related to nondollar-denominated sales in Japan, Canada, and Australia and certain nondollar-denominated operating expenses and service cost of sales in Europe, Latin America, and Asia, where we sell primarily in U.S. dollars.
Additionally, we have exposures to emerging market currencies, which can have extreme currency volatility.
An increase in the value of the dollar could increase the real cost to our customers of our products in those markets outside the United States where we sell in dollars and a weakened dollar could increase the cost of local operating expenses and procurement of raw materials to the extent that we must purchase components in foreign currencies.
Currently, we enter into foreign exchange forward contracts and options to reduce the short-term impact of foreign currency fluctuations on certain foreign currency receivables, investments, and payables.
In addition, we periodically hedge anticipated foreign currency cash flows.
Our attempts to hedge against these risks may result in an adverse impact on our net income.
OUR PROPRIETARY RIGHTS MAY PROVE DIFFICULT TO ENFORCE 

We generally rely on patents, copyrights, trademarks, and trade secret laws to establish and maintain proprietary rights in our technology and products.
Although we have been issued numerous patents and other patent applications are currently pending, there can be no assurance that any of these patents or other proprietary rights will not be challenged, invalidated, or circumvented or that our rights will, in fact, provide competitive advantages to us.
Furthermore, many key aspects of networking technology are governed by industrywide standards, which are usable by all market entrants.
In addition, there can be no assurance that patents will be issued from pending applications or that claims allowed on any patents will be sufficiently broad to protect our technology.
In addition, the laws of some foreign countries may not protect our proprietary rights to the same extent as do the laws of the United States.
The outcome of any actions taken in these foreign countries may be different than if such actions were determined under the laws of the United States.
Although we are not dependent on any individual patents or group of patents for particular segments of the business for which we compete, if we are unable to protect our proprietary rights to the totality of the features (including aspects of products protected other than by patent rights) in a market, we may find ourselves at a competitive disadvantage to others who need not incur the substantial expense, time, and effort required to create innovative products that have enabled us to be successful.
WE MAY BE FOUND TO INFRINGE ON INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS OF OTHERS 


Our exposure to risks associated with the use of intellectual property may be increased as a result of acquisitions, as we have a lower level of visibility into the development process with respect to such technology or the care taken to safeguard against infringement risks.
Further, in the past, third parties have made infringement and similar claims after we have acquired technology that had not been asserted prior to our acquisition.
WE RELY ON THE AVAILABILITY OF THIRD-PARTY LICENSES 

Many of our products are designed to include software or other intellectual property licensed from third parties.
It may be necessary in the future to seek or renew licenses relating to various aspects of these products.
There can be no assurance that the necessary licenses would be available on acceptable terms, if at all.
The inability to obtain certain licenses or other rights or to obtain such licenses or rights on favorable terms, or the need to engage in litigation regarding these matters, could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, and financial condition.
Moreover, the inclusion in our products of software or other intellectual property licensed from third parties on a nonexclusive basis could limit our ability to protect our proprietary rights in our products.
OUR OPERATING RESULTS MAY BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED AND DAMAGE TO OUR REPUTATION MAY OCCUR DUE TO PRODUCTION AND SALE OF COUNTERFEIT VERSIONS OF OUR PRODUCTS

As is the case with leading products around the world, our products are subject to efforts by third parties to produce counterfeit versions of our products.
While we work diligently with law enforcement authorities in various countries to block the manufacture of counterfeit goods and to interdict their sale, and to detect counterfeit products in customer networks, and have succeeded in prosecuting counterfeiters and their distributors, resulting in fines, imprisonment and restitution to us, there can be no guarantee that such efforts will succeed.
While counterfeiters often aim their sales at customers who might not have otherwise purchased our products due to lack of verifiability of origin and service, such counterfeit sales, to the extent they replace otherwise legitimate sales, could adversely affect our operating results.
OUR OPERATING RESULTS AND FUTURE PROSPECTS COULD BE MATERIALLY HARMED BY UNCERTAINTIES OF REGULATION OF THE INTERNET 

Currently, few laws or regulations apply directly to access or commerce on the Internet.
We could be materially adversely affected by regulation of the Internet and Internet commerce in any country where we operate.
Such regulations could include matters such as voice over the Internet or using IP, encryption technology, sales or other taxes on Internet product or service sales, and access charges for Internet service providers.
The adoption of regulation of the Internet and Internet commerce could decrease demand for our products and, at the same time, increase the cost of selling our products, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, and financial condition.
CHANGES IN TELECOMMUNICATIONS REGULATION AND TARIFFS COULD HARM OUR PROSPECTS AND FUTURE SALES 

Changes in telecommunications requirements, or regulatory requirements in other industries in which we operate, in the United States or other countries could affect the sales of our products.
In particular, we believe that there may be future changes in U.S. telecommunications regulations that could slow the expansion of the service providers’ network infrastructures and materially adversely affect our business, operating results, and financial condition, including "net neutrality" rules to the extent they impact decisions on investment in network infrastructure.
Future changes in tariffs by regulatory agencies or application of tariff requirements to currently untariffed services could affect the sales of our products for certain classes of customers.
Additionally, in the United States, our products must comply with various requirements and regulations of the Federal Communications Commission and other regulatory authorities.
In countries outside of the United States, our products must meet various requirements of local telecommunications and other industry authorities.
Changes in tariffs or failure by us to obtain timely approval of products could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, and financial condition.
FAILURE TO RETAIN AND RECRUIT KEY PERSONNEL WOULD HARM OUR ABILITY TO MEET KEY OBJECTIVES 

Our success has always depended in large part on our ability to attract and retain highly skilled technical, managerial, sales, and marketing personnel.
Competition for these personnel is intense, especially in the Silicon Valley area of Northern California.
Stock incentive plans are designed to reward employees for their long-term contributions and provide incentives for them to remain with us.
Volatility or lack of positive performance in our stock price or equity incentive awards, or changes to our overall compensation program, including our stock incentive program, resulting from the management of share dilution and share-based compensation expense or otherwise, may also adversely affect our ability to retain key employees.
As a result of one or more of these factors, we may increase our hiring in geographic areas outside the United States, which could subject us to additional geopolitical and exchange rate risk.
The loss of services of any of our key personnel; the inability to retain and attract qualified personnel in the future; or delays in hiring required personnel, particularly engineering and sales personnel, could make it difficult to meet key objectives, such as timely and effective product introductions.
In addition, companies in our industry whose employees accept positions with competitors frequently claim that competitors have engaged in improper hiring practices.
We have received these claims in the past and may receive additional claims to this effect in the future.
Litigation can be expensive, lengthy, and disruptive to normal business operations.
Moreover, the results of complex legal proceedings are difficult to predict.
For example, Brazilian authorities have investigated our Brazilian subsidiary and certain of its former employees, as well as a Brazilian importer of our products, and its affiliates and employees, relating to alleged evasion of import taxes and alleged improper transactions involving the subsidiary and the importer.
Brazilian tax authorities have assessed claims against our Brazilian subsidiary based on a theory of joint liability with the Brazilian importer for import taxes, interest, and penalties.
The asserted claims by Brazilian federal tax authorities which remain are for calendar years 2003 through 2007, and the asserted claims by the tax authorities from the state of Sao Paulo are for calendar years 2005 through 2007.
The total asserted claims by Brazilian state and federal tax authorities aggregate to $206 million for the alleged evasion of import and other taxes, $1.3 billion for interest, and $1.0 billion for various penalties, all determined using an exchange rate as of April 27, 2019.
We have completed a thorough review of the matters and believe the asserted claims against our Brazilian subsidiary are without merit, and we are defending the claims vigorously.
While we believe there is no legal basis for the alleged liability, due to the complexities and uncertainty surrounding the judicial process in Brazil and the nature of the claims asserting joint liability with the importer, we are unable to determine the likelihood of an unfavorable outcome against our Brazilian subsidiary and are unable to reasonably estimate a range of loss, if any.
We do not expect a final judicial determination for several years.
An unfavorable resolution of lawsuits or governmental investigations could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, or financial condition.
For additional information regarding certain of the matters in which we are involved, see Note 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, subsection (g) “Legal Proceedings.”

CHANGES IN OUR PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES OR ADVERSE OUTCOMES RESULTING FROM EXAMINATION OF OUR INCOME TAX RETURNS COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR RESULTS 

Our provision for income taxes is subject to volatility and could be adversely affected by earnings being lower than anticipated in countries that have lower tax rates and higher than anticipated in countries that have higher tax rates; by changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities; by changes to domestic manufacturing deduction, foreign-derived intangible income, global intangible low-tax income and base erosion and anti-abuse tax laws, regulations, or interpretations thereof; by expiration of or lapses in tax incentives; by transfer pricing adjustments, including the effect of acquisitions on our legal structure; by tax effects of nondeductible compensation; by tax costs related to intercompany realignments; by changes in accounting principles; or by changes in tax laws and regulations, treaties, or interpretations thereof, including changes to the taxation of earnings of our foreign subsidiaries, the deductibility of expenses attributable to foreign income, and the foreign tax credit rules.
Significant judgment is required to determine the recognition and measurement attribute prescribed in the accounting guidance for uncertainty in income taxes.
The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), an international association comprised of 36 countries, including the United States, has made changes to numerous long-standing tax principles.
There can be no assurance that these changes, once adopted by countries, will not have an adverse impact on our provision for income taxes.
Further, as a result of certain of our ongoing employment and capital investment actions and commitments, our income in certain countries is subject to reduced tax rates.
Our failure to meet these commitments could adversely impact our provision for income taxes.
In addition, we are subject to the continuous examination of our income tax returns by the Internal Revenue Service and other tax authorities.
We regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes.
There can be no assurance that the outcomes from these continuous examinations will not have an adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition.
OUR BUSINESS AND OPERATIONS ARE ESPECIALLY SUBJECT TO THE RISKS OF EARTHQUAKES, FLOODS, AND OTHER NATURAL CATASTROPHIC EVENTS 

Our corporate headquarters, including certain of our research and development operations are located in the Silicon Valley area of Northern California, a region known for seismic activity.
Additionally, a certain number of our facilities are located near rivers that have experienced flooding in the past.
Also certain of our suppliers and logistics centers are located in regions that have been or may be affected by earthquake, tsunami and flooding activity which in the past has disrupted, and in the future could disrupt, the flow of components and delivery of products.
A significant natural disaster, such as an earthquake, a hurricane, volcano, or a flood, could have a material adverse impact on our business, operating results, and financial condition.
We may also make prioritization decisions in determining which vulnerabilities or security defects to fix, and the timing of these fixes, which could result in an exploit which compromises security.
Customers also need to test security releases before they can be deployed which can delay implementation.
In addition, we rely on third-party providers of software and cloud-based service and we cannot control the rate at which they remedy vulnerabilities.
Customers may also not deploy a security release, or decide not to upgrade to the latest versions of our products, services or cloud-based solutions containing the release, leaving them vulnerable.
Vulnerabilities and critical security defects, prioritization errors in remedying vulnerabilities or security defects, failure of third-party providers to remedy vulnerabilities or security defects, or customers not deploying security releases or deciding not to upgrade products, services or solutions could result in claims of liability against us, damage our reputation or otherwise harm our business.
TERRORISM AND OTHER EVENTS MAY HARM OUR BUSINESS, OPERATING RESULTS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION

The continued threat of terrorism and heightened security and military action in response to this threat, or any future acts of terrorism, may cause further disruptions to the economies of the United States and other countries and create further uncertainties or otherwise materially harm our business, operating results, and financial condition.
Likewise, events such as loss of infrastructure and utilities services such as energy, transportation, or telecommunications could have similar negative impacts.
To the extent that such disruptions or uncertainties result in delays or cancellations of customer orders or the manufacture or shipment of our products, our business, operating results, and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected.
IF WE DO NOT SUCCESSFULLY MANAGE OUR STRATEGIC ALLIANCES, WE MAY NOT REALIZE THE EXPECTED BENEFITS FROM SUCH ALLIANCES AND WE MAY EXPERIENCE INCREASED COMPETITION OR DELAYS IN PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT 

We have several strategic alliances with large and complex organizations and other companies with which we work to offer complementary products and services and in the past have established a joint venture to market services associated with our Cisco Unified Computing System products.
These arrangements are generally limited to specific projects, the goal of which is generally to facilitate product compatibility and adoption of industry standards.
There can be no assurance we will realize the expected benefits from these strategic alliances or from the joint venture.
If successful, these relationships may be mutually beneficial and result in industry growth.
However, alliances carry an element of risk because, in most cases, we must compete in some business areas with a company with which we have a strategic alliance and, at the same time, cooperate with that company in other business areas.
Also, if these companies fail to perform or if these relationships fail to materialize as expected, we could suffer delays in product development or other operational difficulties.
Joint ventures can be difficult to manage, given the potentially different interests of joint venture partners.
OUR STOCK PRICE MAY BE VOLATILE 

Historically, our common stock has experienced substantial price volatility, particularly as a result of variations between our actual financial results and the published expectations of analysts and as a result of announcements by our competitors and us.
Furthermore, speculation in the press or investment community about our strategic position, financial condition, results of operations, business, security of our products, or significant transactions can cause changes in our stock price.
In addition, the stock market has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have affected the market price of many technology companies, in particular, and that have often been unrelated to the operating performance of these companies.
These factors, as well as general economic and political conditions and the announcement of proposed and completed acquisitions or other significant transactions, or any difficulties associated with such transactions, by us or our current or potential competitors, may materially adversely affect the market price of our common stock in the future.
Additionally, volatility, lack of positive performance in our stock price or changes to our overall compensation program, including our stock incentive program, may adversely affect our ability to retain key employees, virtually all of whom are compensated, in part, based on the performance of our stock price.
THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT OUR OPERATING RESULTS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION WILL NOT BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY OUR INCURRENCE OF DEBT 

As of the end of the third quarter of fiscal 2019, we have senior unsecured notes outstanding in an aggregate principal amount of $20.5 billion that mature at specific dates from calendar year 2019 through 2040.
We have also established a commercial paper program under which we may issue short-term, unsecured commercial paper notes on a private placement basis up to a maximum aggregate amount outstanding at any time of $10.0 billion, and we had $3.3 billion in commercial paper notes outstanding under this program as of April 27, 2019.
The outstanding senior unsecured notes bear fixed-rate interest payable semiannually, except $0.5 billion of the notes which bears interest at a floating rate payable quarterly.
The fair value of the long-term debt is subject to market interest rate volatility.
The instruments governing the senior unsecured notes contain certain covenants applicable to us and our wholly-owned subsidiaries that may adversely affect our ability to incur certain liens or engage in certain types of sale and leaseback transactions.
In addition, we will be required to have available in the United States sufficient cash to service the interest on our debt and repay all of our notes on maturity.
There can be no assurance that our incurrence of this debt or any future debt will be a better means of providing liquidity to us than would our use of our existing cash resources.
Further, we cannot be assured that our maintenance of this indebtedness or incurrence of future indebtedness will not adversely affect our operating results or financial condition.
In addition, changes by any rating agency to our credit rating can negatively impact the value and liquidity of both our debt and equity securities, as well as the terms upon which we may borrow under our commercial paper program or future debt issuances.
Item 2.Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds





On September 13, 2001, we announced that our Board of Directors had authorized a stock repurchase program.
On February 13, 2019, our Board of Directors authorized a $15 billion increase to the stock repurchase program.
The remaining authorized amount for stock repurchases under this program, including the additional authorization, is approximately $18 billion, with no termination date.
For the majority of restricted stock units granted, the number of shares issued on the date the restricted stock units vest is net of shares withheld to meet applicable tax withholding requirements.
Although these withheld shares are not issued or considered common stock repurchases under our stock repurchase program and therefore are not included in the preceding table, they are treated as common stock repurchases in our financial statements as they reduce the number of shares that would have been issued upon vesting (see Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements).
