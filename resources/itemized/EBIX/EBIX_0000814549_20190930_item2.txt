Results of Operations — Three Months Ended September 30, 2019 and 2018 

Operating Revenue 

The Company derives its revenues primarily from subscription and transaction fees pertaining to services delivered over our exchanges or from our application service provider "ASP" platforms, fees for business process outsourcing services, and fees for software development projects including associated fees for consulting, implementation, training, and project management provided to customers with installed systems, e-governance solutions to governmental agencies in the health and education sectors, as well as foreign exchange, remittance (both inward and outward) and related services, including travel, from our new financial exchange.
International revenue accounted for 69.4% and 62.4% of the Company’s total revenue for the three months ended September 30, 2019 and 2018, respectively.
In the table above for the three months ending September 30, 2019 and 2018 respectfully, there is $3.8 million, and $2.1 million of Insurance Exchange revenues derived in India that are being reported within the EbixCash Exchange channel only above.
Similarly, for the nine months ending September 30, 2019 and 2018 respectfully, there is $13.1 million, and $2.1 million of Insurance Exchange revenues derived in India that are being reported within the EbixCash Exchange channel only above.
During the three months ended September 30, 2019 our total operating revenues increased $18.6 million or 14%, to $147.2 million as compared to $128.6 million during the third quarter of 2018.
The year-over-year revenues primarily increased as a result of the growth in the EbixCash segment as well as the acquisitions in the travel, foreign exchange, and software solutions sectors during the last twelve months offset by reductions in revenues from the insurance consulting business, EbixHealth JV, and e-governance service contracts executed within the Ebix Vayam Limited JV for Bharat Sanchar Nigam Limited "BSNL" (a leading public sector undertaking in the telecommunication sector in India).
Reported revenues were impacted by the continuing weakening in the foreign currencies in which we conduct operations (particularly in India, Australia, and United Kingdom) as compared to the strengthening of the U.S. dollar.
Specifically, the adverse impact from fluctuations of the exchange rates for the foreign currencies in the countries in which we conduct operations, in the aggregate, reduced reported revenues by $1.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2019.
With respect to business acquisitions completed during the years 2019 and 2018 on a pro forma basis, as disclosed in the pro forma financial information table in Note 3, combined revenues increased 5.2% for the three months ending September 30, 2019 versus the same periods in 2018.
The 2019 and 2018 pro forma financial information assumes that all business acquisitions made during this period were made on January 1, 2018, whereas the Company's reported condensed consolidated financial statements for the three months ended September 30, 2019 only includes the revenues from these businesses since the effective date that they were acquired or consolidated by Ebix, being February 2018 for Transcorp, April 2018 for Centrum, April 2018 for Smartclass, July 2018 for Indus, July 2018 for Mercury, July 2018 for Leisure, August 2018 for Miles, October 2018 for Routier, October 2018 for Business Travels, October 2018 for Aha Taxis, December 2018 for Pearl, Weizmann, January 2019 for Zillious, January 2019 for Essel and August 2019 for Wallstreet Canada.
Revenues for the three months ended September 30, 2019 and 2018 actual and proforma include $198 thousand and $2.6 million revenue, respectively, from the e-governance business.
The company has consciously decided to disengage in the e-governance business, leading to an actual and pro forma year-over-year decrease of revenue of $2.4 million in this revenue source.
•2019 and 2018 pro forma revenue contains actual revenue of the acquired entities before acquisition date, as reported by the sellers, as well as actual revenue of the acquired entities after acquisition, whereas the reported growth in revenues of the acquired entities after acquisition date are only reflected for the period after their acquisition.
•Revenue billed to existing clients from the cross selling of acquired products has been assigned to the acquired section of our business.

The increase in the Company's costs of services provided is due primarily to additional personnel, consulting, customer support, and merchant bank service fee costs associated with the Company's India business acquisitions over the last few years in the travel, foreign exchange, and software solutions sectors offset by reductions in our U.S. consulting salary costs, customer support costs in our EbixHealth JV, and a reduction of our e-governance service contracts executed within the Ebix Vayam Limited JV.
Product Development Expenses

The Company’s product development efforts are focused on the development of new technologies for insurance carriers, brokers and agents, and the development of new data exchanges for use in the insurance industry, and across the travel and currency exchange sectors.
Product development expenses increased $235 thousand or 2% to $11.2 million during the third quarter of 2019 as compared to $11.0 million during the third quarter of 2018 primarily due to increased employee-related insurance costs in our expanding India operations.
Sales and Marketing Expenses

Payment of these receivables has been delayed due to liquidity issues at BSNL.
The Government of India has recently approved funding to BSNL and he Company expects the accounts to be collectible once the Government funding reaches BSNL.

Reported revenues were impacted by the continuing weakening in the foreign currencies in which we conduct operations (particularly in India, Australia, and United Kingdom) as compared to the strengthening of the U.S. dollar.

The Company expects its full year effective tax rate to be in the range of 6% to 7%.
Liquidity and Capital Resources

The Company's ability to generate significant cash flows from ongoing operating activities is one of its fundamental financial strengths.
Our principal sources of liquidity are the cash flows provided by the Company's operating activities, the Company's commercial banking credit facility, and cash and cash equivalents on hand.
Due to the effect of temporary or timing 

differences resulting from the differing treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes (including the treatment of net operating loss carry-forwards and minimum alternative tax obligations in the U.S., United Kingdom, and India), future cash outlays for income taxes are expected to exceed income tax expense.
We intend to utilize cash flows generated by our operations, in combination with our commercial bank credit facility, and the possible issuance of additional equity or debt securities, to fund capital expenditures and organic growth initiatives, to make strategically accretive business acquisitions, and to re-purchase shares of our common stock as market conditions warrant.
We believe that anticipated cash flows provided by our operating activities, together with current cash and cash equivalent balances, access to our credit facilities, and access to the capital markets, if required and available, will be sufficient to meet our projected cash requirements for the foreseeable future, although any projections of future cash needs, cash flows, and the condition of the capital markets in general, as to the availability of debt and equity financing, are subject to substantial uncertainty.
Our cash and cash equivalents were $124.2 million and $147.8 million at September 30, 2019 and December 31, 2018, respectively.
The $4.2 million of restricted fiduciary funds is associated with the EbixHealth JV and pertains to un-remitted insurance premiums and claim funds established for the benefit of various carriers which are held in a fiduciary capacity until disbursed.
Our current ratio increased to 1.50 at September 30, 2019 from 1.35 at December 31, 2018 and our working capital position increased to $126.7 million at September 30, 2019 from $110.0 million at the end of 2018.

Recent Accounting Pronouncements

For information about new accounting pronouncements and the potential impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements, see Note 1 of the condensed notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-Q and Note 1 of the notes to consolidated financial statements in our 2018 Form 10-K.
Application of Critical Accounting Policies 

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP, as promulgated in the United States, requires our management to make significant estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, revenues and expenses and related disclosures in our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements and accompanying notes.
We believe the most complex and sensitive judgments, because of their significance to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements, result primarily from the need to make estimates and assumptions about the effects of matters that are inherently uncertain.
The following accounting policies involve the use of “critical accounting estimates” because they are particularly dependent on estimates and 

assumptions made by management about matters that are uncertain at the time the accounting estimates are made.
In addition, while we have used our best estimates based on facts and circumstances available to us at the time, different estimates reasonably could have been used in the current period, and changes in the accounting estimates that we used are reasonably likely to occur from period to period both of which may have a material impact on our financial condition and results of operations.
For additional information about these policies, see Note 1 of the Condensed Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-Q.
Although we believe that our estimates, assumptions and judgments are reasonable, they are limited based upon information presently available.
Actual results may differ significantly from these estimates under different assumptions, judgments or conditions.
Revenue Recognition

The Company derives its revenues primarily from software subscription and transaction fees, software license fees, financial transaction fees, risk compliance solution services fees, and professional service fees including associated fees for consulting, implementation, training, and project management provided to customers with installed systems and applications.
•identification of the contract, or contracts, with a customer;

•identification of the performance obligations in the contract;

•determination of the transaction price;

•allocation of the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract; and

•recognition of revenue when, or as, we satisfy a performance obligation.
EbixCash Exchanges ("EbixCash") 

EbixCash revenues are primarily derived from consideration paid by customers to transfer or exchange money.
The significant majority of EbixCash revenue is for a single performance obligation and is recognized at a point in time.
These revenues vary by transaction based upon channel, send and receive locations, the principal amount sent, whether the money transfer involves different send and receive currencies, and speed of service, as applicable.
EbixCash also offers several other services, primarily including payment services and ticketing and travel services for which revenue is impacted by varying factors.
EbixCash acts as the principal in transactions and reports revenue on a gross basis, as EbixCash controls the service at all times prior to transfer to the customer, is primarily responsible for fulfilling the customer contracts, has the risk of loss, and has the ability to establish transaction prices.
EbixCash Money Transfer


Foreign Exchange and Outward Remittance Services

For EbixCash’s foreign exchange and payment services, customers agree to terms and conditions for all transactions, either at the time of initiating a transaction or signing a contract with EbixCash to provide payment services on the customer’s behalf.
In the majority of EbixCash’s foreign exchange and payment services, EbixCash makes payments to the recipient to satisfy its performance obligation to the customer, and therefore, EbixCash recognizes revenue on foreign exchange and payment services when this performance obligation has been fulfilled.
Consumer Payment Services


EbixCash Travel Exchanges

EbixCash Travel revenues are primarily derived from commissions and transaction fees received from various travel providers and international exchanges involved in the sale of travel to the consumer.
EbixCash travel revenue is for a single performance obligation and is recognized at a point in time.
Travel revenues include reservation commissions and transaction net revenues (i.e., the amount charged to travelers less the amount owed to travel service providers) in connection with our reservation services; ancillary fees, including travel insurance-related revenues and certain reservation booking fees; and credit card processing rebates and customer processing fees.
EbixCash Travel services include the sale of hotel rooms, airline tickets, bus tickets and train tickets.
EbixCash’s Travel revenue is derived from ticket sales, wherein the commissions payable to EbixCash Travel, along with any transaction fees paid by travel providers and travel exchanges, is recognized as revenue after completion of the service.
The transaction price on such services is agreed upon at the time of the purchase.
EbixCash Travel revenue for the corporate MICE (Meetings, Incentives, Conferences, and Exhibitions) packages is recognized at full purchase value at the completion of the obligation with the corresponding costs recorded under direct expenses.
For MICE revenues, EbixCash Travel acts as the principal in transactions, and accordingly reports revenue on a gross basis.
EbixCash Travel controls the service at all times prior to transfer to the customer, is responsible for fulfilling the customer contracts, has the risk of loss, and has the ability to establish transaction prices.
Gift Cards

EbixCash resells gift cards to consumers that can be later redeemed at various merchants.
Gift cards are recorded as inventory until sold to the consumer.
Gift card revenue is recognized at full purchase value at time of sale with the corresponding cost of vouchers recorded under direct expenses.
Insurance Exchanges


Contracts generally do not contain a right of return or refund provisions.
Our contracts often do contain overage fees, contingent fees, or service level penalties which are accounted for as variable consideration.
Revenue accounted for as variable consideration is immaterial and is recognized using the “right to invoice” practical expedient when the invoiced amount equals the value provided to the customer.
Software-as-a-Service ("SaaS")

The Company allocates the transaction price to each distinct performance obligation using the relative stand-alone selling price.
Determining the stand-alone selling price may require significant judgement.
The stand-alone selling price is the price at which an entity has sold or would sell a promised good or service separately to a customer.
The Company determines the stand-alone selling price based on observable price of products or service sold separately in comparable circumstances, when such observable prices are available.
When standalone selling price is not directly observable, the Company estimates the stand-alone selling price using the market assessment approach by considering historical pricing and other market factors.
Subscription Services

Subscription services revenues are associated with performance obligations that are satisfied over specific time periods and primarily consist of fees that provide customers access to our SaaS platforms.
Revenue is generally recognized ratably over the contract term.
Our subscription contracts are generally for an initial three-year period with subsequent one-year automatic renewals.
Transaction Fees

Transaction revenue is comprised of fees applied to the volume of transactions that are processed through our SaaS platforms.
These are typically based on a per-transaction rate and are invoiced for the same period in which the transactions were processed and as the performance obligation is satisfied.
The amount invoiced generally equals the value provided to the customer, and revenue is typically recognized when invoiced using the as-invoiced practical expedient.
Professional Services

Professional service revenue primarily consists of fees for setup, customization, training, or consulting.
Professional service fees are generally on a time and materials basis or a fixed fee.
Revenues for time and materials are recognized as such services are rendered while fixed fee revenues are recognized based on the input method driven by the expected hours to complete the project measured against the actual hours completed to date.
Professional services, particularly related to SaaS platforms, may have significant dependencies on the related licensed software and may not be considered a distinct performance obligation.
Risk Compliance Services ("RCS") 

RCS revenues consist of two revenue streams—Certificates of Insurance (COI) and Consulting Services.
COI revenues are derived from consideration paid by customers for the creation and tracking of certificates of insurance.
These are transactional-based revenues.
Consulting Services revenues are driven by distinct consulting service engagements rendered to customers for which revenues are recognized using the output method on a time and material basis as the services are performed.
COI Creation and Tracking

The Company provides services to issue and track certificates of insurance in the United States and Australian markets.
Revenue is derived from transaction fees for each certificate issued or tracked.
The Company recognizes revenue at the issuance of each certificate or over the period the certificate is being tracked.
Consulting Services

The Company provides consulting services to clients around the world for project management and development.
Consulting services fees are generally on a time and materials basis or a fixed fee.
Revenues for time and materials are recognized as the services are rendered while fixed fee revenues are recognized based on the input method driven by the expected hours to complete the project measured against the actual hours completed to date.
Allowance for Doubtful Accounts Receivable

Management specifically analyzes accounts receivable and historical bad debts, write-offs, customer concentrations, customer credit-worthiness, current economic trends and changes in our customer payment terms when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts.
Valuation of Goodwill and Other Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets

Goodwill represents the cost in excess of the fair value of the net assets of acquired businesses.
Indefinite-lived intangible assets represent the fair value of acquired contractual customer relationships for which future cash flows are expected to continue 

indefinitely.
In accordance with the relevant FASB accounting guidance, goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets are not amortized but are tested for impairment at the reporting unit level on an annual basis or on an interim basis if an event occurs or circumstances change that would likely have reduced the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value.
Potential impairment indicators include a significant change in the business climate, legal factors, operating performance indicators, competition, and the sale or disposition of a significant portion of the business.
The impairment evaluation process first involves an assessment of certain qualitative factors to determine whether the existence of events or circumstances would indicate that it is more likely than not that the fair value of any of our reporting units was less than its carrying amount.
If, after assessing the totality of events or circumstances, we were to determine that it is not more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, then we would not perform the quantitative impairment testing described further below.
The aforementioned quantitative testing process involves comparing the reporting unit carrying values to their respective fair values.
We determine the fair value of our reporting units by applying the discounted cash flow method using the present value of future estimated net cash flows.
If the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying value, then no further testing is required.
However, if a reporting unit's fair value were to be less than its carrying value, we would then determine the amount of the impairment charge, if any, which would be the amount that the carrying value of the reporting unit's goodwill exceeded its implied value.
Projections of cash flows are based on our views of growth rates, operating costs, anticipated future economic conditions and the appropriate discount rates relative to risk and estimates of residual values.
We believe that our estimates are consistent with assumptions that marketplace participants would use in their estimates of fair value.
The use of different estimates or assumptions for our projected discounted cash flows (e.g., growth rates, future economic conditions, discount rates and estimates of terminal values) when determining the fair value of our reporting units could result in different values and may result in a goodwill impairment charge.
We perform our annual goodwill impairment evaluation and testing as of October 1st of each year.
This evaluation is done during the fourth quarter each year.
During the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 we had no impairment of our reporting unit goodwill balances.
Income Taxes

Deferred income taxes are recorded to reflect the estimated future tax effects of differences between financial statement and tax basis of assets, liabilities, operating losses, and tax credit carry forwards using the tax rates expected to be in effect when the temporary differences reverse.
Valuation allowances, if any, are recorded to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount management considers more likely than not to be realized.
Such valuation allowances are recorded for the portion of the deferred tax assets that are not expected to be realized based on the levels of historical taxable income and projections for future taxable income over the periods in which the temporary differences will be deductible.
The Company also applies FASB accounting guidance on accounting for uncertainty in income taxes positions.
This guidance clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes by prescribing the minimum recognition threshold a tax position is required to meet before being recognized in the financial statements.
Foreign Currency Matters

The functional currency is the U.S. Dollar for the Company's foreign subsidiaries in Dubai and Singapore, and its product development and information technology enabled services activities for the insurance industry provided by its India subsidiary, because both the intellectual property research and development activities provided by its Dubai and Singapore subsidiaries, and the product development and information technology enabled services activities for the insurance industry provided by its India subsidiary, are in support of the Company's operating divisions across the world, which are primarily transacted in U.S.
Dollars.
The functional currency of the Company's other foreign subsidiaries is the local currency of the country in which the subsidiary operates.
The assets and liabilities of these foreign subsidiaries are translated into U.S. dollars at the rates of exchange at the balance sheet dates.
Income and expense accounts are translated at the average exchange rates in effect during the period.
Gains and losses resulting from translation adjustments are included as a component of other comprehensive income in the accompanying Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets.
Foreign exchange transaction gains and losses that are derived from transactions denominated in a currency other than the subsidiary's functional currency are included in the determination of net income.
