Results of Operations — Three Months Ended March 31, 2018 and 2017 

Operating Revenue 

The Company derives its revenues primarily from subscription and transaction fees pertaining to services delivered over our exchanges or from our application service provider (“ASP”) platforms, fees for business process outsourcing services, and fees for software development projects including associated fees for consulting, implementation, training, and project management provided to customers with installed systems, e-governance solutions to governmental agencies in the health and education sectors, 

as well as remittance and related services, including travel, from our new financial exchange.
International revenue accounted for 53.9% and 34.0% of the Company’s total revenue for the three months ended March 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively.
The Company is continuing to evaluate the classification of the 2017 acquisitions that collectively make up the EbixCash Financial Exchanges, refer to Part I, Item I Business in our Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2017.
Currently they are reported under Exchange channel, but is subject to change based on the conclusions of our evaluations.
During the three months ended March 31, 2018 our total operating revenues increased $29.1 million or 37%, to $108.2 million as compared to $79.1 million during the first quarter of 2017.
The year-over-year revenues primarily increased as a result

of the Company's acquisitions of Via, YouFirst and ItzCash.
During the three months ended March 31, 2018 the Company's reported total operating revenues increased by $29.1 million or 37% to $108.2 million as compared to $79.1 million during the same period in 2017.
With respect to business acquisitions completed during the years 2018 and 2017 on a pro forma basis, as disclosed in the above pro forma financial information table, combined revenues decreased 2.7% for the three months ending March 31, 2018 versus the same periods in 2017.
The 2018 and 2017 pro forma financial information assumes that all business acquisitions made during this period were made on January 1, 2017, whereas the Company's reported financial statements for three months ended March 31, 2018 only includes the revenues from these businesses since the effective date that they were acquired or consolidated by Ebix, being April 2017 for Itzcash, June 2017 for beBetter, September 2017 for YouFirst, October 2017 for WallStreet, November 2017 for Paul Merchants, November 2017 for Via, and February 2018 for Transcorp.
•2018 and 2017 pro forma revenue contains actual revenue of the acquired entities before acquisition date, as reported by the sellers, as well as actual revenue of the acquired entities after acquisition, whereas the reported growth in revenues of the acquired entities after acquisition date are only reflected for the period after their acquisition.
•Revenue billed to existing clients from the cross selling of acquired products has been assigned to the acquired section of our business.
•Any existing products sold to new customers obtained through a newly acquired customer base are assigned to the acquired section of our business.
Cost of Services Provided

Costs of services provided, which includes costs associated with maintenance, customer support, call center, consulting, implementation and training services, increased $14.4 million or 57%, to $39.6 million in the first quarter of 2018 as compared to $25.2 million in the first quarter of 2017.
This increase is primarily due to costs associated with the business acquisitions of ItzCash,Via, YouFirst, WallStreet and Paul Merchants offset by reduced U.S. consulting salary costs.
Product Development Expenses

The Company’s product development efforts are focused on the development of new processing technologies, software, systems and related services for use by healthcare professionals, consumers, insurance carriers, brokers and agents, and the development of new data exchanges for use in the domestic and international insurance markets.
Product development expenses remained flat at $8.4 million during the first quarter of 2018 as compared to $8.4 million during the first quarter of 2017.
Sales and Marketing Expenses

Sales and marketing expenses decreased $339 thousand or 8%, to $4.0 million in the first quarter of 2018 as compared to $4.3 million in the first quarter of 2017 primarily due to a decrease in expenses relating to commissions.
General and Administrative Expenses

Reported general and administrative expenses increased $6.8 million or 54% to $19.5 million in the first quarter of 2018 as compared to $12.7 million in the first quarter of 2017 primarily due to costs associated with the business acquisitions of ItzCash,Via, YouFirst, WallStreet and Paul Merchants, a $1.1 million increase in professional fees, a $948 thousand purchase accounting adjustment in 2017, and a $638 thousand increase in bad debt expense.
Amortization and Depreciation Expenses

Interest Income

Interest income decreased $653 thousand or 84% to $121 thousand in the first quarter of 2018 as compared to $774 thousand in the first quarter of 2017 primarily due to interest now recorded as revenue in India and a reduction in the average cash balances in interest bearing accounts.
Interest Expense

Interest expense increased $2.4 million or 96%, to $4.8 million in the first quarter of 2018 as compared to $2.5 million in the first quarter of 2017.
Interest expense increased primarily due to the increase in the average outstanding balance on our commercial banking credit facilities, which increased 44% to $402.4 million during Q1 2018 from $278.9 million during Q1 of 2017, as well as an increase in the underlying average interest rate which increased to 4.3% for Q1 2018 versus 3.1% for Q1 2017.

The income tax expense exclusive of discrete items for the three months ended March 31, 2018 is $2.10 million (7.33%).
Our tax expense and effective tax rate increased year over year, exclusive of discrete charges, due to a new minimum tax on global intangible low-taxed income (“GILTI”) earned by foreign subsidiaries as part of the Tax Act.
The Company expects its full year tax rate before discrete items to be approximately 7.35%.
On December 22, 2017, the U.S. enacted the Tax Act, which implemented a number of changes that took effect on January 1, 2018, including but not limited to, a new minimum tax on GILTI earned by foreign subsidiaries.
The Company estimated the impact of GILTI on the expected annual effective income tax rate and recorded a provisional tax expense.
Any adjustment of the Company’s provisional tax expense will be reflected as a change in estimate in its results in the period in which the change in estimate is made in accordance with Staff Accounting Bulletin No.
118, Income Tax Accounting Implications of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, which is also included in ASU 2018-05, Income Taxes (Topic 740), Amendments to SEC Paragraphs Pursuant to SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin No.

In addition, the Company continues to gather information to compute the 

amount of the Transition Tax under the Tax Act and expects to finalize its calculation prior to filing its U.S. federal tax return, which is due October 15, 2018.
Liquidity and Capital Resources

The Company's ability to generate significant cash flows from ongoing operating activities is one of its fundamental financial strengths.
Our principal sources of liquidity are the cash flows provided by the Company's operating activities, the Company's commercial banking credit facility, and cash and cash equivalents on hand.
Due to the effect of temporary or timing differences resulting from the differing treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes (including the treatment of net operating loss carry-forwards and minimum alternative tax obligations in the U.S., Great Britain, and India), future cash outlays for income taxes are expected to exceed income tax expense.
We intend to utilize cash flows generated by our operations, in combination with our commercial bank credit facility, and the possible issuance of additional equity or debt securities, to fund capital expenditures and organic growth initiatives, to make strategic and accretive business acquisitions in the insurance services sector, and to re-purchase shares of our common stock as market conditions warrant.
We believe that anticipated cash flows provided by our operating activities, together with current cash and cash equivalent balances, access to our credit facilities, and access to the capital markets, if required and available, will be sufficient to meet our projected cash requirements for the foreseeable future, although any projections of future cash needs, cash flows, and the condition of the capital markets in general, as to the availability of debt and equity financing, are subject to substantial uncertainty.
Our cash and cash equivalents were $111.9 million and $63.9 million at March 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017, respectively.
The $4.0 million of restricted cash on the condensed consolidated balance sheet as of March 31, 2018 consists of the ItzCash acquisition $4.0 million of the possible future contingent earn-out payments being held in escrow accounts for the twelve month period following the effective date of the acquisition to ensure that the acquired business achieves the minimum specified annual gross revenue threshold, which if not achieved will result in said funds being returned to Ebix.
The $8.6 million of restricted fiduciary funds is associated with the EbixHealth JV and pertains to un-remitted insurance premiums and claim funds established for the benefit of various carriers which are held in a fiduciary capacity until disbursed.
Our current ratio increased to 1.83 at March 31, 2018 from 1.72 at December 31, 2017 and accordingly our working capital position increased to $132.2 million at March 31, 2018 from $106.0 million at the end of 2017.
Our short-term liquidity has primarily increased due to increased cash and cash equivalents, partially offset by a decrease in short-term investments and increased deferred revenues.
The Company's days sales outstanding in accounts receivable ("DSO") was 99 days at March 31, 2018 up 7 

days from 92 days at December 31, 2017.
The increase is primarily due to contracts in Brazil, the US and India that have longer payment terms.
We believe that Ebix's ability to generate sustainable and robust cash flows from operations will enable the Company to continue to fund its current liabilities from current assets including available cash balances for the foreseeable future.

Recent Accounting Pronouncements

For information about new accounting pronouncements and the potential impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements, see Note 1 of the condensed notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-Q and Note 1 of the notes to consolidated financial statements in our 2017 Form 10-K.
Application of Critical Accounting Policies 

The preparation of financial statements in conformity GAAP, as promulgated in the United States, requires our management to make significant estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, revenues and expenses and related disclosures in our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements and accompanying notes.
We believe the most complex and sensitive judgments, because of their significance to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements, result primarily from the need to make estimates and assumptions about the effects of matters that are inherently uncertain.
The following accounting policies involve the use of “critical accounting estimates” because they are particularly dependent on estimates and assumptions made by management about matters that are uncertain at the time the accounting estimates are made.
In addition, while we have used our best estimates based on facts and circumstances available to us at the time, different estimates reasonably could have been used in the current period, and changes in the accounting estimates that we used are reasonably likely to occur from period to period both of which may have a material impact on our financial condition and results of operations.
For additional information about these policies, see Note 1 of the Condensed Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-Q.
Although we believe that our estimates, assumptions and judgments are reasonable, they are limited based upon information presently available.
Actual results may differ significantly from these estimates under different assumptions, judgments or conditions.
Revenue Recognition

The Company derives its revenues primarily from subscription and transaction fees pertaining to services delivered over our exchanges or from our application service provider ("ASP") platforms, fees for risk compliance solution services, and fees for software development projects including associated fees for consulting, implementation, training, and project management provided to customers with installed systems and applications.
Sales and value-added taxes are not included in revenues, but rather are recorded as a liability until the taxes assessed are remitted to the respective taxing authorities.
Under Topic 606, revenue is recognized when control of the promised goods or services is transferred to our customers, in an amount that reflects the consideration we expect to be entitled to in exchange for those goods or services.
• identification of the contract, or contracts, with a customer;

• identification of the performance obligations in the contract;

• determination of the transaction price;

• allocation of the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract; and

• recognition of revenue when, or as, we satisfy a performance obligation.
For contracts that contain multiple deliverables, we analyze the revenue arrangements in accordance with the relevant technical accounting guidance, which provides criteria governing how to determine whether goods or services that are delivered separately in a bundled sales arrangement should be considered as separate performance obligations for the purpose of revenue recognition.
These types of arrangements include obligations pertaining to software licenses, system set-up, and professional services associated with product customization or modification.
Delivery of the various contractual obligations typically occurs over periods of less than eighteen months.
These arrangements generally do not have refund provisions or have very limited refund terms.
Software development arrangements involving significant customization, modification or production are accounted for in accordance with the appropriate technical accounting guidance issued by FASB using the percentage-of-completion method.
The Company recognizes revenue using periodic reported actual hours worked as a percentage of total expected hours required to complete the project arrangement and applies the percentage to the total arrangement fee.
Financial exchange revenue consists largely of transaction-based fees and fees from corporate and retail gift vouchers.
The transaction-based fees are primarily based on a percentage of payment value processed for solutions such as retail and corporate payments, domestic money transfers, and general purpose reloadable cards.
Transaction-based fees are recognized at the completion of the transaction.
Gift voucher revenue is recognized at full purchase value at time of sale with the corresponding cost of vouchers recorded under direct expenses.
Allowance for Doubtful Accounts Receivable

Management specifically analyzes accounts receivable and historical bad debts, write-offs, customer concentrations, customer credit-worthiness, current economic trends and changes in our customer payment terms when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts.
Valuation of Goodwill and Other Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets

Goodwill represents the cost in excess of the fair value of the net assets of acquired businesses.
Indefinite-lived intangible assets represent the fair value of acquired contractual customer relationships for which future cash flows are expected to continue indefinitely.
In accordance with the relevant FASB accounting guidance, goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets are not amortized but are tested for impairment at the reporting unit level on an annual basis or on an interim basis if an event occurs or circumstances change that would likely have reduced the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value.
Potential impairment indicators include a significant change in the business climate, legal factors, operating performance indicators, competition, and the sale or disposition of a significant portion of the business.
The impairment evaluation process first involves an assessment of certain qualitative factors to determine whether the existence of events or circumstances would indicate that it is more likely than not that the fair value of any of our reporting units was less than its carrying amount.
If, after assessing the totality of events or circumstances, we were to determine that it is not more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, then we would not perform the two-step quantitative impairment testing described further below.
The aforementioned two-step quantitative testing process involves comparing the reporting unit carrying values to their respective fair values.
We determine the fair value of our reporting units by applying the discounted cash flow method using the present value of future estimated net cash flows.
If the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying value, then no further testing is required.
However, if a reporting unit's fair value were to be less than its carrying value, we would then determine the amount of the impairment charge, if any, which would be the amount that the carrying value of the reporting unit's goodwill exceeded its implied value.
Projections of cash flows are based on our views of growth rates, operating costs, anticipated future economic conditions and the appropriate discount rates relative to risk and estimates of residual values.
We believe that our estimates are consistent with assumptions that marketplace participants would use in their estimates of fair value.
The use of different estimates or assumptions for our projected discounted cash flows (e.g., growth rates, future economic conditions, discount rates and estimates of terminal values) when determining the fair value of our reporting units could result in different values and may result in a goodwill impairment charge.
We perform our annual goodwill impairment evaluation and testing as of September 30th of each year.
This evaluation is done during the fourth quarter each year.
During the year ended December 31, 2017 we had no impairment of our reporting unit goodwill balances.
Valuation of Contingent Liabilities related to Earn-Out Obligations from Business Acquisitions


Income Taxes

Deferred income taxes are recorded to reflect the estimated future tax effects of differences between financial statement and tax basis of assets, liabilities, operating losses, and tax credit carry forwards using the tax rates expected to be in effect when the temporary differences reverse.
Valuation allowances, if any, are recorded to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount management considers more likely than not to be realized.
Such valuation allowances are recorded for the portion of the deferred tax assets that are not expected to be realized based on the levels of historical taxable income and projections for future taxable income over the periods in which the temporary differences will be deductible.
The Company also applies FASB accounting guidance on accounting for uncertainty in income taxes positions.
This guidance clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes by prescribing the minimum recognition threshold a tax position is required to meet before being recognized in the financial statements.
Foreign Currency Matters

The functional currency for the Company's foreign subsidiaries in India, Dubai, and Singapore is the U.S. dollar because the intellectual property research and development activities provided by its Dubai and Singapore subsidiary, and the product development and information technology enabled services activities for the insurance industry provided by its India subsidiary, both in support of Ebix's operating divisions across the world, are transacted in U.S. dollars.
The functional currency of the Company's other foreign subsidiaries is the local currency of the country in which the subsidiary operates.
The assets and liabilities of these foreign subsidiaries are translated into U.S. dollars at the rates of exchange at the balance sheet dates.
Income and expense accounts are translated at the average exchange rates in effect during the period.
Gains and losses resulting from translation adjustments are included as a component of other comprehensive income in the accompanying Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets.
Foreign exchange transaction gains and losses that are derived from transactions denominated in a currency other than the subsidiary's functional currency are included in the determination of net income.
