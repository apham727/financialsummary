Item 3: QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK

The Company is exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk related to our foreign-based operations where certain transactions are denominated in other than our entity's functional currency and are subject to market risk with respect to fluctuations in the relative value of those currencies.
A majority of the Company’s operations are based in the U.S and India, furthermore the functional currencies in our main India and Singapore offices is the U.S. dollar, and accordingly, a substantial portion of our business transactions are denominated in U.S. dollars.
However, the Company has operations in Australia, India (specifically EbixCash), New Zealand, Great Britain, Canada, Brazil, Dubai, Singapore, Philippines, Indonesia, and United Arab Emirates where we conduct transactions in the local currencies of each of these locations.There can be no assurance that fluctuations in the value of foreign currencies will not have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business, operating results, revenues or financial condition.
During the three months ended March 31, 2018 and 2017 the net change in the cumulative foreign currency translation account, which is a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss within stockholders’ equity, were unrealized gains (losses) of $4.8 million and $2.5 million, respectively.
The Company considered the historical trends in currency exchange rates and determined that it was reasonably possible that adverse changes in our respective foreign currency exchange rates of 20% could be experienced in the near term.
Such an adverse change in currency exchange rates would have resulted in reduction to pre-tax income of approximately $3.1 million and $2.3 million for the three months ended March 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively.
The Company's exposure to interest rate risk relates to its interest expense on outstanding debt obligations and to its interest income on existing cash balances.
As of March 31, 2018 the Company had $425.5 million of outstanding debt obligations which consisted of a $250.0 million term loan, a $173.7 million balance on our commercial banking revolving line of credit, and a $1.8 million note due to IHC by the EbixHealth JV.
The Company's revolving line of credit bears interest at the rate of LIBOR plus 2.25%, and stood at 3.88% at March 31, 2018.
The Company is exposed to market risk in relation to this line of credit in regards to the potential increase in interest expense arising from adverse changes in interest rates.
This interest rate risk is estimated as the potential decrease in earnings resulting from a hypothetical 30 basis point increase in the LIBOR rate.
Such an adverse change in the LIBOR rate would have resulted in a reduction to pre-tax income of approximately $611 thousand and $179 thousand for the three months ended March 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively.
The Company's average cash balances and short term investments during the three months ended March 31, 2018 were $109.9 million and its existing cash balances as of March 31, 2018 were $111.9 million.
The Company is exposed to market risk in relation to these cash balances in regards to the potential loss of interest income arising from adverse changes in interest rates.
This interest rate risk is estimated as the potential decrease in earnings resulting from a hypothetical 20 basis point interest rates earned on deposited funds.
Such an adverse change in these interest rates would have resulted in a reduction to pre-tax income of approximately $139 thousand and $155 thousand for the three months ended March 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively.
There were no other material changes to our market risk exposure during the three months ended March 31, 2018 and 2017.
