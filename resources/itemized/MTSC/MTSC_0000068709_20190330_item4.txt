Item 4.
Controls and Procedures
Our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, has conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act)), as of March 30, 2019.
Based on that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that, as of March 30, 2019, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective.
There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the second quarter of fiscal year 2019 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
