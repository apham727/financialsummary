Item 4.
Controls and Procedures
Our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, have conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act)), as of December 30, 2017.
Based on that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that, as of December 30, 2017, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective.
There were no changes in the Company's internal control over financial reporting during the first quarter of fiscal year 2018 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company's internal control over financial reporting.
