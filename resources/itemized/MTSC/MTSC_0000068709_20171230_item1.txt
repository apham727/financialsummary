Item 1A.
Risk Factors

A discussion of our risk factors can be found in Item 1A of Part I of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2017.
The information below includes additional risks relating to the enactment of U.S. federal income tax legislation, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, on December 22, 2017.
The risks described below and in our Annual Report on Form 10-K are not the only risks we face.
Additional risks not currently known to us, or that we currently deem to be immaterial, may also adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations in future periods.
The final impacts of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act could be materially different from our current estimates.
The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the Tax Act) was signed into law on December 22, 2017.
The new law made numerous changes to U.S. federal corporate tax law and is expected to reduce our effective tax rate for fiscal year 2018 and future periods.
Effective January 1, 2018, the Tax Act lowers the U.S. corporate tax rate from 35% to 21% and prompts various other changes to U.S. federal corporate tax law, including the establishment of a territorial-style system for taxing foreign-source income of domestic multinational corporations.
The tax benefit recorded for the three months ended December 30, 2017 involves significant judgment and assumptions as to the impact of the Tax Act.
Our estimated impact of the new law is based on management's current knowledge and assumptions.
Recognized impacts could be materially different from current estimates based on our actual results in fiscal year 2018.
We expect to record any adjustments in the next year in accordance with the guidance provided in the SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin No.
118, and these adjustments could be material.
The full impact of the Tax Act on our business, operations and financial statements cannot be predicted at this time, and we make no assurances in this regard.
