1. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES 



Basis of Presentation 



The accompanying unaudited consolidated financial statements of ADTRAN®, Inc. and its subsidiaries (ADTRAN) have been prepared pursuant to the rules and regulations for reporting on Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q. Accordingly, certain information and notes required by generally accepted accounting principles for complete financial statements are not included herein. The December 31, 2017 Consolidated Balance Sheet is derived from audited financial statements, but does not include all disclosures required by accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. 



In the opinion of management, all adjustments necessary to fairly state these interim statements have been recorded and are of a normal and recurring nature. The results of operations for an interim period are not necessarily indicative of the results for the full year. The interim statements should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and notes thereto included in ADTRAN’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2017, filed on February 23, 2018 with the SEC. 



Use of Estimates 



The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenue and expense during the reporting period. Our more significant estimates include the obsolete and excess inventory reserves, warranty reserves, customer rebates, determination of the deferred revenue components of multiple element sales agreements, estimated costs to complete obligations associated with deferred revenues, estimated income tax provision and income tax contingencies, the fair value of stock-based compensation, impairment of goodwill, valuation and estimated lives of intangible assets, estimated pension liability, fair value of investments, and the evaluation of other-than-temporary declines in the value of investments. Actual amounts could differ significantly from these estimates. 



Recent Accounting Pronouncements 



In February 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842). ASU 2016-02 requires an entity to recognize lease assets and lease liabilities on the balance sheet and to disclose key information about the entity's leasing arrangements. In July 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-10, Codification Improvements to Topic 842, Leases, which clarified certain aspects of ASU 2016-02, as well as, ASU 2018-11, Leases (Topic 842), Targeted Improvements, which provides for an optional transition method that allows for the application of current legacy guidance, including its disclosure requirements, in the comparative periods presented in the year of adoption. Otherwise, Topic 842 must be adopted by a modified retrospective method, with elective reliefs, which requires application of the new guidance for all periods presented. The Company plans to use the optional transition method when adopting the new standard. ASU 2016-02, ASU 2018-10 and ASU 2018-11 are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, and interim periods within those fiscal years. We anticipate the adoption of these ASUs will have a material increase in the assets and liabilities of our consolidated balance sheets; however, we do not believe adoption will have a material effect on our results of operations. We believe the most significant effect relates to our accounting for operating leases for office space.  



In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-13, Financial Instruments – Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments. ASU 2016-13 requires the measurement and recognition of expected credit losses for financial instruments held at amortized cost. ASU 2016-13 is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2019, with early adoption permitted. We are currently evaluating the effect ASU 2016-13 will have on our consolidated financial statements. 



7 



In January 2017, the FASB issued ASU 2017-04, Intangibles – Goodwill and Other (Topic 350): Simplifying the Test for Goodwill Impairment. ASU 2017-04 simplifies the measurement of goodwill by eliminating step 2 of the goodwill impairment test. Under ASU 2017-04, entities will be required to compare the fair value of a reporting unit to its carrying amount and recognize an impairment charge for the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the reporting unit’s fair value. ASU 2017-04 is effective for annual or interim impairment tests performed in fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019, with early adoption permitted for annual or interim impairment tests performed on testing dates after January 1, 2017. The amendments should be applied prospectively. We are currently evaluating whether to early adopt ASU 2017-04, but we do not expect it will have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements. 



In March 2017, the FASB issued ASU 2017-08, Receivables – Nonrefundable Fees and Other Costs (Subtopic 310-20): Premium Amortization on Purchased Callable Debt Securities, which shortens the amortization period for the premium on certain purchased callable debt securities to the earliest call date. ASU 2017-08 is effective for fiscal years and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2018 with early adoption permitted. The amendments should be applied through a modified-retrospective transition approach that requires a cumulative-effect adjustment directly to retained earnings as of the beginning of the period of adoption. We are currently evaluating the effect of ASU 2017-08, but we do not expect it will have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements.  



In August 2017, the FASB issued ASU 2017-12, Derivatives and Hedging (Topic 815): Targeted Improvements to Accounting for Hedging Activities. ASU 2017-12 expands and refines hedge accounting for both financial and non-financial risk components, aligns the recognition and presentation of the effects of hedging instruments and hedge items in the financial statements, and includes certain targeted improvements to ease the application of current guidance related to the assessment of hedge effectiveness. ASU 2017-12 is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2018, with early adoption permitted. We are currently evaluating the effect ASU 2017-12 will have on our consolidated financial statements. 



In February 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-02, Income Statement – Reporting Comprehensive Income (Topic 220): Reclassification of Certain Tax Effects from Accumulated Comprehensive Income. ASU 2018-02 allows for an optional reclassification from accumulated other comprehensive income to retained earnings for stranded tax effects resulting from the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017. ASU 2018-02 is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2018, with early adoption permitted. We are currently evaluating whether to reclassify stranded tax effects related to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, but we do not expect ASU 2018-02 will have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements. 



In August 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-13, Fair Value Measurement (Topic 820) Disclosure Framework-Changes to the Disclosure Requirements for Fair Value Measurement, which changes the fair value measurement disclosure requirements of ASC 820, Fair Value Measurement. The amendments in this ASU are the result of a broader disclosure project called, Concepts Statement No. 8 - Conceptual Framework for Financial Reporting — Chapter 8, Notes to Financial Statements, which the FASB finalized on August 28, 2018. The FASB used the guidance in the Concepts Statement to improve the effectiveness of ASC 820’s disclosure requirements. ASU 2018-13 provides users of financial statements with information about assets and liabilities measured at fair value in the statement of financial position or disclosed in the notes to the financial statements. More specifically ASU 2018-13 requires disclosures about the valuation techniques and inputs that are used to arrive at measures of fair value, including judgments and assumptions that are made in determining fair value. In addition, ASU 2018-13 requires disclosures regarding the uncertainty in the fair value measurements as of the reporting date and how changes in fair value measurements affect performance and cash flows. ASU 2018-13 is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2019. We are currently evaluating the effect of ASU 2018-13, but we do not expect it will have a material effect on our financial statement disclosures. 



In August 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-14, Compensation-Retirement Benefits-Defined Benefit Plans-General (Subtopic 715-20): Disclosure Framework-Changes to the Disclosure Requirements for Defined Benefit Plans, which makes changes to and clarifies the disclosure requirements related to defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans. ASU 2018-14 requires additional disclosures related to the reasons for significant gains and losses affecting the benefit obligation and an explanation of any other significant changes in the benefit obligation or plan assets that are not otherwise apparent in other disclosures required by ASC 715. ASU 2018-14 also clarifies the guidance in ASC 715 to require disclosure of the projected benefit obligation (PBO) and fair value of plan assets for pension plans with PBOs in excess of plan assets and the accumulated benefit obligation (ABO) and fair value of plan assets for pension plans with ABOs in excess of plan assets. ASU 2018-14 is effective for public business entities for fiscal years ending after December 15, 2020. We are currently evaluating the effect of ASU 2018-14, but we do not expect it will have a material effect on our financial statement disclosures.  



8 



In August 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-15, Intangibles-Goodwill and Other-Internal-Use Software (Subtopic 350-40), Customer’s Accounting for Implementation Costs Incurred in a Cloud Computing Arrangement That Is a Service Contract. ASU 2018-15 clarifies certain aspects of ASU 2015-05, Customer’s Accounting for Fees Paid in a Cloud Computing Arrangement. Specifically, ASU 2018-15 aligns the requirements for capitalizing implementation costs incurred in a hosting arrangement that is a service contract with the requirements for capitalizing implementations costs incurred to develop or obtain internal use software. ASU 2018-15 is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2019, with early adoption permitted. We are currently evaluating whether to early adopt, but we do not expect it will have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements. 



During 2018, we adopted the following accounting standards, which had the following effects on our consolidated financial statements: 



In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606), which supersedes the revenue recognition requirements in Topic 605, Revenue Recognition, including most industry-specific revenue recognition guidance throughout the Industry Topics of the Codification. The core principle of ASU 2014-09 is to recognize revenues when promised goods or services are transferred to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration that is expected to be received for those goods or services. In August 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-14, which deferred the effective date of ASU 2014-09 to fiscal years beginning after December 31, 2017, and interim periods within those fiscal years, with early adoption permitted for reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016. Subsequently, the FASB issued ASUs in 2016 containing implementation guidance related to ASU 2014-09, including: ASU 2016-08, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Principal versus Agent Considerations (Reporting Revenue Gross versus Net), which is intended to improve the operability and understandability of the implementation guidance on principal versus agent considerations; ASU 2016-10, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Identifying Performance Obligations and Licensing, which is intended to clarify two aspects of Topic 606: identifying performance obligations and the licensing implementation guidance; ASU 2016-12, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Narrow-Scope Improvements and Practical Expedients, which contains certain provisions and practical expedients in response to identified implementation issues; and ASU 2016-20, Technical Corrections and Improvements to Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, which is intended to clarify the Codification and/or to correct unintended application of guidance. ASU 2014-09 allows for either full retrospective or modified retrospective adoption. We adopted ASU 2014-09 and the related ASUs on January 1, 2018 using the modified retrospective method, which was applied to all contracts on the date of initial adoption.  



These ASUs primarily affected our network implementation service revenue performance obligations and contract costs. We are using the “output method” to measure network implementation services progress, which 1) accelerates revenue recognition for certain performance obligations related to service revenue arrangements that were previously deferred until customer acceptance and 2) requires capitalization and amortization of the incremental costs of obtaining a contract as described below.  



In connection with the adoption of the new revenue standard, effective January 1, 2018, we adopted ASC 340-40, Other Assets and Deferred Costs – Contracts with Customers, with respect to capitalization and amortization of incremental costs of obtaining a contract. As a result, certain costs of obtaining a contract, including sales commissions, will be capitalized, as the guidance requires the capitalization of all incremental costs incurred to obtain a contract with a customer that it would not have incurred if the contract had not been obtained, provided the costs are recoverable. The primary effect was the capitalization of certain sales commissions for our extended maintenance and support contracts in excess of one year and amortization of those costs over the period that the related revenue is recognized.  



The cumulative effect of the changes made to our Consolidated Balance Sheet on January 1, 2018 for the adoption of ASU 2014-09 and the related ASUs was as follows: 



 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

The effect of the adoption of ASU 2014-09 and the related ASUs on our financial statements was as follows: 



 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 



 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 



 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 



In January 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-01, Financial Instruments — Overall: Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities, which addresses certain aspects of the recognition, measurement, presentation and disclosure of financial instruments. Subsequently, the FASB issued ASU 2018-03, Technical Corrections and Improvements to Financial Instruments – Overall (Subtopic 825-10): Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities, which issued technical corrections and improvements intended to clarify certain aspects of ASU 2016-01. ASU 2016-01 was effective beginning January 1, 2018 and we now recognize any changes in the fair value of certain equity investments in net income as prescribed by the new standard rather than in other comprehensive income. We adopted ASU 2016-01 on January 1, 2018 using the modified retrospective method, which resulted in a $3.2 million reclassification of net unrealized gains from accumulated other comprehensive income to opening retained earnings. ASU 2018-03 is effective for us with the interim period beginning after June 15, 2018. See Note 7 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.  



10 



In March 2017, the FASB issued ASU 2017-07, Compensation – Retirement Benefits (Topic 715): Improving the Presentation of Net Periodic Pension Cost and Net Periodic Postretirement Benefit Cost. ASU 2017-07 amends ASC 715, Compensation — Retirement Benefits, to require employers that present a measure of operating income in their statements of earnings to include only the service cost component of net periodic pension cost and net periodic postretirement benefit cost in operating expenses (together with other employee compensation costs). The other components of net benefit cost, including amortization of prior service cost/credit, and settlement and curtailment effects, are to be included in non-operating expenses. We adopted ASU 2017-07 on January 1, 2018. We retrospectively adopted the presentation of service cost separate from other components of net periodic pension costs. As a result, $0.1 million and $0.3 million have been reclassified from cost of sales, selling, general and administrative expenses, and research and development expense to other income (expense), net for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2017, respectively.  



2. BUSINESS COMBINATIONS 



On March 19, 2018, we acquired Sumitomo Electric Lightwave Corp.’s (SEL) North American EPON business and entered into a technology license and OEM supply agreement with Sumitomo Electric Industries, Ltd. (SEI). This acquisition establishes ADTRAN as the North American market leader for EPON solutions for the cable MSO industry and it will accelerate the MSO market’s adoption of our open, programmable and scalable architectures. This transaction was accounted for as a business combination. We have included the financial results of this acquisition in our consolidated financial statements since the date of acquisition. These revenues are included in the Access & Aggregation and Customer Devices categories within the Network Solutions reportable segment. 



We recorded a bargain purchase gain of $11.3 million during the first quarter of 2018, net of income taxes, which is subject to customary working capital adjustments between the parties. The bargain purchase gain of $11.3 million represents the difference between the fair value of the net assets acquired over the cash paid. SEI, an OEM supplier based in Japan, is the global market leader in EPON. SEI’s Broadband Networks Division, through its SEL subsidiary, operated a North American EPON business that included sales, marketing, support, and region-specific engineering development. The North American EPON market is primarily driven by the Tier 1 cable MSO operators and has developed more slowly than anticipated. Through the transaction, SEI divested its North American EPON assets and established a relationship with ADTRAN. The transfer of these assets to ADTRAN, which included key customer relationships and a required assumption by ADTRAN of relatively low incremental expenses, along with the value of the technology license and OEM supply agreement, resulted in the bargain purchase gain. We have assessed the recognition and measurement of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on historical and forecasted data for future periods and we have concluded that our valuation procedures and resulting measures were appropriate. 



The preliminary allocation of the purchase price to the estimated fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the acquisition date is as follows: 



 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 



The actual revenue and net loss included in our Consolidated Statements of Income for the three months ended September 30, 2018 and the period March 19, 2018 to September 30, 2018 are as follows: 



 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 



11 



The details of the acquired intangible assets are as follows: 



 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 



The following unaudited supplemental pro forma information presents the financial results as if the acquisition had occurred on January 1, 2017. This unaudited supplemental pro forma information does not purport to be indicative of what would have occurred had the acquisition been completed on January 1, 2017, nor is it indicative of any future results. Aside from revising the 2017 and 2018 net income for the effect of the bargain purchase gain, there were no material, non-recurring adjustments to this unaudited pro forma information. 



 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 



For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2018, we incurred acquisition and integration related expenses and amortization of acquired intangibles of $0.7 million and $1.6 million, respectively, related to this acquisition. 



3. REVENUE 



Revenue is measured based on the consideration we expect to receive in exchange for transferring goods or providing services to a customer and as performance obligations under the terms of the contract are satisfied. Generally, this occurs with the transfer of control of a product or service to the customer. For transactions where there are multiple performance obligations, we account for individual products and services separately if they are distinct (if a product or service is separately identifiable from other items and if a customer can benefit from it on its own or with other resources that are readily available to the customer). The consideration, including any discounts, is allocated between separate products and services based on their stand-alone selling prices. The stand-alone selling prices are determined based on the prices at which we sell the separate products and services and are allocated based on each item’s relative value to the total value of the products and services in the arrangement. For items that are not sold separately, we estimate stand-alone selling prices primarily using the “expected cost plus a margin” approach. Payment terms are typically 30 days. Shipping fees are recorded as revenue and the related cost is included in cost of sales. Sales, value-added, and other taxes collected concurrently with revenue-producing activities are excluded from revenue. Costs of obtaining a contract are capitalized and amortized over the period that the related revenue is recognized if greater than one year. We have elected to apply the practical expedient related to the incremental costs of obtaining contracts and recognize those costs as an expense when incurred if the amortization period of the assets is one year or less. These costs are included in selling, general and administrative expenses. Capitalized costs with an amortization period greater than one year were immaterial. 



The following is a description of the principal activities from which we generate our revenue by reportable segment. 



Network Solutions Segment 



Network Solutions includes hardware products and next-generation virtualized solutions used in service provider or business networks, as well as prior generation products.  



12 



Hardware 



The majority of the revenue from this segment is from hardware sales and is recognized when control is transferred to our customers, which is generally when we ship the products. Shipping terms are generally FOB shipping point. Revenue is recorded net of estimated discounts and rebates using historical trends. Customers are typically invoiced when control is transferred and revenue is recognized. Our products generally include assurance-based warranties of 90 days to five years for product defects, which are accrued at the time revenue is recognized. 



In certain transactions, we are also the lessor in sales-type lease arrangements for network equipment that have terms of 18 months to five years. These arrangements typically include network equipment, network implementation services and maintenance services. Product revenue for these leases is generally recorded when we transfer control of the product to our customers. Revenue for network implementation and maintenance services is recognized as described below. Customers are typically invoiced and pay in equal installments over the lease term. In relation to these lease agreements, during the three months ended September 30, 2018 and 2017, we recognized revenue of $4.2 million and $8.4 million, respectively, and during the nine months ended September 30, 2018 and 2017 we recognized revenue of $10.5 million and $15.4 million, respectively. 



Services & Support Segment 



To complement our Network Solutions segment, we offer a complete portfolio of maintenance, network implementation, and solutions integration and managed services, which include hosted cloud services and subscription services.  



Maintenance 



Our maintenance service periods range from one month to five years. Customers are typically invoiced and pay for maintenance services at the beginning of the maintenance period. We recognize revenue for maintenance services on a straight-line basis over the maintenance period in services revenue as our customers benefit evenly throughout the contract term and deferred revenues are recorded in current and non-current unearned revenue. 



Network Implementation 



We recognize revenue for network implementation, which primarily consists of engineering, execution and enablement services, at a point in time when each performance obligation is complete. If we have recognized revenue, but have not billed the customer, the right to consideration is recognized as a contract asset that is included in other receivables in the Consolidated Balance Sheet. The contract asset is transferred to accounts receivable when the completed performance obligation is invoiced to the customer. 



As of September 30, 2018, we did not have any significant performance obligations related to customer contracts that had an original expected duration of one year or more, other than maintenance services, which are satisfied over time. 



The following table provides information about receivables, contract assets, and unearned revenue from contracts with customers: 



 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 



The decrease in accounts receivable is due to the collection of customer specific payment terms that became due in the first quarter of 2018. The increase in the contract asset balance for the nine months ended September 30, 2018 is primarily attributable to revenue recognized that has not yet been billed to the customer during the period. The increase in the unearned revenue balance as of nine months ended September 30, 2018 is primarily attributable to cash payments received or due in advance of satisfying our performance obligations, offset by $8.9 million of revenues recognized that were included in the unearned revenue balance as of December 31, 2017.

The following table disaggregates our revenue by major source for the three months ended September 30, 2018: 



 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 



The following table disaggregates our revenue by major source for the nine months ended September 30, 2018: 



 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 



4. INCOME TAXES 



Our effective tax rate decreased from an expense of 23.1% in the nine months ended September 30, 2017, to a benefit of 34.9%, excluding the tax effect of the bargain purchase gain, in the nine months ended September 30, 2018. The decrease in the effective tax rate between the two periods is primarily driven by the completion of other tax projects, current year net losses in our domestic business and the effect of the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, which was signed into law on December 22, 2017.  



5. PENSION BENEFIT PLAN 



We maintain a defined benefit pension plan covering employees in certain foreign countries. 



The following table summarizes the components of net periodic pension cost for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2018 and 2017: 



 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 



The components of net periodic pension cost other than the service cost component are included in the line item “Other income (expense), net” in the Consolidated Statements of Income.

6. STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION 



The following table summarizes the stock-based compensation expense related to stock options, performance stock units (PSUs), restricted stock units (RSUs) and restricted stock for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2018 and 2017, which was recognized as follows: 



 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 



Stock Options 



The following table is a summary of our stock options outstanding as of December 31, 2017 and September 30, 2018 and the changes that occurred during the nine months ended September 30, 2018: 



 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 



The aggregate intrinsic values in the table above represent the total pre-tax intrinsic value (the difference between the closing price of our stock on the last trading day of the quarter and the exercise price, multiplied by the number of in-the-money stock options) that would have been received by the option holders had all option holders exercised their options on September 30, 2018. The aggregate intrinsic value will change based on the fair market value of our stock. 



The total pre-tax intrinsic value of options exercised during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2018 was $0.1 million and $0.2 million, respectively.  



As of September 30, 2018, there was $1.2 million of unrecognized compensation expense related to unvested stock options, which is expected to be recognized over an average remaining recognition period of 1.0 years. 



The fair value of our stock options is estimated using the Black-Scholes model. The determination of the fair value of stock options on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes model is affected by our stock price, as well as assumptions regarding a number of complex and subjective variables that may have a significant impact on the fair value estimate. 



There were no stock options granted during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2018 or 2017. 



15 



 PSUs, RSUs and restricted stock 



The following table is a summary of our PSUs, RSUs and restricted stock outstanding as of December 31, 2017 and the changes that occurred during the nine months ended September 30, 2018: 



 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 



The fair value of our PSUs with market conditions is calculated using a Monte Carlo simulation valuation method. The fair value of RSUs and restricted stock is equal to the closing price of our stock on the date of grant. During the first quarter of 2017, the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors approved a PSU grant of 0.5 million shares that contain performance conditions. The fair value of these performance-based PSU awards was equal to the closing price of our stock on the date of grant.  



As of September 30, 2018, there was $9.8 million of unrecognized compensation expense related to unvested market-based PSUs, RSUs and restricted stock, which is expected to be recognized over an average remaining recognition period of 2.6 years. In addition, there was $9.4 million of unrecognized compensation expense related to unvested performance-based PSUs, which will be recognized over the requisite service period of three years as the achievement of the performance objective becomes probable. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2018, no compensation expense was recognized related to these performance-based PSU awards. 



7. INVESTMENTS 



Debt Securities and Other Investments 



At September 30, 2018, we held the following debt securities and other investments, recorded at either fair value or cost: 



 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 



At December 31, 2017, we held the following debt securities and other investments, recorded at either fair value or cost: 



 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 



16 



As of September 30, 2018 our debt securities had the following contractual maturities: 



 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 



Actual maturities may differ from contractual maturities because some borrowers have the right to call or prepay obligations with or without call or prepayment penalties. 



Realized gains and losses on sales of debt securities are computed under the specific identification method. The following table presents gross realized gains and losses related to our debt securities: 



 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 



Our investment policy provides limitations for issuer concentration, which limits, at the time of purchase, the concentration in any one issuer to 5% of the market value of our total investment portfolio. 



At September 30, 2018, we held a $26.7 million restricted certificate of deposit that is carried at cost. This investment serves as a collateral deposit against the principal amount outstanding under loans made to ADTRAN pursuant to an Alabama State Industrial Development Authority revenue bond (the Bond), which totaled $26.7 million at September 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017. At September 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017, the estimated fair value of the Bond using a level 2 valuation technique was approximately $26.5 million and $26.7 million, respectively, based on a debt security with a comparable interest rate and maturity and a Standard and Poor’s credit rating of AAA. We have the right to set-off the balance of the Bond with the collateral deposit in order to reduce the balance of the indebtedness. The Bond matures on January 1, 2020, and bears interest at the rate of 2% per annum. In conjunction with this program, we are eligible to receive certain economic incentives from the state of Alabama that reduce the amount of payroll withholdings we are required to remit to the state for those employment positions that qualify under this program. We are required to make payments in the amounts necessary to pay the interest on the amounts currently outstanding. It is our intent to make annual principal payments in addition to the interest amounts that are due. 



Marketable Equity Securities 



Our marketable equity securities consist of publicly traded stocks or funds measured at fair value.  



Prior to January 1, 2018, our marketable equity securities were classified as available-for-sale. Realized gains and losses on marketable equity securities were included in net investment gain (loss). Unrealized gains and losses were recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income, net of deferred taxes, on the balance sheet. 



On January 1, 2018, we adopted ASU 2016-01, which requires us to measure all equity investments that do not result in consolidation and are not accounted for under the equity method at fair value, with any changes in fair value recognized in net investment gain (loss). Upon adoption, we reclassified $3.2 million of net unrealized gains related to marketable equity securities from accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) to opening retained earnings.

Realized and unrealized gains and losses for our marketable equity securities for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2018 were as follows: 



 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 



As of September 30, 2018 and 2017, gross unrealized losses related to individual investments in a continuous loss position for twelve months or longer were not significant. 



We have categorized our cash equivalents and our investments held at fair value into a three-level fair value hierarchy based on the priority of the inputs to the valuation technique for the cash equivalents and investments as follows: Level 1 - Values based on unadjusted quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in an active market; Level 2 - Values based on quoted prices in markets that are not active or model inputs that are observable either directly or indirectly; Level 3 - Values based on prices or valuation techniques that require inputs that are both unobservable and significant to the overall fair value measurement. These inputs include information supplied by investees. 



 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 



The fair value of our Level 2 securities is calculated using a weighted average market price for each security. Market prices are obtained from a variety of industry standard data providers, security master files from large financial institutions, and other third-party sources. These multiple market prices are used as inputs into a distribution-curve-based algorithm to determine the daily market value of each security. 



8. DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS AND HEDGING ACTIVITIES 



We participate in foreign exchange forward contracts in connection with the management of exposure to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates. 



Cash Flow Hedges 



Our cash flow hedging activities utilize foreign exchange forward contracts to reduce the risk that movements in exchange rates will adversely affect the net cash flows resulting from the planned purchase of products from foreign suppliers. Purchases of U.S. denominated inventory by our European subsidiary represent our primary exposure. Changes in the fair value of derivatives designated as cash flow hedges are not recognized in current operating results, but are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income. Amounts related to cash flow hedges are reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive income when the underlying hedged item impacts earnings. This reclassification is recorded in cost of sales, the same line item of the Consolidated Statements of Income at which the effects of the hedged item are recorded. 



Undesignated Hedges 



We have certain customers and suppliers who are invoiced or pay in a non-functional currency. Changes in the monetary exchange rates may adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition, as outstanding non-functional balances are revalued to the functional currency through profit and loss. When appropriate, we utilize foreign exchange forward contracts to help manage the volatility relating to these valuation exposures. All changes in the fair value of our derivative instruments that do not qualify for or are not designated for hedged accounting transactions are recognized as other income (expense), net in the Consolidated Statements of Income. 



We do not hold or issue derivative instruments for trading or other speculative purposes. Our derivative instruments are recorded in the Consolidated Balance Sheets at their fair values. Our derivative instruments are not subject to master netting arrangements and are not offset in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. 



As of September 30, 2018, we had no foreign exchange forward contracts.

9. INVENTORY 



At September 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017, inventory consisted of the following: 



 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 



We establish reserves for estimated excess, obsolete, or unmarketable inventory equal to the difference between the cost of the inventory and the estimated fair value of the inventory based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions. At September 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017, raw materials reserves totaled $17.2 million and $15.0 million, respectively, and finished goods inventory reserves totaled $10.6 million and $8.3 million, respectively.

10. GOODWILL AND INTANGIBLE ASSETS 



Goodwill, all of which relates to our acquisition of Bluesocket, Inc., was $3.5 million at September 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017, of which $3.1 million and $0.4 million is allocated to our Network Solutions and Services & Support reportable segments, respectively. 



We evaluate the carrying value of goodwill during the fourth quarter of each year and between annual evaluations if events occur or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of the reporting unit below its carrying amount. We have elected to first assess the qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit to which the goodwill is assigned is less than its carrying amount as a basis for determining whether it is necessary to perform the two-step impairment test. If we determine that it is more likely than not that its fair value is less than its carrying amount, then the two-step impairment test will be performed. Based on the results of our qualitative assessment in 2017, we concluded that it was not necessary to perform the two-step impairment test. There have been no impairment losses recognized since the acquisition in 2011. 



Intangible assets are included in other assets in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets and include intangibles acquired in conjunction with our acquisitions of Bluesocket, Inc. on August 4, 2011, the NSN BBA business on May 4, 2012, CommScope’s active fiber access business on September 13, 2016 and Sumitomo Electric Lightwave Corp.’s North American EPON business and technology license and OEM supply agreement with Sumitomo Electric Industries, Ltd. on March 19, 2018. 



The following table presents our intangible assets as of September 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017. Fully amortized intangible assets have been removed from prior year balances for comparability. 



 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 



Amortization expense, all of which relates to business acquisitions, was $0.9 million and $0.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively, and $2.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2018 and 2017. 



As of September 30, 2018, the estimated future amortization expense of our intangible assets is as follows:

Stock Repurchase Program 



Since 1997, our Board of Directors has approved multiple share repurchase programs that have authorized open market repurchase transactions of up to 50.0 million shares of our common stock that are implemented through open market or private purchases from time to time as conditions warrant. During the nine months ended September 30, 2018, we repurchased 0.9 million shares of our common stock at an average price of $15.75 per share. As of September 30, 2018, we have the authority to purchase an additional 2.7 million shares of our common stock under the current plans approved by the Board of Directors.

We issued 0.1 million shares of treasury stock during the nine months ended September 30, 2018 to accommodate employee stock option exercises. The stock options had exercise prices ranging from $15.29 to $18.97. We received proceeds totaling $1.3 million from the exercise of these stock options during the nine months ended September 30, 2018.

A summary of the calculation of basic and diluted earnings per share for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2018 and 2017 is as follows: 



 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 



Anti-dilutive options to purchase common stock outstanding were excluded from the above calculations. Anti-dilutive options totaled 3.9 million and 3.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively, and 4.8 million and 3.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2018 and 2017. As a result of the net loss for the nine months ended September 30, 2018, we excluded 0.1 million of unvested stock options, PSUs, RSUs and restricted stock from the calculation of diluted EPS due to their anti-dilutive effect. 



13. SEGMENT INFORMATION 



We operate in two reportable segments: (1) Network Solutions and (2) Services & Support. Network Solutions includes hardware products and next-generation virtualized solutions used in service provider or business networks, as well as prior-generation products. Services & Support includes our suite of ProCloud® managed services, network installation, engineering and maintenance services, and fee-based technical support and equipment repair/replacement plans. 



We evaluate the performance of our segments based on gross profit; therefore, selling, general and administrative expenses, research and development expenses, interest and dividend income, interest expense, net investment gain, other income (expense) and provision for taxes are reported on a company-wide, functional basis only. There are no inter-segment revenues. 



The following table presents information about the reported sales and gross profit of our reportable segments for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2018 and 2017. We do not produce asset information by reportable segment; therefore, it is not reported.

Sales by Category 



In addition to our reporting segments, we also report revenue for the following three categories – Access & Aggregation, Customer Devices, and Traditional & Other Products. 



The table below presents sales information by category for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2018 and 2017: 



 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 



14. LIABILITY FOR WARRANTY RETURNS 



Our products generally include warranties of 90 days to five years for product defects. We accrue for warranty returns at the time revenue is recognized based on our estimate of the cost to repair or replace the defective products. We engage in extensive product quality programs and processes, including actively monitoring and evaluating the quality of our component suppliers. Our products continue to become more complex in both size and functionality as many of our product offerings migrate from line card applications to total systems. The increasing complexity of our products will cause warranty incidences, when they arise, to be more costly. Our estimates regarding future warranty obligations may change due to product failure rates, material usage, and other rework costs incurred in correcting a product failure. In addition, from time to time, specific warranty accruals may be recorded if unforeseen problems arise. Should our actual experience relative to these factors be worse than our estimates, we will be required to record additional warranty expense. Alternatively, if we provide for more reserves than we require, we will reverse a portion of such provisions in future periods. The liability for warranty obligations totaled $9.0 million and $9.7 million at September 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017. During the three months ended March 31, 2017, we recorded a receivable and a reduction in warranty expense related to a settlement with a third party supplier for a defective component, the impact of which is reflected in the table below. During the three months ended September 30, 2018, we had a reversal of prior provisions, the impact of which is reflected in the table below. These liabilities are included in accrued expenses in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets. 



A summary of warranty expense and write-off activity for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2018 and 2017 is as follows: 



 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 



15. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES 



In the ordinary course of business, we may be subject to various legal proceedings and claims, including employment disputes, patent claims, disputes over contract agreements and other commercial disputes. In some cases, claimants seek damages or other relief, such as royalty payments related to patents, which, if granted, could require significant expenditures. Although the outcome of any claim or litigation can never be certain, it is our opinion that the outcome of all contingencies of which we are currently aware will not materially affect our business, operations, financial condition or cash flows. 



We have committed to invest up to an aggregate of $7.9 million in two private equity funds, and we have contributed $8.4 million as of September 30, 2018, of which $7.7 million has been applied to these commitments.

16. SUBSEQUENT EVENTS 



On October 16, 2018, we announced that our Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.09 per common share to be paid to stockholders of record at the close of business on October 31, 2018. The payment date will be November 14, 2018. The quarterly dividend payment will be approximately $4.3 million. In July 2003, our Board of Directors elected to begin declaring quarterly dividends on our common stock considering the tax treatment of dividends and adequate levels of Company liquidity. 



During the 4th quarter and as of November 6, 2018, we have repurchased 0.1 million shares of our common stock through open market purchases at an average cost of $13.60 per share. We currently have the authority to purchase an additional 2.6 million shares of our common stock under the current plan approved by the Board of Directors.
