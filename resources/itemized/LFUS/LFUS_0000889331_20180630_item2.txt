Executive Overview 



Founded in 1927, Littelfuse is a global leader in circuit protection products with advancing platforms in power control and sensor technologies, serving customers in the electronics, automotive, and industrial markets. With a diverse and extensive product portfolio of fuses, semiconductors, polymers, ceramics, relays and sensors, the Company works with its customers to build safer, more reliable and more efficient products for the connected world in virtually every market that uses electrical energy, ranging across consumer electronics, IT and telecommunication applications, industrial electronics, automobiles and other transportation, and heavy industrial applications. 





Executive Summary 



For the second quarter of 2018, the Company recognized net sales of $459.2 million compared to $313.4 million in the second quarter of 2017 representing an increase of $145.8 million, or 46.5%. The increase was primarily driven by the acquisition of IXYS, which added $100.2 million in sales along with higher volume across all three segments. Net sales for Electronics increased $130.0 million, or 76.7%, primarily due to the acquisition of IXYS and strong growth across all the business units and favorable changes in foreign exchange rates of $8.0 million. Net sales for the Automotive segment increased $10.7 million, or 9.2% due to volume growth across all the segment’s business units. Net sales in the Industrial segment increased $5.1 million or 18.7% due to volume growth across all the segment’s business units. The Company recognized net income of $42.3 million, or $1.67 per diluted share, in the second quarter of 2018 compared to net income of $48.6 million, or $2.11 per diluted share in the second quarter of 2017. The decrease in net income reflects the impact of $19.0 million of purchase accounting inventory charges, higher amortization expense of $7.2 million and foreign exchange losses of $3.2 million that were partially offset by the acquisition of IXYS and operating income increases across the Electronics and Industrial segments. Additionally, the per share results reflect an increase in the weighted average diluted shares outstanding of 2.1 million resulting from the shares issued in conjunction with the acquisition of IXYS. 



Net cash provided by operating activities was $140.9 million for the six months ended June 30, 2018 as compared to $93.6 million for the six months ended July 1, 2017. The increase in net cash provided by operating activities reflected higher earnings and favorable working capital management that more than offset higher payments related to acquisition and integration costs and higher cash taxes. 



During the second quarter of 2018, the Company announced as part of its strategic assessment and cost savings initiatives, the exit of the Custom business within the Industrial segment and the Radio Pulse business within the IXYS acquisition. The Company does not expect the exit of these businesses to have a material impact on the Company's future net sales and net earnings. The exit of the Custom business resulted in total impairment charges of $1.1 million for the tradename and real property. The exit of the Radio Pulse business resulted in restructuring charges of $2.1 million, of which $1.4 million was for severance charges and $0.7 million of other restructuring charges. The Company expects to realize future cost savings resulting from these restructuring activities. 



On July 6, 2018, the Trump administration imposed Section 301 tariffs on products that are imported into the United States where the country of origin is China. This tariff primarily impacts our Electronics segment and to a lesser extent our Automotive and Industrial segments. The Company is currently evaluating the impact on our future results of operations.

Results of Operations  



The following table summarizes the Company’s consolidated results of operations for the periods presented. The second quarter of 2018 includes $28.7 million of non-segment charges. The charges related to the IXYS acquisition total $24.4 million ($63.2 million year-to-date) and include $19.0 million ($36.9 million year-to-date) of purchase accounting inventory charges, $2.3 million ($14.1 million year-to-date) in acquisition-related and integration costs primarily related to legal, accounting and other expenses associated with the acquisition of IXYS, $3.1 million ($5.6 million year-to-date) in backlog amortization costs, stock compensation expense recognized immediately upon close for converted IXYS options related to prior services periods of $4.5 million year-to-date and other charges of $2.1 million year-to-date. In addition, there were $3.2 million ($3.9 million year-to-date) of severance and other restructuring charges and $1.1 million of impairment charges ($1.1 million year-to-date) associated with the exit of the Radio Pulse and Custom businesses, respectively. 



The second quarter of 2017 includes approximately $0.3 million of non-segment charges ($1.8 million year-to-date). These were primarily attributable to acquisition-related costs primarily related to legal and integration costs associated with the Company’s acquisitions in 2016 of the ON Portfolio. 





Net Sales 



Net sales increased $145.8 million, or 46.5%, for the second quarter of 2018 compared to the second quarter of 2017 with increases of $100.2 million and $3.4 million resulting from incremental net sales related to the IXYS and U.S. Sensor acquisitions, respectively. The remaining increase in net sales was driven by higher volume across all businesses in the Electronics, Automotive and Industrial segments and $8.0 million of favorable changes in foreign exchange rates. 



Net sales for the first six months of 2018 increased $278.2 million, or 46.5%, compared to the first six months of 2017 with increases of $186.5 million and $6.5 million resulting from incremental net sales related to the IXYS and U.S. Sensor acquisitions, respectively. The remaining increase in net sales was driven by higher volume across all businesses in the Electronics, Automotive and Industrial segments and $21.1 million of favorable changes in foreign exchange rates. 



Gross Profit 



Gross profit was $169.0 million, or 36.8% of net sales, in the second quarter of 2018, compared to $132.6 million, or 42.3% of net sales, in the second quarter of 2017. The increase in gross profit reflects the impact of the IXYS acquisition and volume growth across all segments. The decrease in gross margin is primarily due to the purchase accounting inventory charges of $19.0 million which negatively impacted the second quarter of 2018 gross margin by 4.1 percentage points and unfavorable mix in products from the IXYS acquisition. 



Gross profit was $318.6 million, or 36.3% of net sales, in the first six months of 2018, compared to $246.3 million, or 41.1% of net sales in the first six months of 2017. The increase in gross profit reflects the IXYS acquisition and volume growth across all segments and expense leverage across all segments. The decrease in gross margin is primarily due to the purchase accounting inventory charges of $36.9 million which negatively impacted the first six months of 2018 gross margin by 4.2 percentage points.

Operating Expenses 



Total operating expenses were $109.4 million, or 23.8% of net sales, for the second quarter of 2018 compared to $72.3 million, or 23.1% of net sales, for the second quarter of 2017. The increase in operating expenses of $37.1 million is primarily due to incremental operating expenses related to the IXYS and U.S. Sensor acquisitions, an increase in amortization expense of $7.2 million resulting from the acquisition of IXYS, higher acquisition-related and integration costs of $2.0 million, and higher restructuring and impairment charges.  



Total operating expense for the first six months of 2018 was $221.4 million, or 25.2% of net sales, compared to $137.1 million, or 22.9% of net sales, for the first six months of 2017. The increase in operating expenses of $84.3 million is primarily due to incremental operating expenses related to the IXYS and U.S. Sensor acquisitions, an increase in amortization expense of $13.3 million resulting from the acquisition of IXYS as well as higher acquisition-related and integration costs of $12.3 million. Total operating expenses as a percent of net sales increased from 22.9% for the first six months of 2017 to 25.2% for the first six months of 2018 primarily due to the higher amortization expense and acquisition-related and integration charges noted above. 



Operating Income 



Operating income was $59.6 million, a decrease of $0.6 million, or 1.1%, for the second quarter of 2018 compared to $60.3 million for the second quarter of 2017. Increases in operating income across the Electronics segment were more than offset by purchase accounting inventory charges of $19.0 million, higher amortization charges of $7.2 million and higher restructuring and impairment charges of $4.3 million along with the costs associated with the acquisition and integration of the IXYS acquisition as described above. Operating margins decreased from 19.2% in the second quarter of 2017 to 13.0% in the second quarter of 2018. The purchase accounting inventory charge negatively impacted margins by 4.1% with the remaining decrease driven by the above charges partially offset by higher volume across all segments. 



Operating income for the first six months of 2018 was $97.2 million, or 11.1% of net sales, compared to $109.1 million, or 18.2% of net sales, for the first six months of 2017. The decrease in operating income is primarily due to the purchase accounting inventory charges of $36.9 million along with the costs associated with the acquisition and integration of IXYS as described above. The purchase accounting inventory charges, higher acquisition and integration charges and higher amortization expense negatively impacted margins by 4.2%, 1.3% and 0.8%, respectively. 



Income Before Income Taxes 



Income before income taxes was $52.3 million, or 11.4% of net sales, for the second quarter of 2018 compared to $57.4 million, or 18.3% of net sales, for the second quarter of 2017. In addition to the factors impacting comparative results for operating income discussed above, income before income taxes was impacted by increased unfavorable foreign exchange losses of $3.8 million primarily due to fluctuations in the Euro and Mexican peso against the U.S. dollar and increased interest expense of $2.5 million associated with the increased borrowings for the IXYS acquisition. Additionally, partially offsetting the previously mentioned expense increases was an increase in other income of $1.9 million during the three months ended June 30, 2018 as compared to the three months ended July 1, 2017 primarily as a result of unrealized investment gains associated with our equity investments. 



Income before income taxes for the first six months of 2018 was $97.0 million, or 11.1% of net sales compared to $104.8 million, or 17.5% of net sales, for the first six months of 2017. In addition to the factors impacting comparative results for operating income discussed above income before income taxes was favorably impacted by foreign exchange gains of $5.2 million and increases in other income of $3.7 million primarily due to unrealized investment gains in our equity investments partially offset by higher interest expense of $4.8 million resulting from increased borrowings for the IXYS acquisition. 



Income Taxes 



Income tax expense was $10.0 million, or an effective tax rate of 19.1%, for the second quarter of 2018 compared to $8.7 million, or an effective tax rate of 15.2%, for the second quarter of 2017. The effective tax rate for the second quarter of 2017 was lower than the then applicable 35% U.S. statutory tax rate primarily due to income earned in lower tax jurisdictions. The effective tax rate for the second quarter of 2018 was higher than the effective tax rate for the second quarter of 2017 primarily due to the impact of U.S. tax reform and the acquisition of IXYS.

Dividends 



During July 2018, the Company’s Board of Directors approved a 16% increase in the quarterly cash dividend from $0.37 to $0.43. This equates to an annualized dividend of $1.72 per share. 



Cash Flow Overview 





Cash Flow from Operating Activities 



Operating cash inflows are largely attributable to sales of the Company’s products. Operating cash outflows are largely attributable to recurring expenditures for raw materials, labor, rent, interest, taxes and other operating activities. 



Net cash provided by operating activities was $140.9 million for the first six months of 2018, compared to $93.6 million during the six months ended July 1, 2017. The increase in net cash provided by operating activities was primarily driven by higher earnings and favorable working capital management that more than offset higher payments related to acquisition and integration costs and higher cash taxes.  



Cash Flow from Investing Activities 



Net cash used in investing activities was $350.7 million for the six months ended June 30, 2018, compared to $36.1 million during the six months ended July 1, 2017.

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 



The Company’s Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements are prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. In connection with the preparation of the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements, the Company uses estimates and makes judgments and assumptions about future events that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, expenses, and the related disclosures. The assumptions, estimates, and judgments are based on historical experience, current trends, and other factors the Company believes are relevant at the time it prepares the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. 





Recent Accounting Pronouncements 



In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02, "Leases" (Topic 842). This ASU requires lessees to recognize, on the balance sheet, assets and liabilities for the rights and obligations created by leases of greater than twelve months. The accounting by lessors will remain largely unchanged. The ASU is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2018, with early adoption permitted. Adoption will require a modified retrospective transition. The Company will adopt the standard in the first quarter of 2019. The Company has made progress on assessing the Company’s portfolio of leases and compiling a central repository of all active leases. We are in the process of assessing the design of the future lease process and drafting a policy to address the new standard requirements. Key lease data elements are being evaluated including developing a methodology for determining the incremental borrowing rate across all countries where we have operations. While the Company has not yet completed its evaluation of the impact the new lease accounting standard will have on its Consolidated Financial Statements, the Company expects to recognize right of use assets and lease liabilities for its operating leases in the Consolidated Balance Sheet upon adoption. 



In January 2018, the FASB released guidance on the accounting for tax on the global intangible low-taxed income ("GILTI") provisions of the Tax Act. The GILTI provisions impose a tax on foreign income in excess of a deemed return on tangible assets of foreign corporations. The guidance indicates that either accounting for deferred taxes related to GILTI inclusions or treating any taxes on GILTI inclusions as period cost are both acceptable methods subject to an accounting policy election. The Company has not yet completed its assessment and therefore has not yet elected an accounting policy.
