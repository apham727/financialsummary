Sold in over 150 countries, the Company’s products are found in automotive and commercial vehicles, industrial applications, data and telecommunications, medical devices, consumer electronics and appliances.
With its broad product portfolio of fuses, semiconductors, polymers, ceramics, relays and sensors, and extensive global infrastructure, the Company’s worldwide associates partner with its customers to design, manufacture and deliver innovative, high-quality solutions for a safer, greener and increasingly connected world.
Executive Summary
For the second quarter of 2019, the Company recognized net sales of $397.9 million compared to $459.2 million in the second quarter of 2018 representing a decrease of $61.3 million, or 13.4%.
The decrease was primarily driven by lower volume in Electronics and Automotive segments and $7.9 million or 1.7% of unfavorable changes in foreign exchange rates.
The Company recognized net income of $43.8 million, or $1.75 per diluted share, in the second quarter of 2019 compared to net income of $42.3 million, or $1.67 per diluted share in the second quarter of 2018.
The increase in net income reflects lower non-segment charges compared to prior year primarily due to the IXYS acquisition, partially offset by lower operating income across all segments and foreign exchange losses.
The Company continues to take actions to improve its cost structure and drive the synergies from the integration of IXYS.
The Company expects to realize cost savings from the restructuring activities taken during 2019 including the reorganization of certain manufacturing, selling and administrative functions across all segments.
For the three and six months ended June 29, 2019, the Company recorded total restructuring charges of $5.7 million and $8.4 million respectively, for employee termination costs and other restructuring charges, which included $1.7 million of restructuring costs associated with the closure of a European manufacturing facility in the automotive sensors business within the Automotive segment.
Net cash provided by operating activities was $80.1 million for the six months ended June 29, 2019 as compared to $140.9 million for the six months ended June 30, 2018.
The decrease in net cash provided by operating activities reflected lower earnings and higher working capital levels primarily due to the timing of supplier payments.
During the three and six months ended June 29, 2019, the Company repurchased 188,214 and 268,130 shares of its common stock totaling $32.0 million and $45.5 million.
Since September 30, 2018, the Company has repurchased 660,102 shares of its common stock at an average price of $171.81 totaling $113.4 million.
