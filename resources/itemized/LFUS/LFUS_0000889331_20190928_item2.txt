Executive Overview
Founded in 1927, Littelfuse is a global manufacturer of leading technologies in circuit protection, power control and sensing.
Sold in over 150 countries, the Company’s products are found in automotive and commercial vehicles, industrial applications, data and telecommunications, medical devices, consumer electronics and appliances.
With its broad product portfolio of fuses, semiconductors, polymers, ceramics, relays and sensors, and extensive global infrastructure, the Company’s worldwide associates partner with its customers to design, manufacture and deliver innovative, high-quality solutions for a safer, greener and increasingly connected world.
Executive Summary
For the third quarter of 2019, the Company recognized net sales of $362.0 million compared to $439.2 million in the third quarter of 2018 representing a decrease of $77.2 million, or 17.6%.
The decrease was primarily driven by lower volume in the Electronics and Automotive segments and $4.4 million or 1.0% of unfavorable changes in foreign exchange rates, partially offset by higher volume in the Industrial segment.
The Company recognized net income of $35.6 million, or $1.44 per diluted share, in the third quarter of 2019 compared to net income of $53.5 million, or $2.10 per diluted share in the third quarter of 2018.
The decrease in net income reflects lower operating income in the Electronics segment and foreign exchange losses, partially offset by lower non-segment charges compared to prior year primarily due to the IXYS acquisition.
The Company continues to take actions to improve its cost structure and drive the synergies from the integration of IXYS.
The Company expects to realize cost savings from the restructuring activities taken during 2019 including the reorganization of certain manufacturing, selling and administrative functions across all segments and the closure of a European manufacturing facility in the automotive sensors business within the Automotive segment.
Net cash provided by operating activities was $160.9 million for the nine months ended September 28, 2019 as compared to $252.1 million for the nine months ended September 29, 2018.
The decrease in net cash provided by operating activities reflected lower earnings and higher working capital levels primarily due to the timing of supplier payments.
During the three and nine months ended September 28, 2019, the Company repurchased 311,786 and 579,916 shares of its common stock totaling $49.5 million and $95.0 million, respectively.
Since September 30, 2018, the Company has repurchased 971,888 shares of its common stock at an average price of $167.65 totaling $162.9 million.
