NOTE 1. BASIS OF PRESENTATION AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES



Fiscal Years



Cypress Semiconductor Corporation (together with its consolidated subsidiaries, "Cypress" or the "Company") reports on a fiscal-year basis. The Company ends its quarters on the Sunday closest to the end of the applicable calendar quarter, except in a 53-week fiscal year, in which case the additional week falls into the fourth quarter of that fiscal year. Fiscal years 2018 and 2017 each contain(ed) 52 weeks. The second quarter of fiscal 2018 ended on July 1, 2018 and the second quarter of fiscal 2017 ended on July 2, 2017.



Basis of Presentation



The consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States ("GAAP") and include the accounts of Cypress Semiconductor Corporation and its subsidiaries. All intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated in consolidation.



In the opinion of management, the accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements contain all adjustments of a normal, recurring nature, which are necessary to state fairly the financial information included therein. These financial statements should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and related notes thereto included in Cypress' Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2017. The year-end condensed balance sheet data was derived from audited financial statements, but does not include all disclosures required by GAAP.



Certain balances included on the Consolidated Balance Sheets and in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows for prior periods have been reclassified to conform to the current period presentation. Beginning fiscal year 2018, the Company is allocating the amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets, restructuring costs and certain other expenses by function in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. The Consolidated Statements of Operations for the prior comparative periods have been reclassified to conform to the current period presentation as follow:

Summary of Significant Accounting Policies



The Company's significant accounting policies are described in Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2017.



Recent Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet Adopted



In February 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued Accounting Standard Update ("ASU") 2016-02, "Leases, (Topic 842)," which replaces most current lease guidance when it becomes effective. This standard update intends to increase the transparency and improve comparability by requiring entities to recognize assets and liabilities on the balance sheet for all leases, with certain exceptions. The new standard states that a lessee will recognize a lease liability for the obligation to make lease payments and a right-of-use asset for the right to use the underlying asset for the lease term. Leases will be classified as either finance or operating, with classification affecting the pattern of expense recognition in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. The new guidance will be effective for the Company starting in the first quarter of fiscal 2019. Early adoption is permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the effect that the new guidance will have on its consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.



In August 2017, the FASB issued ASU No. 2017-12, "Derivatives and Hedging (Topic 815): Targeted Improvements to Accounting for Hedging Activities." The amendments in ASU 2017-12 are intended to more closely align hedge accounting with companies’ risk management strategies, simplify the application of hedge accounting, and increase transparency as to the scope and results of hedging programs. The guidance in ASU 2017-12 is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2018 and for interim periods within those fiscal years, with early adoption permitted. The Company is evaluating the impact this guidance will have on its consolidated financial statements and related disclosures. 



9



In February 2018, the FASB issued ASU No. 2018-02, "Income Statement-Reporting Comprehensive Income (Topic 220): Reclassification of Certain Tax Effects from Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income." The amendments in ASU 2018-02 are intended to allow a reclassification from accumulated other comprehensive income to retained earnings for stranded tax effects resulting from the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. The guidance in ASU 2018-02 is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2018 and for interim periods within those fiscal years, with early adoption permitted. The Company is evaluating the impact this guidance will have on its consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.



In February 2018, the FASB issued ASU No. 2018-03, "Technical Corrections and Improvements to Financial Instruments-Overall (Subtopic 825-10): Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities." The corrections and improvements are effective for the Company for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017 and for interim periods within those fiscal years beginning after June 15, 2018. The Company is currently evaluating the impact that the adoption of this standard will have on its consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.



Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements



Adoption of ASU No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers:



In May 2014, the FASB issued an ASU on revenue from contracts with customers, ASU No. 2014-09, "Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606)." This standard update outlines a single comprehensive model for entities to use in accounting for revenue arising from contracts with customers. The guidance is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017 and for interim periods within those fiscal years. Collectively, we refer to ASU No. 2014-09, its related amendments, and Subtopic 340-40 as "Topic 606."



On January 1, 2018, we adopted Topic 606 using the modified retrospective method applied to all contracts that are not completed contracts at the date of initial application (i.e., January 1, 2018). Results for reporting periods after January 1, 2018 are presented under Topic 606, while prior period amounts are not adjusted and continue to be reported in accordance with our historic accounting under Topic 605. There was no impact on the opening accumulated deficit as of January 1, 2018 due to the adoption of Topic 606. We reclassified the sales return reserve to current liabilities presented as "Price adjustment and other revenue reserves" from the allowance for accounts receivable due to the adoption of Topic 606. 



Revenues are recognized when control of the promised goods or services is transferred to our customers, in an amount that reflects the consideration we expect to be entitled to in exchange for those goods or services. Sales of products with alternative use account for the majority of our revenue and are recognized at a point in time, the timing of such recognition remained the same under Topic 606.



Taxes assessed by a governmental authority that are both imposed on and concurrent with a specific revenue-producing transaction, that are collected by the Company from a customer and deposited with the relevant government authority, are excluded from revenue. The Company's revenue arrangements do not contain significant financing components. 



Revenue is recognized over a period of time when it is assessed that performance obligations are satisfied over a period rather than at a point in time. When any of the following criteria is fulfilled, revenue is recognized over a period of time:



(a)The customer simultaneously receives and consumes the benefits provided by the performance as Cypress performs.



(b)Cypress’ performance creates or enhances an asset (for example, work in process) that the customer controls as the asset is created or enhanced.



(c)Cypress’ performance does not create an asset with an alternative use, and Cypress has an enforceable right to payment for performance completed to date.



We then select an appropriate method for measuring progress toward complete satisfaction of the performance obligation, usually costs incurred to date relative to the total expected costs to the satisfaction of that performance obligation.



Sales to certain distributors are made under arrangements that provide the distributors with price adjustments, price protection, stock rotation and other allowances under certain circumstances. These adjustments and allowances are accounted for as variable consideration. We estimate these amounts based on the expected amount to be provided to customers and reduce revenue recognized. We believe that there will not be significant changes to our estimates of variable consideration.



Our non-recurring engineering ("NRE") contracts with customers may include multiple performance obligations. For NRE arrangements, we allocate revenue to each performance obligation based on its relative standalone selling price. We generally determine the standalone selling price of intellectual property licenses based on the residual approach, and service based on cost 



10



plus a reasonable margin. We recognize revenue in the amount to which we have a right to invoice, if the right to consideration from the customer is in an amount that corresponds reasonably with the value to the customer of the entity’s performance completed to date.



We license or sell our rights to use portions of our intellectual property ("IP") portfolio, which includes certain patent rights useful in the manufacture and sales of certain products. IP revenue recognition is dependent on the nature and terms of each agreement. We recognize IP revenue upon delivery of the IP if we have no substantive future obligation to perform under the arrangement. We defer recognition of IP revenue where future performance obligations are required to earn the revenue or the revenue is not guaranteed. Sales-based or usage-based royalties from license of our IP are recognized at the later of the period the sales or usages occur or the satisfaction of the performance obligation to which some or all of the sales-based or usage-based royalties have been allocated.



If a customer pays consideration, or Cypress has a right to an amount of consideration that is unconditional before we transfer a good or service to the customer, those amounts are classified as deferred income/ advances received from customers which are included in other current liabilities or other long-term liabilities when the payment is made or it is due, whichever is earlier.



If the arrangement includes variable contingent consideration, the Company recognizes revenue over time if management can reasonably measure its progress or is capable of providing reliable information as required to apply an appropriate method of measuring progress.



Practical Expedients and Elections



Sales commissions are owed and are recorded at the time of sell-through of our products to end customers. These costs are recorded within sales and marketing expenses.



We do not disclose the value of unsatisfied performance obligations for (i) contracts with an original expected length of one year or less and (ii) contracts for which we recognize revenue at the amount to which we have the right to invoice for services performed. 



We have elected to account for shipping and handling costs as fulfillment costs after the customer obtains control of the goods. 



Other Recently Adopted Pronouncements:



In October 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-16, "Intra-Entity Transfers of Assets Other Than Inventory." For public entities, ASU 2016-16 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, and interim periods within those fiscal years. The Company adopted this guidance in the first quarter of fiscal 2018. The adoption of this guidance did not have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.



In November 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-18 Restricted Cash, which requires amounts generally described as restricted cash and restricted cash equivalents to be included with cash and cash equivalents when reconciling the total beginning and ending amounts for the periods shown on the statement of cash flows. ASU 2016-18 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017 (including interim periods within those periods) using a retrospective transition method to each period presented. The Company adopted the provisions of ASU 2016-18 as of January 1, 2018. There was no material impact on the Company's consolidated financial statements resulting from the adoption of this guidance.



In January 2017, the FASB issued ASU No. 2017-04, "Intangibles-Goodwill and Other (Topic 350): Simplifying the Test for Goodwill Impairment." The standard eliminates the second step in the goodwill impairment test which requires an entity to determine the implied fair value of the reporting unit’s goodwill. Instead, an entity should recognize an impairment loss if the carrying value of the net assets assigned to the reporting unit exceeds the fair value of the reporting unit, with the impairment loss not to exceed the amount of goodwill allocated to the reporting unit. The standard is effective for annual and interim goodwill impairment tests conducted in fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019, with early adoption permitted. The Company adopted this guidance in the first quarter of fiscal 2018. The adoption of this guidance did not have a material impact on the Company's consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.



In May 2017, the FASB issued ASU No. 2017-09, "Compensation - Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Scope of Modification Accounting." ASU 2017-09 amends the requirements in GAAP related to accounting for changes to stock-based compensation awards. The guidance in ASU 2017-09 is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within those fiscal years. The Company adopted this guidance in the first quarter of fiscal 2018. The adoption of this guidance did not have a material impact on the Company's consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.

NOTE 5. INVESTMENT IN EQUITY METHOD INVESTMENTS



Privately-held equity investments in entities the Company does not control are accounted for under the equity method of accounting if the Company has an ownership interest of 20% or greater or if it has the ability to exercise significant influence over the operations of such companies. 



Enovix Corporation ("Enovix")



During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017, the Company determined that its investment in Enovix, which is accounted for as an equity method investment, had suffered an other-than temporary impairment primarily because Enovix had not achieved certain key planned product development milestones. Consequently, the Company recognized a charge of $51.2 million during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017, reducing its carrying value to zero as of December 31, 2017. The Company held 41.1% of Enovix's outstanding voting shares as of July 1, 2018. 



Deca Technologies Inc. ("Deca")



The Company held 52.5% of Deca's outstanding voting shares as of July 1, 2018 and December 31, 2017. The Company's investment in Deca is accounted for as an equity method investment. 



The below table presents the changes in carrying value of the equity method investment related to Deca.

Senior Secured Credit Facility: Revolving Credit Facility and Term Loan B



23



On March 12, 2018, the Company amended its Amended and Restated Credit and Guaranty Agreement, which governs the Senior Secured Credit Facility. The amendment reduces the applicable margins on the Revolving Credit Facility and Term Loan B. After giving effect to the amendment, the Term Loan B bears interest, at the option of the Company, at the base rate plus an applicable margin of 1.25% or the Eurodollar rate plus an applicable margin of 2.25%; and the Revolving Credit Facility bears interest, at the option of the Company, at the base rate plus an applicable margin of either 0.75% or 1.00%, depending on the Company's secured leverage ratio, or the Eurodollar rate plus an applicable margin of 1.75% or 2.00%, depending on the Company's secured leverage ratio. The amendment removed the fixed charge coverage ratio financial covenants. In addition, for Term Loan B, the amendment removed the total leverage ratio covenant, changed the required amortization payments to 1% per annum, and waived the excess cash flow mandatory repayment for fiscal 2017.



As of July 1, 2018, $504.0 million aggregate principal amount of loans, all of which related to Term Loan B, were outstanding under the senior secured credit facility.



2% 2020 Spansion Exchangeable Notes



Pursuant to the Merger, Cypress assumed Spansion's 2% 2020 Spansion Exchangeable Notes (the "Spansion Notes") on March 12, 2015. They are fully and unconditionally guaranteed on a senior unsecured basis by the Company. The Spansion Notes will mature on September 1, 2020, unless earlier repurchased or converted, and bear interest of 2% per year payable semi-annually in arrears on March 1 and September 1. The Spansion Notes may be due and payable immediately in certain events of default.



On March 7, 2018, the Company entered into a privately negotiated agreement to induce the extinguishment of $10 million out of the $22 million of Spansion Notes outstanding. The Company paid the holders of the Spansion Notes cash for the aggregate principal of $10 million and delivered 1.4 million shares of common stock for the conversion spread. The Company recorded $0.2 million in loss on extinguishment and a reduction in additional paid-in capital of $25.7 million towards the deemed repurchase of the equity component of the notes.

NOTE 10. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES



Operating Lease Commitments



The Company leases certain facilities and equipment under non-cancelable operating lease agreements that expire at various dates through fiscal 2022 and thereafter. Some leases include renewal options, which would permit extensions of the expiration dates at rates approximating fair market rental values at the time of the extension.



As of July 1, 2018, future minimum lease payments under non-cancelable operating leases were as follows:



[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]



Restructuring accrual balances related to operating facility leases were $9.9 million and $11.5 million as of July 1, 2018 and December 31, 2017, respectively.



Product Warranties



26



The Company generally warrants its products against defects in materials and workmanship for a period of one year, and that product warranty is generally limited to a refund of the original purchase price of the product or a replacement part. The Company estimates its warranty costs based upon its historical warranty claim experience. Warranty returns are recorded as an allowance for sales returns. The allowance for sales returns is reviewed quarterly to verify that it reflects the remaining obligations based on the anticipated returns over the balance of the obligation period.



The following table presents the Company's warranty reserve activities:



[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]



Contractual Obligations



The Company has entered into agreements with certain vendors that include "take or pay" terms. Take or pay terms obligate the Company to purchase a minimum required amount of materials or services or make specified payments in lieu of such purchase. The Company may not be able to consume minimum commitments under these take or pay terms, requiring payments to vendors, which may have a material adverse impact on the Company’s earnings.



Litigation and Asserted Claims



On August 15, 2016, a patent infringement lawsuit was filed by the California Institute of Technology ("Caltech") against the Company in the U.S. District Court for the Central District of California (Case No. 16-cv-03714). The other co-defendants are Apple Inc., Avago Technologies Limited, Broadcom Corporation, and Broadcom Limited. Caltech alleges that defendants infringe four patents. On July 12, 2017, the Court issued a claim construction order. Trial will likely not occur until at least the first quarter of 2019, and the Company will defend against the allegations accordingly. 



In addition, the Company is currently involved in various other legal proceedings, claims, and disputes arising in the ordinary course of business, including intellectual property claims and other matters. 



For many legal matters, particularly those in early stages, the Company cannot reasonably estimate the possible loss (or range of loss), if any. The Company records an accrual for legal matters at the time or times it determines that a loss is both probable and reasonably estimable. Amounts accrued at July 1, 2018 were not material. Regarding matters for which no accrual has been made (including the potential for losses in excess of amounts accrued), the Company currently believes based on its own investigations, that any losses (or ranges of losses) that are reasonably possible and estimable will not, in the aggregate, have a material adverse effect on its financial position, results of operations, or cash flows. However, the ultimate outcome of legal proceedings involves judgments, estimates, and inherent uncertainties and cannot be predicted with certainty. Should the ultimate outcome of any legal matter be unfavorable, the Company's business, financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows could be materially and adversely affected. The Company may also incur substantial legal fees, which are expensed as incurred, in defending against legal claims.



Indemnification Obligations



The Company is a party to a variety of agreements pursuant to which it may be obligated to indemnify other parties to such agreements with respect to certain matters. Typically, these obligations arise in the context of contracts that the Company has entered into, under which the Company customarily agrees to hold the other party harmless against losses arising from a breach of representations and covenants or terms and conditions related to such matters as the sale and/or delivery of its products, title to assets sold, certain intellectual property claims, defective products, specified environmental matters and certain income taxes. With respect to the sale of a manufacturing facility or subsidiary business, such indemnification may also cover tax matters and the Company's management of the facility or business prior to the sale. In the foregoing circumstances, payment 



27



by the Company is customarily conditioned on the other party making a claim pursuant to the procedures specified in the particular contract, which procedures typically allow the Company to challenge the other party’s claims and vigorously defend itself and the other party against related third-party claims. Further, the Company's obligations under these agreements may be limited in terms of time, amount or the scope of its responsibility and in some instances, the Company may have recourse against third parties for certain payments made under these agreements.



It is not possible to predict the maximum potential amount of future payments under these agreements due to the conditional nature of the Company's obligations and the unique facts and circumstances involved in each particular agreement. Historically, payments the Company has made under these agreements have not had a material effect on the Company’s business, financial condition or results of operations. Management believes that if the Company were to incur a loss in any of these matters, such loss would not have a material effect on its business, financial condition, cash flows or results of operations, although there can be no assurance of this. As of July 1, 2018, the Company had no reason to believe a loss exceeding amounts already recognized would be incurred.



NOTE 11. FOREIGN CURRENCY AND INTEREST RATE DERIVATIVES



The Company enters into multiple foreign exchange forward contracts to hedge certain foreign currency risk resulting from fluctuations in Japanese yen (¥) and Euro (€) exchange rates. In addition, the Company entered into fixed-for-interest rate forward swap agreements and has designated these swaps as hedging instruments. The Company does not enter into derivative securities for speculative purposes. The Company’s hedging policy is designed to mitigate the impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations on its operating results. Some foreign currency forward contracts are considered to be economic hedges that were not designated as hedging instruments while others were designated as cash flow hedges. Whether designated or undesignated as cash flow hedges or not, these forward contracts protect the Company against the variability of forecasted foreign currency cash flows resulting from revenues, expenses and net asset or liability positions designated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. The maximum original duration of any contract allowable under the Company’s hedging policy is thirteen months for foreign currency hedging contracts.



Cash Flow Hedges



The Company enters into cash flow hedges to protect non-functional currency inventory purchases and certain other operational expenses, in addition to its on going program of cash flow hedges to protect its non-functional currency revenues against variability in cash flows due to foreign currency fluctuations. The Company’s foreign currency forward contracts that were designated as cash flow hedges have maturities between three and thirteen months. All hedging relationships are formally documented, and the hedges are designed to offset changes to future cash flows on hedged transactions at the inception of the hedge. The Company recognizes derivative instruments from hedging activities as either assets or liabilities on the balance sheet and measures them at fair value on a monthly basis. The Company records changes in the intrinsic value of its cash flow hedges in accumulated other comprehensive income on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets, until the forecasted transaction occurs. Interest charges or "forward points" on the forward contracts are excluded from the assessment of hedge effectiveness and are recorded in interest and other income, net in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations. In the second quarter of 2018, the Company entered into cash flow hedges, in which interest charges or "forward points" on the forward contracts are included in the assessment of hedge effectiveness, and are recorded in the underlying hedged items in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations. When the forecasted transaction occurs, the Company reclassifies the related gain or loss on the cash flow hedge to revenue or costs, depending on the risk hedged. In the event the underlying forecasted transaction does not occur, or it becomes probable that it will not occur, the Company will reclassify the gain or loss on the related cash flow hedge from accumulated other comprehensive income to interest and other income, net in its Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations at that time. For the six months ended July 1, 2018, the Company had a loss of $0.5 million, which was related to cash flow hedges, recorded in other comprehensive income.



The Company evaluates hedge effectiveness at the inception of the hedge prospectively as well as retrospectively and records any ineffective portion of the hedge in interest and other income, net in its Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations.



Designated Hedges

Total notional amounts of net outstanding contracts were as summarized below:



[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]



Non-designated hedges



Total notional amounts of net outstanding contracts were as summarized below:



[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]



In December 2017, the Company entered into fixed-for-floating interest rate forward swap agreements with two counterparties to swap variable interest payments on certain debt for fixed interest payments; these agreements will expire in July 2021. The objective of the swap was to effectively fix the interest rate at current levels without having to refinance the outstanding term loan, thereby avoiding the incurrence of transaction costs. The interest rate on the variable debt was fixed in December 2017 and became effective in April 2018. 



On January 3, 2018, the Company evaluated the hedge effectiveness of the interest rate swaps and designated these swaps as hedging instruments. Upon designation as cash flow hedge instruments, future changes in fair value of these swaps are recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income. For the six months ended July 1, 2018, the Company had a gain of $4.7 million, which was related to interest rate swaps, recorded in other comprehensive income. 



The effect of derivative instruments on the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations for the three and six months ended July 1, 2018 was not material.



The gross fair values of derivative instruments on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets as of July 1, 2018 and December 31, 2017 were as follows:

NOTE 12. NET INCOME (LOSS) PER SHARE



The following table sets forth the computation of basic and diluted net income (loss) per share:



[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]



For the three months ended July 1, 2018 and July 2, 2017, approximately 2.9 million and 27.6 million weighted average potentially dilutive shares underlying outstanding stock-based awards and convertible debt, respectively, were excluded in the computation of diluted net loss per share because their effect would have been anti-dilutive. For the six months ended July 1, 2018 and July 2, 2017, approximately 2.6 million and 27.9 million weighted average potentially dilutive shares underlying outstanding stock-based awards and convertible debt, respectively, were excluded in the computation of diluted net loss per share because their effect would have been anti-dilutive. 



NOTE 13. INCOME TAXES



The Company's income tax expense was $5.2 million and $4.5 million for the three months ended July 1, 2018 and July 2, 2017, respectively. The Company's income tax expense was $10.2 million and $9.4 million for the six months ended July 1, 2018, and July 2, 2017, respectively. The income tax expenses for the three months ended July 1, 2018 and July 2, 2017 were primarily attributable to non-U.S. taxes associated with the Company's non-U.S. operations. 



On December 22, 2017, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (the "Act") was signed into law, making significant changes to the U.S. Internal Revenue Code effective for tax years beginning after December 31, 2017. Changes include, but are not limited to, a corporate tax rate decrease from 35% to 21%, the repeal of corporate alternative minimum tax, the transition of U.S. international taxation from a worldwide tax system to a territorial system, and a one-time transition tax on the mandatory deemed repatriation of cumulative foreign earnings as of December 31, 2017. 



On December 22, 2017, Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 118 ("SAB 118") was issued to address the application of GAAP in situations when a registrant does not have the necessary information available, prepared, or analyzed (including computations) in reasonable detail to complete the accounting for certain income tax effects of the Act. For the six months ended July 1, 2018, the Company did not obtain any additional information affecting the provisional amount initially recorded at December 31, 2017. Additional work is still necessary for a more detailed analysis of the Company’s historical foreign earnings as well as potential correlative adjustments. Any subsequent adjustment to these amounts will be recorded to current tax expense in the quarter of 2018 in which the analysis is complete.



The Company intends to continue maintaining a full valuation allowance on its deferred tax assets until there is sufficient evidence to support the reversal of all or some portion of these allowances. However, considering the Company's current assessment of the probability of maintaining profitability, there is a reasonable possibility that, within the next 12 months, sufficient positive evidence may become available to reach a conclusion that a significant portion, or all, of the valuation allowance will no longer be needed. As such, the Company may release a significant portion, or all, of its valuation allowance against its deferred tax assets within the next 12 months. This release, if any, would result in the recognition of certain deferred tax assets and a decrease to income tax expense for the period such release is recorded.



Unrecognized Tax Benefits



As of July 1, 2018, and December 31, 2017, the amount of unrecognized tax benefits that, if recognized, would affect the Company's effective tax rate totaled $30.2 million and $28.9 million, respectively.



30



Management believes events that could occur in the next 12 months and cause a change in unrecognized tax benefits include, but are not limited to, the following:



•completion of examinations by, and resolution of agreements with, U.S. or foreign taxing authorities; and



•expiration of statutes of limitations applicable to the Company's tax returns.



The calculation of unrecognized tax benefits involves uncertainties in the application of complex global tax regulations. Management regularly assesses the Company’s tax positions in light of legislative, bilateral tax treaty, regulatory, and judicial developments in the countries in which the Company does business. The Company believes it is reasonably possible that it may recognize up to approximately $2.5 million of its existing unrecognized tax benefits within the next 12 months as a result of the events listed above.



Classification of Interest and Penalties



The Company classifies interest and penalties as components of the income tax provision in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations. As of July 1, 2018 and December 31, 2017, the amounts of accrued interest and penalties totaled $12.0 million and $11.0 million, respectively.



NOTE 14. SEGMENT, GEOGRAPHICAL AND CUSTOMER INFORMATION



Segment Information



The Company designs, develops, manufactures and markets a broad range of solutions for embedded systems, from automotive, industrial, consumer electronics, and medical products. 



Operating segments are identified as components of an enterprise for which separate discrete financial information is available for evaluation by the chief operating decision-maker, or decision-making group, in making decisions on how to allocate resources and assess performance. The Company’s chief operating decision maker ("CODM") is considered to be the Chief Executive Officer. 



Income (Loss) Before Income Taxes



[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]



The Company does not allocate goodwill and intangible assets impairment charges, impact of purchase accounting, IPR&D impairment, severance and retention costs, acquisition-related costs, stock-based compensation, interest income and other, and interest expense to its segments. In addition, the Company does not allocate assets to its segments. The Company excludes these items consistent with the manner it internally evaluates its results of operations.



Geographical Information



Property, plant and equipment, net, by geographic locations were as follows:



[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]



The Company tracks its assets by physical location. Although management reviews asset information on a corporate level and allocates depreciation expense by segment, the Company’s CODM does not review asset information on a segment basis.



Customer Information



Outstanding accounts receivable from two of the Company's distributors accounted for 23.8% and 12.3% of its consolidated accounts receivable as of July 1, 2018. Outstanding accounts receivable from one of the Company's distributors accounted for 28.0% of its consolidated accounts receivable as of December 31, 2017.



Revenue earned through two of the Company's distributors accounted for 18.9% and 12.7% of its consolidated revenues for the three months ended July 1, 2018. Revenue earned through two of the Company's distributors accounted for 19.1% and 13.1% of its consolidated revenues for the six months ended July 1, 2018. No other distributors or customers accounted for 10% or more of the Company's consolidated revenues for the three months or six months ended July 1, 2018.



Revenue earned through one of the Company’s distributors accounted for 16.4% of its consolidated revenues for the three months ended July 2, 2017. Revenue earned through one of the Company’s distributors accounted for 16.7% of its consolidated revenues for the six months ended July 2, 2017. No other distributors or customers accounted for 10% or more of the Company's consolidated revenues for the three months or six months ended July 2, 2017.



NOTE 15. ACCUMULATED OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME (LOSS)



The changes in accumulated other comprehensive loss, net of tax, by components are as follows (in thousands):

NOTE 16. RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS



31



In the ordinary course of business, the Company purchases from, or sells to (a) entities for which one of the Company's directors or executive officers serves as a director or (b) entities that are otherwise affiliated with one of the Company's directors or executive officers (collectively, "related parties").



For the indicated periods, the following table presents information on the Company's transactions with such entities occurring at a time when the other entity was a related party of the Company



[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]



As of July 1, 2018, and July 2, 2017, balances receivable from related parties totaled $2.4 million and $4.6 million, respectively, and balances payable to related parties totaled $6.5 million and $1.2 million, respectively.



NOTE 17. EQUITY



Stock Buyback Program



On October 20, 2015, the Company's Board of Directors (the "Board") authorized a $450 million stock buyback program. The program allows the Company to purchase its common stock or enter into equity derivative transactions related to its common stock. The timing and actual amount expended with the authorized funds will depend on a variety of factors including the market price of the common stock, regulatory, legal, and contractual requirements, other uses of cash, and other market factors. The program does not obligate us to repurchase any particular amount of common stock and may be modified or suspended at any time at the discretion of the Board. During fiscal quarter ended July 1, 2018, the Company repurchased 610 thousand shares for an aggregate consideration of $10.0 million. As of July 1, 2018, the total remaining dollar amount of shares that may be repurchased under the program was approximately $200.8 million.



Dividend



On May 11, 2018, the Company's Board of Directors approved a cash dividend of $0.11 per share payable to holders of record of its common stock at the close of the business day on June 28, 2018. This cash dividend was paid on July 19, 2018 and totaled approximately $39.4 million which was accrued for and shown as "Dividends payable" on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets as of July 1, 2018.



ITEM 1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS



The information required by this item is included in Note 10 of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements in Part I Item 1, of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and is incorporated herein by reference.



ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS



You should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties discussed in Part I, Item 1A (Risk Factors) of our Annual Report, any of which could materially affect our business, financial condition, and/or future results. Part I, Item 1A of our Annual Report is incorporated herein by reference. The risk factors in our Annual Report are not repeated in this Quarterly Report, unless the underlying risks have materially changed. The risks described in our Annual Report and this Quarterly Report are not the only risks we face. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and/or future results.



Geopolitical uncertainty, and changes to international trade agreements, tariffs, import and excise duties, taxes or other governmental rules and regulations could adversely affect our business and results of operations



A majority of our revenue is generated from customers located outside the U.S. and a substantial portion of our assets, including employees, are located outside the U.S. Risks associated with international operations, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, liquidity, financial condition and/or results of operations, include:



•political instability, and the possibility of a deteriorating relationship with the United States;



•the imposition of new or modified international trade restrictions, tariffs, import and excise duties or other taxes;



•import and export requirements, including restrictions on sales to certain end customers;



•restrictions on foreign ownership and investments, including potential intervention by the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United Stated (CFIUS) or by other applicable administrative review boards to block strategic transactions that might otherwise be in shareholders’ interests;



•restrictions on repatriation of cash earned in countries outside the U.S.;



•changes in local political, economic, social and labor conditions;



•a less developed and less certain legal and regulatory environment in some countries, which, among other things, can create uncertainty regarding contract enforcement, intellectual property rights and liability issues; and



•inadequate levels of compliance with applicable anti-bribery laws, including the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act.



The U.S. federal government or other governmental bodies may propose changes to international trade agreements, tariffs, taxes and other government rules and regulations. Any changes to the international trading system, or the emergence of an international trade dispute, could significantly impact our business and have a negative impact on our revenues. In addition, the U.S. and other countries in which we operate impose import and excise duties, tariffs and other taxes on our products in varying amounts. Any significant increases in import and excise duties or other taxes on our products could have a material adverse effect on our business, liquidity, financial condition and/or results of operations.



For example, our sales were impacted in the second quarter of 2018 when the U.S. Department of Commerce banned U.S. companies from providing exports to ZTE, a Chinese telecoms equipment manufacturer (which ban was subsequently lifted in the third quarter of 2018) in an export controls case. Similarly, general trade tensions between the U.S. and China have been escalating in 2018, with one round of U.S. tariffs on Chinese goods taking effect in July 2018 followed by a round of retaliatory Chinese tariffs on U.S. goods. Although we do not anticipate any material impact on our supply chain costs from the July 2018 round of U.S. tariffs (and to date the Chinese tariffs have generally focused on other industries), further rounds of tariffs have been threatened by U.S. and Chinese leaders. 



•If the U.S. were to impose tariffs on components that we or our suppliers source from China, the tariffs could cause our cost for such components to increase, which could narrow the profits we earn from U.S. sales of products containing such components or force us to raise prices, negatively impacting our U.S. sales. 



•Some of our customers manufacture products containing our components for re-sale into the U.S. If the U.S. were to impose tariffs on the finished goods that our customers import into the U.S., such tariffs could negatively impact our customers' sales, thereby causing an indirect negative impact on our own sales.



40



•If China were to impose new tariffs on the products we sell in China, or on finished goods our end customers sell in China, such tariffs could directly or indirectly reduce demand for our products, negatively impacting our sales. 



We could also be affected by nationalization of our international operations, unstable governments, unfamiliar or biased legal systems or intergovernmental disputes. Any determination that our operations or activities did not comply with applicable U.S. or foreign laws or regulations could result in the imposition of fines and penalties, interruptions of business, terminations of necessary licenses and permits, and other legal and equitable sanctions.



These international economic and political uncertainties and regulatory changes could have a material adverse effect on our, or our suppliers’ and distributors’, business, liquidity, financial condition and/or results of operations. 



We are dependent on third parties to manufacture products, distribute products, generate a significant portion of our product sales, fulfill our customer orders and transport our products. Problems in the performance or availability of these companies could seriously harm our financial performance.



We rely significantly on independent contractors to manufacture, which includes assembly of, our products. In addition, in March 2017, we divested a manufacturing facility located in Minnesota, which reduced our internal manufacturing capacity.



If market demand for our products exceeds our internal manufacturing capacity and available capacity from our foundry partners, we may seek additional foundry manufacturing arrangements. A shortage in foundry manufacturing capacity, which is more likely to occur at times of increasing demand, could hinder our ability to meet demand for our products and therefore adversely affect our operating results. Suppliers may extend lead times, limit supplies or increase prices due to commodity price increases, capacity constraints or other factors, which may lead to supply interruptions which could materially harm our results of operations. In addition, greater demand for wafers produced by any such foundries without an offsetting increase in foundry capacity raises the likelihood of potential shortages and wafer price increases. Our operations would be disrupted if any of our foundry partners terminates its relationship with us, delays its shipments to us, or experiences financial difficulty and we are unable to arrange a satisfactory alternative to fulfill customer orders on a timely basis and in a cost-effective manner. There are also only a few foundry vendors that have the capabilities to manufacture our most advanced products. If we need to engage alternate sources of supply, such sources may be unavailable on commercially reasonable terms, or at all. Even if we are able to engage alternate sources of supply, we may encounter start-up difficulties or yield issues or incur additional costs. Shipments could be delayed significantly while these sources are engaged and qualified for volume production.



While many of our products are assembled, packaged and tested at our manufacturing facilities located in the Philippines and Thailand, we rely on independent subcontractors to assemble, package and test the balance of our products. We cannot be certain that these subcontractors will continue to assemble, package and test products for us on acceptable economic and quality terms or at all and it might be difficult for us to find alternatives if they do not do so.



Our foundry partners and assembly and test subcontractors have operations in locations that may suffer the impact of certain natural disasters and political risk, which could impact their ability to provide us with our products. We monitor these events closely, but if one of our third-party manufacturing partners were to suffer significant damage to its operations as a result of a natural disaster or other catastrophic events, our ability to timely meet consumer demand would suffer which would materially harm our results of operations.



Our channel partners include distributors and resellers. We continue to expand and change our relationships with our distributors. Worldwide sales through our distributors accounted for approximately 73% of our revenue in fiscal year 2017. We rely on many distributors to assist us in creating customer demand, providing technical support and other value-added services to our customers, filling customer orders and stocking our products. We face ongoing business risks due to our reliance on our channel partners to create and maintain customer relationships where we have a limited or no direct relationship. Should our relationships with our channel partners or their effectiveness decline, we face the risk of declining demand which could affect our revenue and results of operations. Our contracts with our distributors may be terminated by either party upon notice. The termination of a significant distributor or a reseller could (a) impact our revenue and limit our access to certain end customers, (b) result in the return of a material amount of inventory held by the distributor or reseller that we may not be able to resell or have to resell at a loss, and (c) jeopardize our ability to collect accounts receivable originating through that distributor or reseller. In addition, our distributors are located all over the world and vary in size and financial strength. Any disruptions to our distributors’ operations such as lower sales, lower earnings, debt downgrades, the inability to access capital markets and/or higher interest rates could have an adverse impact on our business.



We also rely on independent carriers and freight haulers to move our products between manufacturing plants and our customers’ facilities. Transport or delivery problems due to their error or because of unforeseen interruptions in their business 



41



due to factors such as strikes, political instability, terrorism, natural disasters or accidents could seriously harm our business, financial condition and results of operations and ultimately impact our relationship with our customers.



Finally, our customers source a variety of materials from various suppliers in addition to Cypress. The failure by third-party suppliers to meet our customers' materials requirements on a timely basis could negatively impact our customers' manufacturing schedules and reduce or delay our customers' demand for our products. For example, in 2018 a shortage of multi-layer ceramic capacitors, or MLCCs (a necessary component on many printed circuit boards), has created challenges for manufacturers in multiple end markets. To the extent our customers experience shortages of necessary materials, they may be forced to slow production of their end products, with a corresponding decline in the rate at which they purchase materials from us.
