OVERVIEW
•
•
•
See Note 14 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Part I, Item 1 of this report for further information regarding these segments and revenue categories.
Our operating results have fluctuated on a quarterly basis in the past, and may vary significantly in future periods, due to a number of factors, including customer order activity and purchase order backlog.
Although the timing of our product deliveries in response to customer orders results in very little purchase order backlog.
Such backlog levels vary because of seasonal trends, the timing of customer projects and other factors that affect customer order lead times.
Many of our customers require prompt delivery of products.
This requires us to maintain sufficient inventory levels to satisfy anticipated customer demand.
If near-term demand for our products declines, or if potential sales in any quarter do not occur as anticipated, our financial results could be adversely affected.
In the second quarter of 2019, we had three 10% of revenue customers geographically diversified in Latin America (“LATAM”), Europe, and the U.S. For the third and fourth quarter of 2019, our current expectations include the effect of a temporary slowdown in capital spending in one of these regions for access at a Tier-1 European carrier customer for the remainder of 2019, however the full effect of this slowdown has not yet been determined.
We believe that normal spending should resume at the beginning of 2020.
Operating expenses are relatively fixed in the short term; therefore, a shortfall in quarterly revenue could significantly impact our financial results in a given quarter.
Our operating results may also fluctuate as a result of a number of other factors, including a decline in general economic and market conditions, foreign currency exchange rate movements, changes related to domestic and international tariffs, increased competition, customer order patterns, changes in product and services mix, timing differences between price decreases and product cost reductions, product warranty returns, expediting costs and announcements of new products by us or our competitors.
Additionally, maintaining sufficient inventory levels to assure prompt delivery of our products increases the amount of inventory that may become obsolete and increases the risk that the obsolescence of this inventory may have an adverse effect on our business and operating results.
Also, not maintaining sufficient inventory levels to assure prompt delivery of our products may cause us to incur expediting costs to meet customer delivery requirements, which may negatively impact our operating results in a given quarter.
Accordingly, our historical financial performance is not necessarily a meaningful indicator of future results, and in general, management expects that our financial results may vary from period to period.
Factors that could materially affect our business, financial condition or operating results are included in Part I, Item 1A of the 2018 Form 10-K and in Part II, Item 1A of this Form 10-Q.
CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES
During the three months ended June 30, 2019, the Company changed the manner in which it estimates its excess and obsolete inventory reserves.
Under the new policy, we establish reserves for estimated excess and obsolete inventory equal to the difference between the cost of the inventory and the estimated net realizable value of the inventory based on historical usage, known trends, inventory age, and market conditions.
When we dispose of excess and obsolete inventories, the related disposals are charged against the inventory reserve.
See Note 8 of Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements in Part I, Item 1 of this report for additional information.
EFFECT OF RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS
See Note 1 of Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements in Part I, Item 1 of this report for a full description of recent accounting pronouncements, including the expected dates of adoption and estimated effects on results of operations and financial condition, which is incorporated herein by reference.
RESULTS OF OPERATIONS – THREE AND SIX MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2019 COMPARED TO THREE AND SIX MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2018
The following table presents selected financial information derived from our Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income expressed as a percentage of sales for the periods indicated.
Amounts may not foot due to rounding.
SALES
COST OF SALES
As a percentage of sales, cost of sales decreased from 61.0% for the three months ended June 30, 2018 to 58.4% for the three months ended June 30, 2019 and decreased from 63.9% for the six months ended June 30, 2018 to 58.2% for the six months ended June 30, 2019.
The decrease in cost of sales as a percentage of sales for the three months ended June 30, 2019 was primarily attributable to an increase in volume, a regional revenue shift, changes in customer and product mix and changes in services and support mix.
The decrease in cost of sales as a percentage of sales for the six months ended June 30, 2019 was primarily attributable to an increase in volume, a regional revenue shift, changes in customer and product mix, changes in services and support mix and a decrease in labor expense as a result of a restructuring program initiated in the first quarter of 2018.
Network Solutions segment cost of sales, as a percentage of that segment’s sales, decreased from 60.5% for the three months ended June 30, 2018 to 57.6% for the three months ended June 30, 2019 and decreased from 62.7% for the six months ended June 30, 2018 to 57.0% for the six months ended June 30, 2019.
The decrease in cost of sales as a percentage of sales for the three months ended June 30, 2019 was primarily attributable to an increase in volume, a regional revenue shift and changes in customer and product mix.
The decrease in cost of sales as a percentage of sales for the six months ended June 30, 2019 was primarily attributable to an increase in volume, a regional revenue shift, changes in customer and product mix and a decrease in labor expense due to a restructuring program initiated in the first quarter of 2018.
SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES
Selling, general and administrative expenses increased 4.8% from $32.1 million for the three months ended June 30, 2018 to $33.6 million for the three months ended June 30, 2019, and increased 4.8% from $65.6 million for the six months ended June 30, 2018 to $68.8 million for the six months ended June 30, 2019.
The increase in selling, general and administrative expenses for the three months ended June 30, 2019 was primarily attributable to increases in incremental expenses as a result of the SmartRG acquisition, deferred compensation and short-term incentive compensation.
The increase in selling, general and administrative expenses for the six months ended June 30, 2019 was primarily attributable to increases in deferred compensation and incremental expenses as a result of the SmartRG acquisition offset by decreases in stock-based compensation expense, commissions and restructuring expenses.
As a percentage of sales, selling, general and administrative expenses decreased from 25.1% for the three months ended June 30, 2018 to 21.5% for the three months ended June 30, 2019, and decreased from 26.4% for the six months ended June 30, 2018 to 22.9% for the six months ended June 30, 2019.
Selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales may fluctuate whenever there is a significant fluctuation in revenue for the periods being compared.
RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EXPENSES
Research and development expenses increased 4.3% from $30.7 million for the three months ended June 30, 2018 to $32.1 million for the three months ended June 30, 2019 and increased 0.2% from $63.6 million for the six months ended June 30, 2018 to $63.7 million for the six months ended June 30, 2019.
The increase in research and development expenses for the three months ended June 30, 2019 was primarily attributable to increases in incremental expenses as a result of the SmartRG acquisition and restructuring expenses.
The increase in research and development expense for the six months ended June 30, 2019 was primarily attributable to increases in contract services and increases in incremental expenses as a result of the SmartRG acquisition, partially offset by decreases in personnel expense and stock-based compensation expense.
As a percentage of sales, research and development expenses decreased from 24.0% for the three months ended June 30, 2018 to 20.5% for the three months ended June 30, 2019, and decreased from 25.5% for the six months ended June 30, 2018 to 21.2% for the six months ended June 30, 2019.
Research and development expenses as a percentage of sales will fluctuate whenever there are incremental product development activities or significant fluctuations in revenue for the periods being compared.
We expect to continue to incur research and development expenses in connection with our new and existing products and our continued expansion into international markets.
We continually evaluate new product opportunities and engage in intensive research and product development efforts, which provides for new product development, enhancement of existing products and product cost reductions.
We may incur significant research and development expenses prior to the receipt of revenue from a major new product group.
GAIN ON CONTINGENCY
Gain on contingency, which was $1.2 million for the three and six months ended June 30, 2019, relates to the reversal of unearned contingent liabilities which were initially recognized upon the acquisition of SmartRG in the fourth quarter of 2018.
See Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part I, Item 1 of this report for additional information.
INTEREST AND DIVIDEND INCOME
Interest and dividend income decreased 24.2% from $0.9 million for the three months ended June 30, 2018 to $0.7 million for the three months ended June 30, 2019, and decreased 27.9% from $1.8 million for the six months ended June 30, 2018 to $1.3 million for the six months ended June 30, 2019.
The changes in interest and dividend income for the three and six months ended June 30, 2019 were primarily attributable to fluctuations in investment balances.
INTEREST EXPENSE
Interest expense, which is primarily related to our taxable revenue bond, remained constant at $0.1 million in the three months ended June 30, 2018 and 2019 and $0.3 million in the six months ended June 30, 2018 and 2019, as we had no substantial change in our fixed-rate borrowing.
See “Liquidity and Capital Resources” below for additional information on our revenue bond.
NET INVESTMENT GAIN
Net investment gain increased from $1.0 million for the three months ended June 30, 2018 to $2.5 million for the three months ended June 30, 2019, and increased from $0.9 million for the six months ended June 30, 2018 to $8.4 million for the six months ended June 30, 2019.
The fluctuation in our net investment gain was primarily attributable to changes in fair value of equity securities recognized during the period.
See Note 7 of Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements, included in Part I, Item 1 of this report, and “Investing Activities” in “Liquidity and Capital Resources” below for additional information.
OTHER INCOME (EXPENSE), NET
Other income (expense), net is comprised primarily of miscellaneous income and gains and losses on foreign currency transactions.
Other income (expense), net remained flat at $0.2 million of expense for the three months ended June 30, 2018 and 2019, and increased from $0.3 million of expense for the six months ended June 30, 2018 to $0.7 million of income for the six months ended June 30, 2019.
The change in other income (expense), net for the six months ended June 30, 2019 was primarily attributable to the receipt of insurance proceeds from a life insurance policy.
GAIN ON BARGAIN PURCHASE OF A BUSINESS, NET
Gain on bargain purchase of a business, net, which was $11.3 million during the six months ended June 30, 2018, was related to our acquisition of Sumitomo Electric Lightwave Corp.’s North American EPON business and entry into a technology license and supply agreement with Sumitomo Electric Industries, Ltd. in March 2018.
No gain on bargain purchase of a business was recorded during the three or six months ended June 30, 2019.
BENEFIT FOR INCOME TAXES
Our effective tax rate decreased from a benefit of 31.9% for the three months ended June 30, 2018 to a benefit of 17.3% for the three months ended June 30, 2019, and increased from a benefit of 20.1%, excluding the tax effect of the bargain purchase gain, for the six months ended June 30, 2018 to a benefit of 6.2% for the six months ended June 30, 2019.
The increase in the effective tax rate between the two periods was primarily driven by the shift to profitability for the three and six months ended June 30, 2019, with tax expense being offset by a 29.1% rate reduction related to a transfer pricing study completed during the second quarter of 2019 that resulted in the assignment of operating expenditures to specific company locations, and the effective income tax rates among the respective jurisdictions.
NET INCOME (LOSS)
As a result of the above factors, net income (loss) increased $11.7 million from a net loss of $(7.7) million for the three months ended June 30, 2018 to net income of $4.0 million for the three months ended June 30, 2019, and increased $23.3 million from a net loss of $(18.5) million for the six months ended June 30, 2018 to net income of $4.8 million for the six months ended June 30, 2019.
LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES
Liquidity
We intend to finance our operations with cash flow from operations.
We have used, and expect to continue to use, the cash generated from operations for working capital, purchases of treasury stock, shareholder dividends, business acquisitions and other general corporate purposes, including (i) product development activities to enhance our existing products and develop new products and (ii) expansion of sales and marketing activities.
We believe our cash and cash equivalents, investments and cash generated from operations to be adequate to meet our operating and capital needs for at least the next 12 months.
At June 30, 2019, cash on hand was $106.8 million and short-term investments were $30.9 million, which resulted in available short-term liquidity of $137.7 million, of which $64.1 million was held by our foreign subsidiaries.
At December 31, 2018, cash on hand was $105.5 million and short-term investments were $3.2 million, which resulted in available short-term liquidity of $108.7 million, of which $87.1 million was held by our foreign subsidiaries.
The increase in short-term liquidity from December 31, 2018 to June 30, 2019 is primarily attributable to a restricted certificate of deposit of $25.6 million, which serves as collateral for our revenue bond, being reclassified from a long-term investment to a short-term investment.
Operating Activities
Our working capital, which consists of current assets less current liabilities, increased 0.2% from $237.4 million as of December 31, 2018 to $238.0 million as of June 30, 2019, and our current ratio, defined as current assets divided by current liabilities, decreased from 3.01 as of December 31, 2018 to 2.64 as of June 30, 2019.
The slight increase in our working capital and decrease in our current ratio was primarily attributable to the reclassification of our bond payable to current liabilities as it matures in January 2020, as well as the reclassification of the related restricted certificate of deposit from a long-term investment to a short-term investment.
The quick ratio, defined as cash, cash equivalents, short-term investments, and net accounts receivable, divided by current liabilities, decreased from 1.76 as of December 31, 2018 to 1.75 as of June 30, 2019.
The decrease in the quick ratio was primarily attributable to the reclassification of our bond payable to current liabilities as it matures in January 2020, partially offset by an increase in short-term investments, primarily related to the reclassification of our restricted certificate of deposit from a long-term investment to a short-term investment.
Net accounts receivable increased 17.4% from $99.4 million at December 31, 2018 to $116.7 million at June 30, 2019.
Our allowance for doubtful accounts was $0.1 million at December 31, 2018 and June 30, 2019.
Quarterly accounts receivable day’s sales outstanding (DSO) increased from 65 days as of December 31, 2018 to 68 days as of June 30, 2019.
The increase in net accounts receivable was due to an increase in volume, the timing of customer mix and international shipments.
Other receivables decreased 31.9% from $36.7 million at December 31, 2018 to $25.0 million at June 30, 2019.
The decrease in other receivables was primarily attributable to a decrease in contract assets, leased equipment receivables, contract manufacturers’ receivables and income tax receivables.
Quarterly inventory turnover increased from 3.29 turns as of December 31, 2018 to 3.87 turns at June 30, 2019.
Inventory decreased 3.5% from $99.8 million at December 31, 2018 to $95.1 million at June 30, 2019.
We expect inventory levels to fluctuate as we attempt to maintain sufficient inventory in response to services activity and seasonal cycles of our business, ensuring competitive lead times while managing the risk of inventory obsolescence that may occur due to rapidly changing technology and customer demand.
Accounts payable increased 6.3% from $60.1 million at December 31, 2018 to $63.8 million at June 30, 2019.
Accounts payable will fluctuate due to variations in the timing of the receipt of supplies, inventory and services and our subsequent payments for these purchases.
Investing Activities
Capital expenditures totaled approximately $4.3 million and $4.2 million for the six months ended June 30, 2019 and 2018, respectively.
These expenditures were primarily used to purchase computer hardware, software, manufacturing and test equipment and building improvements.
Our combined short-term and long-term investments increased $6.1 million from $112.1 million at December 31, 2018 to $118.2 million at June 30, 2019.
This increase reflects the impact of net realized and unrealized gains and losses on our combined investments plus new investments.
Our long-term investments decreased 19.8% from $108.8 million at December 31, 2018 to $87.3 million at June 30, 2019.
Long-term investments at December 31, 2018 included an investment in a certificate of deposit of $25.6 million, which serves as collateral for our revenue bond.
This certificate of deposit is now included in short-term investments as of June 30, 2019, as this bond matures on January 1, 2020.
See “Debt” below for additional information.
We also have investments in various marketable equity securities classified as long-term investments with a fair market value of $32.7 million and $27.0 million, at June 30, 2019 and December 31, 2018, respectively.
Long-term investments at June 30, 2019 and December 31, 2018 also included $21.2 million and $18.3 million, respectively, related to our deferred compensation plans.
No businesses were acquired during the six months ended June 30, 2019.
Acquisition of businesses, net of cash acquired, totaled $7.8 million for the six months ended June 30, 2018.
See Note 2 of Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part I, Item 1 of this report for additional information.
Financing Activities
Dividends
In July 2003, our Board of Directors elected to begin declaring quarterly dividends on our common stock considering the tax treatment of dividends and adequate levels of Company liquidity.
During the six months ended June 30, 2019 and 2018, we paid dividends totaling $8.6 million and $8.7 million, respectively.
The continued payment of dividends is at the discretion of the Company’s Board of Directors and is subject to general business conditions and ongoing financial results of the Company.
Debt
Stock Repurchase Program
Since 1997, our Board of Directors has approved multiple share repurchase programs that have authorized repurchases of our common stock, which are implemented through open market or private purchases from time to time as conditions warrant.
During the six months ended June 30, 2019, we repurchased 13 thousand shares of our common stock, for $0.2 million at an average price of $14.06 per share.
We currently have authorization to repurchase an additional 2.5 million shares of our common stock under the current authorization of up to 5.0 million shares.
Stock Option Exercises
We issued 34,000 shares of treasury stock during the six months ended June 30, 2019 to accommodate employee stock option exercises.
The stock options had exercise prices ranging from $15.33 to $16.97.
We received proceeds totaling $0.5 million from the exercise of these stock options during the six months ended June 30, 2019.
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements and Contractual Obligations
We do not have off-balance sheet financing arrangements and have not engaged in any related party transactions or arrangements with unconsolidated entities or other persons that are reasonably likely to materially affect liquidity or the availability of or requirements for capital resources.
During the six months ended June 30, 2019, there have been no material changes in contractual obligations and commercial commitments from those discussed in the 2018 Form 10-K.
We have committed to invest up to an aggregate of $7.9 million in two private equity funds, of which $7.7 million has been applied to these commitments as of June 30, 2019.
ITEM 2.
UNREGISTERED SALES OF EQUITY SECURITIES AND USE OF PROCEEDS
On July 14, 2015, our Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of an additional 5.0 million shares of our common stock (bringing the total shares authorized for repurchase since 1997 to 50.0 million).
This authorization will be implemented through open market or private purchases from time to time as conditions warrant.
We currently have authorization to repurchase 2.5 million shares of our common stock under the current authorization of up to 5.0 million shares.
