OTHER INFORMATION
ITEM 1A.
RISK FACTORS
Increased tariffs caused by changes in trade policies of the United States or other countries in which we do business, which could trigger retaliatory actions by affected countries resulting in “trade wars”, may increase costs for material imported into the United States and other countries.
This in turn may increase our cost of goods and result in reduced profit margins or customer demand for some of our products or in trading partners limiting their trade with the United States.
ITEM 2.
UNREGISTERED SALES OF EQUITY SECURITIES AND USE OF PROCEEDS
On July 14, 2015, our Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of an additional 5.0 million shares of our common stock (bringing the total shares authorized for repurchase to 50.0 million).
This authorization will be implemented through open market or private purchases from time to time as conditions warrant.
