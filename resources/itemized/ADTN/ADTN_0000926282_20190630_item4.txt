ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 





As of the end of the period covered by this report, an evaluation was carried out by management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(e)) pursuant to Rule 13a-15 of the Exchange Act. Based upon that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of June 30, 2019 due to the material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting described in the 2018 Form 10-K and below.  



Material Weaknesses 





•  



Management determined that controls were not effectively designed, documented, and maintained to verify that the existence of all inventories subject to our cycle count program were included and counted at the frequency required under the Company’s internal policies, and that the key reports and related data used to monitor the results of this program were not validated to ensure completeness and accuracy. 



•  



Management determined that controls were not effectively designed and maintained over the determination of the estimated reserve for excess and obsolete inventory, including the review of significant inputs and assumptions used to determine our excess and obsolete inventory reserve, and to ensure the completeness and accuracy of key reports and related data used in the calculation of this reserve. 



Despite the existence of these material weaknesses, we believe that the consolidated financial statements included in this report (as well as the financial statements included in the Form 10-Q for the period ended March 31, 2019) present fairly, in all material respects, our financial position, results of operations, and cash flows for the periods presented, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. These material weaknesses did not result in any material misstatement to the Company’s financial statements or disclosures but did result in an out-of-period adjustment with the effect of increasing cost of goods sold during the three months ended June 30, 2019 and decreasing cost of goods sold for the six months ended June 30, 2019. However, these material weaknesses could result in a misstatement of the Company’s interim or annual consolidated financial statements and disclosures that would result in a material misstatement that would not be prevented or detected.
