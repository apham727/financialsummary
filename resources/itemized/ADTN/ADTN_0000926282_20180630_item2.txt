ITEM 2.
MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements and the related notes that appear elsewhere in this document.
OVERVIEW
ADTRAN, Inc. is a leading global provider of networking and communications equipment.
Our solutions enable voice, data, video and Internet communications across a variety of network infrastructures.
These solutions are deployed by many of the United States’ and the world’s largest communications service providers (CSPs), distributed enterprises and small and medium-sized businesses, public and private enterprises, and millions of individual users worldwide.
Customer Devices includes our products and services that provide end users access to CSP networks.
Our Customer Devices portfolio includes a comprehensive array of service provider and enterprise hardware and software products and services.
See Note 13 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this report for further information regarding these product categories.
Sales were $128.0 million and $248.9 million for the three and six months ended June 30, 2018, compared to $184.7 million and $355.0 million for the three and six months ended June 30, 2017.
Our gross margin decreased to 39.0% and 36.1% in the three and six months ended June 30, 2018, from 45.8% and 44.6% in the three and six months ended June 30, 2017.
Our operating income margin decreased to (10.0)% and (15.9)% for the three and six months ended June 30, 2018, from 8.9% and 6.6% for the three and six months ended June 30, 2017.
Net income (loss) was $(7.7) million and $(18.5) million for the three and six months ended June 30, 2018, compared to $12.4 million and $19.1 million for the three and six months ended June 30, 2017.
Our effective tax rate, excluding the effect of the bargain purchase gain in 2018, increased to 31.9% for the three months ended June 30, 2018 from 30.6% for the three months ended June 30, 2017, and decreased to 20.1% for the six months ended June 30, 2018 from 27.3% for the six months ended June 30, 2017.
Earnings (loss) per share, assuming dilution, were $(0.16) and $(0.38) for the three and six months ended June 30, 2018, compared to $0.26 and $0.39 for the three and six months ended June 30, 2017.
Our operating results have fluctuated on a quarterly basis in the past, and may vary significantly in future periods due to a number of factors, including customer order activity and backlog.
Backlog levels vary because of seasonal trends, the timing of customer projects and other factors that affect customer order lead times.
Many of our customers require prompt delivery of products.
This requires us to maintain sufficient inventory levels to satisfy anticipated customer demand.
If near-term demand for our products declines, or if potential sales in any quarter do not occur as anticipated, our financial results could be adversely affected.
Operating expenses are relatively fixed in the short term; therefore, a shortfall in quarterly revenues could significantly impact our financial results in a given quarter.
Our operating results may also fluctuate as a result of a number of other factors, including a decline in general economic and market conditions, foreign currency exchange rate movements, increased competition, customer order patterns, changes in product and services mix, timing differences between price decreases and product cost reductions, product warranty returns, expediting costs and announcements of new products by us or our competitors.
Additionally, maintaining sufficient inventory levels to assure prompt delivery of our products increases the amount of inventory that may become obsolete and increases the risk that the obsolescence of this inventory may have an adverse effect on our business and operating results.
Also, not maintaining sufficient inventory levels to assure prompt delivery of our products may cause us to incur expediting costs to meet customer delivery requirements, which may negatively impact our operating results in a given quarter.
Accordingly, our historical financial performance is not necessarily a meaningful indicator of future results, and in general, management expects that our financial results may vary from period to period.
Factors that could materially affect our business, financial condition or operating results are included in Item 1A of Part I in our most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2017, filed on February 23, 2018 with the SEC.
CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES
Our critical accounting policies and estimates have not changed significantly from those detailed in our most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2017, filed on February 23, 2018 with the SEC.
EFFECT OF RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS
See Note 1 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 1 of this Form 10-Q for a full description of recent accounting pronouncements, including the expected dates of adoption and estimated effects on results of operations and financial condition, which is incorporated herein by reference.
RESULTS OF OPERATIONS – THREE AND SIX MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2018 COMPARED TO THREE AND SIX MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2017
SALES
We recognized a positive revenue impact in the first half of 2017 due to our being awarded a network expansion program by a large European Tier-1 customer.
During the first and second quarters of 2018, this European Tier 1 customer undertook an additional network expansion project.
We anticipate that as our Latin American customers resume their network upgrade projects, we may experience further enhancement to our revenues.
We have recently announced receipt of a new nation-wide award in the APAC region, as well as additional awards based on new ADTRAN technologies in the EMEA region that we believe will likely result in a positive impact to our revenues.
However, a resolution of the regulatory changes affecting a major customer in Mexico has been slower than anticipated, and business with one of our customers in that region has not yet returned to normal levels.
We are continuing to pursue opportunities with new customers in this region.
COST OF SALES
As a percentage of sales, cost of sales increased from 54.2% in the three months ended June 30, 2017 to 61.0% in the three months ended June 30, 2018, and increased from 55.4% in the six months ended June 30, 2017 to 63.9% in the six months ended June 30, 2018.
The increase in cost of sales as a percentage of sales for the three months ended June 30, 2018 is primarily attributable to a regional revenue shift, customer and product mix, services and support mix and an increase in warranty expense.
The increase in cost of sales as a percentage of sales for the six months ended June 30, 2018 is primarily attributable to a regional revenue shift, customer and product mix, services and support mix, an increase in labor expense due to a restructuring program and an increase in warranty expense.
Network Solutions cost of sales, as a percent of that segment’s sales, increased from 51.2% in the three months ended June 30, 2017 to 60.5% in the three months ended June 30, 2018, and increased from 52.3% in the six months ended June 30, 2017 to 62.7% in the six months ended June 30, 2018.
The increase in cost of sales as a percentage of sales for the three months ended June 30, 2018 is primarily attributable to a regional revenue shift, customer and product mix and an increase in warranty expense.
The increase in cost of sales as a percentage of sales for the six months ended June 30, 2018 is primarily attributable to a regional revenue shift, customer and product mix, an increase in labor expense due to a restructuring program, an increase in warranty expense due to a settlement in first quarter of 2017 with a third party supplier for a defective component and purchase discounts received from a contract manufacturer in the first quarter of 2017.
An important part of our strategy is to reduce the product cost of each succeeding product generation and then to lower the product’s price based on the cost savings achieved.
This may cause variations in our gross profit percentage due to timing differences between the recognition of cost reductions and the lowering of product selling prices.
SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES
Selling, general and administrative expenses decreased 7.6% from $34.7 million in the three months ended June 30, 2017 to $32.1 million in the three months ended June 30, 2018, and decreased 5.6% from $69.5 million in the six months ended June 30, 2017 to $65.6 million in the six months ended June 30, 2018.
The decrease in selling, general and administrative expenses for the three months ended June 30, 2018 is primarily attributable to decreases in performance-based compensation expense, travel expense, deferred compensation expense, and independent contractor expense, partially offset by an increase in labor expense due to a restructuring program.
The decrease in selling, general and administrative expenses for the six months ended June 30, 2018 is primarily attributable to a decrease in deferred compensation expense, performance-based compensation expense, travel expense, and independent contractor expense, partially offset by an increase in labor expense due to a restructuring program.
As a percentage of sales, selling, general and administrative expenses increased from 18.8% in the three months ended June 30, 2017 to 25.1% in the three months ended June 30, 2018, and increased from 19.6% in the six months ended June 30, 2017 to 26.4% in the six months ended June 30, 2018.
Selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales may fluctuate whenever there is a significant fluctuation in revenues for the periods being compared.
RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EXPENSES
Research and development expenses decreased 8.4% from $33.6 million in the three months ended June 30, 2017 to $30.7 million in the three months ended June 30, 2018, and decreased 3.0% from $65.5 million in the six months ended June 30, 2017 to $63.6 million in the six months ended June 30, 2018.
The decrease in research and development expenses for the three months ended June 30, 2018 is primarily attributable to decreases in engineering materials, independent contractor expense, amortization of intangibles acquired in the third quarter of 2016 that were fully amortized in 2017, and performance-based compensation expense.
The decrease in research and development expenses for the six months ended June 30, 2018 is primarily attributable to decreases in engineering materials and amortization of intangibles acquired in the third quarter of 2016 that were fully amortized in 2017, partially offset by an increase in labor expense due to a restructuring program.
As a percentage of sales, research and development expenses increased from 18.2% in the three months ended June 30, 2017 to 24.0% in the three months ended June 30, 2018, and increased from 18.5% in the six months ended June 30, 2017 to 25.5% in the six months ended June 30, 2018.
Research and development expenses as a percentage of sales will fluctuate whenever there are incremental product development activities or significant fluctuations in revenues for the periods being compared.
We expect to continue to incur research and development expenses in connection with our new and existing products and our expansion into international markets.
We continually evaluate new product opportunities and engage in intensive research and product development efforts, which provides for new product development, enhancement of existing products and product cost reductions.
We may incur significant research and development expenses prior to the receipt of revenues from a major new product group.
INTEREST AND DIVIDEND INCOME
Interest and dividend income decreased 6.1% from $1.0 million in the three months ended June 30, 2017 to $0.9 million in the three months ended June 30, 2018, and decreased 6.6% from $1.9 million in the six months ended June 30, 2017 to $1.8 million in the six months ended June 30, 2018.
The decrease in interest and dividend income for the three and six months ended June 30, 2018 is primarily attributable to a decrease in investment balances and a decrease in the rate of return on those investments.
INTEREST EXPENSE
Interest expense, which is primarily related to our taxable revenue bond, remained constant at $0.1 million in the three months ended June 30, 2017 and 2018, and $0.3 million in the six months ended June 30, 2017 and 2018, as we had no substantial change in our fixed-rate borrowing.
See “Liquidity and Capital Resources” below for additional information on our revenue bond.
NET REALIZED INVESTMENT GAIN
Net realized investment gains decreased 28.8% from $1.4 million in the three months ended June 30, 2017 to $1.0 million in the three months ended June 30, 2018, and decreased 52.0% from $1.9 million in the six months ended June 30, 2017 to $0.9 million in the six months ended June 30, 2018.
The decrease in net realized investment gains for the three and six months ended June 30, 2018 is primarily attributable to changes in fair value on equity securities recognized during the period under ASC 2016-01.
Prior to January 1, 2018, changes in fair value were recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income, net of deferred taxes, on the balance sheet.
See Note 1, Note 7 and “Investing Activities” in “Liquidity and Capital Resources” below for additional information.
OTHER EXPENSE, NET
Other expense, net, comprised primarily of miscellaneous income, gains and losses on foreign currency transactions, gains and losses on foreign exchange forward contracts, investment account management fees, and scrap raw material sales, decreased 69.8% from $0.7 million of expense in the three months ended June 30, 2017 to $0.2 million of expense in the three months ended June 30, 2018, and decreased 53.2% from $0.6 million of expense in the six months ended June 30, 2017 to $0.3 million of expense in the six months ended June 30, 2018.
The change in other expense, net for the three and six months ended June 30, 2018 is primarily attributable to higher losses on foreign exchange contracts in 2017.
GAIN ON BARGAIN PURCHASE OF A BUSINESS
Gain on bargain purchase of a business is related to our acquisition of Sumitomo Electric Lightwave Corp.’s North American EPON business and entry into a technology license and supply agreement with Sumitomo Electric Industries, Ltd. on March 19, 2018.
See Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.
INCOME TAXES
Our effective tax rate decreased from an expense of 27.3% in the six months ended June 30, 2017 to a benefit of 20.1%, excluding the tax effect of the bargain purchase gain, in the six months ended June 30, 2018.
The decrease in the effective tax rate between the two periods is primarily attributable to the change in income and the effect of the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, which was signed into law on December 22, 2017.
NET INCOME (LOSS)
As a result of the above factors, net income (loss) decreased $20.1 million from $12.4 million in the three months ended June 30, 2017 to $(7.7) million in the three months ended June 30, 2018, and decreased $37.5 million from $19.1 million in the six months ended June 30, 2017 to $(18.5) million in the six months ended June 30, 2018.
LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES
Liquidity
We intend to finance our operations with cash flow from operations.
We have used, and expect to continue to use, the cash generated from operations for working capital, purchases of treasury stock, shareholder dividends, and other general corporate purposes, including (i) product development activities to enhance our existing products and develop new products and (ii) expansion of sales and marketing activities.
We believe our cash and cash equivalents, investments and cash generated from operations to be adequate to meet our operating and capital needs for at least the next 12 months.
At June 30, 2018, cash on hand was $100.3 million and short-term investments were $6.1 million, which resulted in available short-term liquidity of $106.4 million, of which $83.0 million was held by our foreign subsidiaries.
At December 31, 2017, cash on hand was $86.4 million and short-term investments were $16.1 million, which resulted in available short-term liquidity of $102.6 million, of which $56.8 million was held by our foreign subsidiaries.
We intend to permanently reinvest the funds held by our foreign subsidiaries outside the U.S. and our current business plans do not indicate a need to repatriate these funds to finance domestic operations.
The increase in short-term liquidity from December 31, 2017 to June 30, 2018 is primarily attributable to shifts among available investment option tenures to provide funds for our short-term cash needs.
Operating Activities
Our working capital, which consists of current assets less current liabilities, decreased 26.7% from $306.3 million as of December 31, 2017 to $224.6 million as of June 30, 2018, and our current ratio, defined as current assets divided by current liabilities, decreased from 3.87 as of December 31, 2017 to 2.93 as of June 30, 2018.
The decreases in our working capital and current ratio are primarily attributable to decreases in accounts receivable and prepaid expenses and other current assets, and an increase in income tax payable.
The quick ratio, defined as cash, cash equivalents, short-term investments, and net accounts receivable, divided by current liabilities, decreased from 2.31 as of December 31, 2017 to 1.57 as of June 30, 2018.
The decrease in the quick ratio is primarily attributable to a decrease in accounts receivable and an increase in income tax payable.
Accounts receivable decreased 47.2% from $144.2 million at December 31, 2017 to $76.1 million at June 30, 2018.
We had no allowance for doubtful accounts at December 31, 2017 or June 30, 2018.
Quarterly accounts receivable days sales outstanding (DSO) decreased from 105 days as of December 31, 2017 to 54 days as of June 30, 2018.
The decrease in net accounts receivable is due to the collection of customer-specific payment terms that became due in the first quarter of 2018 and the timing of sales and collections during the quarter.
Additionally, certain international customers may have longer payment terms than U.S. customers.
Quarterly inventory turnover decreased from 3.09 turns as of December 31, 2017 to 2.60 turns at June 30, 2018.
Inventory decreased 1.6% from $122.5 million at December 31, 2017 to $120.5 million at June 30, 2018.
We expect inventory levels to fluctuate as we attempt to maintain sufficient inventory in response to services activity and seasonal cycles of our business, ensuring competitive lead times while managing the risk of inventory obsolescence that may occur due to rapidly changing technology and customer demand.
Prepaid expense and other current assets decreased 45.2% from $17.3 million at December 31, 2017 to $9.5 million at June 30, 2018.
The decrease in prepaid expenses and other current assets is primarily attributable to the recognition of deferred costs related to network installation services that were completed during the first quarter.
Income tax payable increased 203.6% from $3.9 million at December 31, 2017 to $11.9 million at June 30, 2018.
The increase in income tax payable is primarily attributable to income taxes accrued for foreign jurisdictions.
Investing Activities
Capital expenditures totaled approximately $4.2 million and $7.5 million for the six months ended June 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively.
These expenditures were primarily used to purchase computer hardware, software, manufacturing and test equipment, and building improvements.
Our combined short-term and long-term investments increased $4.1 million from $146.4 million at December 31, 2017 to $150.5 million at June 30, 2018.
This increase reflects funds available for investment provided by our operating activities, as well as net realized and unrealized gains and losses and amortization of net premiums on our combined investments, partially offset by our cash needs for capital expenditures, purchases of treasury stock, and shareholder dividends.
Our long-term investments increased 10.9% from $130.3 million at December 31, 2017 to $144.4 million at June 30, 2018.
Long-term investments at June 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017 included an investment in a certificate of deposit of $26.7 million and $27.8 million, respectively, which serves as collateral for our revenue bond.
See “Debt” below for additional information.
We have various equity investments included in long-term investments with a fair value of $37.6 million and $35.7 million, at June 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017, respectively.
Long-term investments at June 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017 also included $20.4 million and $19.9 million, respectively, related to our deferred compensation plans, and $0.5 million of other investments carried at cost, consisting of interests in two private equity funds and an investment in a privately held telecommunications equipment manufacturer.
Financing Activities
Dividends
In July 2003, our Board of Directors elected to begin declaring quarterly dividends on our common stock considering the tax treatment of dividends and adequate levels of Company liquidity.
During the six months ended June 30, 2018, we paid dividends totaling $8.7 million.
Debt
Stock Repurchase Program
Since 1997, our Board of Directors has approved multiple share repurchase programs that have authorized open market repurchase transactions of up to 50.0 million shares of our common stock that are implemented through open market or private purchases from time to time as conditions warrant.
During the six months ended June 30, 2018, we repurchased 0.8 million shares of our common stock at an average price of $15.72 per share.
As of June 30, 2018, we have the authority to purchase an additional 2.7 million shares of our common stock under the current plans approved by the Board of Directors.
Stock Option Exercises
We issued 24 thousand shares of treasury stock during the six months ended June 30, 2018 to accommodate employee stock option exercises.
The stock options had exercise prices ranging from $15.29 to $18.97.
We received proceeds totaling $0.4 million from the exercise of these stock options during the six months ended June 30, 2018.
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements and Contractual Obligations
We do not have off-balance sheet financing arrangements and have not engaged in any related party transactions or arrangements with unconsolidated entities or other persons that are reasonably likely to materially affect liquidity or the availability of or requirements for capital resources.
During the six months ended June 30, 2018, there have been no material changes in contractual obligations and commercial commitments from those discussed in our most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2017 filed on February 23, 2018 with the SEC.
We have committed to invest up to an aggregate of $7.9 million in two private equity funds, and we have contributed $8.4 million as of June 30, 2018, of which $7.7 million has been applied to these commitments.
ITEM 2.
UNREGISTERED SALES OF EQUITY SECURITIES AND USE OF PROCEEDS
On July 14, 2015, our Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of an additional 5.0 million shares of our common stock (bringing the total shares authorized for repurchase to 50.0 million).
This authorization will be implemented through open market or private purchases from time to time as conditions warrant.
