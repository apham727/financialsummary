Notes to Unaudited Consolidated Condensed Financial Statements 



Note 1 Basis of Presentation 



In the opinion of management, the accompanying unaudited consolidated condensed financial statements of Badger Meter contain all adjustments (consisting only of normal recurring accruals except as otherwise discussed) necessary to present fairly the Company’s consolidated condensed financial position at March 31, 2019, results of operations, comprehensive income, cash flows and statements of shareholders’ equity for the three-month periods ended March 31, 2019 and 2018. The results of operations for any interim period are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for the full year. 



The preparation of financial statements in conformity with United States generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP") requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes. Actual results could differ from those estimates. 



Note 2 Additional Financial Information Disclosures 



The consolidated condensed balance sheet at December 31, 2018 was derived from amounts included in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018. Refer to the notes to the financial statements included in that report for a description of the Company’s accounting policies and for additional details of the Company’s financial condition. The details in those notes have not changed except as discussed below and as a result of normal adjustments in the interim. 



Warranty and After-Sale Costs 







Note 3 Employee Benefit Plans 



Historically, the Company maintained a non-contributory defined benefit pension plan that covered substantially all U.S. employees who were employed at December 31, 2011. After that date, no further benefits were accrued in this plan. For the frozen pension plan, benefits were based primarily on years of service and, for certain individuals, levels of compensation. In 2018, the Company completed the termination of the non-contributory defined benefit pension plan. 



The Company maintains supplemental non-qualified plans for certain officers and other key employees, and an Employee Savings and Stock Ownership Plan for the majority of the U.S. employees. 



The Company additionally has a postretirement healthcare benefit plan that provides medical benefits for certain U.S. retirees and eligible dependents hired prior to November 1, 2004. Employees are eligible to receive postretirement healthcare benefits upon meeting certain age and service requirements. No employees hired after October 31, 2004 are eligible to receive these benefits. This plan requires employee contributions to offset benefit costs.

The Company disclosed in its financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2018 that it estimated it would pay $0.4 million in other postretirement benefits in 2019 based on actuarial estimates. As of March 31, 2019, $52,000 of such benefits have been paid. The Company continues to believe that its estimated payments for the full year are reasonable. However, such estimates contain inherent uncertainties because cash payments can vary significantly depending on the timing of postretirement medical claims and the collection of the retirees’ portion of certain costs. The amount of benefits paid in calendar year 2019 will not impact the expense for postretirement benefits for 2019. 



Note 4 Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (Loss) 













These accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) components are included in the computation of net periodic benefit cost (income) in Note 3 “Employee Benefit Plans.”

On April 2, 2018, the Company acquired 100% of the outstanding stock of Innovative Metering Solutions, Inc. ("IMS") of Odessa, Florida, which was one of the Company's distributors serving Florida. Acquisitions are accounted for under the purchase method, and accordingly, the results of operations were included in the Company's financial statements from the date of acquisition. The IMS acquisition did not have a material impact on the Company's consolidated financial statements or the notes thereto. 



The total purchase consideration was approximately $12.0 million, which included $7.7 million in cash, a $0.3 million working capital adjustment, a balance sheet holdback of $0.7 million and settlement of $3.3 million of pre-existing Company receivables. The working capital adjustment was settled in the second quarter of 2018 and the balance sheet holdback is recorded in payables on the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheet as it is anticipated to be paid in the next twelve months. The Company's allocation of the purchase price at March 31, 2019 included $3.8 million of receivables, $0.8 million of inventories, $0.1 million of machinery and equipment, $3.6 million of intangibles and $3.7 million of goodwill. The intangible assets acquired are customer relationships with an estimated average useful life of 10 years. The allocation of the purchase price to the assets acquired was based upon the estimated fair values at the date of acquisition. As of March 31, 2019, the Company had completed its analysis for estimating the fair value of the assets acquired with no additional adjustments.  



In the first quarter of 2019, the Company made a contingent payment of $1.0 million related to the May 1, 2017 acquisition of 100% of the outstanding common stock of D-Flow Technology AB (“D-Flow”). There is an additional $2.0 million of contingent payments related to the D-Flow acquisition that is anticipated to be made in 2019 which is recorded in payables on the Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheet at March 31, 2019. 



Note 6 Contingencies, Litigation and Commitments 



In the normal course of business, the Company is named in legal proceedings. There are currently no material legal proceedings pending with respect to the Company. 



The Company is subject to contingencies related to environmental laws and regulations. A future change in circumstances with respect to specific matters or with respect to sites formerly or currently owned or operated by the Company, off-site disposal locations used by the Company, and property owned by third parties that is near such sites, could result in

future costs to the Company and such amounts could be material. Expenditures for compliance with environmental control provisions and regulations during 2018 and the first quarter of 2019 were not material. 



The Company relies on single suppliers for most brass castings, certain resins and electronic subassemblies in several of its product lines. The Company believes these items would be available from other sources, but that the loss of certain suppliers would result in a higher cost of materials, delivery delays, short-term increases in inventory and higher quality control costs in the short term. The Company attempts to mitigate these risks by working closely with key suppliers, purchasing minimal amounts from alternative suppliers and by purchasing business interruption insurance where appropriate. 



The Company reevaluates its exposures on a periodic basis and makes adjustments to reserves as appropriate. 



Note 7 Income Taxes 



The Company is subject to income taxes in the United States and numerous foreign jurisdictions. The Company’s income tax positions are based on interpretations of income tax laws and rulings in each of the jurisdictions that the Company operates. Significant judgment is required in determining the worldwide provision for income taxes and recording the related deferred tax assets and liabilities. The Company’s deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the currently enacted tax rates that apply to taxable income for the years in which the assets or liabilities are expected to be realized or settled. Interim provisions are tied to an estimate of the overall annual rate which can vary due to the relationship of foreign and domestic earnings, state taxes and available deductions, credits and discrete items.  







Note 8 Fair Value Measurements of Financial Instruments 



The Company applies the accounting standards for fair value measurements and disclosures for its financial assets and financial liabilities. The carrying amounts of cash, receivables and payables in the financial statements approximate their fair values due to the short-term nature of these financial instruments. Short-term debt is comprised of notes payable drawn against the Company's lines of credit and commercial paper. Because of its short-term nature, the carrying amount of the short-term debt also approximates fair value. Included in other assets are insurance policies on various individuals who were previously employed by the Company. The carrying amounts of these insurance policies approximate their fair value. 



Note 9 Subsequent Events 



The Company evaluates subsequent events at the date of the balance sheet as well as conditions that arise after the balance sheet date but before the financial statements are issued. The effects of conditions that existed at the balance sheet date are recognized in the financial statements. Events and conditions arising after the balance sheet date but before the financial statements are issued are evaluated to determine if disclosure is required to keep the financial statements from being misleading. To the extent such events and conditions exist, if any, disclosures are made regarding the nature of events and the estimated financial effects for those events and conditions. For purposes of preparing the accompanying consolidated financial statements and the notes to these financial statements, the Company evaluated subsequent events through the date that the accompanying financial statements were issued, and has determined that no material subsequent events exist through the date of this filing. 



Note 10 New Pronouncements 



In August 2018, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) No. 2018-14 “Compensation - Retirement Benefits - Defined Benefit Plans - General (Subtopic 715-20),” which modifies the annual disclosure requirements for defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plans. This ASU as modified added and deleted specific disclosures in an effort to improve the usefulness for financial statement users while also reducing unnecessary costs for companies. The ASU is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2020 with early adoption being permitted in any interim reporting period within the annual reporting period. The Company is currently assessing the impact of adopting ASU No. 2018-14. 





Table of Contents  



In August 2018, the FASB issued ASU No. 2018-13 “Fair Value Measurement (Topic 820),” which is designed to improve the effectiveness of disclosures related to fair value measurements.  This ASU is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2019 and early adoption is allowed in any interim reporting period within the annual reporting period.  The Company is currently assessing the impact of adopting ASU No. 2018-13. 



In January 2017, the FASB issued ASU No. 2017-04 “Intangibles - Goodwill and Other (Topic 350).” The update requires a single-step quantitative test to measure potential impairment based on the excess of a reporting unit's carrying amount over its fair value. A qualitative assessment can still be completed first for an entity to determine if a quantitative impairment test is necessary. The ASU is effective on a prospective basis for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2019 and interim periods thereafter. Early adoption is permitted for interim or annual goodwill impairment tests performed on testing dates after January 1, 2017. The Company adopted ASU No. 2017-04 on January 1, 2019. The adoption of this standard did not have any impact on the Company’s financial statements.  



In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-13 “Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326),” which amends the accounting for credit losses on purchased financial assets and available-for-sale debt securities with credit deterioration. This ASU requires the measurement of all expected credit losses for financial assets, including accounts receivables, held at the reporting date based upon current conditions, historical experience and reasonable forecasts. This ASU is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2019, and early adoption is allowed in any interim reporting period within the annual reporting period. The Company is currently assessing the impact of adopting ASU No. 2016-13. 



In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02 “Leases (Topic 842),” which requires lessees to record most leases on their balance sheets. Lessees initially recognize a lease liability (measured at the present value of the lease payments over the lease term) and a right-of-use asset (measured at the lease liability amount, adjusted for lease prepayments, lease incentives received and the lessee's initial direct costs). Lessees can make an accounting policy election not to recognize ROU assets and lease liabilities for leases with a lease term of 12 months or less as long as the leases do not include options to purchase the underlying assets that the lessee is reasonably certain to exercise. The standard includes the use of a modified retrospective approach for leases that exist or are entered into after the beginning of the earliest comparative period in the financial statements. Full retrospective application is prohibited. In July 2018, the FASB issued ASU No. 2018-11 “Targeted Improvements (Topic 842).” This ASU provides for an optional method of transition which allows companies to adopt the new leasing standard with a cumulative effect adjustment to reinvested earnings. The Company adopted the new leasing standard with the optional transition methodology as of January 1, 2019. For a complete discussion of the adoption of ASU No. 2016-02 and ASU No. 2018-11, see Note 12 “Leases.” 



Note 11 Revenue Recognition 



Revenue for sales of products and services is derived from contracts with customers. The products and services promised in contracts include the sale of municipal water and flow instrumentation products, such as flow meters and radios, software access and other ancillary services. Contracts generally state the terms of sale, including the description, quantity and price of each product or service. Since the customer typically agrees to a stated rate and price in the contract that does not vary over the life of the contract, the majority of the Company's contracts do not contain variable consideration. The Company establishes a provision for estimated warranty and returns as well as certain after sale costs as discussed in Note 2 "Additional Financial Information Disclosures." 



In accordance with ASU No. 2016-10 “Revenue from Contracts with Customers” (“Topic 606”), the Company disaggregates revenue from contracts with customers into geographical regions and by the timing of when goods and services are transferred. The Company determined that disaggregating revenue into these categories meets the disclosure objective in Topic 606 which is to depict how the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows are affected by regional economic factors. 





Table of Contents  











The Company performs its obligations under a contract by shipping products or performing services in exchange for consideration. The Company typically invoices its customers as soon as control of an asset is transferred and a receivable to the Company is established. The Company, however, recognizes a contract liability when a customer prepays for goods or services and the Company has not transferred control of the goods or services. 







The balance of contract assets was immaterial as the Company did not have a significant amount of uninvoiced receivables at March 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018. The difference between the opening and closing balances of the Company's contract liabilities was the result of a timing difference between the Company's performance and the customers' prepayments. 



As of March 31, 2019, the Company had certain contracts where there were unsatisfied performance obligations. For contracts recorded as contract liabilities, $16.7 million was the aggregate amount of the transaction price allocated to performance obligations that were unsatisfied or partially unsatisfied as of the end of the reporting period. The Company estimates that revenue recognized from satisfying those performance obligations will be approximately $3.3 million in 2019, $1.5 million in each year from 2020 through 2024 and $5.9 million thereafter.  



A performance obligation is a promise in a contract to transfer a distinct good or service to the customer, and is the unit of measurement in Topic 606. At contract inception, the Company assesses the products and services promised in its contracts with customers. The Company then identifies performance obligations to transfer distinct products or services to the customer. In order to identify performance obligations, the Company considers all of the products or services promised in the contract regardless of whether they are explicitly stated or are implied by customary business practices. 



The Company's performance obligations are satisfied at a point in time or over time as work progresses. Revenue from products and services transferred to customers at a single point in time accounted for 96.4% and 97.4% of net sales for the three-month periods ended March 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. The majority of the Company's revenue recognized at a  





Table of Contents  



point in time is for the sale of municipal and flow instrumentation products. Revenue from these contracts is recognized when the customer is able to direct the use of and obtain substantially all of the benefits from the product which generally coincides with title transfer during the shipping process. 



Revenue from services transferred to customers over time accounted for 3.6% and 2.6% of sales of net sales for the three-month periods ended March 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. The majority of the Company's revenue that is recognized over time relates to the BEACON AMA software as a service. 





On January 1, 2019, the Company adopted ASU No. 2016-02 and ASU No. 2018-11 using the optional transition method. Under this transition method, comparative periods will continue to be reported in accordance with prior lease guidance under ASC 840 Leases. The Company has elected certain practical expedients permitted under the transition guidance, which, among other things, allows the Company to carry forward historical lease classifications.
