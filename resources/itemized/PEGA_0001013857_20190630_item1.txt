NOTES TO UNAUDITED CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS



1. BASIS OF PRESENTATION



Pegasystems Inc. (together with its subsidiaries, “the Company”) has prepared the accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements pursuant to the rules and regulations of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) regarding interim financial reporting. Accordingly, they do not include all the information required by accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“U.S.”) for complete financial statements and should be read in conjunction with the Company’s audited financial statements included in the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018.



In the opinion of management, the Company has prepared the accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements on the same basis as its audited financial statements, and these financial statements include all adjustments, consisting only of normal recurring adjustments, necessary for a fair presentation of the results of the interim periods presented. 



The operating results for the interim periods presented are not necessarily indicative of the results expected for the full year 2019.



2. NEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS



Financial instruments 



In June 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2016-13, “Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments,” which requires measurement and recognition of expected credit losses for financial assets measured at amortized cost, including accounts receivable, upon initial recognition of that financial asset using a forward-looking expected loss model, rather than an incurred loss model. Credit losses relating to available-for-sale debt securities should be recorded through an allowance for credit losses when the fair value is below the amortized cost of the asset, removing the concept of “other-than-temporary” impairments. The effective date for the Company will be January 1, 2020, with early adoption permitted. The Company does not expect the adoption of this standard will have a material effect on its financial position or results of operations.



Leases



On January 1, 2019, the Company adopted Accounting Standards Codification 842 “Leases” (“ASC 842”) using the modified retrospective method, reflecting any cumulative effect as an adjustment to equity. Results for reporting periods beginning on or after January 1, 2019 are presented under ASC 842, while prior period amounts were not adjusted and continue to be reported in accordance with the Company’s historic accounting under ASC 840 “Leases”.



The Company elected the permitted practical expedients to not reassess the following related to leases that commenced before the effective date of ASC 842: (i) whether any expired or existing contracts contain leases; (ii) the lease classification for any expired or existing leases; and (iii) initial direct costs for any existing leases. Upon adoption, the Company recorded right of use assets of $41.8 million and lease liabilities of $54.2 million. The difference between the value of the right of use assets and lease liabilities is due to the reclassification of existing deferred rent, prepaid rent, and unamortized lease incentives as of January 1, 2019. 



See Note 9. “Leases” for additional information.



3. MARKETABLE SECURITIES



[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]



[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]



As of June 30, 2019, maturities of marketable securities ranged from January 2020 to August 2022, with a weighted-average remaining maturity of approximately 1.5 years.

4. RECEIVABLES, CONTRACT ASSETS, AND DEFERRED REVENUE



Receivables



[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]



Unbilled receivables are client committed amounts for which revenue recognition precedes billing, and billing is solely subject to the passage of time.



Unbilled receivables are expected to be billed in the future as follows:



[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]



Contract assets and deferred revenue



[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]



(1) Included in other current assets. (2) Included in other long-term assets.



[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]



 (1) Included in other long-term liabilities.



Contract assets are amounts under client contracts where revenue recognized exceeds the amount billed to the client and the right to payment is subject to conditions other than the passage of time, such as the completion of a related performance obligation. Deferred revenue consists of billings and payments received in advance of revenue recognition. Contract assets and deferred revenue are netted at the contract level for each reporting period. 



The change in deferred revenue in the six months ended June 30, 2019 was primarily due to $135.8 million of revenue recognized, excluding the impact of netting contract assets and deferred revenue at the contract level, during the period that was included in deferred revenue at December 31, 2018, partially offset by new billings in advance of revenue recognition.



5. DEFERRED CONTRACT COSTS



The Company recognizes an asset for the incremental costs of obtaining a client contract, which primarily relate to sales commissions. The Company expects to benefit from those costs for more than one year, as the Company generally only pays sales commissions on the initial contract, and not any subsequent contract renewals. As a result, there are no commensurate commissions paid on contract renewals. Deferred costs are amortized on a straight-line basis over the benefit period, which is on average 5 years.



[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]



(1) Included in other long-term assets.



[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]



(1) Included in selling and marketing expenses.

6. GOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS



Goodwill



The change in the carrying amount of goodwill was:



[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]



(1) In May 2019, the Company acquired In the Chat Communications Inc., a privately-held software provider of digital customer service software for $10.9 million, net of cash acquired. The Company also expects to issue up to approximately 15 thousand shares in retention-based bonus payments to a key employee upon the achievement of specified retention milestones. The principal assets and liabilities acquired as part of the business combination were additional goodwill and technology intangibles assets of $6.2 million and $5.1 million. The allocation of the purchase price is preliminary for income taxes as the Company is still gathering information.



Intangibles



Intangible assets are recorded at cost and amortized using the straight-line method over their estimated useful lives as follows:



[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]



(1) Included in other long-term assets.

8. FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS 



Assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis



The Company records its cash equivalents, marketable securities, and investments in privately-held companies at fair value on a recurring basis. Fair value is an exit price, representing the amount that would be received from the sale of an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants based on assumptions that market participants would use in pricing an asset or liability. 



As a basis for classifying the fair value measurements, a three-tier fair value hierarchy, which classifies the fair value measurements based on the inputs used in measuring fair value, was established as follows: 



•Level 1 - observable inputs such as quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities; 



•Level 2 - significant other inputs that are observable either directly or indirectly; and 



•Level 3 - significant unobservable inputs on which there is little or no market data, which require the Company to develop its own assumptions. This hierarchy requires the Company to use observable market data, when available, and to minimize the use of unobservable inputs when determining fair value.



The Company’s cash equivalents are composed of money market funds and time deposits, which are classified within Level 1 and Level 2, respectively, in the fair value hierarchy. The Company’s marketable securities, which are classified within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy are valued based on a market approach using quoted prices, when available, or matrix pricing compiled by third party pricing vendors, using observable market inputs such as interest rates, yield curves, and credit risk. The Company’s investments in privately-held companies are classified within Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy.



If applicable, the Company will recognize transfers into and out of levels within the fair value hierarchy at the end of the reporting period in which the actual event or change in circumstance occurs. There were no transfers between levels during the six months ended June 30, 2019.



The Company’s assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis were:



[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]



(1) Included in other long-term assets.



[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]



(1) Included in other long-term assets.



For certain other financial instruments, including accounts receivable and accounts payable, the carrying value approximates fair value due to the relatively short maturity of these items.



9. LEASES



The Company’s leases are primarily for office space used in the ordinary course of business. 



Accounting policy



All the Company’s leases are operating leases. The Company accounts for a contract as a lease when it has the right to control the asset for a period of time while obtaining substantially all of the asset’s economic benefits. The Company determines the initial classification and measurement of its operating right of use assets and lease liabilities at the lease commencement date and thereafter if modified. Fixed lease costs are recognized on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease. Variable lease costs are recognized in the period in which the obligation for those payments is incurred. The Company combines lease and non-lease components in the determination of lease costs for its office space leases. The lease liability includes lease payments related to options to extend or renew the lease term, if the Company is

NOTES TO UNAUDITED CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)



reasonably certain it will exercise those options. The Company’s leases do not contain any material residual value guarantees or restrictive covenants. 



Expense



[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]



(1) Lease costs that are fixed. 



Right of use assets and lease liabilities



[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]



(1) An asset that represents the Company’s right to use the leased asset during the lease term. Included in other long-term assets. (2) Included in other current liabilities.



The weighted-average remaining lease term and discount rate for the Company’s leases were:



[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]



(1) The rates implicit in most of the Company’s leases are not readily determinable, and therefore the Company uses its incremental borrowing rate as the discount rate when measuring operating lease liabilities. The incremental borrowing rate represents an estimate of the interest rate the Company would incur to borrow an amount equal to the lease payments on a collateralized basis over the term of the lease.



Maturities of lease liabilities are:



[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]



(1) Lease liabilities are measured at the present value of the remaining lease payments using a discount rate determined at lease commencement unless the discount rate is updated as a result of a lease reassessment event.



As of December 31, 2018, the Company’s future minimum rental payments required under operating leases with noncancellable terms in excess of one year as determined prior to the adoption of ASC 842 were:



[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]



(1) Operating leases include future minimum rent payments, net of estimated sublease income for facilities that the Company has vacated pursuant to its restructuring activities.

11. STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION 



Expense



[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]



As of June 30, 2019, the Company had $99.5 million of unrecognized stock-based compensation expense, net of estimated forfeitures, which is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 2.2 years.



Grants



The Company granted the following stock-based compensation awards:



[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]



Vestings and exercises



During the six months ended June 30, 2019, 0.8 million shares of common stock were issued due to stock option exercises and RSU vestings under the Company’s stock-based compensation plans.

12. INCOME TAXES



Effective income tax rate



[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]



During the six months ended June 30, 2019, the Company’s effective income tax rate decreased primarily due to the Global Intangible Low-Taxed Income (“GILTI”) and Foreign Derived Intangible Income (“FDII”) provisions of the Tax Reform Act. The Company’s effective income tax rate was also affected by excess tax benefits from stock-based compensation, an increase in U.S. research and development tax credits, and a decrease in uncertain tax positions as a result of the lapse of the statute of limitations on certain foreign reserves.



13. EARNINGS PER SHARE



Basic earnings per share is computed using the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during the applicable period. Diluted earnings per share is computed using the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during the applicable period, plus the dilutive effect of outstanding stock options and RSUs, using the treasury stock method. In periods of loss, all stock options and RSUs are excluded, as their inclusion would be anti-dilutive.



The calculation of the basic and diluted earnings per share was:



[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]



(1) Certain outstanding stock options and RSUs were excluded from the computation of diluted earnings per share because they were anti-dilutive in the period presented. These awards may be dilutive in the future.
