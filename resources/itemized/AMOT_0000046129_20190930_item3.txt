Item 3. Qualitative and Quantitative Disclosures about Market Risk 



Foreign Currency 



We have foreign operations in The Netherlands, Sweden, Germany, China, Portugal, Canada and Mexico, which expose the Company to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations due to transactions denominated in Euros, Swedish Krona, Chinese Renminbi, Canadian dollar and Mexican pesos, respectively. We continuously evaluate our foreign currency risk and will take action from time to time in order to best mitigate these risks. A hypothetical 10% change in the value of the U.S. dollar in relation to our most significant foreign currency exposures would have had an impact of approximately $3,200 on our third quarter 2019 sales and $9,600 on our sales for the nine months ended September 30, 2019. This amount is not indicative of the hypothetical net earnings impact due to partially offsetting impacts on cost of sales and operating expenses in those currencies. We estimate that foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations during the quarter ended September 30, 2019 decreased sales in comparison to quarter ended September 30, 2018 by approximately $1,600. For the nine months ended September 30, 2019 we estimate that foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations decreased sales by approximately $6,700 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2018. 



We translate all assets and liabilities of our foreign operations, where the U.S. dollar is not the functional currency, at the period-end exchange rate and translate sales and expenses at the average exchange rates in effect during the period. The net effect of these translation adjustments is recorded in the condensed consolidated financial statements as Comprehensive Income. The translation adjustment was a loss of approximately $2,369 and $307 for the third quarter of 2019 and 2018, respectively. For the nine months ended September 30, 2019 and 2018, the translation adjustment was a loss of approximately $2,708 and $2,152, respectively. Translation adjustments are not adjusted for income taxes as they relate to permanent investments in our foreign subsidiaries. Net foreign currency transaction gains and losses included in other income, net amounted to a gain of $214 and $17 for the third quarter of 2019 and 2018, respectively. For the nine months ended September 30, 2019 and 2018, net foreign currency transaction gains and losses included in other income, net were a gain of $156 and $173, respectively. A hypothetical 10% change in the value of the U.S. dollar in relation to our most significant foreign currency net assets would have had an impact of approximately $6,350 on our foreign net assets as of September 30, 2019. 



Interest Rates 



Interest rates on our Revolving Facility are based on the LIBOR plus a margin of 1.00% to 2.25% (currently 1.75%) or the Prime Rate plus a margin of 0% to 1.25% (currently 0.75%), in each case depending on the CompanyÂ’s ratio of total funded indebtedness to consolidated EBITDA. We use interest rate derivatives to add stability to interest expense and to manage our exposure to interest rate movements. We primarily use interest rate swaps as part of our interest rate risk management strategy. Interest rate swaps designated as cash flow hedges involve the receipt of variable amounts from a counterparty in

exchange for the Company making fixed-rate payments over the life of the agreements without exchange of the underlying notional amount. During October 2013, the Company entered into two interest rate swaps with a combined notional of $25,000 that amortized quarterly to a notional of $6,673 at the September 2018 maturity. Neither of these interest rate swaps is currently active, one was liquidated as part of the 2016 debt refinancing and the other matured in September 2018. In February 2017, we entered into three interest rate swaps with a combined notional of $40,000 that matures in February 2022. 



As of September 30, 2019, we had $116,849 outstanding under the Revolving Facility, of which $40,000 is currently being hedged. Refer to Note 10 of the notes to the condensed consolidated financial statements for additional information about our outstanding debt. A hypothetical one percentage point (100 basis points) change in the Base Rate on the $76,849 of unhedged floating rate debt outstanding at September 30, 2019 would have an impact of approximately $200 on our interest expense for the third quarter of 2019 and $600 on our interest expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2019.
