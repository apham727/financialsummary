Background


• Evident, formed in April 2015, provides a comprehensive acute care electronic health record ("EHR") solution, Thrive, and related services for community hospitals and their physician clinics.
• Healthland provides a comprehensive acute care EHR solution, Centriq, and related services for community hospitals and their physician clinics.
• TruBridge focuses on providing business management, consulting, and managed IT services along with its complete revenue cycle management ("RCM") solution for all care settings, regardless of their primary healthcare information solutions provider.
• AHT provides a comprehensive post-acute care EHR solution and related services for skilled nursing and assisted living facilities.
Our companies currently support approximately 1,100 acute care facilities and approximately 3,500 post-acute care facilities with a geographically diverse customer mix within the domestic community healthcare market.
Our clients primarily consist of community hospitals with 200 or fewer acute care beds, with hospitals having 100 or fewer beds comprising approximately 94% of our hospital EHR customer base.
Acute Care EHR

Our Acute Care EHR segment consists of acute care software solutions and support sales generated by Evident and Healthland.
Post-acute Care EHR

Our Post-acute Care EHR segment consists of post-acute care software solutions and support sales generated by AHT.
TruBridge

Our TruBridge segment primarily consists of business management, consulting and managed IT services sales generated by TruBridge and the sale of the Rycan revenue cycle management workflow and automation software.
Management Overview

Historically, we have primarily sought revenue growth through sales of healthcare IT systems and related services to existing and new clients within our target market, a strategy that has resulted in a ten-year compounded annual growth rate in legacy revenues (i.e., revenues related to our legacy Evident and TruBridge operations) of approximately 5.9% as of the end of our most recently completed fiscal year.
Important to our potential for continued long-term revenue growth is our ability to sell new and additional products and services to our existing customer base, including cross-selling opportunities presented with the acquisition of Healthland Holding Inc. ("HHI"), the parent company of Healthland, AHT and Rycan Technologies, Inc. We believe that as our combined customer base grows, the demand for additional products and services, including business management, consulting and managed IT services, will also continue to grow, supporting further increases in recurring revenues.
We also expect to drive revenue growth from new product development that we may generate from our research and development activities.
January 2016 marked an important milestone for CPSI, as we announced the completion of our acquisition of HHI, the first major acquisition in the Company's history.
This acquisition expanded our footprint for servicing acute care facilities and introduced us to the post-acute care segment, adding significantly to our already substantial recurring revenue base and further expanding our ability to generate organic recurring revenue growth through additional cross-selling opportunities now available 

within the combined company.
We believe that the addition of HHI and its clients and products has enhanced and will continue to enhance our ability to grow our business and compete in the markets that we serve.
Our business model is designed such that, as revenue growth materializes, earnings and profitability growth are naturally bolstered through increased future margin realization.
Once a hospital has installed our solutions, we continue to provide support services to the customer on an ongoing basis and make available to the customer our broad portfolio of business management, consulting, and managed IT services.
The provision of these services typically requires fewer resources than the initial system installation, resulting in increased overall gross margins.
We also look to increase margins through cost containment measures where appropriate as we continue to leverage opportunities for greater operating efficiencies of the combined entity.
For example, during the first quarter of 2018, we further integrated our acute care product lines into a combined client support group.
Using best practices of the combined companies' implementation processes, we have decreased travel costs for our acute-care installations by approximately 25%.
During the fourth quarter of 2017, TruBridge eliminated approximately $0.6 million per quarter of cloud hosting service costs for the HHI customer base by utilizing in-house resources.
Also, during the first quarter of 2017, we instituted a limited-time, voluntary severance program offering those employees meeting certain predetermined criteria severance packages involving continuing periodic cash payments and healthcare benefits for varying periods, depending upon the individual's years of service with the Company.
Turbulence in the U.S. and worldwide economies and financial markets impacts almost all industries.
While the healthcare industry is not immune to economic cycles, we believe it is more significantly affected by U.S. regulatory and national health projects than by the economic cycles of our economy.
Additionally, healthcare organizations with a large dependency on Medicare and Medicaid populations, such as community hospitals, have been affected by the challenging financial condition of the federal government and many state governments and government programs.
Accordingly, we recognize that prospective hospital clients often do not have the necessary capital to make investments in information technology.
Additionally, in response to these challenges, hospitals have become more selective regarding where they invest capital, resulting in a focus on strategic spending that generates a return on their investment.
Despite these challenges, we believe healthcare information technology is often viewed as more strategically beneficial to hospitals than other possible purchases because the technology also plays an important role in healthcare by improving safety and efficiency and reducing costs.
Additionally, we believe most hospitals recognize that they must invest in healthcare information technology to meet current and future regulatory, compliance and government reimbursement requirements.
In recent years, there have been significant changes to provider reimbursement by the U.S. federal government, followed by commercial payers and state governments.
There is increasing pressure on healthcare organizations to reduce costs and increase quality while replacing fee-for-service in part by enrolling in an advanced payment model.
This pressure could further encourage adoption of healthcare IT and increase demand for business management, consulting, and managed IT services as the future success of these healthcare providers is greatly dependent upon their ability to engage patient populations and to coordinate patient care across a multitude of settings, while optimizing operating efficiency along the way.
We have historically made financing arrangements available to clients on a case-by-case basis depending upon the various aspects of the proposed contract and customer attributes.
These financing arrangements include short-term payment plans and longer-term lease financing through us or third-party financing companies.
For those clients not seeking a financing arrangement, the payment schedule of the typical contract is structured to provide for a scheduling deposit due at contract signing, with the remainder of the contracted fees due at various stages of the installation process (delivery of hardware, installation of software and commencement of training, and satisfactory completion of a monthly accounting cycle or end-of-month operation by each respective application, as applicable).
During 2017, total financing receivables increased by $15.5 million, which had a significant impact on operating cash flow.
The increase in financing arrangements was primarily due to two reasons.
First, meaningful use stage three ("MU3") installations are primarily financed through short-term payment plans.
Second, competitor financing options, primarily through accounts receivables management collections and cloud EHR arrangements, have applied pressure to reduce initial customer capital investment requirements for new EHR installations, leading to the offering of long-term lease options.
We have also historically made our software applications available to clients through "Software as a Service" or "SaaS" configurations, including our Cloud Electronic Health Record ("Cloud EHR") offering.
These offerings are attractive to some clients because this configuration allows them to obtain access to advanced software products without a significant initial capital outlay.
We have experienced a substantial increase in the prevalence of such SaaS arrangements for new system installations and add-on sales to existing clients since 2015, a trend we expect to continue for the foreseeable future.
Unlike our historical perpetual license arrangements under which the related revenue is recognized effectively upon installation, the SaaS arrangements result in revenue being recognized monthly as the services are provided over the term of the arrangement.
As a 

result, the effect of this trend on the Company's financial statements is reduced system sales revenues during the period of installation in exchange for increased recurring periodic revenues (reflected in system sales and support revenues) over the term of the SaaS arrangement.
American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009

While ongoing financial challenges facing healthcare organizations have impacted and are expected to continue to impact the community hospitals that comprise our target market, we believe that the reduced reimbursement under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (the "ARRA") for those providers failing to adopt qualifying EHRs will continue to support demand for healthcare information technology and will have a positive impact on our business prospects through at least 2018.
While we believe that the expanded requirements for continued compliance with meaningful use rules have resulted in an expanded replacement market for EHRs, it is uncertain whether revenues generated from this replacement market will be sufficient to offset the impacts of the overall accelerated adoption and increased penetration of EHRs within our target market.
As a result, our system sales revenues and profitability may be materially and adversely affected during the short-term.
Similarly, compliance with the meaningful use rules has accelerated the purchases of incremental applications by our existing clients.
Consequently, our penetration rates within our existing customer base for our current menu of applications have increased significantly under the ARRA, thereby significantly narrowing the market for add-on sales to existing clients.
As a result of the announcement from CMS on August 2, 2018 of a final rule that changes the attestation period for 2019 and 2020 to any continuous 90-day period instead of the previously-required full year attestation period, hospitals now have until October 1, 2019 to install compliant technology in order to meet the requirements of the program during 2019, compared to a deadline of January 1, 2019 under the previous rule.
While we believe that the stage three requirements of the meaningful use program (re-named "Promoting Interoperability" by such rule) provide a significant opportunity for add-on sales revenues through 2019, the delay by CMS is expected to delay some of the contract revenues we previously anticipated and there is a risk of further delays or reductions in the regulatory requirements imposed on hospitals, which could have an adverse effect on our revenues.
Although we are pursuing other strategic initiatives designed to result in system sales revenue growth in the future in the form of selective expansion into English-speaking international markets, selective expansion within the 100 to 200 bed hospital market, and continued development of new software applications such as our Business Intelligence solution which provides community hospital leaders valuable insight into financial, operational, and clinical data, there can be no guarantee that such initiatives will prove successful or will benefit the Company in a sufficiently timely fashion to offset the short-term effects of the aforementioned narrowing markets.
Results of Operations

During the six months ended June 30, 2018, we generated revenues of $138.8 million from the sale of our products and services, compared to $131.8 million during the six months ended June 30, 2017, an increase of 5% that is primarily attributed to TruBridge client growth.
We view sales of TruBridge solutions within our existing EHR client base as our leading performance indicator.
Our net income for the six months ended June 30, 2018 increased by $2.5 million to $4.3 million from the six months ended June 30, 2017 as a result of revenue growth accompanied with improved gross margins of 53%, a 1% increase from the first six months of 2017.
Net cash provided by operating activities decreased by $8.1 million to $7.8 million provided from operations during the six months ended June 30, 2018, primarily due to a reduction of short-term liabilities and other changes in working capital.
Three Months Ended June 30, 2018 Compared with Three Months Ended June 30, 2017 

Revenues.
Total revenues for the three months ended June 30, 2018 increased slightly $0.2 million, compared to the three months ended June 30, 2017.
Non-recurring system sales and support revenues decreased $2.6 million, or 21%, as volatility in the timing of new customer installations coupled with relative weakness in non-MU3 related add-on sales resulted in a decrease in Acute Care EHR non-recurring revenues of $2.5 million, or 22%.
We installed our Acute Care EHR solutions at three new hospital clients during the second quarter 2018 (one under a SaaS arrangement, resulting in revenue being recognized ratably over the contractual term) compared to ten new hospital clients during the second quarter 2017 (one under a SaaS arrangement).
The ten new hospital client implementations during the second quarter 2017 marked the highest during a quarter since the HHI acquisition, presenting a particularly difficult comparison versus the current quarter's results and resulting in a $3.7 million, or 60%, decrease in new system implementation revenues.
This decrease in new system implementation revenues was partially offset by a $3.4 million increase in MU3 implementations from $0.2 million in the second quarter 2017 to $3.6 million in the second quarter 2018.
However, the impact on our results of these increased MU3 implementation volumes was muted by relative weakness in non-MU3 related add-on sales as a result of the Company's and clients' emphasis on MU3 certification prior to the October 1, 2019 deadline.
Non-recurring Post-acute Care EHR revenues decreased by $0.1 million, or 9%, in the second quarter of 2018 as a result of slowing new installation bookings due to aggressive competition during our effort to make technological improvements to the AHT product line.
Recurring system sales and support revenues were relatively flat, decreasing slightly from $33.1 million in the second quarter of 2017 to $33.0 million in the second quarter of 2018.
Acute Care EHR recurring revenues increased $0.3 million, or 1%, as new Thrive customer growth and additional support fees for MU3-related add-on sales have outweighed attrition primarily from the Healthland customer base.
Post-acute Care EHR recurring revenues decreased by $0.5 million, or 9%, due to attrition attributed to the aforementioned aggressive competitive environment.
TruBridge revenues increased 13%, or $3.0 million, compared to the second quarter 2017.
Our hospital clients operate in an environment typified by rising costs and increased complexity and are increasingly seeking to alleviate themselves of the ever-increasing administrative burden of operating their own business office functions, most notably resulting in an expanded customer base for our accounts receivable management services, increasing $2.4 million, or 38%, and our medical coding services, increasing $1.1 million, or 89%, compared to the second quarter 2017.
These increases were partially offset by a $0.6 million, or 52%, decrease in consulting services as consulting opportunities related to Thrive software add-on sales have decreased and medical coding initiatives have been completed.
Costs of Sales.
Total costs of sales increased by 4%, or $1.4 million, compared to the second quarter 2017.
As a percentage of total revenues, costs of sales increased to 49% in the second quarter 2018, compared to 47% in the second quarter 2017.
Costs of Acute Care EHR system sales and support increased by $0.2 million, or 1%, compared to the second quarter 2017 primarily due to a $1.0 million, or 41%, increase in third-party software costs, primarily due to fees implemented for use of CPT codes by the American Medical Association ("AMA") during 2018 that are passed to the customer.
This increase was partially offset by a $0.6 million, or 34%, decrease in travel costs due to improved implementation techniques and decreased equipment costs (which are minimal for MU3 implementations) of $0.1 million, or 11%.
The dual effect of decreased revenues and increased third-party software costs resulted in the gross margin on Acute Care EHR system sales and support decreasing to 52% in the second quarter 2018, compared to 55% in the second quarter 2017.
Costs of Post-acute Care EHR system sales and support decreased by $0.5 million, or 23%, compared to the second quarter 2017, primarily due to reduced payroll costs of $0.2 million, or 19%, as the realization of HHI integration synergies over the trailing twelve months has resulted in reduced headcount.
Third-party software costs, hardware costs, and travel costs decreased by a total of $0.3 million due to the decreased installation volume mentioned above.
The gross margin on Post-acute Care EHR system sales and support increased to 72% in the second quarter 2018, compared to 67% in the second quarter 2017.
Our costs associated with TruBridge sales and support increased 13%, or $1.6 million, with the largest contributing factor being an increase in payroll and related costs of 29%, or $2.1 million, as a result of adding more employees during the trailing twelve months in order to support and develop our growing customer base.
Increased payroll was partially offset by an approximate $0.6 million decrease in cloud hosting costs as a result of moving to in-house resources during the fourth quarter of 2017 for cloud services provided to the HHI customer base.
The gross margin on these services was 46% in the second quarters of 2018 and 2017.
Product Development.
Product development expenses consist primarily of compensation and other employee-related costs (including stock-based compensation) and infrastructure costs incurred, but not capitalized, for new product development and product enhancements.
Product development costs increased 11%, or $0.9 million, compared to the second quarter 2017, as a result of increased headcount dedicated to functionality additions and enhancements across the product lines, as well as integration across product lines.
Sales and Marketing.
Sales and marketing expenses decreased 1%, or $0.1 million, compared to the second quarter 2017, primarily due to decreased payroll costs of 10%, or $0.3 million, partially offset by increased TruBridge-specific and MU3 commissions expense compared to the second quarter 2017.
General and Administrative.
General and administrative expenses increased 2%, or $0.3 million, compared to the second quarter 2017, primarily due to a $0.8 million increase in bad debt expense, a $0.6 million, or 17%, increase in employee health costs, and a $0.4 million increase in stock compensation expense during the second quarter 2018.
Bad debt was negatively impacted by a few of our hospital clients that have not been or may not be able to fulfill their financial obligations, while increased prescription drug utilization drove employee health costs higher.
These increases were partially offset by a $1.5 million decrease in voluntary severance program expense compared to the second quarter 2017.
Amortization of Acquisition-Related Intangibles.
Amortization expense associated with acquisition-related intangible assets was unchanged compared to the second quarter 2017.
Total Operating Expenses.
As a percentage of total revenues, total operating expenses increased to 48% in the second quarter 2018, compared to 47% in the second quarter 2017.
Total Other Income (Expense).
Total other income (expense) decreased from expense of $1.9 million during the second quarter 2017 to expense of $1.6 million during the second quarter 2018, as our long-term debt interest rate was reduced when our leverage ratio fell below the target ratio coupled with an increase in interest income due to the expansion of long-term payment plans offered to our clients.
Income Before Taxes.
As a result of the foregoing factors, income before taxes decreased by 76%, or $2.0 million, compared to the second quarter 2017.
Provision for Income Taxes.
Our effective tax rate for the three months ended June 30, 2018 increased to 46% from 38% for the three months ended June 30, 2017.
Our effective tax rate for the three months ended June 30, 2018 was heavily impacted by the year-to-date impact of changing state income allocation determinations among our various subsidiaries from entities with lower effective state rates to entities with higher effective state rates.
The year-to-date adjustment, when recorded in a three-month period of significantly lower net income before taxes compared to the immediately preceding period, had an outsized impact on our effective tax rate, resulting in a 25% increase in the effective tax rate.
This increase was partially offset by the tax benefits of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, which reduced our corporate federal rate from 35% to 21% effective at the beginning of 2018.
Net Income.
Net income for the three months ended June 30, 2018 decreased by $1.3 million to $0.3 million, or $0.02 per basic and diluted share, compared with net income of $1.6 million, or $0.11 per basic and diluted share, for the three months ended June 30, 2017.
Net income represented less than 1% of revenue for the three months ended June 30, 2018, compared to 2% of revenue for the three months ended June 30, 2017.
Six Months Ended June 30, 2018 Compared with Six Months Ended June 30, 2017 

Revenues.
Total revenues for the six months ended June 30, 2018 increased 5%, or $7.0 million, compared to the six months ended June 30, 2017.
Non-recurring system sales and support revenues increased $0.4 million, or 2%, primarily as year-to-date revenue contributions from MU3 implementations have outpaced the negative impact of new system implementation volatility and relative weakness in non-MU3 related add-on sales, resulting in an overall increase in Acute Care EHR non-recurring revenues of $0.9 million, or 5%.
MU3 implementations contributed $7.9 million of Acute Care EHR non-recurring revenue during the first six months of 2018, compared to only $0.2 million during the first six months of 2017.
These revenue contributions were partially offset by a $4.1 million, or 44%, decrease in new system implementation revenues, as we installed our Acute Care EHR solutions at nine new hospital clients during the six months ended June 30, 2018 (two under a SaaS arrangement), compared to thirteen new hospital clients during the six months ended June 30, 2017 (two under a SaaS arrangement).
Further mitigating the significant impact of MU3 implementation revenues has been the relative weakness in non-MU3 related add-on sales as a result of the Company's and clients' emphasis on MU3 certification prior to the October 1, 2019 deadline.
Non-recurring Post-acute Care EHR revenues decreased by $0.6 million, or 26%, as a result of slowing new installation bookings due to aggressive competition during our effort to make technological improvements to the AHT product line.
Recurring system sales and support revenues decreased $0.8 million, or 1%, during the six months ended June 30, 2018.
Acute Care EHR recurring revenues decreased slightly by $0.1 million as a result of 2017 price freezes for the existing customer base to ease the impact of MU3 implementation, coupled with attrition primarily from the Healthland customer base, outweighing new customer growth.
Post-acute Care EHR recurring revenues decreased by $0.7 million, or 7%, due to attrition attributed to the aforementioned aggressive competitive environment.
TruBridge revenues increased 17%, or $7.4 million, compared to the six months ended June 30, 2017.
Our hospital clients operate in an environment typified by rising costs and increased complexity and are increasingly seeking to alleviate themselves of the ever-increasing administrative burden of operating their own business office functions, most notably resulting in an expanded customer base for our accounts receivable management services, increasing $5.2 million, or 42%, and our medical coding services, increasing $2.6 million, or 120%, compared to the six months ended June 30, 2017.
These increases were partially offset by a $0.7 million, or 35%, decrease in consulting services as consulting opportunities related to Thrive software add-on sales have decreased and medical coding initiatives have been completed.
Costs of Sales.
Total costs of sales increased by 3%, or $1.8 million, compared to the six months ended June 30, 2017.
As a percentage of total revenues, costs of sales decreased to 47% in the six months ended June 30, 2018, compared to 48% in the six months ended June 30, 2017.
Costs of Acute Care EHR system sales and support decreased by $0.8 million, or 2%, compared to the six months ended June 30, 2017, primarily due to a $1.0 million, or 36%, decrease in equipment costs (which are minimal for MU3 implementations), and decreased travel costs of $1.0 million, or 30%, due to improved implementation techniques, partially offset by a $1.3 million, or 25%, increase in third-party software costs, primarily due to fees for use of CPT codes implemented by the AMA during 2018 that are passed to the customer.
The dual effect of increased revenues and these beneficial cost improvements resulted in the gross margin on Acute Care EHR system sales and support increasing to 55% in the six months ended June 30, 2018 compared to 54% in the six months ended June 30, 2017.
Costs of Post-acute Care EHR system sales and support decreased by $0.8 million, or 20%, compared to the six months ended June 30, 2017 primarily due to reduced payroll costs of $0.4 million, or 18%, as the realization of HHI integration synergies over the trailing twelve months has resulted in reduced headcount.
Third-party software costs, hardware costs, and travel costs decreased by a total of $0.5 million due to the decreased installation volume mentioned above.
The gross margin on Post-acute Care EHR system sales and support increased to 71% for the six months ended June 30, 2018, compared to 67% for the six months ended June 30, 2017.
Our costs associated with TruBridge sales and support increased 14%, or $3.4 million, with the largest contributing factor being an increase in payroll and related costs of 29%, or $4.3 million, as a result of adding more employees during the trailing twelve months in order to support and develop our growing customer base.
Increased payroll was partially offset by an approximate $1.2 million decrease in cloud hosting costs as a result of moving to in-house resources during the fourth quarter of 2017 for cloud services provided to the HHI customer base.
The gross margin on these services increased to 46% in the six months ended June 30, 2018 compared to 45% in the six months ended June 30, 2017, primarily attributed to the realization of 2017 bookings to revenue in which the aforementioned accompanying payroll costs constricted margins during 2017.
Product Development.
Product development expenses consist primarily of compensation and other employee-related costs (including stock-based compensation) and infrastructure costs incurred, but not capitalized, for new product development and product enhancements.
Product development costs increased 10%, or $1.6 million, compared to the six months ended June 30, 2017, as a result of increased headcount dedicated to functionality additions and enhancements across the product lines, as well as integration across product lines.
Sales and Marketing.
Sales and marketing expenses increased 3%, or $0.5 million, compared to the six months ended June 30, 2017, primarily due to increased TruBridge-specific and MU3 commissions expense.
General and Administrative.
General and administrative expenses increased 4%, or $1.0 million, compared to the six months ended June 30, 2017, primarily due to a $1.2 million increase in bad debt expense and a $1.3 million, or 20%, increase in employee health costs during the six months ended June 30, 2018.
Bad debt was negatively impacted by a few of our hospital clients that have not been or may not be able to fulfill their financial obligations, while increased prescription drug utilization drove employee health costs higher.
These notable increases were partially offset by a $1.9 million decrease in voluntary severance program expense compared to the six months ended June 30, 2017.
Amortization of Acquisition-Related Intangibles.
Amortization expense associated with acquisition-related intangible assets was unchanged compared to the six months ended June 30, 2017.
Total Operating Expenses.
As a percentage of total revenues, total operating expenses remained flat at 46% for both six month periods.
Total Other Income (Expense).
Total other income (expense) decreased from expense of $3.6 million during the six months ended June 30, 2017 to expense of $3.4 million during the six months ended June 30, 2018, as interest income has increased due to the expansion of long-term payment plans offered to our clients.
Income Before Taxes.
As a result of the foregoing factors, income before taxes increased by 59%, or $2.4 million, compared to the six months ended June 30, 2017.
Provision for Income Taxes.
Our effective tax rate for the six months ended June 30, 2018 decreased to 34% from 55% for the six months ended June 30, 2017.
Our effective tax rate for the six months ended June 30, 2018 was impacted by the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, which reduced our corporate federal rate from 35% to 21% effective at the beginning of 2018.
The six months ended June 30, 2018 also included a $0.4 million shortfall tax expense related to stock-based compensation that 

increased the effective rate by 6%.
During the six months ended June 30, 2017 we experienced a shortfall tax expense related to stock-based compensation of $0.9 million that increased the effective rate by 23%.
Net Income.
Net income for the six months ended June 30, 2018 increased by $2.5 million to a net income of $4.3 million, or $0.31 per basic and diluted share, compared with net income of $1.8 million, or $0.13 per basic and diluted share, for the six months ended June 30, 2017.
Net income represented 3% of revenue for the six months ended June 30, 2018, compared to 1% of revenue for the six months ended June 30, 2017.
Liquidity and Capital Resources

Sources of Liquidity

As of June 30, 2018, our principal sources of liquidity consisted of cash and cash equivalents of $1.5 million and our remaining borrowing capacity under the Amended Revolving Credit Facility of $15.3 million, compared to $0.5 million of cash and cash equivalents and $17.0 million of remaining borrowing capacity under the Amended Revolving Credit Facility as of December 31, 2017.
In conjunction with our acquisition of HHI in January 2016, we entered into the Previous Credit Agreement which provided for the $125 million Previous Term Loan Facility and the $50 million Previous Revolving Credit Facility.
On October 13, 2017, the Company entered into the Second Amendment to refinance and decrease the aggregate committed size of the credit facilities from $175 million to $162 million, which included the $117 million Amended Term Loan Facility and the $45 million Amended Revolving Credit Facility.
On February 8, 2018, the Company entered into the Third Amendment to increase the aggregate principle amount of the Amended Credit Facilities from $162 million to $167 million, which includes the $117 million Amended Term Loan Facility and a $50 million Amended Revolving Credit Facility.
As of June 30, 2018, we had $140.1 million in principal amount of indebtedness outstanding under the Amended Credit Facilities.
We believe that our cash and cash equivalents of $1.5 million as of June 30, 2018, the future operating cash flows of the combined entity, and our remaining borrowing capacity under the Amended Revolving Credit Facility of $15.3 million as of June 30, 2018, taken together, provide adequate resources to fund ongoing cash requirements for the next twelve months.
We cannot provide assurance that our actual cash requirements will not be greater than we expect as of the date of filing of this Form 10-Q.
If sources of liquidity are not available or if we cannot generate sufficient cash flow from operations during the next twelve months, we may be required to obtain additional sources of funds through additional operational improvements, capital market transactions, asset sales or financing from third parties, a combination thereof or otherwise.
We cannot provide assurance that these additional sources of funds will be available or, if available, would have reasonable terms.
Operating Cash Flow Activities

Net cash provided by operating activities decreased $8.1 million, from $15.9 million provided by operations for the six months ended June 30, 2017 to $7.8 million provided by operations for the six months ended June 30, 2018.
The decrease in cash flows provided from operations is primarily due to a $6.3 million contraction in payables and other liabilities during the six months ended June 30, 2018 as a result of the timing of vendor and payroll payments compared to a $6.6 million expansion during the six months ended June 30, 2017.
The $2.5 million increase in net income was mostly offset by a combined accounts and financing receivables expansion of $6.1 million during the six months ended June 30, 2018.
The increase in financing arrangements is primarily due to two reasons.
First, meaningful use stage three installations are primarily financed through short-term payment plans.
Second, competitor financing options, primarily accounts receivables management collections and cloud EHR arrangements, have applied pressure to reduce initial customer capital investment requirements for new EHR installations, leading to the offering of long-term lease options.
Investing Cash Flow Activities

Net cash used in investing activities remained relatively flat with $0.4 million used in the six months ended June 30, 2018 compared to $0.5 million used during the six months ended June 30, 2017.
We do not anticipate the need for significant capital expenditures during the remainder of 2018. 

Financing Cash Flow Activities

During the six months ended June 30, 2018, our financing activities used net cash of $6.4 million, as we paid a net $3.6 million in long-term debt principal and declared and paid dividends in the amount of $2.8 million.
During the six months ended June 30, 2018, we made a $7.3 million prepayment on the Amended Term Loan Facility by drawing down on the Amended Revolving Credit Facility, in accordance with the excess cash flow mandatory prepayment requirements of the Amended Credit Agreement.
Financing cash flow activities used $15.9 million during the six months ended June 30, 2017, primarily due to $9.8 million paid in long-term debt principal and $6.1 million cash paid in dividends.
The decrease in dividends paid is a result of moving to a fixed dividend policy during the fourth quarter of 2017.
We believe that paying dividends is an effective way of providing an investment return to our stockholders and a beneficial use of our cash.
However, the declaration of dividends by CPSI is subject to compliance with the terms of our Amended Credit Agreement and the discretion of our Board of Directors, which may decide to change or terminate the Company's dividend policy at any time.
Our Board of Directors will continue to take into account such matters as general business conditions, capital needs, our financial results and such other factors as our Board of Directors may deem relevant.
Credit Agreement

As of June 30, 2018, we had $105.4 million in principal amount outstanding under the Amended Term Loan Facility and $34.7 million in principal amount outstanding under the Amended Revolving Credit Facility.
Each of the Amended Credit Facilities continues to bear interest at a rate per annum equal to an applicable margin plus, at our option, either (1) the Adjusted LIBOR rate for the relevant interest period, (2) an alternate base rate determined by reference to the greater of (a) the prime lending rate of Regions, (b) the federal funds rate for the relevant interest period plus one half of one percent per annum and (c) the one month LIBOR rate plus one percent per annum, or (3) a combination of (1) and (2).
The applicable margin range for LIBOR loans and the letter of credit fee ranges from 2.00% to 3.50%.
The applicable margin range for base rate loans ranges from 1.00% to 2.50%, in each case based on the Company's consolidated leverage ratio.
Principal payments with respect to the Amended Term Loan Facility are due on the last day of each fiscal quarter beginning December 31, 2017, with quarterly principal payments of approximately $1.46 million through September 30, 2019, approximately $2.19 million through September 30, 2021 and approximately $2.93 million through September 30.
2022, with the maturity on October 13, 2022 or such earlier date as the obligations under the Amended Credit Agreement become due and payable pursuant to the terms of the Amended Credit Agreement (the "Amended Maturity Date").
Any principal outstanding under the Amended Revolving Credit Facility is due and payable on the Amended Maturity Date.
The Amended Credit Facilities are secured pursuant to a Pledge and Security Agreement, dated January 8, 2016, among the parties identified as obligors therein and Regions, as collateral agent, on a first priority basis by a security interest in substantially all of the tangible and intangible assets (subject to certain exceptions) of the Company and certain subsidiaries of the Company, as guarantors (collectively, the “Subsidiary Guarantors”), including certain registered intellectual property and the capital stock of certain of the Company’s direct and indirect subsidiaries.
Our obligations under the Amended Credit Agreement are also guaranteed by the Subsidiary Guarantors.
The Amended Credit Agreement requires the Company to mandatorily prepay the Amended Credit Facilities with (i) 75% of excess cash flow (minus certain specified other payments) during each of the fiscal years ending December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2018 and (ii) 50% of excess cash flow (minus certain specified other payments) during the fiscal year ending December 31, 2019 and thereafter.
The Company is permitted to voluntarily prepay the Amended Credit Facilities at any time without penalty, subject to customary “breakage” costs with respect to prepayments of LIBOR rate loans made on a day other than the last day of any applicable interest period.
The excess cash flow mandatory prepayment requirement under the Amended Credit Agreement resulted in a $7.3 million prepayment on the Amended Term Loan Facility during the first quarter of 2018 related to excess cash flow generated by the Company during 2017.
This mandatory prepayment was funded by drawing down on the Amended Revolving Credit Facility, as excess cash flow generated by the Company during 2017 was primarily used to voluntarily prepay amounts due under the Amended Revolving Credit Facility.
Backlog

Backlog consists of revenues we reasonably expect to recognize over the next twelve months under all existing contracts, including those with remaining performance obligations that have original expected durations of one year or less and those with fees that are variable in which we estimate future revenues.
The revenues to be recognized may relate to a combination of one-time fees for system sales and recurring fees for support and maintenance and TruBridge services.
As of June 30, 2018, we had a twelve-month backlog of approximately $38 million in connection with non-recurring system purchases and approximately $229 million in connection with recurring payments under support and maintenance, Cloud EHR contracts, and TruBridge services.
As of June 30, 2017, we had a twelve-month backlog of approximately $37 million in connection with non-recurring system purchases and approximately $217 million in connection with recurring payments under support and maintenance and TruBridge services.
Bookings



 Acute Care EHR bookings in the second quarter 2018 decreased $7.8 million, or 33%, compared to the second quarter 2017, and in the six months ended June 30, 2018 decreased $5.3 million, or 14%, compared to the six months ended June 30, 2017, mostly due to the demand dynamics related to the Company's MU3 software applications.
Bookings during the three and six months ended June 30, 2017 were heavily influenced by the then-deadline of January 1, 2018 for hospital compliance with the stage three rules.
Since that time, CMS has announced two rules (the most recent of which was proposed in April 2018) that would effectively delay the deadline for compliance to October 1, 2019.
While we do not believe these events significantly alter the total opportunity presented by MU3, it has impacted our periodic bookings results by naturally extending the sales cycle.
Post-acute Care EHR bookings in the second quarter 2018 decreased $0.1 million, or 6%, compared to the second quarter 2017, and decreased $1.3 million, or 41%, compared to the six months ended June 30, 2017.
New business opportunities for this segment, which consist solely of the operations of AHT, have suffered as a result of increased competition and underinvestment in AHT's product offerings (particularly prior to our acquisition of AHT as part of the January 2016 acquisition of HHI), making functionality and usability comparisons less favorable for AHT.
Although management has formulated a strategy and enacted steps to improve the related product functionality and usability and is confident that such measures will translate into improved future bookings performance (and, eventually, revenue growth), there can be no guarantee that this strategy will be successful.
During the fourth quarter of 2017, the anticipated attrition of significant customer accounts and a product development acceleration investment plan in our Post-acute Care EHR software led management to record a goodwill impairment of $28.0 million against our Post-acute Care EHR reporting unit as of December 31, 2017.
We continue to execute on our TruBridge strategy by moving up-market into larger healthcare facilities while expanding the scope of our relationships with new and existing clients by increasing revenue-generating touchpoints within those facilities.
Our initial success in that endeavor has resulted in bookings volatility as our periodic bookings are heavily influenced by low-volume, high-value deals.
Such large, enterprise client wins resulted in TruBridge bookings for the first two quarters of 2017 that were some of the highest in TruBridge history at that time, with bookings for the remainder of 2017 being heavily influenced by large, enterprise client wins.
Absent any such large, enterprise client wins during the first two quarters of 2018, TruBridge bookings experienced a normalization that resulted in a decrease from the first two quarters of 2017.
We continue to see demand for TruBridge's products and services that alleviate administrative burden on our clients and allow them to take 

advantage of our specialized capabilities.
Particularly strong demand exists for TruBridge's accounts receivable management and medical coding services.
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements

We had no off-balance sheet arrangements, as defined by Item 303(a)(4) of SEC Regulation S-K, as of June 30, 2018.
The Company has other lease rights and obligations that it accounts for as operating leases that may be reclassified as balance sheet arrangements under accounting pronouncements recently finalized by the FASB.
Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates

Our Management Discussion and Analysis is based upon our condensed consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP.
The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make subjective or complex judgments that may affect the reported financial condition and results of operations.
We base our estimates on historical experience and other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the reported values of assets, liabilities, revenues, expenses and other financial amounts that are not readily apparent from other sources.
Actual results may differ from these estimates and these estimates may differ under different assumptions or conditions.
We continually evaluate the information used to make these estimates as our business and the economic environment changes.
In our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2017, we identified our critical accounting polices related to revenue recognition, allowance for doubtful accounts, allowance for credit losses, and estimates.
During the first quarter of 2018, we adopted the new accounting standard codified as Accounting Standards Codification ("ASC") 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, and all related amendments and have applied it to all contracts using the modified retrospective method, pursuant to which the cumulative effect of initially applying the new revenue standard is recognized as an adjustment to retained earnings and impacted balance sheet line items as of January 1, 2018, the date of adoption.
Refer to Note 2 - Recent Accounting Pronouncements of the Notes to Financial Statements (Part 1, Item 1 of this Form 10-Q) for further discussion.
There have been no other significant changes to these critical accounting policies during the six months ended June 30, 2018.
Item 2.Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds.
Not Applicable.
