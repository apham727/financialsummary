Disclosure controls and procedures: As of the end of the period covered by this report, the Company carried out an evaluation, with the participation of the Company's management, including the Company's Chief Executive Officer and Vice President of Finance, of the effectiveness of the Company's disclosure controls and procedures pursuant to Securities Exchange Act Rule 13a-15. Based on that evaluation, the Company's Chief Executive Officer and Vice President of Finance concluded that the Company's disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of the end of the period covered by this report. 



Changes in internal controls over financial reporting: Effective January 1, 2018, the Company implemented ASC 606 Revenue from Contracts with Customers. As a result, the Company's processes related to revenue recognition and the internal control activities within them were revised to comply with the new revenue recognition standard. This included the development of an internal accounting policy based on the five-step model provided in the new revenue standard, training, ongoing contract review requirements and the gathering of information for disclosure purposes. The new revenue standard is expected to have an immaterial impact on the Company's ongoing operating results.
