 1.Overview of Business and Basis of Presentation  



References herein to “CCUR Holdings,” the “Company,” “we,” “us,” or “our” refer to CCUR Holdings, Inc. and its subsidiaries unless the context specifically indicates otherwise. CCUR Holdings was formerly known as Concurrent Computer Corporation and changed its name on January 2, 2018. 



In May 2017, we sold our Real-Time business consisting of real-time Linux operating system versions, development and performance optimization tools, simulation software and other system software combined, in many cases, with computer platforms and services. These real-time products were sold to a wide variety of companies seeking high performance, real-time computer solutions in the defense, aerospace, financial and automotive markets around the world. 



On December 31, 2017, we completed the sale of our content delivery and storage business (the “Content Delivery business”) and other related assets to Vecima Networks, Inc. (“Vecima”) pursuant to an Asset Purchase Agreement, dated as of October 13, 2017, between the Company and Vecima. Substantially all liabilities associated with the Content Delivery business were assigned to Vecima as part of the transaction. The Content Delivery business provided advanced applications focused on storing, protecting, transforming, and delivering high value media. 



Results of the Content Delivery business are retrospectively reported as discontinued operations in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for all periods presented. Prior year information has been adjusted to conform to the current year presentation. Unless otherwise stated, the information disclosed in the footnotes accompanying the consolidated financial statements refers to continuing operations. See Note 3 “Discontinued Operations” for more information regarding results from discontinued operations. 



In fiscal year 2018, following the sale of the Content Delivery business, we began developing a real estate operation initially through, among other things, making a number of commercial loans secured by real property. Based on the success of these activities, including the yield characteristics of these loans, and management’s experience in the real estate area, we created Recur Holdings LLC, a Delaware limited liability company wholly owned by the Company, during the first quarter of our fiscal year 2019. Through Recur Holdings LLC, we conduct, hold and manage our existing and future real estate operations. 



The accompanying unaudited consolidated financial statements included herein have been prepared by the Company pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”). Certain information and footnote disclosures normally included in consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America (“U.S. GAAP”) have been omitted pursuant to applicable rules and regulations. In the opinion of management, all adjustments of a normal recurring nature which were considered necessary for a fair presentation have been included. The year-end consolidated balance sheet data as of June 30, 2018 was derived from our audited consolidated financial statements and may not include all disclosures required by U.S. GAAP. Certain prior period income amounts have been reclassified to conform with current period presentation. The results of operations for the three months and six months ended December 31, 2018 are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for the entire year. These consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2018 filed with the SEC on September 7, 2018. 



Smaller Reporting Company 



We meet the SEC’s definition of a “Smaller Reporting Company,” and therefore qualify for the SEC’s reduced disclosure requirements for smaller reporting companies.

Use of Estimates 



The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. 



Investments in Debt and Equity Securities 



We determine the appropriate classification of investments in debt securities at the time of purchase and reevaluate such determinations at each balance sheet date. Debt securities are classified as held-to-maturity when the Company has the positive intent and ability to hold the securities to maturity. Held-to-maturity securities are recorded as either short term or long term in the consolidated balance sheet based on contractual maturity date and are stated at amortized cost. Marketable securities that are bought and held principally for the purpose of selling them in the near term are classified as trading securities and are reported at fair value, with unrealized gains and losses recognized in earnings. Debt securities not classified as held-to-maturity or as trading are classified as available-for-sale, and are carried at fair market value, with the unrealized gains and losses, net of tax, included in the determination of comprehensive income and reported in stockholders’ equity. 



We adopted Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) No. 2016-01, Financial Instruments-Overall: Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities (“ASU 2016-01”), as amended by ASU No. 2018-03, Financial Instruments-Overall: Technical Corrections and Improvements, on July 1, 2018 (see Note 2). Upon adoption of ASU 2016-01 on July 1, 2018, we are no longer required to determine the classification of our equity securities and there will no longer be a requirement to assess equity securities for impairment since such securities will be measured at fair value through net income. 



Premiums and discounts on fixed maturity securities are amortized using the effective interest method. Prepayment assumptions are reviewed periodically and adjusted to reflect actual prepayments and changes in expectations. Dividends on equity securities are recognized when declared. When the Company sells a security, the difference between the sale proceeds and amortized cost (determined based on specific identification) is reported as a realized investment gain or loss. When a decline in the value of a specific investment is considered to be other-than-temporary at the balance sheet date, a provision for impairment is charged to earnings (included in realized gains (losses) on investments) and the cost basis of that investment is reduced. If the Company can assert that it does not intend to sell an impaired fixed maturity security and it is not more likely than not that it will have to sell the security before recovery of its amortized cost basis, then the other-than-temporary impairment is separated into two components: (i) the amount related to credit losses (recorded in earnings) and (ii) the amount related to all other factors (recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income, or “AOCI”). The credit-related portion of an “other-than-temporary” impairment is measured by comparing a security’s amortized cost to the present value of its current expected cash flows discounted at its effective yield prior to the impairment charge. If the Company intends to sell an impaired security, or it is more likely than not that it will be required to sell the security before recovery, an impairment charge to earnings is recorded to reduce the amortized cost of that security to fair value. 



In some cases, our debt investments may provide for a portion of the interest payable to be payment-in-kind (“PIK”) interest. To the extent interest is PIK, it is payable through the increase of the principal amount of the loan by the amount of the interest due on the then-outstanding principal amount of the loan.

Commercial and Mortgage Loans and Loan Losses 



We have potential exposure to transaction losses as a result of uncollectibility of commercial mortgage and other loans. We base our reserve estimates on prior chargeback history and currently available information that is indicative of a transaction loss. We reflect additions to the reserve in current operating results, while we make charges to the reserve when we incur losses. We reflect recoveries in the reserve for transaction losses as collected. We have the intent and ability to hold our commercial loans to maturity and have not recorded provisions for loan losses as of December 31, 2018. 



We have the intent and ability to hold these loans to maturity or payoff and as such, have classified these loans as held-for-investment. These loans are reported on the balance sheet at the outstanding principal balance adjusted for any charge-offs, allowance for loan losses, and deferred fees or costs. As of December 31, 2018, we have not recorded any charge-offs, and believe that an allowance for loan losses is not required. 



Advances Receivable 



Merchant Cash Advances, net 



In December 2018, we began purchasing participation interests in Merchant Cash Advances (“MCAs”) from a third party whose principal activity is originating MCAs to small businesses. MCAs are contracts formed through a future receivables or receipts purchase and sale agreement, which stipulates the purchase price, or the amount advanced, and the specified amount, or the advance amount plus the factored receivable balance the Company will be repaid, on the face of the contract. Generally, a specified amount will be withdrawn from the merchant’s bank account via daily or weekly ACH in order to pay down the merchant’s advance. These are not consumer loan contracts, nor are they installment loan contracts to businesses for business use only. In addition, there is no monthly minimum payment, nor is there a specific repayment schedule. 



Other Advances Receivable 



During the six months ended December 31, 2018, we provided a $2,000 cash advance to an aviation business to fund the deposit required for the recipient’s aircraft purchases for up to six months, in exchange for paying us an upfront fee and a guaranty of the full repayment obligation from the principal of the third-party business. The fee is earned over the six-month advance period and is reported as part of merchant cash advance income within the statement of operations. Each quarter, we review the carrying value of this cash advance, and determine if an impairment reserve is necessary. As of December 31, 2018, our advance receivable was not impaired. 



Allowance for MCA credit losses 



The allowance for credit losses for MCAs is established at the time of funding through a provision for losses charged to our statement of operations based on historical performance experienced by an industry peer group. Losses are charged against the allowance when management believes that the future collection in full of purchased receivables is unlikely. Subsequent recoveries, if any, are credited to the allowance. 



The establishment of appropriate reserves is an inherently uncertain process, and ultimate losses may vary from the current estimates. We regularly update our reserve estimates as new facts become known and events occur that may affect the settlement or recovery of losses. For the six months ended December 31, 2018, we have experienced no losses on advances; however, new facts and circumstances may adversely affect our MCA portfolio resulting in increased delinquencies and losses and could require additional provisions for credit losses, which could impact future periods. Based on industry peer group historical performance, we recorded a $495 loss reserve during the current period.

Revenue Recognition 



We generate revenue primarily from interest earned on commercial mortgage and other loans that yield interest, and also from fees earned on MCAs. Loan origination fees are deferred and recognized over the expected term of the loan. The revenue generated from MCAs is primarily factor income. The factor income represents the amount of the purchased receivables in excess of the funded contract amount advanced to the merchant in accordance with the merchant agreement net of amounts related to participations. Factor income on merchant advance receivables is earned and recognized ratably as receivables are collected, at factor rates stipulated in the client funding agreement from the date of purchase through the date the receivables are collected or ceases accruing factor revenue when the receivable is identified as uncollectible. 



Basic and Diluted (Loss) Earnings per Share 



Basic (loss) earnings per share is computed by dividing (loss) income by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during each year. Diluted (loss) earnings per share is computed by dividing (loss) income by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding including dilutive common share equivalents. Under the treasury stock method, incremental shares representing the number of additional common shares that would have been outstanding if the dilutive potential common shares had been issued are included in the computation. Due to the loss from continuing operations for both periods presented, weighted average common share equivalents of 10,937 and 315,771 for the three months ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively, and weighted average common share equivalents of 13,420 and 322,570 for the six months ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively, were excluded from the calculation as their effect would have been anti-dilutive. 



Fair Value Measurements 



Fair value is defined as the price that would be received from selling an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly fashion between market participants at the measurement date. When determining the fair value measurements for assets and liabilities required or permitted to be either recorded or disclosed at fair value, we consider the most advantageous market in which it would transact and assumptions that market participants would use when pricing the asset or liability. 



ASC Topic 820, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures requires certain disclosures around fair value and establishes a fair value hierarchy for valuation inputs. The hierarchy prioritizes the inputs into three levels based on the extent to which inputs used in measuring fair value are observable in the market. Each fair value measurement is reported in one of the three levels which are determined by the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety. These levels are: 



 ·Level 1 Quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities; 



 ·Level 2 Inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are either directly or indirectly observable; and 



 ·Level 3 Assets or liabilities for which fair value is based on valuation models with significant unobservable pricing inputs and which include the use of management estimates.

(Amounts in thousands, except share and per share data) 



Our investment portfolio consists of money market funds, repurchase agreements (“repos”), domestic and international commercial paper, equity securities and corporate debt. All highly liquid investments with an original maturity of three months or less when purchased are considered to be cash equivalents. All cash equivalents are carried at cost less any unamortized premium or discount, which approximates fair value. All investments with original maturities of more than three months are classified as available-for-sale, trading or held-to-maturity investments. Our marketable securities, other than warrants and equity securities, are classified as available-for-sale and are reported at fair value with unrealized gains and losses, net of tax, reported in stockholders’ equity as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income or loss. Interest on securities is recorded in interest income. Dividends paid by securities are recorded in dividend income. Any realized gains or losses are reported in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations. Equity securities are reported at fair value with unrealized gains and losses resulting from adjustments to fair value reported within our consolidated statements of operations. We provide fair value measurement disclosures of our securities in accordance with one of the three levels of fair value measurement. We have no financial assets that are measured on a recurring basis that fall within Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy. Our financial assets that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis as of December 31, 2018 and June 30, 2018 are as follows:

 2.Recent Accounting Guidance  



Recently Issued and Adopted Accounting Guidance 



In January 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (the “FASB”) issued ASU No. 2016-01, Financial Instruments-Overall: Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities, as amended by ASU No. 2018-03, Financial Instruments-Overall: Technical Corrections and Improvements, issued in February 2018 on the recognition and measurement of financial instruments. The new guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within those fiscal years. The new guidance changes the current accounting guidance related to (i) the classification and measurement of certain equity investments, (ii) the presentation of changes in the fair value of financial liabilities measured under the fair value option that are due to instrument-specific credit risk, and (iii) certain disclosures associated with the fair value of financial instruments. Additionally, there is no longer a requirement to assess equity securities for impairment since such securities are now measured at fair value through net income. We utilized a modified retrospective approach to adopt the new guidance effective July 1, 2018. The impact related to the change in accounting for equity securities for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2018 was $318 of net unrealized investment gains, net of income tax, reclassified from AOCI to retained earnings.

Recent Accounting Guidance Not Yet Adopted 



In August 2018, the FASB issued ASU No. 2018-13, “Fair Value Measurement (Topic 820): Disclosure Framework — Changes to the Disclosure Requirements for Fair Value Measurement” (“ASU 2018-13”). ASU No. 2018-13 is part of the disclosure framework project and eliminates certain disclosure requirements for fair value measurements, requires entities to disclose new information, and modifies existing disclosure requirements. The new guidance is effective after December 15, 2019. Early adoption is permitted. We are currently evaluating the impact this change will have on our consolidated financial statements and disclosures. 



 3.Discontinued Operations  



Content Delivery Business 



On December 31, 2017, we completed the sale of the Content Delivery business and other related assets to Vecima pursuant to an Asset Purchase Agreement, dated as of October 13, 2017, between the Company and Vecima for a purchase price of $29,000 (subject to an adjustment for net working capital). The sale included our Content Delivery business assets and related liabilities in the United States, United Kingdom, and Germany, as well as the sale of all equity in our Japanese subsidiary. 



Gross proceeds of $29,812 from the sale were paid to us as follows: (1) $28,362 net cash payment during our fiscal year ended June 30, 2018 (including an $812 adjustment for surplus net working capital transferred to Vecima as defined in the CDN APA) and (2) $1,450 placed in escrow as security for the Company’s indemnification obligations to Vecima under the CDN APA, which amount was to be released to the Company on or around December 31, 2018 (less any portion used to make indemnification payments to Vecima). In January 2019 we received the full $1,450 from escrow. 



Results associated with the Content Delivery business are classified within income from discontinued operations, net of income taxes, in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations. Operating expenses recorded in discontinued operations include costs incurred directly in support of the Content Delivery business.

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 



  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 



Fixed maturity debt securities are classified as “available for sale,” and as such, adjustments to fair value are recorded within other comprehensive income on the consolidated balance sheet as unrealized gains and losses. Upon our adoption of ASU 2016-01, effective July 1, 2018, changes in fair value of equity securities are recorded within the consolidated statement of operations as a net realized gain (loss) on investments. During the three months ended December 31, 2018, we recorded a $1,529 unrealized loss on investments within our consolidated statement of operations as a fair value adjustment to our equity securities investments. During the six months ended December 31, 2018, we recorded a $1,986 unrealized loss on investments within our consolidated statement of operations as a fair value adjustment to our equity securities investments, and we recorded a $201 realized gain on the sale of debt and equity securities, as reported within our consolidated statement of operations.

We also had a $1,400 deposit held by an escrow agent as of June 30, 2018 for a mortgage loan that was consummated subsequent to our June 30, 2018 fiscal year end. 



Additionally, during the second quarter of our fiscal year 2019, we originated a commercial line of credit (“credit facility”) to support the working capital needs of a business (the “borrower”) with eligible borrowings of up to $3,000, based upon the borrower’s eligible accounts receivable. All outstanding credit facility balances are due upon collection of the borrower’s accounts receivable and the credit facility expires on October 29, 2020. The credit facility yields prime plus 5% on the outstanding balance of the credit facility, and a 1.2% fee is charged on the unused portion of the credit facility. The borrower has $721 outstanding as of December 31, 2018 and the credit facility is secured by substantially all of the assets of the borrower. Credit facility activity for the period is as follows:

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 



The components of the (benefit) provision for income taxes are as follows: 



  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 



On December 22, 2017, President Donald J. Trump signed the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (“TCJA”) that instituted fundamental changes to the taxation of U.S. corporations. Among the many changes instituted by TCJA, the following have already impacted or are likely to impact our business in the future: permanent reduction in the U.S. federal statutory tax rate for corporations from 35% to 21%; new restrictions on the deductibility of net operating losses generated in years beginning after December 22, 2017; additional limitations on certain business deductions such as interest expense and entertainment expenses; the creation of new regimes designed to tax the income of controlled foreign corporations (global intangible low-taxed income, or “GILTI”, and a base-erosion anti-abuse tax, or “BEAT”); and a possible new deduction for U.S. corporations on their foreign earnings (foreign-derived intangible income, or “FDII”); and imposing a one-time repatriation tax on deemed repatriated earnings and profits of U.S.-owned foreign subsidiaries (Transition Tax). In conjunction with TCJA, on December 22, 2017, the SEC staff issued Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 118, Income Tax Accounting Implications of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (SAB 118), which provides guidance on accounting for the tax effects of TCJA. SAB 118 allows for recording certain effects of the TCJA as “provisional” during a one-year measurement period, which for the Company ended in the second quarter of fiscal 2019. 



We are continuing to evaluate the impact of TCJA in light of the guidance that the U.S. Treasury and various state taxing authorities are releasing. At this time, we do not believe there will be any material changes to the amounts previously provided for the impact of the TCJA. We concluded our analysis during the second quarter of fiscal 2019. 



 15  



CCUR HOLDINGS, INC. 



NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 



(Amounts in thousands, except share and per share data) 



As a result of the TCJA, we are reassessing our intentions related to our indefinite reinvestment assertion as part of our provisional estimates. Should we decide to no longer indefinitely reinvest such foreign earnings outside the U.S., we would have to adjust the income tax provision in the period such determination is made. We currently have an immaterial amount of cash available for repatriation of less than $35. After the TCJA, there should be no federal income taxes that would be due upon repatriation. Any other impact, such as withholding tax, states taxes, or foreign exchange rate changes, should be immaterial based on the amount of cash held overseas. 



Net Operating Losses 



As of June 30, 2018, we had U.S. federal net operating loss carryforwards (“NOLs”) of approximately $56,113 for income tax purposes, of which none expire in fiscal year 2019, and the remainder expire at various dates through fiscal year 2037. We recently completed an evaluation of the potential effect of Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code (the “IRC”) on our ability to utilize these net operating losses. The study concluded that we have not had an ownership change for the period from July 22, 1993 to June 30, 2018; therefore, the NOLs will not be subject to limitation under Section 382. If we experience an ownership change as defined in Section 382 of the IRC, our ability to use these NOLs will be substantially limited, which could therefore significantly impair the value of that asset. We have taken steps to protect the value of our NOLs with a “Tax Asset Preservation Plan” which is described more fully in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2018. 



As of June 30, 2018, we had state NOLs of $33,240. The state NOLs expire according to the rules of each state and expiration will occur between fiscal year 2019 and fiscal year 2037. 



Deferred Tax Assets and Related Valuation Allowances 



In assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets, we consider whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. In determining whether or not a valuation allowance for tax assets is needed, we evaluate all available evidence, both positive and negative, including: trends in operating income or losses; currently available information about future years; future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences; future taxable income exclusive of reversing temporary differences and carryforwards; taxable income in prior carryback years if carryback is permitted under the tax law; and tax planning strategies that would accelerate taxable amounts to utilize expiring carryforwards, change the character of taxable and deductible amounts from ordinary income or loss to capital gain or loss, or switch from tax-exempt to taxable investments. The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences become deductible. As of December 31, 2018, we maintained a full valuation allowance on our net deferred tax assets in all jurisdictions, with the exception of the $487 alternative minimum tax credit carryforward that is now considered refundable in post-fiscal year 2019 after the enactment of the TCJA. We reclassified $487 of additional alternative minimum tax credit to an income tax receivable account at December 31, 2018 based on our ability to claim a refund of fifty percent of the alternative minimum tax credit with the filing of our fiscal year 2019 return within the next twelve months. We do not have sufficient evidence of future income to conclude that it is more likely than not the Company will realize its entire deferred tax inventory in any of its jurisdictions (United States, Germany, and Australia). Therefore, we have recognized a full valuation allowance on the Company’s deferred tax inventory, other than the alternative minimum tax credit. We reevaluate our conclusions quarterly regarding the valuation allowance and will make appropriate adjustments as necessary in the period in which significant changes occur. 



Research and Development Tax Credits 



During the year ended June 30, 2017, we applied for both a U.S. federal and state of Georgia research and development tax credit in the amounts of $719 and $675, respectively, for our fiscal year ending June 30, 2016. For U.S. federal tax purposes, the credit cannot be utilized immediately but will carryforward for a period of 20 years. As we do not expect to be able to realize the benefit of the U.S. federal tax credit carryforward before its expiration, we maintain a full valuation allowance on this item. For the state of Georgia tax credit, we have recorded the credit within both other current assets and other long-term assets with an offset in both accrued expenses and other long-term liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets as of December 31, 2018 and June 30, 2018, respectively. As future payroll tax withholdings of our Georgia-based employees become due, we are able to offset the withholding amount dollar-for-dollar against the credit. As a result, as the credit is claimed, we will (1) reduce other current assets and offset the payroll tax liability and (2) reduce accrued expenses and recognize a reduction of operating expenses.

 Item 1.Legal Proceedings  



We are not presently involved in any material litigation. However, we are, from time to time, party to various routine legal proceedings arising out of our business. 



 Item 1A.Risk Factors   



There have been no material changes in our risk factors from those included in “Item 1A. Risk Factors” in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2018, except as noted below. 



There can be no assurance that we will complete the acquisition of an 80% interest in LuxeMark, which acquisition currently is under a non-binding letter of intent. If we do not complete this acquisition, we will have expended significant expenses and management resources without our shareholders realizing the potential benefits. 



There can be no assurance that we will complete the acquisition of an 80% interest in LuxeMark as discussed under a non-binding letter of intent under the terms set forth in the letter of intent, or at all, because the letter of intent is not binding on us or on LuxeMark. Our acquisition of such interest is subject to us negotiating and executing with LuxeMark a mutually acceptable definitive and binding purchase agreement with respect to the business, which we expect will contain a number of conditions to closing the acquisition, including (i) our completion of satisfactory due diligence with respect to LuxeMark’s business, and (ii) satisfaction of customary closing conditions and, dependent on the results of due diligence and negotiation of the definitive documents between the parties, may require material modifications to the terms set forth in the letter of intent. There can be no assurance that LuxeMark will be willing to proceed with a transaction, that we will be able to negotiate and execute a satisfactory definitive purchase agreement with LuxeMark, that our due diligence will be satisfactory, or that the conditions to closing will be satisfied. 



If we are unable to complete the acquisition of an 80% interest in LuxeMark, we will have expended significant expenses and management resources related to due diligence, legal and accounting work undertaken for the failed acquisition without our shareholders realizing any of the potential benefits of such acquisition.

We participate in the MCA industry, which presents a number of unique risks. 



In December 2018, we acquired certain advance assets from an MCA originator and funder that is a leader in the MCA sector. An MCA funder provides small businesses with cash advances in return for the purchase of an amount of the small business’s future receipts. This type of transaction is not characterized or structured as a loan. Small businesses typically seek these advances for working capital purposes to finance their purchase of inventory, equipment, or to otherwise address immediate business needs. This business presents a number of unique risks, including the illiquidity of the cash advances; our critical reliance on certain individuals to operate the business; collection and cash advance repayment issues and challenges given that the MCAs are typically unsecured; and sensitivity to general economic conditions. 



Because real estate assets are relatively illiquid, we may not be able to diversify, liquidate, or monetize our real estate portfolio in response to changes in economic and other relevant conditions, which may result in losses. The illiquidity of our real estate portfolio may also result in us seeking financing in order to expand our operations while maintaining sufficient liquid assets to execute our business plan. 



Real estate assets are relatively illiquid. A variety of factors could make it difficult for us to modify our real estate portfolio in response to changing economic or other relevant conditions, thus creating risk of loss associated with those changed conditions. In addition, we may seek to restrict the percentage of our assets that are contained in illiquid real estate assets by seeking financing to continue expansion of our real estate operations while maintaining sufficient liquid assets to execute our business plan and invest in other value producing assets, including acquisition of additional businesses and assets. In addition, reserving a certain percentage of our liquid assets may benefit our financial performance by increasing our ability to modify our operations to respond to adverse economic or other relevant conditions. Any financing that we obtain creates risks normally associated with financing, including the risk that our cash flow is insufficient to make timely payments of interest or principal. 



We may engage in real estate transactions or other strategic opportunities that involve property types or structures with which we have less familiarity, thereby increasing our risk of loss. 



We may decide to participate in real estate transactions and other strategic opportunities in which we have limited or no prior experience. When engaging in such transactions, we may not be successful in our diligence and underwriting efforts. We may also be unsuccessful in preserving value if conditions deteriorate and we may expose ourselves to unknown substantial risks. Furthermore, engaging in unfamiliar transactions may require additional management time and attention relative to transactions with which we are more familiar. All of these factors increase our risk of loss. 



We may continue to grow our business through acquisitions, which entails substantial risk. 



We may continue growing our operating business through one or more acquisitions. Such acquisitions entail substantial risk. During our due diligence of such acquisitions, we may not uncover all relevant liabilities and we may have limited, if any, recourse against the sellers. We may also incur significant transaction and integration costs in connection with such acquisitions. Further, we may not successfully integrate the acquired assets or businesses into our existing business and operations, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial performance. In addition, post-closing expansion of any acquired assets and businesses may subject us to additional costs or make us vulnerable to regulations or rules that were not assessed prior to acquisition. 



We may be limited in the types of acquisitions that we can pursue in order to preserve use of our NOLs. 



We currently have NOLs valued at $56.1 million as of June 30, 2018. We may be able to achieve greater realization of the value of our NOLs with certain business or asset acquisitions. There is no guarantee that we will be able to find or consummate an acquisition that allows for utilization of our NOLs and we may engage in acquisitions that do not facilitate use of the NOLs. In any acquisition we may be limited by our available cash and cash equivalents or ability to obtain financing in order to preserve use of our NOLs. Use of our NOLs can be impaired by certain shift in the ownership of our common stock and thus we are limited in our ability to use stock in an acquisition for NOL preservation purposes. Alternatively, while we have not identified or committed to any such transactions, we may identify acquisitions that we believe will provide value sufficient to forego preservation of the NOLs to participate in the acquisition opportunity.
