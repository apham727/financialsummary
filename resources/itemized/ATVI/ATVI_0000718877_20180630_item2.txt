Monthly Active Users 

We monitor monthly active users (MAUs) as a key measure of the overall size of our user base.
MAUs are the number of individuals who accessed a particular game in a given month.
We calculate average MAUs in a period by adding the total number of MAUs in each of the months in a given period and dividing that total by the number of months in the period.
An individual who accesses two of our games would be counted as two users.
In addition, due to technical limitations, for Activision and King, an individual who accesses the same game on two platforms or devices in the relevant period would be counted as two users.
For Blizzard, an individual who accesses the same game on two platforms or devices in the relevant period would generally be counted as a single user.
Average MAUs decreased by 22 million, or 6%, for the three months ended June 30, 2018, as compared to the three months ended March 31, 2018.
The sequential decrease in Kings average MAUs is due to decreases across franchises and less engaged users leaving the network.
The sequential decrease in Activisions average MAUs is due primarily to lower MAUs for the Call of Duty franchise.
Average MAUs decreased by 55 million, or 14%, for the three months ended June 30, 2018, as compared to the three months ended June 30, 2017.
The year-over-year decrease in Kings average MAUs is due to decreases across Kings franchises due to less engaged users leaving the network.
The year-over-year decrease in Blizzards average MAUs is due to lower MAUs for Heroes of the Storm and Overwatch.
MAUs at King for the three months ended June 30, 2018, were also negatively impacted as a result of technical system changes made by some third-party partners in response to data initiatives, which inadvertently impacted some users ability to play and spend money in King games.
Managements Overview of Business Trends 

Interactive Entertainment and Mobile Gaming Growth 

Our business participates in the global interactive entertainment industry.
Games have become an increasingly popular form of entertainment, and we estimate the total industry grew, on average, 18% from 2014 to 2017.
The industry continues to benefit from additional players entering the market as interactive entertainment becomes more commonplace across age groups and as more developing regions gain access to this form of entertainment.
Table of Contents 

Further, the wide adoption of smart phones globally and the free-to-play business model on those platforms has increased the total addressable market for gaming significantly by introducing gaming to new age groups and new regions and allowing gaming to occur more widely outside the home.
Mobile gaming is estimated to be larger than both console and PC gaming and continues to grow at a significant rate.
King is a leading developer of mobile and free-to-play games and our other business units have mobile efforts underway that present the opportunity for us to expand the reach of, and drive additional player investment from, our franchises.
Opportunities to Expand Franchises Outside of Games 

Our fans spend significant time investing in our franchises through purchases of our game content, whether through purchases of full games or downloadable content or via microtransactions.
Given the passion our players have for our franchises, we believe there are emerging opportunities to drive additional engagement and investment in our franchises outside of games.
These opportunities include esports, film and television, and consumer products.
Our efforts to build these adjacent opportunities are still relatively nascent, but we view them as potentially significant sources of future revenues.
As part of our efforts to take advantage of the esports opportunity, during 2017 we completed the sale of 12 teams for the Overwatch LeagueTM, the first major global professional esports league with city-based teams, and we are nearing completion of the leagues inaugural season.
Concentration of Sales Among the Most Popular Franchises 

The concentration of retail revenues among key titles has continued as a trend in the overall interactive entertainment industry.
According to The NPD Group, the top 10 titles accounted for 36% of the retail sales in the U.S. interactive entertainment industry in 2017.
Similarly, a significant portion of our revenues has historically been derived from video games based on a few popular franchises and these video games were responsible for a disproportionately high percentage of our profits.
For example, the Call of Duty, Candy Crush, World of Warcraft, and Overwatch franchises, collectively, accounted for 66% of our consolidated net revenuesand a significantly higher percentage of our operating incomefor 2017.
The top titles in the industry are also becoming more consistent as players and revenues concentrate more heavily in established franchises.
The top 10 console franchises in 2017 were all established franchises.
Similarly, according to U.S. rankings for the Apple App Store and Google Play store per App Annie Intelligence, as of December 2017, the top 10 mobile games have an average tenure of 22 months.
In addition to investing in, and developing sequels and content for, our top franchises, we are continually exploring additional ways to expand those franchises.
Further, while there is no guarantee of success, we invest in new properties in an effort to develop future top franchises.
In 2014, we released Hearthstone and Destiny, in 2015, we released Heroes of the Storm, and in 2016, we released Overwatch.
Additionally, to diversify our portfolio of key franchises and increase our presence in the mobile market, in 2016 we acquired King.
Overall, we do expect that a limited number of popular franchises will continue to produce a disproportionately high percentage of our, and the industrys, revenues and profits in the near future.
Accordingly, our ability to maintain our top franchises and our ability to successfully compete against our competitors top franchises can significantly impact our performance.
Recurring Revenue Business Models 

Increased consumer online connectivity has allowed us to offer players new investment opportunities and to shift our business further towards a more consistently recurring and year-round model.
Offering downloadable content and microtransactions, in addition to full games, allows our players to access and invest in new content throughout the year.
This incremental content not only provides additional high-margin revenues, it can also increase player engagement.
Also, mobile games, and free-to-play games more broadly, are generally less seasonal.

YTD Q2 2018 vs. YTD Q2 2017 

The decrease in interest and other expense (income), net, for the six months ended June 30, 2018, as compared to the six months ended June 30, 2017, was primarily due to a $23 million increase in interest income from our cash and cash equivalents and as the prior-year period included $12 million from the write-offs of unamortized discount and deferred financing costs associated with debt paydown activities that are not present in 2018.

On June 27, 2018, the Company entered into the Closing Agreement.
The primary adjustments recognized in the second quarter of 2018 related to the Closing Agreement were a tax expense of $70 million and a reduction in unrecognized tax benefits of $437 million.
In addition, we recognized $185 million of tax benefits related to other tax adjustments resulting from the changes in U.S. tax attributes and taxable income caused by the primary adjustments.
We expect the Closing Agreement to result in federal and state cash tax payments of approximately $345 million, which we expect to be made mostly before December 31, 2018.
On December 22, 2017, the U.S. Tax Reform Act was enacted.
The U.S. Tax Reform Act, among other things, reduced the U.S. corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21% beginning in 2018 and implemented a modified territorial tax system that imposed a one-time tax on deemed repatriated earnings of foreign subsidiaries (the Transition Tax).
On December 22, 2017, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) staff issued Staff Accounting Bulletin No.
118 (SAB 118), which provides guidance on how to account for the effects of the U.S. Tax Reform Act under Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 740.
SAB 118 enabled companies to record a provisional amount for the effects of the U.S. Tax Reform Act based on a reasonable estimate, subject to adjustment during a measurement period of up to one year, until accounting is complete.
During the fourth quarter of 2017, we recorded provisional amounts for the effects of the U.S. Tax Reform Act in accordance with SAB 118.
In addition, as of December 31.
2017, we no longer considered the available cash balances related to undistributed earnings held outside of the U.S. by our foreign subsidiaries to be indefinitely reinvested.
We continue to analyze the effects of the U.S. Tax Reform Act on our condensed consolidated financial statements.
Accounting for the income tax effects of the U.S. Tax Reform Act requires complex new calculations and significant judgments in interpreting the legislation.
Additional guidance may be issued on how the provisions of the U.S. Tax Reform Act will be applied or otherwise administered that is different from our interpretation.
We may make adjustments to the provisional amounts as we collect and prepare the data necessary to finalize our calculations, interpret the U.S. Tax Reform Act and any additional guidance issued, and consider the effects of any additional actions we may take as a result of the U.S. Tax Reform Act.
During the three months ended June 30, 2018, the Company obtained additional information, including adjustments related to the Closing Agreement, and the evaluation of the impact of changing our indefinite reinvestment assertion, which affected the provisional amount initially recorded for the U.S. Tax Reform Act in the fourth quarter of 2017.
As a result, the Company recorded an additional tax expense of $34 million in the three months ended June 30, 2018 for the effects of the U.S. Tax Reform Act.
We continue to evaluate the ongoing impacts of the U.S. Tax Reform Act, including provisions impacting certain foreign income, such as a tax on GILTI and a deduction for foreign derived intangible income.
These provisions are complex and subject to continuing regulatory interpretation by the IRS.
While we have included an estimate of GILTI in our estimated effective tax rate for 2018, we may make adjustments as we interpret the U.S. Tax Reform Act and any additional guidance issued, and consider the effects of any additional actions we may take as a result of the U.S. Tax Reform Act.

Liquidity and Capital Resources 

We believe our ability to generate cash flows from operating activities is one of our fundamental financial strengths.
In the near term, we expect our business and financial condition to remain strong and to continue to generate significant operating cash flows, which, we believe, in combination with our existing balance of cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments of $5.0 billion, our access to capital, and the availability of our $250 million revolving credit facility, will be sufficient to finance our operational and financing requirements for the next 12 months.
Our primary sources of liquidity, which are available to us to fund cash outflows such as our anticipated dividend payments, share repurchases, and scheduled debt maturities, include our cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments, and cash flows provided by operating activities.
As of June 30, 2018, the amount of cash and cash equivalents held outside of the U.S. by our foreign subsidiaries was $0.9 billion, as compared to $3.0 billion as of December 31, 2017.
Following the enactment of the U.S. Tax Reform Act and the current period expense on unrepatriated earnings, we no longer consider these available cash balances, which primarily relate to undistributed earnings of our most significant foreign subsidiaries, to be indefinitely reinvested.
Our cash provided from operating activities is somewhat impacted by seasonality.
Working capital needs are impacted by weekly sales, which are generally highest in the fourth quarter due to seasonal and holiday-related sales patterns.
We consider, on a continuing basis, various transactions to increase shareholder value and enhance our business results, including acquisitions, divestitures, joint ventures, share repurchases, and other structural changes.
These transactions may result in future cash proceeds or payments.

Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities 


Net cash provided by operating activities for the six months ended June 30, 2018, was $538 million, as compared to $676 million for the six months ended June 30, 2017.
The decrease was primarily due to changes in our working capital resulting from timing of collections and payments.
The decrease was partially offset by higher net income for the six months ended June 30, 2018, as compared to the six months ended June 30, 2017.
Net Cash Used in Investing Activities 

The primary drivers of net cash flows associated with investing activities typically include capital expenditures, purchases and sales of investments, changes in restricted cash balances, and cash used for acquisitions.
Net cash used in investing activities for the six months ended June 30, 2018, was $124 million, as compared net cash used in investing activities of $48 million for the six months ended June 30, 2017.
The increase in the cash used in investing activities was primarily due to purchases of available-for-sale investments of $59 million for the six months ended June 30, 2018, with no comparable transaction in the prior-year period.
Net Cash (Used in) Provided by Financing Activities 

The primary drivers of net cash flows associated with financing activities typically include the proceeds from, and repayments of, our long-term debt and transactions involving our common stock, including the issuance of shares of common stock to employees upon the exercise of stock options, as well as the payment of dividends.
· lower proceeds from stock option exercises of $77 million for the six months ended June 30, 2018, as compared to $130 million for the six months ended June 30, 2017; 

· higher tax payments made for net share settlements on restricted stock units of $68 million for the six months ended June 30, 2018, as compared to $36 million for the six months ended June 30, 2017; and 

· higher dividends paid of $259 million for the six months ended June 30, 2018, as compared to $226 million for the six months ended June 30, 2017.

Effect of Foreign Exchange Rate Changes 

Changes in foreign exchange rates had a negative impact of $19 million and a positive impact of $50 million on our cash and cash equivalents for the six months ended June 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively.
The change was primarily due to changes in the value of the U.S. dollar relative to the euro and the British pound.
Debt 

As of both June 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017, our total outstanding debt was $4.4 billion, bearing interest at a weighted average rate of 3.69% and 3.58%, respectively.
During the six months ended June 30, 2018, there was no activity associated with our debt instruments except for normal recurring interest payments.
On July 17, 2018, we issued an irrevocable notice of redemption to the holders of all of our outstanding 2023 Notes.
Accordingly, the 2023 Notes will be redeemed pursuant to their terms on August 16, 2018 at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the 2023 Notes plus a make-whole premium calculated as set forth in the indenture governing the 2023 Notes.
Redemption of the 2023 Notes will result in a loss on extinguishment of approximately $35 million, comprised of premium payments of approximately $27 million and a write-off of unamortized discount and financing costs of approximately $8 million.
As the irrevocable notice of redemption was issued subsequent to June 30, 2018, we presented the outstanding principal balance of the 2023 Notes and its related unamortized discount and deferred financing costs as Long-term debt, net on our condensed consolidated balance sheets as of June 30, 2018.
On February 1, 2018, our Board of Directors authorized repayment of up to $1.8 billion of the companys outstanding debt during 2018.
As discussed above, on July 17, 2018, we issued an irrevocable notice to the holders of our 2023 Notes that all of our outstanding 2023 Notes will be redeemed on August 16, 2018.
The determination as to if and when we make any such remaining repayments will be dependent on market conditions and other factors.

For the year ending December 31, 2018, we anticipate total capital expenditures of approximately $140 million, primarily for leasehold improvements, computer hardware, and software purchases.
During the six months ended June 30, 2018, capital expenditures were $61 million.
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 

At June 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017, Activision Blizzard had no significant relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial parties, often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities, established for the purpose of facilitating off-balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes, that have or are reasonably likely to have a material current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures, or capital resources.

Revenue Recognition 

As discussed in Note 2 of the notes to condensed consolidated financial statements included in Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, in May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued new accounting guidance related to revenue recognition and on January 1, 2018, we adopted the new accounting standard and related amendments (collectively, the new revenue accounting standard), utilizing the modified retrospective method.
Additionally, we elected to apply the new revenue accounting standard only to contracts not completed as of the adoption date.
For contracts that were modified before the period of adoption, we elected to reflect the aggregate effect of all modifications when (1) identifying the satisfied and unsatisfied performance obligations, (2) determining the transaction price, and (3) allocating the transaction price to the satisfied and unsatisfied performance obligations.
We recognized the cumulative effect of initially applying the new revenue accounting standard as an adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings.
The comparative information has not been restated and continues to be reported under the accounting standards in effect for those periods.
The cumulative effect adjustment recorded to our retained earnings at January 1, 2018 was $88 million.

· The accounting for certain of our software licensing arrangements.
While the impact of the new revenue accounting standard may differ on a contract-by-contract basis (as the actual revenue recognition treatment required under the standard will depend on contract-specific terms), the new revenue accounting standard generally results in earlier revenue recognition for these arrangements.
For additional discussion regarding the impact of our adoption of the new revenue accounting standard, including the impacts to our condensed consolidated balance sheet and statement of operations, see Note 3 of the notes to condensed consolidated financial statements included in Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.
Statement of Cash Flows-Restricted Cash 

In November 2016, the FASB issued new guidance related to the classification of restricted cash in the statement of cash flows.
The new standard requires that a statement of cash flows explain any change during the period in total cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash.
Therefore, restricted cash will be included with Cash and cash equivalents when reconciling the beginning-of-period and end-of-period total amounts shown on the statement of cash flows.
The new standard is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, and should be applied retrospectively.
Early adoption is permitted.
We adopted the new standard during the first quarter of 2018 and applied the standard retrospectively for all periods presented.
The application of this new standard did not have a material impact on our condensed consolidated statements of cash flows for the six months ended June 30, 2018 and 2017.
In our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ending December 31, 2018, there will be a significant impact to the consolidated statements of cash flows for 2016, as this period includes, as an investing activity, the $3.6 billion movement in restricted cash resulting from the transfer of cash into escrow at December 31, 2015 to facilitate the acquisition of King, and the subsequent release of that cash in 2016 to complete the acquisition.
Under this new standard, the restricted cash balance will be included in the beginning and ending total cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash balances and, hence, will not be included as an investing activity in the statement of cash flows.
Derivatives and Hedging 

In August 2017, the FASB issued new guidance related to the accounting for derivatives and hedging.
The new guidance expands and refines hedge accounting for both financial and non-financial risk components, aligns the recognition and presentation of the effects of hedging instruments and hedged items in the financial statements, and includes certain targeted improvements to ease the application of current guidance related to the assessment of a hedges effectiveness.
The new standard is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018.
Early adoption is permitted.
We adopted the standard during the first quarter of 2018.
The adoption of the standard did not have a material impact to our condensed consolidated financial statements.
Recent Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet Adopted 

Leases 

In February 2016, the FASB issued new guidance related to the accounting for leases.
The new standard will replace all current U.S. GAAP guidance on this topic.
The new standard, among other things, requires a lessee to classify a lease as either an operating or financing lease, and to recognize a lease liability and a right-of-use asset for its leases.
Classification will be based on criteria that are largely similar to those applied in current lease accounting.
The lease liability will be equal to the present value of lease payments.
The asset will be based on the lease liability, subject to adjustment for initial direct costs, lease incentives received, and any prepaid lease payments.
Operating leases will result in a straight-line expense pattern, while finance leases will result in a front-loaded expense pattern.
The standard is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2018.
Early adoption is permitted.
The new standard must be adopted using a

modified retrospective transition and will require application of the new guidance at the beginning of the earliest comparative period presented, with certain transition practical expedients available to provide relief in adopting the new standard.
We are evaluating the impact of this new accounting guidance on our financial statements, but expect it to have a significant impact to our consolidated balance sheet as a result of establishing lease liabilities and right-of-use assets for our operating leases.
We do not plan to early adopt this new standard but do expect to elect and apply the available transition practical expedients upon adoption.
