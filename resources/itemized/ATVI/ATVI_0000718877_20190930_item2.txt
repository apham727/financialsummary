Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations

Business Overview

Activision Blizzard, Inc. is a leading global developer and publisher of interactive entertainment content and services.
We develop and distribute content and services on video game consoles, personal computers (“PC”s), and mobile devices.
We also operate esports leagues and events and create film and television content based on our intellectual property.
The terms “Activision Blizzard,” the “Company,” “we,” “us,” and “our” are used to refer collectively to Activision Blizzard, Inc. and its subsidiaries.
The Company was originally incorporated in California in 1979 and was reincorporated in Delaware in December 1992.
In connection with the 2008 business combination by and among the Company (then known as Activision, Inc.), Vivendi S.A, and Vivendi Games, Inc., then an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of Vivendi S.A., we were renamed Activision Blizzard, Inc.

Our Segments




In 2010, Activision entered into an exclusive relationship with Bungie, Inc. (“Bungie”) to publish games in the Destiny franchise.
Effective December 31, 2018, Activision and Bungie mutually agreed to terminate their publishing relationship related to the Destiny franchise.
As part of this termination, Activision agreed to transfer its publishing rights for the Destiny franchise to Bungie in exchange for cash and Bungie’s assumption of on-going customer obligations of Activision.
Activision no longer has any material rights or obligations related to the Destiny franchise.
Blizzard Entertainment, Inc. (“Blizzard”) is a leading global developer and publisher of interactive software products and entertainment content, particularly for the PC platform.
Blizzard primarily delivers content through retail and digital channels, including subscriptions, full-game, and in-game sales, as well as by licensing software to third-party or related-party companies that distribute Blizzard products.
Blizzard also maintains a proprietary online gaming service, Blizzard Battle.net®, which facilitates digital distribution of Blizzard content and selected Activision content, online social connectivity, and the creation of user-generated content.
Blizzard also includes the activities of the Overwatch LeagueTM, the first major global professional esports league with city-based teams, and our Major League Gaming (“MLG”) business, which is responsible for various esports events and serves as a multi-platform network for Activision Blizzard esports content.
King Digital Entertainment (“King”) is a leading global developer and publisher of interactive entertainment content and services, particularly for the mobile platform, including for Google’s Android and Apple’s iOS.
King also distributes its content and services on the PC platform, primarily via Facebook.
King’s games are free to play; however, players can acquire in-game items, either with virtual currency or real currency, and we continue to focus on in-game advertising as a growing source of additional revenue.
Other


•the Activision Blizzard Studios (“Studios”) business, which is devoted to creating original film and television content based on our library of globally recognized intellectual properties, and which, in September 2018, released the third season of the animated TV series Skylanders™ Academy on Netflix; and

•the Activision Blizzard Distribution (“Distribution”) business, which consists of operations in Europe that provide warehousing, logistics, and sales distribution services to third-party publishers of interactive entertainment software, our own publishing operations, and manufacturers of interactive entertainment hardware.
Business Results and Highlights

Financial Results














Since certain of our games are hosted online or include significant online functionality that represents a separate performance obligation, we defer the transaction price allocable to the online functionality from the sale of these games and then recognize the attributable revenues over the relevant estimated service periods, which are generally less than a year.
Net revenues and operating income for the three months ended September 30, 2019, include a net effect of $68 million and $53 million, respectively, from the recognition of deferred net revenues and related cost of revenues.
Net revenues and operating income for the nine months ended September 30, 2019, include a net effect of $824 million and $629 million, respectively, from the recognition of deferred net revenues and related cost of revenues.
Content Release and Event Highlights

During the three months ended September 30, 2019, Activision released SpyroTM Reignited Trilogy on Nintendo Switch and PC, and Blizzard released World of Warcraft® Classic, a re-creation of the pre-expansion version of the game, and the latest expansions to Hearthstone—Saviors of UldumTM and Tombs of TerrorTM .
Operating Metrics

The following operating metrics are key performance indicators that we use to evaluate our business.
Net bookings and In-game net bookings

We monitor net bookings as a key operating metric in evaluating the performance of our business.
Net bookings is the net amount of products and services sold digitally or sold-in physically in the period, and includes license fees, merchandise, and publisher incentives, among others.
Net bookings is equal to net revenues excluding the impact from deferrals.
In-game net bookings primarily includes the net amount of downloadable content and microtransactions sold during the period, and is equal to in-game net revenues excluding the impact from deferrals.
Net bookings

Q3 2019 vs. Q3 2018



•a decrease in Activision net bookings of $188 million driven by (1) lower net bookings from the Destiny franchise (reflecting our sale of the publishing rights for Destiny to Bungie in December 2018), and (2) lower net bookings from the Call of Duty franchise catalog titles.
YTD Q3 2019 vs. YTD Q3 2018




In-game net bookings

Q3 2019 vs. Q3 2018

The decrease in in-game net bookings for the three months ended September 30, 2019, as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2018, was primarily due to a decrease in Blizzard and Activision in-game net bookings of $183 million and $113 million, respectively, due to the same drivers discussed for net bookings above.
YTD Q3 2019 vs. YTD Q3 2018



•a decrease in Activision in-game net bookings of $254 million driven by (1) lower in-game net bookings from the Destiny franchise and (2) lower in-game net bookings from the Call of Duty franchise, primarily driven by catalog titles.
Monthly Active Users

We monitor monthly active users (“MAUs”) as a key measure of the overall size of our user base.
MAUs are the number of individuals who accessed a particular game in a given month.
We calculate average MAUs in a period by adding the total number of MAUs in each of the months in a given period and dividing that total by the number of months in the period.
An individual who accesses two of our games would be counted as two users.
In addition, due to technical limitations, for Activision and King, an individual who accesses the same game on two platforms or devices in the relevant period would be counted as two users.
For Blizzard, an individual who accesses the same game on two platforms or devices in the relevant period would generally be counted as a single user.
Average MAUs decreased by 11 million, or 3%, for the three months ended September 30, 2019, as compared to the three months ended June 30, 2019, primarily driven by a decrease in average MAUs for King.
The decrease in King’s average MAUs is primarily due to decreases from the Candy Crush franchise.
The slight increase in Blizzard’s average MAUs is due to an increase in average MAUs for World of Warcraft, largely offset by lower average MAUs for Hearthstone.
•decreases across King’s various franchises, other than Candy Crush, primarily from less engaged users leaving the network, partially offset by an increase in average MAUs for the Candy Crush franchise, primarily driven by the launch of Candy Crush Friends SagaTM in the fourth quarter of 2018;

•lower average MAUs for Activision, primarily due to the absence of Destiny MAUs in our operating metric and lower average MAUs from the Call of Duty franchise; and


Management’s Overview of Business Trends

Interactive Entertainment and Mobile Gaming Growth

Our business participates in the global interactive entertainment industry.
Games have become an increasingly popular form of entertainment, and we estimate the total industry has grown, on average, 18% annually from 2015 to 2018.
The industry continues to benefit from additional players entering the market as interactive entertainment becomes more commonplace across age groups and as more developing regions gain access to this form of entertainment.
Opportunities to Expand Franchises Outside of Games

Our fans spend significant time investing in our franchises through purchases of our game content, whether through purchases of full games or downloadable content or via microtransactions.
Given the passion our players have for our franchises, we believe there are emerging opportunities to drive additional engagement and investment in our franchises outside of games.
Our efforts to build these adjacent opportunities are still relatively nascent, but we view them as potentially significant sources of future revenues.
For example, as part of our efforts to take advantage of esports opportunities, we have sold rights for 20 teams that are participating in the Overwatch League, which recently completed its second season.
Additionally, we have sold the first 12 teams for the Call of Duty League.
Concentration of Sales Among the Most Popular Franchises

The concentration of retail revenues among key titles has continued as a trend in the overall interactive entertainment industry.
According to The NPD Group, the top 10 titles accounted for 38% of the retail sales in the U.S. interactive entertainment industry in 2018.
Similarly, a significant portion of our revenues historically has been derived from video games based on a few popular franchises, and these video games have been responsible for a disproportionately high percentage of our profits.
For example, the Call of Duty, Candy Crush, and World of Warcraft franchises, collectively, accounted for 58% of our consolidated net revenues—and a significantly higher percentage of our operating income—for 2018.
Overall, we do expect that a limited number of popular franchises will continue to produce a disproportionately high percentage of our, and the industry’s, revenues and profits in the near future.
Accordingly, our ability to maintain our top franchises and our ability to successfully compete against our competitors’ top franchises can significantly impact our performance.
Recurring Revenue Business Models

Increased consumer online connectivity has allowed us to offer players new investment opportunities and to shift our business further towards a more consistently recurring and year-round model.
Offering downloadable content and microtransactions, in addition to full games, allows our players to access and invest in new content throughout the year.
This incremental content not only provides additional high-margin revenues, it can also increase player engagement.
Also, mobile games, and free-to-play games more broadly, are generally less seasonal than games developed primarily for the console or PC platforms.

Since the roll out of the plan, we have been, and will continue focusing on these goals.
The restructuring and related costs incurred during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2019, relate primarily to severance costs, write-downs of lease facility assets, and the write-downs of other assets that will no longer be used.

The decrease in interest and other expense (income), net, for the three months ended September 30, 2019, as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2018, was primarily due to an $11 million decrease in interest expense and amortization of deferred financing costs associated with our debt obligations, due to a decrease in our total debt outstanding as a result of our debt redemptions and repayment activities during 2018.
YTD Q3 2019 vs. YTD Q3 2018


•a $49 million decrease in interest expense and amortization of deferred financing costs associated with our debt obligations, reflecting a decrease in our total debt outstanding as a result of our debt redemptions and repayment activities during 2018; 

•a $38 million gain recognized as a result of adjusting a cost-method equity investment to fair value, with no comparable activity in the prior period (refer to Note 8 of the notes to the condensed consolidated financial statements included in Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q); and

•an $11 million increase in interest income due to our cash and cash equivalent balances earning interest at higher rates, along with an overall higher cash balance, in 2019 as compared to 2018.
Income Tax Expense (amounts in millions)


The income tax expense of $45 million for the three months ended September 30, 2019, reflects an effective tax rate of 18%, which is higher than the effective tax rate of (23)% for the three months ended September 30, 2018.
The increase is primarily due to a discrete tax benefit recognized in the prior year in connection with adjustments made to the provisional amounts initially recorded in connection with tax reform legislation known as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act enacted in December 22, 2017 (the “U.S.
Tax Reform Act”), lower excess tax benefits from share-based payments in the current year, and an increase in U.S. tax on foreign earnings.
The effective tax rate of 18% for both the three and nine months ended September 30, 2019, is lower than the U.S. statutory rate of 21%, primarily due to foreign earnings taxed at lower statutory rates as compared to domestic earnings, which is partially offset by U.S. tax on foreign earnings, and the recognition of federal research and development credit.
Further information about our income taxes is provided in Note 16 of the notes to the condensed consolidated financial statements included in Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.
Liquidity and Capital Resources

We believe our ability to generate cash flows from operating activities is one of our fundamental financial strengths.
In the near term, we expect our business and financial condition to remain strong and to continue to generate significant operating cash flows, which, we believe, in combination with our existing balance of cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments of $4.9 billion, our access to capital, and the availability of our $1.5 billion revolving credit facility, will be sufficient to finance our operational and financing requirements for the next 12 months.
Our primary sources of liquidity, which are available to us to fund cash outflows such as potential dividend payments or share repurchases, and scheduled debt maturities, include our cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments, and cash flows provided by operating activities.
As of September 30, 2019, the amount of cash and cash equivalents held outside of the U.S. by our foreign subsidiaries was $2.3 billion, as compared to $1.4 billion as of December 31, 2018.
These cash balances are generally available for use in the U.S., subject in some cases to certain restrictions.
Our cash provided from operating activities is somewhat impacted by seasonality.
Working capital needs are impacted by weekly sales, which are generally highest in the fourth quarter due to seasonal and holiday-related sales patterns.
We consider, on a continuing basis, various transactions to increase shareholder value and enhance our business results, including acquisitions, divestitures, joint ventures, share repurchases, and other structural changes.
These transactions may result in future cash proceeds or payments.
Sources of Liquidity (amounts in millions)



Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities


Net cash provided by operating activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2019, was $913 million, as compared to $791 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2018.
The increase was primarily due to changes in our working capital resulting from the timing of collections and payments and lower cash spent to support the Destiny franchise (reflecting our sale of the publishing rights for Destiny to Bungie in December 2018).
This increase was partially offset by lower net income and a decrease in non-cash adjustments to net income, primarily due to lower amortization on intangible assets related to King and lower amortization of capitalized software development costs and intellectual property licenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2019, as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2018.
Net Cash Provided by (Used in) Investing Activities 

The primary drivers of net cash flows associated with investing activities typically include capital expenditures, purchases and sales of investments, changes in restricted cash balances, and cash used for acquisitions.
Net cash provided by investing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2019, was $79 million, as compared to net cash used in investing activities of $160 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2018.
The increase was primarily due to $153 million of cash proceeds from the maturities of available-for-sale investments, as compared to purchases of available-for-sale investments of $59 million in the prior-year period.
Additionally, capital expenditures of $79 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2019, were lower than the capital expenditures of $97 million for the prior-year period.
Net Cash Used in Financing Activities 

The primary drivers of net cash flows associated with financing activities typically include the proceeds from, and repayments of, our long-term debt and transactions involving our common stock, including the issuance of shares of common stock to employees upon the exercise of stock options, as well as the payment of dividends.
Net cash used in financing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2019, was $251 million, as compared to $2.0 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2018.
The decrease was primarily due to debt repayments, inclusive of premium payments, of $1.8 billion during the nine months ended September 30, 2018, with no comparable repayment activity in the nine months ended September 30, 2019.

The change was primarily due to changes in the value of the U.S. dollar relative to the euro and the British pound.

Leases

As noted in Note 2 of the notes to the condensed consolidated financial statements included in Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, we adopted the new lease accounting standard effective January 1, 2019.
We elected to apply an optional adoption method, which uses the effective date as the initial date of application on transition with no retrospective adjustments to prior periods.
Additionally, we elected to apply the package of transition practical expedients which permitted us to, among other things, (1) not reassess if existing contracts contained leases under the new lease accounting standard, and (2) carry forward our historical lease classifications.
For additional discussion regarding the impact of our adoption of the new lease accounting standard to our condensed consolidated balance sheet, see Note 3 of the notes to the condensed consolidated financial statements included in Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.
