Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations
Business Overview
Activision Blizzard, Inc. is a leading global developer and publisher of interactive entertainment content and services.
We develop and distribute content and services on video game consoles, personal computers (“PC”s), and mobile devices.
We also operate esports leagues and events and create film and television content based on our intellectual property.
The terms “Activision Blizzard,” the “Company,” “we,” “us,” and “our” are used to refer collectively to Activision Blizzard, Inc. and its subsidiaries.
The Company was originally incorporated in California in 1979 and was reincorporated in Delaware in December 1992.
In connection with the 2008 business combination by and among the Company (then known as Activision, Inc.), Vivendi S.A, and Vivendi Games, Inc., then an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of Vivendi S.A., we were renamed Activision Blizzard, Inc.
Our Segments
Activision Publishing, Inc. (“Activision”), is a leading global developer and publisher of interactive software products and entertainment content, particularly for the console platform.
Activision primarily delivers content through retail and digital channels, including full-game and in-game sales, as well as by licensing software to third-party or related-party companies that distribute Activision products.
Activision develops, markets, and sells products primarily based on our internally developed intellectual properties, as well as some licensed properties.
Activision’s key product franchise is Call of Duty®, a first-person shooter for the console and PC platforms.
In 2010, Activision entered into an exclusive relationship with Bungie, Inc. (“Bungie”) to publish games in the Destiny franchise.
Effective December 31, 2018, Activision and Bungie mutually agreed to terminate their publishing relationship related to the Destiny franchise.
As part of this termination, Activision agreed to transfer its publishing rights for the Destiny franchise to Bungie in exchange for cash and Bungie’s assumption of on-going customer obligations of Activision.
Activision no longer has any material rights or obligations related to the Destiny franchise.
Blizzard Entertainment, Inc. (“Blizzard”) is a leading global developer and publisher of interactive software products and entertainment content, particularly for the PC platform.
Blizzard primarily delivers content through retail and digital channels, including subscriptions, full-game, and in-game sales, as well as by licensing software to third-party or related-party companies that distribute Blizzard products.
Blizzard also maintains a proprietary online gaming service, Blizzard Battle.net®, which facilitates digital distribution of Blizzard content and selected Activision content, online social connectivity, and the creation of user-generated content.
Blizzard also includes the activities of the Overwatch LeagueTM, the first major global professional esports league with city-based teams, and our Major League Gaming (“MLG”) business, which is responsible for various esports events and serves as a multi-platform network for Activision Blizzard esports content.
King Digital Entertainment (“King”) is a leading global developer and publisher of interactive entertainment content and services, particularly for the mobile platform, including for Google Inc.’s (“Google”) Android and Apple Inc.’s (“Apple”) iOS.
King also distributes its content and services on the PC platform, primarily via Facebook.
King’s games are free to play; however, players can acquire in-game items, either with virtual currency or real currency, and we continue to focus on in-game advertising as a growing source of additional revenue.
Other
•the Activision Blizzard Studios (“Studios”) business, which is devoted to creating original film and television content based on our library of globally recognized intellectual properties, and which, in September 2018, released the third season of the animated TV series Skylanders™ Academy on Netflix; and
•the Activision Blizzard Distribution (“Distribution”) business, which consists of operations in Europe that provide warehousing, logistics, and sales distribution services to third-party publishers of interactive entertainment software, our own publishing operations, and manufacturers of interactive entertainment hardware.
Business Results and Highlights
Financial Results
Since certain of our games are hosted online or include significant online functionality that represents a separate performance obligation, we defer the transaction price allocable to the online functionality from the sale of these games and then recognize the attributable revenues over the relevant estimated service periods, which are generally less than a year.
Net revenues and operating income for the three months ended June 30, 2019, include a net effect of $189 million and $135 million, respectively, from the recognition of deferred net revenues and related cost of revenues.
Net revenues and operating income for the six months ended June 30, 2019, include a net effect of $755 million and $576 million, respectively, from the recognition of deferred net revenues and related cost of revenues.
Content Release and Event Highlights
During the three months ended June 30, 2019, Activision released CrashTM Team Racing Nitro-Fueled and Blizzard released the latest expansion to Hearthstone—Rise of ShadowsTM.
Operating Metrics
The following operating metrics are key performance indicators that we use to evaluate our business.
Net Bookings
We monitor net bookings as a key operating metric in evaluating the performance of our business.
Net bookings is the net amount of products and services sold digitally or sold-in physically in the period, and includes license fees, merchandise, and publisher incentives, among others.
Net bookings is equal to net revenues excluding the impact from deferrals.
Q2 2019 vs. Q2 2018
•lower net bookings from the Destiny franchise, the publishing rights to which we sold to Bungie in December 2018, as previously disclosed; and
•lower net bookings from Overwatch.
The decrease was partially offset by net bookings from Crash Team Racing Nitro-Fueled, which was released in June 2019.
YTD Q2 2019 vs. YTD Q2 2018
•lower net bookings from Overwatch.
Monthly Active Users
We monitor monthly active users (“MAUs”) as a key measure of the overall size of our user base.
MAUs are the number of individuals who accessed a particular game in a given month.
We calculate average MAUs in a period by adding the total number of MAUs in each of the months in a given period and dividing that total by the number of months in the period.
An individual who accesses two of our games would be counted as two users.
In addition, due to technical limitations, for Activision and King, an individual who accesses the same game on two platforms or devices in the relevant period would be counted as two users.
For Blizzard, an individual who accesses the same game on two platforms or devices in the relevant period would generally be counted as a single user.
Average MAUs decreased by 18 million, or 5%, for the three months ended June 30, 2019, as compared to the three months ended March 31, 2019, primarily driven by a decrease in average MAUs for King and Activision.
The decrease in King’s average MAUs is primarily due to decreases from the Candy Crush franchise.
The decrease in Activision’s average MAUs is primarily due to decreases from the Call of Duty franchise.
•decreases across King’s various franchises, primarily from less engaged users leaving the network, partially offset by an increase in average MAUs for the Candy Crush franchise, primarily given the launch of Candy Crush Friends SagaTM in the fourth quarter of 2018;
•lower average MAUs for Activision, primarily due to lower average MAUs from the Call of Duty franchise and the absence of Destiny MAUs in our operating metric; and
King MAUs were also negatively impacted by a King network outage in the second quarter of 2018, resulting from changes made by a third-party partner which inadvertently impacted some users’ ability to play and spend money in King games.
Management’s Overview of Business Trends
Interactive Entertainment and Mobile Gaming Growth
Our business participates in the global interactive entertainment industry.
Games have become an increasingly popular form of entertainment, and we estimate the total industry has grown, on average, 18% annually from 2015 to 2018.
The industry continues to benefit from additional players entering the market as interactive entertainment becomes more commonplace across age groups and as more developing regions gain access to this form of entertainment.
The wide adoption of smart phones globally and the free-to-play business model on those platforms has increased the total addressable audience for gaming significantly by introducing gaming to new age groups and new regions and allowing gaming to occur more widely outside the home.
Mobile gaming is estimated to be larger than console and PC gaming, and continues to grow at a significant rate.
King is a leading developer of mobile and free-to-play games and our other business units have mobile efforts underway that present the opportunity for us to expand the reach of, and drive additional player investment from, our franchises.
Opportunities to Expand Franchises Outside of Games
Our fans spend significant time investing in our franchises through purchases of our game content, whether through purchases of full games or downloadable content or via microtransactions.
Given the passion our players have for our franchises, we believe there are emerging opportunities to drive additional engagement and investment in our franchises outside of games.
Our efforts to build these adjacent opportunities are still relatively nascent, but we view them as potentially significant sources of future revenues.
For example, as part of our efforts to take advantage of esports opportunities, during 2017, we completed the sale of 12 teams for the Overwatch League, which concluded its inaugural season in July 2018.
During 2018, we also completed the sale of eight additional teams for the Overwatch League, which are competing in the league’s second season that began in February 2019.
Additionally, we have sold the first eight teams for our professional Call of Duty city-based league.
Concentration of Sales Among the Most Popular Franchises
The concentration of retail revenues among key titles has continued as a trend in the overall interactive entertainment industry.
According to The NPD Group, the top 10 titles accounted for 38% of the retail sales in the U.S. interactive entertainment industry in 2018.
Similarly, a significant portion of our revenues historically has been derived from video games based on a few popular franchises, and these video games have been responsible for a disproportionately high percentage of our profits.
For example, the Call of Duty, Candy Crush, and World of Warcraft franchises, collectively, accounted for 58% of our consolidated net revenues—and a significantly higher percentage of our operating income—for 2018.
In addition to investing in, and developing sequels and content for, our top franchises, we are continually exploring additional ways to expand those franchises.
Further, while there is no guarantee of success, we invest in new properties in an effort to develop future top franchises.
For example, in 2014, we released Hearthstone, and in 2016, we released Overwatch.
Additionally, to diversify our portfolio of key franchises and increase our presence on the mobile platform, in 2016, we acquired King.
We also have mobile titles in development based on Activision and Blizzards intellectual property, such as the previously announced Call of Duty Mobile and Diablo ImmortalTM.
Overall, we do expect that a limited number of popular franchises will continue to produce a disproportionately high percentage of our, and the industry’s, revenues and profits in the near future.
Accordingly, our ability to maintain our top franchises and our ability to successfully compete against our competitors’ top franchises can significantly impact our performance.
Recurring Revenue Business Models
Increased consumer online connectivity has allowed us to offer players new investment opportunities and to shift our business further towards a more consistently recurring and year-round model.
Offering downloadable content and microtransactions, in addition to full games, allows our players to access and invest in new content throughout the year.
This incremental content not only provides additional high-margin revenues, it can also increase player engagement.
Also, mobile games, and free-to-play games more broadly, are generally less seasonal than games developed primarily for the console or PC platforms.

The increase is primarily due to the factors discussed above for the three months ended June 30, 2019, as compared to the three months ended June 30, 2018.
Further information about our income taxes is provided in Note 16 of the notes to the condensed consolidated financial statements included in Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
We believe our ability to generate cash flows from operating activities is one of our fundamental financial strengths.
In the near term, we expect our business and financial condition to remain strong and to continue to generate significant operating cash flows, which, we believe, in combination with our existing balance of cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments of $4.7 billion, our access to capital, and the availability of our $1.5 billion revolving credit facility, will be sufficient to finance our operational and financing requirements for the next 12 months.
Our primary sources of liquidity, which are available to us to fund cash outflows such as our anticipated dividend payments, share repurchases, and scheduled debt maturities, include our cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments, and cash flows provided by operating activities.
As of June 30, 2019, the amount of cash and cash equivalents held outside of the U.S. by our foreign subsidiaries was $2.0 billion, as compared to $1.4 billion as of December 31, 2018.
These cash balances are generally available for use in the U.S., subject in some cases to certain restrictions.
Our cash provided from operating activities is somewhat impacted by seasonality.
Working capital needs are impacted by weekly sales, which are generally highest in the fourth quarter due to seasonal and holiday-related sales patterns.
We consider, on a continuing basis, various transactions to increase shareholder value and enhance our business results, including acquisitions, divestitures, joint ventures, share repurchases, and other structural changes.
These transactions may result in future cash proceeds or payments.
Sources of Liquidity (amounts in millions)
Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities
Net cash provided by operating activities for the six months ended June 30, 2019, was $604 million, as compared to $538 million for the six months ended June 30, 2018.
The increase was primarily due to changes in our working capital resulting from the timing of collections and payments and lower cash spent to support the Destiny franchise, the publishing rights to which we sold to Bungie in December 2018, as previously disclosed.
This increase was partially offset by lower net income and a decrease in non-cash adjustments to net income for the six months ended June 30, 2019, as compared to the six months ended June 30, 2018.
Net Cash Provided by (Used in) Investing Activities
The primary drivers of net cash flows associated with investing activities typically include capital expenditures, purchases and sales of investments, changes in restricted cash balances, and cash used for acquisitions.
Net cash provided by investing activities for the six months ended June 30, 2019, was $37 million, as compared to net cash used in investing activities of $124 million for the six months ended June 30, 2018.
The increase was primarily due to cash flow activities associated with available-for-sale investments, for which, in the six months ended June 30, 2019, there were $75 million of cash proceeds from the maturities of available-for-sale investments, as compared to purchases of available-for-sale investments of $59 million in the prior-year period.
Additionally, capital expenditures of $45 million for the six months ended June 30, 2019, were lower than the capital expenditures of $61 million for the prior-year period.
Net Cash Used in Financing Activities
The primary drivers of net cash flows associated with financing activities typically include the proceeds from, and repayments of, our long-term debt and transactions involving our common stock, including the issuance of shares of common stock to employees upon the exercise of stock options, as well as the payment of dividends.
The increase was partially offset by lower tax payments made for net share settlements on restricted stock units of $48 million for the six months ended June 30, 2019, as compared to $68 million for the prior-year period.
Effect of Foreign Exchange Rate Changes
Changes in foreign exchange rates had a positive impact of $3 million on our cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash for the six months ended June 30, 2019, as compared to a negative impact of $19 million for the six months ended June 30, 2018.
The change was primarily due to changes in the value of the U.S. dollar relative to the euro and the British pound.
Debt
As of June 30, 2019 and December 31, 2018, our total outstanding debt was $2.7 billion, bearing interest at a weighted average rate of 3.18%.
Refer to Note 11 of the notes to the condensed consolidated financial statements included in Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for further disclosures regarding our debt obligations.
Dividends
On February 12, 2019, our Board of Directors declared a cash dividend of $0.37 per common share.
On May 9, 2019, we made an aggregate cash dividend payment of $283 million to shareholders of record at the close of business on March 28, 2019.
Capital Expenditures
For the year ending December 31, 2019, we anticipate total capital expenditures of approximately $140 million, primarily for leasehold improvements, computer hardware, and software purchases.
During the six months ended June 30, 2019, capital expenditures were $45 million.
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
At each of June 30, 2019 and December 31, 2018, Activision Blizzard had no significant relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial parties, often referred to as “structured finance” or “special purpose” entities, established for the purpose of facilitating off-balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes, that have or are reasonably likely to have a material current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures, or capital resources.

Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements
Leases
As noted in Note 2 of the notes to the condensed consolidated financial statements included in Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, we adopted the new lease accounting standard effective January 1, 2019.
We elected to apply an optional adoption method, which uses the effective date as the initial date of application on transition with no retrospective adjustments to prior periods.
Additionally, we elected to apply the package of transition practical expedients which permitted us to, among other things, (1) not reassess if existing contracts contained leases under the new lease accounting standard and (2) carry forward our historical lease classifications.
For additional discussion regarding the impact of our adoption of the new lease accounting standard to our condensed consolidated balance sheet, see Note 3 of the notes to the condensed consolidated financial statements included in Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.
