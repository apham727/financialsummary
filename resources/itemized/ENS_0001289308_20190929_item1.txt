NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED CONDENSED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Unaudited)



(In Thousands, Except Share and Per Share Data)



1. Basis of Presentation



The accompanying unaudited consolidated condensed financial statements have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles for interim financial information and with the instructions to Form 10-Q and Article 10 of Regulation S-X. Accordingly, they do not include all of the information and footnotes required by generally accepted accounting principles for complete financial statements. In the opinion of management, all adjustments (consisting of normal recurring adjustments except those otherwise described herein) considered necessary for a fair presentation have been included, unless otherwise disclosed. Operating results for the three months and six months ended September 29, 2019 are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for the fiscal year ending March 31, 2020. 



The Consolidated Condensed Balance Sheet at March 31, 2019 has been derived from the audited consolidated financial statements at that date but does not include all of the information and footnotes required by generally accepted accounting principles for complete financial statements. 



The financial statements should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes thereto included in the Company’s 2019 Annual Report on Form 10-K (SEC File No. 001-32253), which was filed on May 29, 2019 (the “2019 Annual Report”).



EnerSys (the “Company,”) reports interim financial information for 13-week periods, except for the first quarter, which always begins on April 1, and the fourth quarter, which always ends on March 31. The four quarters in fiscal 2020 end on June 30, 2019, September 29, 2019, December 29, 2019, and March 31, 2020, respectively. The four quarters in fiscal 2019 ended on July 1, 2018, September 30, 2018, December 30, 2018, and March 31, 2019, respectively.



The consolidated condensed financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its wholly-owned subsidiaries and any partially owned subsidiaries that the Company has the ability to control. All intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated in consolidation.



Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements



In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02, “Leases (Topic 842)”, which sets out the principles for the recognition, measurement, presentation and disclosure of leases for both parties to a contract (i.e. lessees and lessors). This update requires lessees to apply a dual approach, classifying leases as either finance or operating leases based on the principle of whether or not the lease is effectively a financed purchase of the leased asset by the lessee. This classification will determine whether the lease expense is recognized based on an effective interest method or on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease. A lessee is also required to record a right-of-use asset and a lease liability for all leases with a term of greater than 12 months regardless of their classification. The new standard requires lessors to account for leases using an approach that is substantially equivalent to existing guidance for sales-type leases, direct financing leases and operating leases. Effective April 1, 2019, the Company adopted the new standard under the modified retrospective approach, which resulted in no adjustment to the April 1, 2019 beginning Retained Earnings. There are optional practical expedients and policy elections made available to simplify the transition to the new standard. The Company has elected the following: 



•to adopt the optional transition method defined within ASU 2018-11 and not restate comparative prior periods but instead recognize a cumulative effect adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings in the period of adoption;



•the package of three practical expedients addressing whether a contract contains a lease, lease classification and initial direct costs;



•to combine lease and non-lease components as a single component for all asset classes;



•to use a portfolio approach to determine the incremental borrowing rate; and 



•to apply the short-term lease exception to leases that, at the commencement date, has a lease term of 12 months or less and does not include an option to purchase the underlying asset that the lessee is reasonably certain to exercise. 



Upon adoption, the Company recorded Right-of-use (“ROU”) assets and lease liabilities of approximately $84,878 and $87,248, respectively. In addition, capital lease assets and liabilities are now classified as finance lease right-of-use assets and liabilities. The difference between the operating lease assets and lease liabilities primarily relates to unamortized lease incentives and deferred rent recorded in accordance with the previous lease guidance.



Apart from the aforementioned changes, the adoption of this standard did not have a significant impact on the Company's operating results, financial position or cash flows. The discount rates used to calculate the ROU assets and lease liabilities as of the effective date were based on the remaining lease terms as of the effective date. See Note 3, Leases for additional information.



In August 2017, the FASB issued ASU No. 2017-12, “Derivatives and Hedging (Topic 815)”: Targeted Improvements to Accounting for Hedging Activities, which amends and simplifies existing guidance in order to allow companies to more accurately present the economic effects of risk management activities in the financial statements. The guidance eliminates the requirement to separately measure and report hedge ineffectiveness and generally requires the entire change in the fair value of a hedging instrument to be presented in the same income

statement line as the hedged item. The Company adopted the standard effective April 1, 2019 and the adoption did not have any impact on the Company's operating results, financial position or cash flows.



In February 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-02, "Income Statement - Reporting Comprehensive Income (Topic 220)". The new standard will allow a reclassification from accumulated other comprehensive income to retained earnings for stranded tax effects resulting from the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (“Tax Act”). The amendments eliminate the stranded tax effects resulting from the Tax Act and will improve the usefulness of information reported to financial statements users. However, because the amendment only relates to the reclassification of the income tax effects of the Tax Act, the underlying guidance that requires that the effect of a change in tax laws or rates be included in income from continuing operations is not affected. The Company adopted this standard effective April 1, 2019 with the election not to reclassify $478 of stranded tax effects, primarily related to the Company's pension plans, from accumulated other comprehensive income (“AOCI”) to retained earnings, as the amount was not material. 



Accounting Pronouncements Issued But Not Adopted as of September 29, 2019



In June 2016, the FASB, issued ASU No. 2016-13, “Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326)”: Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments, which changes the recognition model for the impairment of financial instruments, including accounts receivable, loans and held-to-maturity debt securities, among others. The guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019, including interim periods within those fiscal years. In contrast to current guidance, which considers current information and events and utilizes a probable threshold, (an “incurred loss” model), ASU 2016–13 mandates an “expected loss” model. The expected loss model: (i) estimates the risk of loss even when risk is remote, (ii) estimates losses over the contractual life, (iii) considers past events, current conditions and reasonable supported forecasts and (iv) has no recognition threshold. The Company is currently assessing the potential impact that the adoption will have on its consolidated financial statements.



2. Revenue Recognition



The Company adopted ASU No. 2014-09, “Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606)” on April 1, 2018 using the modified retrospective transition method. There was no cumulative effect of adopting the standard at the date of initial application in retained earnings. 



The Company's revenues by reportable segments are presented in Note 17. 



Service revenues related to the work performed for the Company’s customers by its maintenance technicians generally represent a separate and distinct performance obligation. Control for these services passes to the customer as the services are performed. Service revenues for the second quarter of fiscal 2020 and fiscal 2019 amounted to $61,282 and $37,105, respectively. Service revenues for the six months of fiscal 2020 and fiscal 2019 amounted to $122,000 and $69,200, respectively.



A small portion of the Company's customer arrangements oblige the Company to create customized products for its customers that require the bundling of both products and services into a single performance obligation because the individual products and services that are required to fulfill the customer requirements do not meet the definition for a distinct performance obligation. These customized products generally have no alternative use to the Company and the terms and conditions of these arrangements give the Company the enforceable right to payment for performance completed to date, including a reasonable profit margin. For these arrangements, control transfers over time and the Company measures progress towards completion by selecting the input or output method that best depicts the transfer of control of the underlying goods and services to the customer for each respective arrangement. Methods used by the Company to measure progress toward completion include labor hours, costs incurred and units of production. Revenues recognized over time for the second quarter of fiscal 2020 and fiscal 2019 amounted to $33,595 and $16,491, respectively. Revenues recognized over time for the six months of fiscal 2020 and fiscal 2019 amounted to $75,090 and $34,895, respectively.



On September 29, 2019, the aggregate transaction price allocated to unsatisfied (or partially unsatisfied) performance obligations was approximately $65,975, of which, the Company estimates that approximately $48,576 will be recognized as revenue in fiscal 2020, $16,621 in fiscal 2021, $643 in fiscal 2022, $16 in fiscal 2023 and $119 in fiscal 2024. 



Any payments that are received from a customer in advance, prior to the satisfaction of a related performance obligation and billings in excess of revenue recognized, are deferred and treated as a contract liability. Advance payments and billings in excess of revenue recognized are classified as current or non-current based on the timing of when recognition of revenue is expected. As of September 29, 2019, the current and non-current portion of contract liabilities were $16,543 and $6,808, respectively. As of March 31, 2019, the current and non-current portion of contract liabilities were $15,162 and $6,360, respectively. Revenues recognized during the second quarter of fiscal 2020 and fiscal 2019, that were included in the contract liability at the beginning of the quarter, amounted to $3,690 and $611, respectively. Revenues recognized during the six months of fiscal 2020 and fiscal 2019, that were included in the contract liability at the beginning of the year, amounted to $8,157 and $2,597, respectively.



Amounts representing work completed and not billed to customers represent contract assets and were $46,319 and $38,778 as of September 29, 2019 and March 31, 2019, respectively. 



The Company uses historic customer product return data as a basis of estimation for customer returns and records the reduction of sales at the time revenue is recognized. At September 29, 2019, the right of return asset related to the value of inventory anticipated to be returned from customers was $2,667 and refund liability representing amounts estimated to be refunded to customers was $5,213.

3. Leases



The Company leases manufacturing facilities, distribution centers, office space, vehicles and other equipment under non-cancellable leases with initial terms typically ranging from 1 to 17 years. At contract inception, the Company reviews the terms of the arrangement to determine if the contract is or contains a lease. Guidance in Topic 842 is used to evaluate whether the contract has an identified asset; if the Company has the right to obtain substantially all economic benefits from the asset; and if it has the right to direct the use of the underlying asset. When determining if a contract has an identified asset, the Company considers both explicit and implicit assets, and whether the supplier has the right to substitute the asset. When determining if the Company has the right to obtain substantially all economic benefits from the asset, the Company considers the primary outputs of the identified asset throughout the period of use and determines if it receives greater than 90% of those benefits. When determining if it has the right to direct the use of an underlying asset, the Company considers if it has the right to direct how and for what purpose the asset is used throughout the period of use and if it controls the decision-making rights over the asset. 



Lease terms may include options to extend or terminate the lease. The Company exercises its judgment to determine the term of those leases when extension or termination options are present and include such options in the calculation of the lease term when it is reasonably certain that the Company will exercise those options. 



The Company has elected to include both lease and non-lease components in the determination of lease payments for all asset classes. Payments made to a lessor for items such as taxes, insurance, common area maintenance, or other costs commonly referred to as executory costs, are also included in lease payments if they are fixed. The fixed portion of these payments are included in the calculation of the lease liability, while any variable portion would be recognized as variable lease expenses, when incurred. Variable payments made to third parties for these, or similar costs, such as utilities, are not included in the calculation of lease payments.



Both finance and operating leases are reflected as liabilities on the commencement date of the lease based on the present value of the lease payments to be made over the lease term. As most of the leases do not provide an implicit rate, the Company has exercised judgment in electing the incremental borrowing rate based on the information available when the lease commences to determine the present value of future payments. Right-of-use assets are valued at the initial measurement of the lease liability, plus any initial direct costs or rent prepayments and reduced by any lease incentives and any deferred lease payments. 



Operating lease expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term. Finance lease expense includes depreciation, which is recognized on a straight-line basis over the expected life of the leased asset, and interest expense, which is recognized following an effective interest rate method.



Short term leases with an initial term of 12 months or less are not presented on the balance sheet and expense is recognized as incurred.



The following table presents lease assets and liabilities and their balance sheet classification:

4. Acquisition



On December 7, 2018, the Company completed the acquisition of all of the issued and outstanding common stock of Alpha Technologies Services, Inc. (“ATS”) and Alpha Technologies Ltd. (“ATL”), resulting in ATS and ATL becoming wholly-owned subsidiaries of the Company (the “share purchase”). Additionally, the Company acquired substantially all of the assets of Alpha Technologies Inc. and certain assets of Altair Advanced Industries, Inc. and other affiliates of ATS and ATL (all such sellers, together with ATS and ATL, “Alpha”), in each case in accordance with the terms and conditions of certain restructuring agreements (collectively, the “asset acquisition” and together with the share purchase, the “acquisition”). Based in Bellingham, Washington, Alpha is a global industry leader in comprehensive commercial-grade energy solutions for broadband, telecom, renewable, industrial and traffic customers around the world. The initial purchase consideration for the acquisition was $750,000, of which $650,000 was paid in cash and the balance was settled by issuing 1,177,630 shares of EnerSys common stock. These shares were issued out of the Company's treasury stock and were valued at $84.92 per share, which was based on the thirty-day volume weighted average stock price of the Company’s common stock at closing, in accordance with the purchase agreement. The 1,177,630 shares had a closing date fair value of $93,268, based upon the December 7, 2018 closing date spot rate of $79.20. The total purchase consideration, consisting of cash paid of $650,000, shares valued at $93,268 and an adjustment for working capital (due post - closing from seller of $766), was $742,502. The Company funded the cash portion of the acquisition with borrowings from the Amended Credit Facility as defined in Note 12. See Note 12 for additional information. 



The acquisition expands the Company's footprint in broadband and telecom markets. The goodwill recognized in connection with this transaction reflects the benefits the Company expects to realize from being able to provide a one-stop, fully integrated power solutions offering to its customers, as well as the benefit of cost synergies from alignment of the Alpha group within its own organizational structure.



The results of operations of Alpha have been included in the Company’s Americas segment. 



The following table represents the fair values assigned to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed and resulting goodwill. The amounts recognized will be finalized as the information necessary to complete the analysis is obtained, but no later than one year from the acquisition date (“the measurement period”).



The acquired assets and assumed liabilities include the following:



[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]



12

The following table summarizes the estimated fair value of Alpha's identifiable intangible assets and the initial assessment of their respective estimated lives:



[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]



The Company recorded the acquisition using the acquisition method of accounting and recognized the assets acquired and liabilities assumed at their fair values as of the date of the acquisition. The excess of the purchase price over the net tangible and intangible assets is recorded to goodwill. Estimated goodwill deductible for tax purposes is $42,262. The measurement of the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed is substantially complete. The Company continues to gather necessary information to finalize the accounting for income taxes associated with the acquisition, and as such the Company could record additional adjustments to the provisional amount recognized as this additional information is obtained.



The following unaudited summary information is presented on a consolidated pro forma basis as if the acquisition had occurred on April 1, 2017:



[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]



The pro forma amounts include additional interest expense on the debt issued to finance the purchases, amortization and depreciation expense based on the estimated fair value and useful lives of intangible assets and plant assets, and related tax effects. The pro forma results are not necessarily indicative of the combined results had the Alpha acquisition been completed on April 1, 2017, nor are they indicative of future combined results. The remeasurement of Alpha's deferred taxes due to the Tax Act are being excluded in arriving at these pro forma results.



Other Intangible Assets



Information regarding the Company’s other intangible assets are as follows:



[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]



The Company’s amortization expense related to finite-lived intangible assets was $7,309 and $14,625, for the second quarter and six months of fiscal 2020, respectively, compared to$2,046 and $4,115 for the second quarter and six months of fiscal 2019, respectively. The expected amortization expense based on the finite-lived intangible assets as of September 29, 2019, is $14,866 for the remainder of fiscal 2020, $29,237 in fiscal 2021, $28,993 in fiscal 2022, $27,694 in fiscal 2023 and $24,287 in fiscal 2024.



13

Contra Equity - Indemnification Receivable



In connection with the Alpha acquisition in fiscal 2019, the Company recorded an unrecognized tax benefit and related indemnification receivable of $7,840. The indemnification receivable represents the Seller’s obligation to indemnify the Company for the outcome of potential contingent liabilities, including those associated with uncertain tax positions. Due to the expiration of certain statutes of limitations during the second quarter of fiscal 2020, a portion of the unrecognized tax benefit was recognized, resulting in a reduction in the indemnification receivable.

6. Fair Value of Financial Instruments



Recurring Fair Value Measurements



The following tables represent the financial assets and (liabilities) measured at fair value on a recurring basis as of September 29, 2019 and March 31, 2019, and the basis for that measurement:



[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]



[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]



The fair values of lead forward contracts are calculated using observable prices for lead as quoted on the London Metal Exchange (“LME”) and, therefore, were classified as Level 2 within the fair value hierarchy, as described in Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies to the Company's consolidated financial statements included in its 2019 Annual Report.



The fair values for foreign currency forward contracts are based upon current quoted market prices and are classified as Level 2 based on the nature of the underlying market in which these derivatives are traded.



Financial Instruments



The fair values of the Company’s cash and cash equivalents approximate carrying value due to their short maturities. 



The fair value of the Company’s short-term debt and borrowings under the Amended Credit Facility (as defined in Note 12), approximate their respective carrying value, as they are variable rate debt and the terms are comparable to market terms as of the balance sheet dates and are classified as Level 2.



14

The Company's 5.00% Senior Notes due 2023 (the “Notes”), with an original face value of $300,000, were issued in April 2015. The fair value of the Notes represent the trading values based upon quoted market prices and are classified as Level 2. The Notes were trading at approximately 102% and 99% of face value on September 29, 2019 and March 31, 2019, respectively. 



The carrying amounts and estimated fair values of the Company’s derivatives and Notes at September 29, 2019 and March 31, 2019 were as follows:



[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]



[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED][DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]



7. Derivative Financial Instruments



The Company utilizes derivative instruments to reduce its exposure to fluctuations in commodity prices and foreign exchange rates under established procedures and controls. The Company does not enter into derivative contracts for speculative purposes. The Company’s agreements are with creditworthy financial institutions and the Company anticipates performance by counterparties to these contracts and therefore no material loss is expected.



Derivatives in Cash Flow Hedging Relationships



Lead Forward Contracts



The Company enters into lead forward contracts to fix the price for a portion of its lead purchases. Management considers the lead forward contracts to be effective against changes in the cash flows of the underlying lead purchases. The vast majority of such contracts are for a period not extending beyond one year. At September 29, 2019 and March 31, 2019, the Company has hedged the price to purchase approximately 54.0 million pounds and 42.0 million pounds of lead, respectively, for a total purchase price of $49,938 and $39,218, respectively.



Foreign Currency Forward Contracts



The Company uses foreign currency forward contracts and options to hedge a portion of the Company’s foreign currency exposures for lead, as well as other foreign currency exposures so that gains and losses on these contracts offset changes in the underlying foreign currency denominated exposures. The vast majority of such contracts are for a period not extending beyond one year. As of September 29, 2019 and March 31, 2019, the Company had entered into a total of $45,350 and $42,318, respectively, of such contracts.



In the coming twelve months, the Company anticipates that $1,602 of pretax gain relating to lead and foreign currency forward contracts will be reclassified from AOCI as part of cost of goods sold. This amount represents the current net unrealized impact of hedging lead and foreign exchange rates, which will change as market rates change in the future, and will ultimately be realized in the Consolidated Condensed Statements of Income as an offset to the corresponding actual changes in lead costs to be realized in connection with the variable lead cost and foreign exchange rates being hedged.



Derivatives not Designated in Hedging Relationships



Foreign Currency Forward Contracts



The Company also enters into foreign currency forward contracts to economically hedge foreign currency fluctuations on intercompany loans and foreign currency denominated receivables and payables. These are not designated as hedging instruments and changes in fair value of these instruments are recorded directly in the Consolidated Condensed Statements of Income. As of September 29, 2019 and March 31, 2019, the notional amount of these contracts was $23,676 and $22,201, respectively.

8. Income Taxes



The Company’s income tax provision consists of federal, state and foreign income taxes. The tax provision for the second quarter of fiscal 2020 and 2019 was based on the estimated effective tax rates applicable for the full years ending March 31, 2020 and March 31, 2019, respectively, after giving effect to items specifically related to the interim periods. The Company’s effective income tax rate with respect to any period may be volatile based on the mix of income in the tax jurisdictions in which the Company operates, change in tax laws and the amount of the Company's consolidated income before taxes. 



On May 19, 2019, a public referendum held in Switzerland approved the Federal Act on Tax Reform and AHV (Old-Age and Survivors Insurance) Financing (TRAF) as adopted by the Swiss Federal Parliament on September 28, 2018. The Swiss tax reform measures are effective January 1, 2020. Certain provisions of the TRAF were enacted during the current quarter. Significant changes in the tax reform include the abolishment of preferential tax regimes for holding companies, domicile companies and mixed companies at the cantonal level. The transitional provisions of the TRAF allow companies to elect tax basis adjustments to fair value, which is used for tax depreciation and amortization purposes resulting in a deduction over the transitional period. The Company recorded a deferred tax asset of $21,000 during the second quarter of fiscal 2020, related to the amortizable goodwill, subject to final negotiations with the Swiss federal and cantonal tax authority.



The consolidated effective income tax rates for the second quarter of fiscal 2020 and 2019 were (29.5)% and 18.6%, respectively and for the six months of fiscal 2020 and 2019 were (4.0)% and 19.1%, respectively. The rate decrease in the second quarter and six months of fiscal 2020 compared to the comparable prior year periods is primarily due to Swiss tax reform and changes in the mix of earnings among tax jurisdictions.



Foreign income as a percentage of worldwide income is estimated to be 72% for fiscal 2020 compared to 68% for fiscal 2019. The foreign effective income tax rates for the six months of fiscal 2020 and 2019 were (2.4)% and 11.1%, respectively. The rate decrease compared to the prior year period is primarily due to Swiss tax reform and changes in the mix of earnings among tax jurisdictions. Income from the Company's Swiss subsidiary comprised a substantial portion of the Company's overall foreign mix of income and was taxed at an effective income tax rate of approximately 6% in both the current and prior year quarter of fiscal 2020 and fiscal 2019.



9. Warranty



The Company provides for estimated product warranty expenses when the related products are sold, with related liabilities included within accrued expenses and other liabilities. As warranty estimates are forecasts that are based on the best available information, primarily historical claims experience, costs of claims may ultimately differ from amounts provided. An analysis of changes in the liability for product warranties is as follows:

10. Commitments, Contingencies and Litigation



Litigation and Other Legal Matters



In the ordinary course of business, the Company and its subsidiaries are routinely defendants in or parties to pending and threatened legal actions and proceedings, including actions brought on behalf of various classes of claimants. These actions and proceedings are generally based on alleged violations of environmental, anticompetition, employment, contract and other laws. In some of these actions and proceedings, claims for substantial monetary damages are asserted against the Company and its subsidiaries. In the ordinary course of business, the Company and its subsidiaries are also subject to regulatory and governmental examinations, information gathering requests, inquiries, investigations, and threatened legal actions and proceedings. In connection with formal and informal inquiries by federal, state, local and foreign agencies, the Company and its subsidiaries receive numerous requests, subpoenas and orders for documents, testimony and information in connection with various aspects of their activities.



European Competition Investigations 



Certain of the Company’s European subsidiaries had received subpoenas and requests for documents and, in some cases, interviews from, and have had on-site inspections conducted by, the competition authorities of Belgium, Germany and the Netherlands relating to conduct and anticompetitive practices of certain industrial battery participants. 



The Company settled the Belgian regulatory proceeding in February 2016 by acknowledging certain anticompetitive practices and conduct and agreeing to pay a fine of $1,962, which was paid in March 2016. During the second quarter of fiscal 2019, the Company also paid $1,272 towards certain aspects related to this matter, which are under appeal. As of September 29, 2019 and March 31, 2019, the Company did not have a reserve balance for these matters. 



In June 2017, the Company settled a portion of its previously disclosed proceeding involving the German competition authority relating to conduct involving the Company's motive power battery business and agreed to pay a fine of $14,811, which was paid in July 2017. As of September 29, 2019 and March 31, 2019, the Company did not have a reserve balance relating to this matter. Also, in March 2019, the Company settled the remaining portion of its previously disclosed proceeding involving the German competition authority relating to conduct involving the Company’s reserve power battery business and agreed to pay a fine of $7,258, which was paid in April 2019. As of September 29, 2019 and March 31, 2019, the Company had a reserve balance of $0 and $7,258, respectively.



The foregoing estimate of losses is based upon currently available information for these proceedings. However, the precise scope, timing and time period at issue, as well as the final outcome of the investigations or customer claims, remain uncertain. Accordingly, the Company’s estimate may change from time to time, and actual losses could vary.



Environmental Issues



As a result of its operations, the Company is subject to various federal, state, and local, as well as international environmental laws and regulations and is exposed to the costs and risks of registering, handling, processing, storing, transporting, and disposing of hazardous substances, especially lead and acid.

2017 Credit Facility and Subsequent Amendment



In fiscal 2018, the Company entered into a credit facility (the “2017 Credit Facility”). The 2017 Credit Facility scheduled to mature on September 30, 2022, comprised a $600,000 senior secured revolving credit facility (“2017 Revolver”) and a $150,000 senior secured term loan (“2017 Term Loan”). The Company utilized the borrowings from the 2017 Credit Facility to repay its pre-existing credit facility. 



In fiscal 2019, the Company amended the 2017 Credit Facility (as amended, the “Amended Credit Facility”) to fund the Alpha acquisition. The Amended Credit Facility consists of $449,105 senior secured term loans (the “Amended 2017 Term Loan”), including a CAD 133,050 ($99,105) term loan and a $700,000 senior secured revolving credit facility (the “Amended 2017 Revolver”). The amendment resulted in an increase of the 2017 Term Loan and the 2017 Revolver by $299,105 and $100,000, respectively.



As of September 29, 2019, the Company had $389,000 outstanding under the Amended 2017 Revolver and $433,625 under the Amended 2017 Term Loan. 



Subsequent to the amendment, the quarterly installments payable on the Amended 2017 Term Loan are $5,645 beginning December 31, 2018, $8,468 beginning December 31, 2019 and $11,290 beginning December 31, 2020 with a final payment of $320,000 on September 30, 2022. The Amended Credit Facility may be increased by an aggregate amount of $325,000 in revolving commitments and / or one or more new tranches of term loans, under certain conditions. Both the Amended 2017 Revolver and the Amended 2017 Term Loan bear interest, at the Company's option, at a rate per annum equal to either (i) the London Interbank Offered Rate (“LIBOR”) or Canadian Dollar Offered Rate (“CDOR”) plus (i) LIBOR plus between 1.25% and 2.00% (currently 1.50% and based on the Company's consolidated net leverage ratio) or (ii) the U.S. Dollar Base Rate (which equals, for any day a fluctuating rate per annum equal to the highest of (a) the Federal Funds Effective Rate plus 0.50%, (b) Bank of America “Prime Rate” and (c) the Eurocurrency Base Rate plus 1%; provided that, if the Base Rate shall be less than zero, such rate shall be deemed zero) (iii) the CDOR Base Rate equal to the higher of (a) Bank of America “Prime Rate” and (b) average 30-day CDOR rate plus 0.50%. Obligations under the Amended Credit Facility are secured by substantially all of the Company’s existing and future acquired assets, including substantially all of the capital stock of the Company’s United States subsidiaries that are guarantors under the Amended Credit Facility and up to 65% of the capital stock of certain of the Company’s foreign subsidiaries that are owned by the Company’s United States subsidiaries.

Effective December 7, 2018 through December 27, 2019, the maximum leverage ratio has been increased to 4.00x.
