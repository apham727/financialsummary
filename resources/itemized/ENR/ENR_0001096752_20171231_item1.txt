Item 1A.
Risk Factors.
Refer to Item 1A.
Risk Factors in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for a detailed discussion of risk factors that could materially adversely affect our business, our operating results or our financial condition.
The risk factor included below is a revision to one included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Legislative changes in applicable tax laws, policies and regulations or unfavorable resolution of tax matters may result in additional tax liabilities, which could adversely impact our cash flows and results of operations.
Significant estimation and judgment is required in determining our provisions for taxes in the U.S. and jurisdictions outside the U.S.
In the ordinary course of our business, there are transactions and calculations in which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain.
We are regularly under audit by tax authorities, and although we believe our tax positions are defensible and our tax provision estimates are reasonable, the final outcome of tax audits and related litigation could be materially different than that reflected in our income tax provisions and accruals.
The unfavorable resolution of any audits or litigation could have an adverse impact on future operating results and our financial condition.
More aggressive and assertive tax collection policies, particularly in jurisdictions outside the U.S., may increase the costs of resolving tax issues and enhance the likelihood that we will have increased tax liabilities going forward.
