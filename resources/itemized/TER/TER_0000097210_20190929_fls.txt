Overview  


   • 

semiconductor test (“Semiconductor Test”) systems;   

   • 

industrial automation (“Industrial Automation”) products;   

   • 


   • 

wireless test (“Wireless Test”) systems.
We have a customer base which includes integrated device manufacturers (“IDMs”), outsourced semiconductor assembly and test providers (“OSATs”), original equipment manufacturers (“OEMs”), wafer foundries, fabless companies that design, but contract with others for the manufacture of integrated circuits (“ICs”), developers of wireless devices and consumer electronics, manufacturers of circuit boards, automotive suppliers, wireless product manufacturers, storage device manufacturers, aerospace and military contractors, and distributors that sell collaborative robots, autonomous mobile robots and wireless test systems.
The sales of our products and services are dependent, to a large degree, on these customers who are subject to cyclical trends in the demand for their products.
These cyclical periods have had, and will continue to have, a significant effect on our business because our customers often delay or accelerate purchases in reaction to changes in their businesses and to demand fluctuations in the semiconductor, electronics and industrial automation industries.
