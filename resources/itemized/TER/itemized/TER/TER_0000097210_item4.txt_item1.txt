Item 1A: Risk Factors  



Our business may suffer if we are impacted by the implementation of tariffs on our products.
Our business operations are international and may be disrupted by the implementation of tariffs on our products.
In March 2018, the United States Trade Representative announced proposed tariffs on a list of products manufactured in China.
While there is uncertainty as to whether the proposed tariffs will be implemented and, if they are implemented, as to the products that will be covered by the tariffs, the tariffs if implemented could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.
In addition, tariffs implemented by China could disrupt our business operations or impact the sale of our products and, therefore, have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results or operations.
