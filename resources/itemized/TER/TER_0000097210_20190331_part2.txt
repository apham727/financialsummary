Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds
In January 2018, our Board of Directors cancelled the December 2016 stock repurchase program and authorized a new stock repurchase program for up to $1.5 billion of common stock.
We intend to repurchase $500 million in 2019.
During the three months ended March 31, 2019, we repurchased 4.5 million shares of common stock for $156.5 million at an average price of $35.12 per share.
During the three months ended April 1, 2018, we repurchased 2.9 million shares of common stock for $134.3 million at an average price of $45.69 per share.
The cumulative repurchases under the $1.5 billion stock repurchase program as of March 31, 2019 totaled 26.1 million shares of common stock for $979.9 million at an average price per share of $37.55.
Includes three hundred ninety one thousand shares at an average price of $36.60 withheld from employees for the payment of taxes.
We satisfy U.S. federal and state minimum withholding tax obligations due upon the vesting and the conversion of restricted stock units into shares of our common stock, by automatically withholding from the shares being issued, a number of shares with an aggregate fair market value on the date of such vesting and conversion that would satisfy the minimum withholding amount due.
