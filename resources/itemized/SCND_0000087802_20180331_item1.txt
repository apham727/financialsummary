  NOTES TO UNAUDITED CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 



   General:    The accompanying unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial statements are prepared pursuant to the Securities and Exchange Commission’s rules and regulations for reporting on Form 10-Q. Accordingly, certain information and footnotes required by accounting principles generally accepted in the United States for complete financial statements are not included herein. The Company believes all adjustments necessary for a fair presentation of these interim statements have been included and that they are of a normal and recurring nature. These interim statements should be read in conjunction with the Company’s financial statements and notes thereto, included in its Annual Report on Form 10-K, for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2017. The results for the three months and nine months ended March 31, 2018, are not necessarily an indication of the results for the full fiscal year ending June 30, 2018.    



  1. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

All material intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated. 



  Recent Accounting Pronouncements 



 In January 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued ASU No. 2016-01, “Financial Instruments - Overall (Subtopic 825-10): Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities”. The update addresses certain aspects of recognition, measurement, presentation and disclosure of financial instruments. For public business entities, the amendments in this update are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted only for certain portions of the ASU related to financial liabilities. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of the provisions of this new standard on the consolidated financial statements. 



 In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02, “Leases” (Topic 842). The FASB issued this update to increase transparency and comparability among organizations by recognizing lease assets and lease liabilities on the balance sheet and disclosing key information about leasing arrangements. The updated guidance is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption of the update is permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the effect of the new standard. 



  In April 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-10, “Revenue from Contracts with Customers: Identifying Performance Obligations and Licensing (Topic 606)”. In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-08, “Revenue from Contracts with Customers: Principal versus Agent Considerations (Reporting Revenue Gross verses Net) (Topic 606)”. These amendments provide additional clarification and implementation guidance on the previously issued ASU 2014-09, “Revenue from Contracts with Customers”. The amendments in ASU 2016-10 provide clarifying guidance on materiality of performance obligations; evaluating distinct performance obligations; treatment of shipping and handling costs; and determining whether an entity’s promise to grant a license provides a customer with either a right to use an entity’s intellectual property or a right to access an entity’s intellectual property. The amendments in ASU 2016-08 clarify how an entity should identify the specified good or service for the principal versus agent evaluation and how it should apply the control principle to certain types of arrangements. The adoption of ASU 2016-10 and ASU 2016-08 is to coincide with an entity’s adoption of ASU 2014-09. The Company has performed a review of the requirements of the new guidance and has identified which of its revenue streams will be within the scope of ASC 606. The Company has applied the five-step model of the new standard to a selection of contracts within each of its revenue streams and has compared the results to its current accounting practices. Based on this analysis, the Company does not currently expect a material impact on the Company’s consolidated financial statements. The Company is expecting to utilize the modified retrospective transition method of adoption. The Company is continuing to work through the remaining steps of the adoption plan to facilitate adoption effective July 1, 2018. As part of this, the Company is assessing changes that might be necessary to information technology systems, processes, and internal controls to capture new data and address changes in financial reporting. The Company will be revising its revenue recognition accounting policy and expanding revenue disclosures to reflect the requirements of ASC 606, which include disclosures related to the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from contracts with customers. Additionally, qualitative and quantitative disclosures are required about customer contracts, significant judgements and assets recognized from the costs to obtain or fulfill a contract. 



 In May 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-12, “Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Narrow-Scope Improvements and Practical Expedients”, which narrowly amended the revenue recognition guidance regarding collectability, noncash consideration, presentation of sales tax and transition and is effective during the same period as ASU 2014-09.The Company is currently evaluating the effect of the standard. 



 In August 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-15, “Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments”. This update provides guidance on how to record eight specific cash flow issues. This update is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, and interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted and a retrospective transition method to each period should be presented. The Company is currently evaluating the effect of this update on its consolidated financial statements. 



 In November 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-18, “Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230)”, requiring that the statement of cash flows explain the change in the total cash, cash equivalents, and amounts generally described as restricted cash or restricted cash equivalents. This guidance is effective for fiscal years, and interim reporting periods therein, beginning after December 15, 2017 with early adoption permitted. The provisions of this guidance are to be applied using a retrospective approach which requires application of the guidance for all periods presented. The adoption of this ASU had no impact on the Company's Condensed Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.

  Adopted Accounting Pronoucements 



 In November 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-17, "Income Taxes: Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes" (“ASU 2015-17") which was effective for fiscal years beginning December 15, 2016 (fiscal 2018 for the Company). ASU 2015-17 required that deferred tax assets and liabilities be net and classified as noncurrent on the balance sheet rather than presenting deferred taxes into current and noncurrent amounts. The Company adopted ASU 2015-07 effective for the first fiscal quarter of the year ending June 30, 2018. The Company applied the new guidance on a retrospective basis, resulting in a reclassification of current deferred tax assets totaling $129,000 against long term deferred tax assets in the Company's Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet as of June 30, 2017. The adoption of this ASU had no impact on the Company’s Condensed Consolidated Statement of Operations. 



 On December 22, 2017, the Staff of the Securities and Exchange Commission issued Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 118, “Income Tax Accounting Implications of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, or SAB 118,” which addresses situations where the accounting under the FASB, Accounting Standards Codification No. 740, Income Taxes, or ASC 740 is incomplete for certain income tax effects of Public Law No. 115-97, commonly referred to as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, or the 2017 Tax Act, by the time an entity issues its financial statements for the fiscal period that includes the date the 2017 Tax Act was enacted. 



 Under ASC 740, entities are required to adjust current and deferred tax assets and liabilities for the effects of changes in tax laws or rates at their date of enactment. However, pursuant to SAB 118, if an entity does not have the necessary information available, prepared, or analyzed for certain income tax effects of the 2017 Tax Act at the time an entity’s financial statements are issued, an entity shall apply ASC 740 based on the provisions of the tax laws that were in effect immediately prior to the enactment of the 2017 Tax Act. If the accounting for certain income tax effects of the 2017 Tax Act is incomplete, but an entity can determine a reasonable estimate for those effects, an entity can record provisional amounts during a measurement period, which ends on the earlier of when an entity has obtained, prepared, and analyzed the information necessary to complete the accounting requirements of ASC 740 and December 22, 2017. 



 The 2017 Tax Act includes significant changes to the U.S. income tax system. The 2017 Tax Act contains numerous provisions impacting the Company, the most significant of which reduces the Federal corporate statutory rate from 35% to 21%. The Company is a fiscal-year end taxpayer and is required to use a blended statutory federal tax rate, inclusive of the Federal rate change enacted on December 22, 2017 to compute its effective rate for the three and six months ended December 31, 2017. The various provisions under the 2017 Tax Act most relevant to the Company have been considered in the preparation of the financial statements as of March 31, 2018. However, the Company had not completed its accounting for the tax effects of the enactment of 2017 Tax act. The Company’s provision for income taxes for the three and nine months ended March 31, 2018 is based on reasonable estimates of the effects of its implementation and existing deferred tax balances. The Company estimates it will record a one-time non-cash charge of approximately $30,000 for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2018 due to an estimated reduction in deferred tax assets as a result of the reduction in the Federal tax rate. We expect to complete our accounting during the one year measurement period from the enactment date. 



  Reclassification 



  Accounts receivable of $245,400 was reclassified from current to long-term assets on the balance sheet as of June 30, 2017 to conform to the current period's presentation.

  2. Segment Information and Concentrations 



 The Company views its operations as three segments: the manufacture and marketing of standard benchtop laboratory equipment for research in university, hospital and industrial laboratories sold primarily through laboratory equipment distributors and laboratory and pharmacy balances and scales (“Benchtop Laboratory Equipment Operations”), the manufacture and marketing of custom-made catalyst research instruments for universities, government laboratories, and chemical and petrochemical companies sold on a direct basis (“Catalyst Research Instruments Operations”) and the design and marketing of bioprocessing systems and products and related royalty income (“Bioprocessing Systems”). 



 Segment information is reported as follows: 



 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]  



 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]  



 Approximately 53% and 54% of net benchtop laboratory equipment sales (39% and 40% of total revenues) for the three month periods ended March 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively, were derived from the Company’s main product, the Vortex-Genie 2 mixer, excluding accessories. 



 Approximately 21% of total benchtop laboratory equipment sales (16% of total revenues) were derived from the Torbal Scales Division for both the three months ended March 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively.



 For the three months ended March 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively, two customers accounted in the aggregate for approximately 17% and 15% of net sales of the Benchtop Laboratory Equipment Operations (13% and 11% of the Company’s total revenues). 



 Sales of catalyst research instruments generally comprise a few very large orders averaging approximately $50,000 per order to a limited number of customers, who differ from order to order. Sales to two and two different customers during the three months ended March 31, 2018 and 2017, accounted for approximately 89% and 76% of the Catalyst Research Instrument Operations’ revenues and 5% and 14% of the Company’s total revenues, respectively.

 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]  



 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]  



 Approximately 51% and 53% of net benchtop laboratory equipment sales (43% and 37% of total revenues) for the nine month periods ended March 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively, were derived from the Company’s main product, the Vortex-Genie 2 mixer, excluding accessories. 



 Approximately 22% and 23% of total benchtop laboratory equipment sales (19% and 16% of total revenues) were derived from the Torbal Scales Division for the nine months ended March 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. For the nine months ended March 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively, two customers accounted in the aggregate for approximately 16% of net sales of the Benchtop Laboratory Equipment Operations (14% and 11% of the Company’s total revenues). 



 Sales of catalyst research instruments generally comprise a few very large orders averaging approximately $50,000 per order to a limited number of customers, who differ from order to order. Sales to three and four customers during the nine months ended March 31, 2018 and 2017, accounted for approximately 79% and 92% of the Catalyst Research Instrument Operations’ revenues and 4% and 24% of the Company’s total revenues, respectively. 



  3. Fair Value of Financial Instruments 



 The FASB defines the fair value of financial instruments as the amount that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. Fair value measurements do not include transaction costs. 



 The accounting guidance also expands the disclosure requirements around fair value and establishes a fair value hierarchy for valuation inputs. The hierarchy prioritizes the inputs into three levels based on the extent to which inputs used in measuring fair value are observable in the market. Each fair value measurement is reported in one of the three levels, which is determined by the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety. These levels are described below: 



 Level 1 - Inputs that are based upon unadjusted quoted prices for identical instruments traded in active markets. 



 Level 2 - Quoted prices in markets that are not considered to be active or financial instruments for which all significant inputs are observable, either directly or indirectly. 



 Level 3 - Prices or valuation that require inputs that are both significant to the fair value measurement and unobservable. 



 8  



 In valuing assets and liabilities, the Company is required to maximize the use of quoted market prices and minimize the use of unobservable inputs. The Company calculated the fair value of its Level 1 and 2 instruments based on the exchange traded price of similar or identical instruments where available or based on other observable instruments. These calculations take into consideration the credit risk of both the Company and its counterparties. The Company has not changed its valuation techniques in measuring the fair value of any financial assets and liabilities during the period. 



 The fair value of the contingent consideration obligations are based on a probability weighted approach derived from the estimates of earn-out criteria and the probability assessment with respect to the likelihood of achieving those criteria. The measurement is based on significant inputs that are not observable in the market, therefore, the Company classifies this liability as Level 3 in the following tables. 



 The following tables set forth by level within the fair value hierarchy the Company’s financial assets that were accounted for at fair value on a recurring basis at March 31, 2018 and June 30, 2017 according to the valuation techniques the Company used to determine their fair values:

 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]  



  4. Inventories 



 Inventories are valued at the lower of cost (determined on a first-in, first-out basis) or net realizable value, and have been reduced by an allowance for excess and obsolete inventories. The estimate is based on managements review of inventories on hand compared to estimated future usage and sales. Cost of work-in-process and finished goods inventories include material, labor, and manufacturing overhead. 



 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]  



  5. Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets 



 Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the net assets acquired in connection with the Company’s acquisitions. Goodwill amounted to $705,300 at March 31, 2018 and June 30, 2017, all of which is expected to be deductible for tax purposes. 



 The components of other intangible assets are as follows:

 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]  



 Total amortization expense was $61,200 and $69,900 for the three months ended March 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively and $183,400 and $224,000 for the nine months ended March 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. As of March 31, 2018, estimated future amortization expense related to intangible assets is $60,200 for the remainder of the fiscal year ending June 30, 2018, $185,800 for fiscal 2019, $65,400 for fiscal 2020, $48,000 for fiscal 2021, $27,000 for fiscal 2022, and $12,800 thereafter. 



  6. Earnings (Loss) Per Common Share 



 Earnings (loss) per common share data was computed as follows: 



 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]  



 Approximately 82,000 and 33,500 shares of the Company's common stock issuable upon the exercise of outstanding options were excluded from the calculation of diluted earnings per common share for the three and nine month periods ended March 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively, because the effect would be anti-dilutive.
