Overview  



We are a leading global supplier of automation equipment for test and industrial applications. We design, develop, manufacture and sell automatic test systems used to test semiconductors, wireless products, data storage    



36  



Table of Contents 



and complex electronics systems in the consumer electronics, wireless, automotive, industrial, computing, communications, and aerospace and defense industries. Our industrial automation products include collaborative robotic arms, autonomous mobile robots and advanced robotic control software used by global manufacturing and light industrial customers to improve quality, increase manufacturing and material handling efficiency and decrease manufacturing costs. Our automatic test equipment and industrial automation products and services include:  



   • 



semiconductor test (“Semiconductor Test”) systems;   



   • 



industrial automation (“Industrial Automation”) products;   



   • 



defense/aerospace (“Defense/Aerospace”) test instrumentation and systems, storage test (“Storage Test”) systems, and circuit-board test and inspection (“Production Board Test”) systems (collectively these products represent “System Test”); and   



   • 



wireless test (“Wireless Test”) systems.   



We have a customer base which includes integrated device manufacturers (“IDMs”), outsourced semiconductor assembly and test providers (“OSATs”), original equipment manufacturers (“OEMs”), wafer foundries, fabless companies that design, but contract with others for the manufacture of integrated circuits (“ICs”), developers of wireless devices and consumer electronics, manufacturers of circuit boards, automotive suppliers, wireless product manufacturers, storage device manufacturers, aerospace and military contractors, and distributors that sell collaborative robots, autonomous mobile robots and wireless test systems.  



The market for our test products is concentrated with a limited number of significant customers accounting for a substantial portion of the purchases of test equipment. Two customers drive significant demand for our products both through direct sales and sales to the customer’s supply partners. We expect that sales of our test products will continue to be concentrated with a limited number of significant customers for the foreseeable future.  



The sales of our products and services are dependent, to a large degree, on customers who are subject to cyclical trends in the demand for their products. These cyclical periods have had, and will continue to have, a significant effect on our business because our customers often delay or accelerate purchases in reaction to changes in their businesses and to demand fluctuations in the semiconductor, electronics and industrial automation industries. Historically, these demand fluctuations have resulted in significant variations in our results of operations. In the first half of 2019, the revenue growth of our industrial automation business was below our forecast. We expect 2019 full year revenue growth of our industrial automation business to be under the low end of our long term range of 30% to 40%.  



On February 26, 2018, we acquired Energid Technologies Corporation (“Energid”) for a total purchase price of approximately $27.6 million. Energid’s technology enables and simplifies the programming of complex robotic motions used in a wide variety of end markets, ranging from heavy industry to healthcare, utilizing both traditional robots and collaborative robots.  



On April 25, 2018, we acquired Mobile Industrial Robots ApS (“MiR”), a Danish limited liability company. MiR is the leading maker of collaborative autonomous mobile robots for industrial applications. The total purchase price was approximately $197.8 million, which included cash paid of approximately $145.2 million and $52.6 million in fair value of contingent consideration payable upon achievement of certain thresholds and targets for revenue and earnings before interest and taxes through 2020. Contingent consideration for 2018 was $30.8 million and was paid in March 2019. The maximum payment for the remaining MiR contingent consideration that could be paid is $84.1 million.  



MiR and Energid are included in our Industrial Automation segment.  



37  



Table of Contents 



On January 30, 2019, we acquired all of the issued and outstanding shares of Lemsys SA (“Lemsys”) for a total purchase price of approximately $9.1 million. Lemsys strengthens our position in the electrification trends of vehicles, solar, wind, and industrial applications. Lemsys is included in our Semiconductor Test segment.  



On June 3, 2019, we invested $15 million in RealWear, Inc. (“RealWear”). RealWear, a private company, develops and sells advanced wearable technology including industrial, hands-free, head-mounted augmented reality devices that make the workplace safer and more productive. Our investment in RealWear aligns with our strategy of bringing the power of advanced automation to companies of all sizes to improve the productivity of their employees and the quality of their products and services.  



We believe our recent acquisitions and investments have enhanced our opportunities for growth. We intend to continue to invest in our business, grow market share in our markets and expand further our addressable markets while tightly managing our costs.  



Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates  



We have identified the policies which are critical to understanding our business and our results of operations. There have been no significant changes during the three and six months ended June 30, 2019 to the items disclosed as our critical accounting policies and estimates in Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in our Annual Report on Form 



10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018, except as noted below. 



Investment in Other Company  



We hold an investment in a private company that develops and sells advanced wearable technology. We do not have the ability to exert significant influence over the company. The investment was recorded at cost and is evaluated for impairment or an indication of changes in fair value resulting from observable price changes in orderly transactions for the identical or a similar investment of the same issuer on a quarterly basis. See Note D: “Acquisitions and Investment in Other Company.”  



Leases  



In February 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) 



2016-02, 



“Leases (Topic 842)” (“Topic 842”), which requires a lessee to record a 



right-of-use  (“ROU”) asset and a lease liability on the balance sheet for operating leases with terms longer than twelve months. We adopted this standard and the related amendments (collectively “ASC 842”) on January 1, 2019 and utilized the modified retrospective approach provided by ASU 



2018-11, 



“Leases (Topic 842): Targeted Improvements,” that allowed for a cumulative effect adjustment in the period of adoption. Under this method of adoption, the comparative information in the consolidated financial statements has not been revised and continues to be reported under the previously applicable lease accounting guidance (ASC 840). We also utilized the package of practical expedients permitted under the transition guidance which included the carry-forward of historical lease classification. Adoption of ASC 842 resulted in recording ROU assets and lease liabilities of approximately $50.1 million and $54.3 million, respectively. Operating lease liabilities were calculated using the discount rate on January 1, 2019. The adoption of ASC 842 did not have a material impact on beginning retained earnings, the consolidated statement of operations, cash flows, or earnings per share. 



Under ASC 842, a contract is or contains a lease when we have the right to control the use of an identified asset. We determine if an arrangement is a lease at inception of the contract, which is the date on which the terms of the contract are agreed to and the agreement creates enforceable rights and obligations. The commencement date of the lease is the date that the lessor makes an underlying asset available for use. As of June 30, 2019, we do not have material leases that have not yet commenced.   



38  



Table of Contents 



We determine if the lease is operating or finance at the lease commencement date based upon the terms of the lease and the nature of the asset. The lease term used to calculate the lease liability includes options to extend or terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain that the option will be exercised.  



For leases commencing after January 1, 2019, the lease liability is measured at the present value of future lease payments, discounted using the discount rate for the lease at the commencement date. As we are typically unable to determine the implicit rate, we use an incremental borrowing rate based on the lease term and economic environment at commencement date. We initially measure payments based on an index by using the applicable rate at lease commencement. Variable payments that do not depend on an index are not included in the lease liability and are recognized as they are incurred. The ROU asset is initially measured as the amount of lease liability, adjusted for any initial lease costs, prepaid lease payments, and reduced by any lease incentives.  



Our contracts often include 



non-lease components such as common area maintenance. We elected the practical expedient to account for the lease and 



non-lease components as a single lease component. For leases with a term of one year or less we elected not to record the lease asset or liability. The lease payments are recognized in the consolidated statement of earnings on a straight-line basis over the lease term. We include lease costs within cost of revenues and operating expenses. 



Preparation of Financial Statements and Use of Estimates  



The preparation of consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements. Actual results may differ significantly from these estimates.

STATEMENTS OF OPERATIONS  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 



Results of Operations  



Second Quarter 2019 Compared to Second Quarter 2018  



Revenues  



Revenues by our four reportable segments were as follows:  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 



40 



Table of Contents 



The increase in Semiconductor Test revenues of $14.8 million, or 4.1%, was driven primarily by an increase in semiconductor test sales for 5G infrastructure and higher service revenues, partially offset by lower microcontroller, power linear and mobile image sensor test sales.  



The increase in Industrial Automation revenues of $12.6 million, or 20.3%, was due to higher demand for collaborative robotic arms and the acquisition of MiR, which was acquired on April 25, 2018. The increase in System Test revenues of $3.7 million, or 5.3%, was primarily due to higher sales in Defense/Aerospace test instrumentation and systems, and higher sales in Production Board Test from higher 5G demand. The increase in Wireless Test revenues of $6.0 million, or 17.0%, was primarily due to higher demand for millimeter wave and cellular test products driven by new wireless standards and 5G, partially offset by a decrease in connectivity test sales.  



Revenues by country as a percentage of total revenues were as follows (1):  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 



 (1) 



Revenues attributable to a country are based on location of customer site.   



Gross Profit  



Our gross profit was as follows:  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 



Gross profit as a percent of revenue decreased by 0.9 points, primarily due to higher excess and obsolescence charges in Semiconductor Test and unfavorable product mix.  



We assess the carrying value of our inventory on a quarterly basis by estimating future demand and comparing that demand against 



on-hand and 



on-order inventory positions. Forecasted revenue information is obtained from sales and marketing groups and incorporates factors such as backlog and future revenue demand. This quarterly process identifies obsolete and excess inventory. Obsolete inventory, which represents items for which there is no demand, is fully reserved. Excess inventory, which represents inventory items that are not expected to be consumed during the next twelve quarters for our Semiconductor Test, System Test and Industrial Automation segments and the next four quarters for our Wireless Test segment, is written-down to estimated net realizable value.  



41  



Table of Contents 



During the three months ended June 30, 2019, we recorded an inventory provision of $3.4 million included in cost of revenues primarily due to downward revisions to previously forecasted demand levels, of which $2.3 million was related to Semiconductor Test, $0.8 million was related to Wireless Test and $0.3 million was related to System Test.  



During the three months ended July 1, 2018, we recorded an inventory provision of $2.7 million included in cost of revenues primarily due to downward revisions to previously forecasted demand levels, of which $1.6 million was related to Semiconductor Test, $0.6 million was related to Wireless Test, $0.3 million was related to System Test, and $0.2 million was related to Industrial Automation.  



During the three months ended June 30, 2019 and July 1, 2018, we scrapped $2.6 million and $1.1 million of inventory, respectively. During the three months ended June 30, 2019 and July 1, 2018, we sold $0.4 million and $1.9 million of previously written-down or 



written-off inventory, respectively. As of June 30, 2019, we had inventory related reserves for inventory, which had been written-down or 



written-off totaling $102.6 million. We have no 



pre-determined timeline to scrap the remaining inventory. 



Selling and Administrative  



Selling and administrative expenses were as follows:  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 



The increase of $9.4 million in selling and administrative expenses was due primarily to higher spending in Industrial Automation from higher sales and marketing spending in Universal Robots and MiR. MiR was acquired on April 25, 2018.  



Engineering and Development  



Engineering and development expenses were as follows:  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 



The increase of $6.1 million in engineering and development expenses was primarily due to higher spending in Industrial Automation and Wireless Test.  



Acquired Intangible Assets Amortization  



Acquired intangible assets amortization expense was as follows:  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 



42 



Table of Contents 



Acquired intangible assets amortization expense increased primarily due to Industrial Automation acquisitions of MiR and Energid in 2018 and the Semiconductor Test acquisition of Lemsys in 2019.  



Restructuring and Other  



During the three months ended June 30, 2019, we recorded an $11.7 million credit for the decrease in the fair value of the MiR contingent consideration liability, partially offset by $0.8 million recorded for severance charges primarily in Semiconductor Test and $0.5 million of acquisition related compensation and expenses.  



During the three months ended July 1, 2018, we recorded $2.5 million of acquisition related expenses, and $2.4 million for employee severance charges, primarily in Semiconductor Test, partially offset by a $3.5 million credit for the decrease in the fair value of Universal Robots contingent consideration.  



Interest and Other  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 



Other (income) expense, net increased by $2.2 million due primarily to higher foreign exchange losses and higher pension costs.  



Income (Loss) Before Income Taxes  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 



 (1) 



Included in Corporate and Other are: contingent consideration adjustments, employee severance, interest income, interest expense, net foreign exchange gains and losses, intercompany eliminations, and acquisition related expenses.   



The increase in income before income taxes in System Test was primarily due to higher sales in Storage Test of 3.5” hard disk drive testers. The increase in income before income taxes in Wireless Test was primarily due to higher demand for millimeter wave and cellular test products. The decrease in income before income taxes in Industrial Automation was primarily due to increased intangible assets amortization expense from the acquisition of MiR on April 25 2018.   



43 



Table of Contents 



Income Taxes  



The effective tax rate for the three months ended June 30, 2019 and July 1, 2018 was 25.8% and 15.8%, respectively. The increase in the effective tax rate from the three months ended July 1, 2018 to the three months ended June 30, 2019 resulted from an increase in net discrete tax expense and an increase in the net unfavorable impact of the international provisions of the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017. These increases were partially offset by a projected shift in the geographic distribution of income, which reduces the income subject to taxation in higher tax rate jurisdictions relative to lower tax rate jurisdictions, an increase in benefit related to U.S. research and development tax credits and a decrease in expense related to the uncertain tax positions for transfer pricing.  



Six Months 2019 Compared to Six Months 2018  



Revenues  



Revenues by our four reportable segments were as follows:  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 



The decrease in Semiconductor Test revenues of $17.6 million, or 2.4%, was driven primarily by a decrease in memory test sales, partially offset by higher sales related to 5G infrastructure, higher image sensor test sales and higher service revenues. The increase in Industrial Automation revenues of $30.0 million, or 27.1%, was due to higher demand for collaborative robotic arms and the acquisition of MiR, which was acquired on April 25, 2018. The increase in System Test revenues of $18.9 million, or 16.8%, was primarily due to higher sales in Storage Test of 3.5” hard disk drive testers and higher sales in Production Board Test due to 5G. The increase in Wireless Test revenues of $12.6 million, or 21.8%, was primarily due to higher demand for millimeter wave and cellular test products driven by new wireless standards and 5G partially offset by lower sales in connectivity test products.

Represents the transition tax liability associated with our accumulated foreign earnings as a result of the enactment of the Tax Reform Act on December 22, 2017.   



 (2) 



Included in other long-term liabilities are liabilities for customer advances, extended warranty, uncertain tax positions, deferred tax liabilities and other obligations. For certain long-term obligations, we are unable to provide a reasonably reliable estimate of the timing of future payments relating to these obligations and therefore we included these amounts in the column marked “Other.”   



Liquidity and Capital Resources  



Our cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities balances decreased by $210.2 million in the six months ended June 30, 2019 to $994.3 million.  



Operating activities during the six months ended June 30, 2019 provided cash of $163.3 million. Changes in operating assets and liabilities used cash of $115.0 million due to a $99.0 million increase in operating assets and a $16.0 million decrease in operating liabilities.  



The increase in operating assets was primarily due to a $79.5 million increase in accounts receivable due to increased sales, a $17.1 million increase in prepayments and other assets, and a $2.4 million increase in inventories.  



The decrease in operating liabilities was due to a $26.8 million decrease in accrued employee compensation due primarily to first quarter payments related to variable compensation, a $15.0 million decrease in income taxes, and $2.4 million of retirement plan contributions, partially offset by a $15.8 million increase in deferred revenue and customer advance payments, a $10.3 million increase in other accrued liabilities, and a $2.0 million increase in accounts payable.

Table of Contents 



While we declared a quarterly cash dividend and authorized a share repurchase program, we may reduce or eliminate the cash dividend or share repurchase program in the future. Future cash dividends and stock repurchases are subject to the discretion of our Board of Directors, which will consider, among other things, our earnings, capital requirements and financial condition.  



We believe our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities balance will be sufficient to pay our quarterly dividend, execute our authorized share repurchase program and meet our working capital and expenditure needs for at least the next twelve months. Inflation has not had a significant long-term impact on earnings.  



Equity Compensation Plans  



As discussed in Note O: “Stock Based Compensation” in our 2018 Annual Report on Form 



10-K, we have a 1996 Employee Stock Purchase Plan and a 2006 Equity and Cash Compensation Incentive Plan (the “2006 Equity Plan”). 



The purpose of the 1996 Employee Stock Purchase Plan is to encourage stock ownership by all eligible employees of Teradyne. The purpose of the 2006 Equity Plan is to provide equity ownership and compensation opportunities in Teradyne to our employees, officers, directors, consultants and/or advisors. Both plans were approved by our shareholders.  



Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements  



On January 26, 2017, the FASB issued ASU 



2017-04, 



“Intangibles—Goodwill and Other (Topic 350): Simplifying the Accounting for Goodwill Impairment.” The new guidance removes Step 2 of the goodwill impairment test, which requires a hypothetical purchase price allocation. Goodwill impairment will be the amount by which a reporting unit’s carrying value exceeds its fair value, not to exceed the carrying amount of goodwill. All other goodwill impairment guidance will remain largely unchanged. Entities will continue to have the option to perform a qualitative assessment to determine if a quantitative impairment test is necessary. The same 



one-step impairment test will be applied to goodwill at all reporting units, even those with zero or negative carrying amounts.

The cumulative repurchases under the $1.5 billion stock repurchase program as of June 30, 2019 totaled 28.1 million shares of common stock for $1,070.7 million at an average price per share of $38.09.
