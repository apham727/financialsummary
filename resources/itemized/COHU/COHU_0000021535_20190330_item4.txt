Item 4.
Controls and Procedures.
It should be noted that any system of controls, however well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, and not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the system are met.
In addition, the design of any control system is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events.
Because of these and other inherent limitations of control systems, there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions, regardless of how remote.
Our disclosure controls and procedures are designed to provide reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives and our principal executive officer and principal financial officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective at the reasonable assurance level.
During the three months ended March 30, 2019, we implemented a new lease accounting system and related internal controls in response to the adoption of ASU No.
2016-02, “Leases (Topic 842),” effective December 30, 2018.
These implementations resulted in a material change in a component of our internal control over financial reporting.
