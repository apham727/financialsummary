Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities


On June 19, 2018, HPâ€™s Board of Directors authorized $4.0 billion for future repurchases of its outstanding shares of common stock.
This program, which does not have a specific expiration date, authorizes repurchases in the open market or in private transactions.
HP intends to use repurchases from time to time to offset the dilution created by shares issued under employee stock plans and to repurchase shares opportunistically.
All share repurchases settled in the first quarter of fiscal year 2019 were open market transactions.
As of January 31, 2019, HP had approximately $3.2 billion remaining under the share repurchase authorizations.
