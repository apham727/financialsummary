Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 

Use of Estimates - Management has made a number of estimates and assumptions relating to the reporting of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities to prepare our condensed consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States.
These estimates have a significant impact on our valuation and reserve accounts relating to the allowance for sales returns, doubtful accounts, inventory reserves and deferred income taxes.
