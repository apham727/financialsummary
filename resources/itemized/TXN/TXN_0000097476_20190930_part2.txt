These forward-looking statements generally can be identified by phrases such as TI or its management “believes,” “expects,” “anticipates,” “foresees,” “forecasts,” “estimates” or other words or phrases of similar import.
Similarly, statements herein that describe TI’s business strategy, outlook, objectives, plans, intentions or goals also are forward-looking statements.
All such forward-looking statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in forward-looking statements.
•Market demand for semiconductors, particularly in our end markets;
•Our ability to compete in products and prices in an intensely competitive industry;
•Customer demand that differs from forecasts and the financial impact of inadequate or excess company inventory that results from demand that differs from projections;
•Economic, social and political conditions in the countries in which we, our customers or our suppliers operate, including security risks; global trade policies; political and social instability; health conditions; possible disruptions in transportation, communications and information technology networks; and fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates;
•Evolving cybersecurity threats to our information technology systems or those of our customers or suppliers;
•Natural events such as severe weather, geological events or health epidemics in the locations in which we, our customers or our suppliers operate;

•Compliance with or changes in the complex laws, rules and regulations to which we are or may become subject, or actions of enforcement authorities, that restrict our ability to manufacture or ship our products or operate our business, or subject us to fines, penalties or other legal liability;
•Changes in tax law and accounting standards that can impact the tax rate applicable to us, the jurisdictions in which profits are determined to be earned and taxed, adverse resolution of tax audits, increases in tariff rates, and the ability to realize deferred tax assets;
•A loss suffered by one of our customers or distributors with respect to TI-consigned inventory;
•Financial difficulties of our distributors or their promotion of competing product lines to our detriment, or the unexpected loss of significant distributors;
•Losses or curtailments of purchases from key customers or the timing and amount of distributor and other customer inventory adjustments;
•Our ability to maintain or improve profit margins, including our ability to utilize our manufacturing facilities at sufficient levels to cover our fixed operating costs, in an intensely competitive and cyclical industry and despite changes in the regulatory environment;
•Our ability to maintain and enforce a strong intellectual property portfolio and maintain freedom of operation in all jurisdictions where we conduct business; or our exposure to infringement claims;
•Instability in the global credit and financial markets that affects our ability to fund our daily operations, invest in the business, make strategic acquisitions, or make principal and interest payments on our debt;
•Increases in health care and pension benefit costs;
•Our ability to recruit and retain skilled engineering, management and technical personnel, and effectively manage key employee succession;
