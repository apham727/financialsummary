ITEM 2.
Management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations.
Overview
•
A strong foundation of manufacturing and technology.
We invest in manufacturing technologies and do most of our manufacturing in-house.
This strategic decision to directly control our manufacturing helps ensure a consistent supply of products for our customers and also allows us to invest in technology that differentiates the features of our products.
We have focused on creating a competitive manufacturing cost advantage by increasing factory loadings of our advanced analog 300-millimeter wafers, which have about a 40 percent cost advantage per unpackaged chip over 200-millimeter wafers.
300-millimeter wafers will support the majority of our Analog growth going forward.
Additionally, we keep our manufacturing costs low by using mature assets acquired ahead of demand when their prices are most attractive.
•
Broad portfolio of differentiated analog and embedded processing semiconductors.
Our customers need multiple chips for their systems.
The breadth of our portfolio means we can solve more of these needs than our competitors, which gives us access to more customers and the opportunity to sell more products and generate more revenue per customer system.
We invest more than $1 billion each year to develop new products for our portfolio, which includes tens of thousands of products.
•
Broadest reach of market channels.
Customers often begin their initial product selection process and design-in journey on our website, and the breadth of our portfolio attracts more customers to our website than any of our competitors.
Our web presence, combined with our global sales force that is also greater in size than those of our competitors, are advantages that give us unique access to about 100,000 customers designing TI semiconductors into their end products.
•
Diversity and longevity of our products, markets and customer positions.
Together, the attributes above result in diverse and long-lived positions that deliver high terminal value to our shareholders.
Because of the breadth of our portfolio, we are not dependent on any single product, and because of the breadth of our markets we are not dependent on any single application or customer.
Some of our products generate revenue for decades, which strengthens the return on our investments.
Our strategic focus, and where we invest the majority of our resources, is on Analog and Embedded Processing, with a particular emphasis on designing and selling those products into the industrial and automotive markets, which we believe represent the best growth opportunities.
Analog and embedded processing products sold into industrial and automotive markets provide long product life cycles, intrinsic diversity, and less capital-intensive manufacturing, which we believe offer stability, profitability and strong cash generation.
This business model is the foundation of our capital management strategy, which is based on our belief that free cash flow growth, especially on a per share basis, is important for maximizing shareholder value over the long term.
We also believe that free cash flow will be valued only if it is productively invested in the business or returned to shareholders.
The combined effect of these sustainable competitive advantages is that over time we have gained market share in Analog and Embedded Processing and have grown free cash flow.
Our business model puts us in a unique class of companies with the ability to grow, generate cash, and return that cash to shareholders.
•
Our segments represent groups of similar products that are combined on the basis of similar design and development requirements, product characteristics, manufacturing processes and distribution channels, and how management allocates resources and measures results.
See Note 1 to the financial statements for more information regarding our segments.
•
All dollar amounts in the tables are stated in millions of U.S. dollars.
•
o
Unless otherwise noted, changes in our revenue are attributable to changes in customer demand, which are evidenced by fluctuations in shipment volumes.
o
New products tend not to have a significant impact on our revenue in any given period because we sell such a large number of products.
o
From time to time, our revenue and gross profit are affected by changes in demand for higher-priced or lower-priced products, which we refer to as changes in the “mix” of products shipped.
o
Because we own much of our manufacturing capacity, a significant portion of our operating cost is fixed.
When factory loadings decrease, our fixed costs are spread over reduced output and, absent other circumstances, our profit margins decrease.
Conversely, as factory loadings increase, our fixed costs are spread over increased output and, absent other circumstances, our profit margins increase.
Increases and decreases in factory loadings tend to correspond to increases and decreases in demand.

Performance summary
Our first-quarter revenue was $3.79 billion, net income was $1.37 billion and earnings per share (EPS) were $1.35.
Earnings per share include 14 cents in tax-related benefits not in our original guidance.
Revenue increased 11 percent from the same quarter a year ago.
Demand for our Analog and Embedded Processing products continued to be strong in the industrial and automotive markets.
Our cash flow from operations of $5.7 billion for the trailing 12 months again underscored the strength of our business model.
Free cash flow for the trailing 12 months was up 17 percent from a year ago to $4.9 billion, or 32.1 percent of revenue.
This reflects the quality of our product portfolio, as well as the efficiency of our manufacturing strategy, including the benefit of 300-millimeter Analog production.
We have returned $5.1 billion to owners in the past 12 months through stock repurchases and dividends, consistent with our strategy to return to owners all of our free cash flow.
Over the last 12 months, our dividends represented 45 percent of free cash flow, emphasizing their sustainability.
We now expect our ongoing annual operating tax rate to be about 16 percent starting in 2019 and 20 percent in 2018, lower than our previous expectation of 18 percent and 23 percent, respectively.
For an explanation of free cash flow and the term “annual operating tax rate,” see the Non-GAAP financial information section.
Results of operations – first-quarter 2018 compared with first-quarter 2017
Revenue increased $387 million, or 11 percent, due to higher revenue from Analog and Embedded Processing.
Gross profit of $2.45 billion was up $303 million, or 14 percent, due to higher revenue and lower manufacturing costs.
As a percentage of revenue, gross profit increased to 64.6 percent from 63.0 percent.
Acquisition charges of $80 million were non-cash.
See Note 9 to the financial statements.
Operating profit was $1.55 billion, or 40.9 percent of revenue, compared with $1.25 billion, or 36.8 percent of revenue.
Our Provision for income taxes was $187 million compared with $258 million, which includes discrete tax benefits of $129 million and $124 million, respectively.
The decrease in our tax provision was primarily due to a lower U.S. statutory corporate tax rate and other net benefits resulting from the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the Tax Act), partially offset by higher income before income taxes.
The $129 million discrete tax benefits include $82 million due to stock-based compensation, $45 million due to updated estimates related to the Tax Act, and $2 million of other net tax benefits.
Our annual operating tax rate, which does not include discrete tax items, is about 20 percent compared with 31 percent in 2017.
We use “annual operating tax rate” to describe the estimated annual effective tax rate.
The 2018 rate differs from the 21 percent U.S. statutory corporate tax rate due to the effect of U.S. tax benefits, offset by a transitional non-cash tax expense.
Net income was $1.37 billion compared with $997 million.
EPS was $1.35 compared with $0.97.
First-quarter 2018 segment results
Analog (includes Power, Signal Chain and High Volume product lines)
Analog revenue increased due to Power and, to a lesser extent, Signal Chain.
High Volume revenue was about even.
Operating profit increased due to higher revenue and associated gross profit.
Embedded Processing (includes Connected Microcontrollers and Processors product lines)
Embedded Processing revenue increased in both product lines, led by Processors.
Operating profit increased primarily due to higher revenue and associated gross profit.
Other (includes DLP® products, calculators and custom ASIC products)
Other revenue decreased by $46 million, and operating profit declined by $23 million.
Financial condition
At the end of the first quarter of 2018, total cash (Cash and cash equivalents plus Short-term investments) was $4.08 billion, a decrease of $390 million from the end of 2017.
Accounts receivable were $1.45 billion, an increase of $176 million compared with the end of 2017.
Days sales outstanding at the end of the first quarter of 2018 were 35 compared with 31 at the end of 2017.
Inventory was $2.03 billion, an increase of $75 million from the end of 2017.
Days of inventory at the end of the first quarter of 2018 were 136 compared with 134 at the end of 2017.
Liquidity and capital resources
Our primary source of liquidity is cash flow from operations.
Additional sources of liquidity are Cash and cash equivalents, Short-term investments and a variable-rate, revolving credit facility.
Cash flows from operating activities for the first three months of 2018 were $1.11 billion, an increase of $317 million from the year-ago period.
This increase was primarily due to higher Net income.
Our revolving credit facility is with a consortium of investment-grade banks and allows us to borrow up to $2 billion until March 2023.
This credit facility also serves as support for the issuance of commercial paper.
As of March 31, 2018, our credit facility was undrawn, and we had no commercial paper outstanding.
Investing activities for the first three months of 2018 provided $266 million compared with $267 million in the year-ago period.
Capital expenditures were $189 million compared with $127 million in the year-ago period and were primarily for semiconductor manufacturing equipment in both periods.
We had proceeds from sales of short-term investments, net of purchases, that provided cash of $459 million compared with $363 million in the year-ago period.
Financing activities for the first three months of 2018 used $1.32 billion compared with $1.14 billion in the year-ago period.
In the year-ago period, we repaid $250 million of maturing debt.
Dividends paid were $611 million compared with $500 million in the year-ago period, reflecting an increase in the dividend rate, partially offset by fewer shares outstanding.
We used $873 million to repurchase 8.2 million shares of our common stock compared with $550 million used in the year-ago period to repurchase 7.1 million shares.
Employee exercises of stock options provided cash proceeds of $178 million compared with $161 million in the year-ago period.
On April 30, 2018, we agreed to issue $1.30 billion principal amount of debt that we expect to use for general corporate purposes, including to replenish our cash on hand following the repayment of maturing debt.
The offering is expected to close on May 7, 2018.
We had $1.72 billion of Cash and cash equivalents and $2.36 billion of Short-term investments as of March 31, 2018.
We believe we have the necessary financial resources and operating plans to fund our working capital needs, capital expenditures, dividend and debt-related payments, and other business requirements for at least the next 12 months.
Non-GAAP financial information
We believe that free cash flow and the associated ratios provide insight into our liquidity, our cash-generating capability and the amount of cash potentially available to return to shareholders, as well as insight into our financial performance.
These non-GAAP measures are supplemental to the comparable GAAP measures.
Reconciliation to the most directly comparable GAAP measures is provided in the table below.
