Item 4. Controls and Procedures.



Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures



We maintain disclosure controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in reports filed under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”), is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the specified time periods, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to management, including our Chief Executive Officer (“CEO”) and Chief Financial Officer (“CFO”), as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.



Our management, with the participation of our CEO and CFO, evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) as of March 31, 2019. Based on that evaluation, our CEO and CFO concluded that, as of that date, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective.



Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting



There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended March 31, 2019 that have materially affected, or are likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
