 Item 2.Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Overview
The Company’s commercial business is affected by such factors as uncertainties in today’s global economy, global competition, the vitality and ability of the commercial aviation industry to purchase new aircraft, the effects and threats of terrorism, market demand and acceptance both for the Company’s products and its customers’ products which incorporate Company made components.
During the three months ended March 31, 2019 and 2018 approximately 10% and 9%, respectively, of the Company’s revenues were derived from contracts with agencies of the U.S. Government or their prime contractors and their subcontractors.
The Company believes that government involvement in military operations overseas will continue to have an impact on the financial results in both the Advanced Technology and Consumer Products markets.
While the Company is optimistic in relation to these potential opportunities, it recognizes that sales to the government are affected by defense budgets, the foreign policies of the U.S. and other nations, the level of military operations and other factors, and as such, it is difficult to predict the impact on future financial results.
The CPG consumer products are marketed throughout the United States and in select foreign markets.
Consumer sales are moderately seasonal.
Sales are direct to consumer, through national and international distributors, and through retailers such as big box, hardware, supermarket, variety, department, discount, gift, drug, outdoors and sporting stores.
The CPG also sells knives and tools, principally machetes, bayonets, survival knives and kitchen knives, to various branches of the United States Government which accounted for less than 2% of the Company’s consolidate revenues in the three months ended March 31, 2019 and 2018.

Results of Operations
Revenue
The Company’s consolidated revenues from operations increased approximately $1,444,000 or 13.7% for the three month period ended March 31, 2019 when compared to the same period in 2018.
The increase in revenue is attributable to an increase in commercial and government shipments at the ATG in addition to an increase in government shipments at the CPG.
This is partially offset by a decrease in commercial shipments at the CPG.
Commercial and government shipments increased approximately $1,278,000 or 15.4% and $202,000 or 25.1% at the ATG for the three month period ended March 31, 2019 when compared to the same period in 2018.
This is offset by a net decrease in CPG shipments.
CPG government shipments increased approximately $23,000 of 17.6% and commercial shipments decreased approximately $59,000 or (4.5%) for the three month period ended March 31, 2019 compared to the same period in 2018.

This is partially offset by a decrease in units shipped of approximately $64,000 and decreased due to average prices and mix of product sold of approximately $9,000 at the CPG as compared to the same period of 2018.
