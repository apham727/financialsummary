 Item 2.Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Overview
The Company’s commercial business is affected by such factors as uncertainties in today’s global economy, global competition, the vitality and ability of the commercial aviation industry to purchase new aircraft, the effects and threats of terrorism, market demand and acceptance both for the Company’s products and its customers’ products which incorporate Company made components.
The CPG consumer products are marketed throughout the United States and in select foreign markets.
Consumer sales are moderately seasonal.
Sales are direct to consumer, through national and international distributors, and through retailers such as big box, hardware, supermarket, variety, department, discount, gift, drug, outdoors and sporting stores.
The CPG also sells knives and tools, principally machetes, bayonets, survival knives and kitchen knives, to various branches of the United States Government which accounted for less than 5% and 7% of the Company’s consolidated revenues in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively.
During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2018 and 2017 approximately 7% and 9% respectively, of the Company’s revenues were derived from contracts with agencies of the U.S. Government or their prime contractors and their subcontractors.
The Company believes that government involvement in military operations overseas will continue to have an impact on the financial results in both the Advanced Technology and Consumer Products markets.
While the Company is optimistic in relation to these potential opportunities, it recognizes that sales to the government are affected by defense budgets, the foreign policies of the U.S. and other nations, the level of military operations and other factors, and as such, it is difficult to predict the impact on future financial results.

Results of Operations
Revenue
The Company’s consolidated revenue from operations increased approximately $5,229,000 or 17.4% for the nine month period ended September 30, 2018 when compared to the same period in 2017.
During this period the ATG increased commercial shipments by approximately $6,507,000 offset by the CPG commercial shipments decrease of approximately $609,000.
Both ATG and CPG decreased government shipments by approximately $447,000 and $222,000, respectively, during the nine month period ended September 30, 2018 and 2017.
The consolidated revenue increase for the nine month period ended September 30, 2018 when compared to the same period in 2017 is primarily attributed to ATG with increased number of units shipped of approximately $3,091,000 and average price increases of approximately $2,969,000.
This is offset by a decrease in revenue at the CPG due to a decrease in the number of units shipped of approximately $456,000 and average price decreases of approximately $375,000 as compared to the same nine month period ended September 30, 2017.
The Company’s consolidated revenue from operations increased approximately $1,443,000 or 12.7% for the three month period ended September 30, 2018 when compared to the same period in 2017.
During this period the ATG increased commercial shipments by approximately $2,142,000 offset by the CPG commercial shipments decrease of approximately $134,000.
Both ATG and CPG decreased government shipments by approximately $421,000 and $144,000, respectively, during the three month period ended September 30, 2018.
The consolidated revenue increase for the three month period ended September 30, 2018 when compared to the same period in 2017 is primarily attributed to increased average prices of approximately $1,155,000 and increased number of units shipped of approximately $566,000 at the ATG.
This is partially offset by an overall decrease in revenue at the CPG.
The decrease in revenue at the CPG is primarily attributed to average price decreases of approximately $352,000 offset slightly by volume increases of approximately $74,000 as compared to the same three month period ended September 30, 2017.
Gross Margin
The Company’s consolidated gross margin increased approximately $2,177,000 or 32.3% for the nine month period ended September 30, 2018 and increased approximately $849,000 or 27.4% for the three month period ended September 30, 2018 when compared to the same periods in 2017.
Gross margin improved in the nine month period ended September 30, 2018 primarily due to the increase in units shipped of approximately $1,256,000 and increased average prices of approximately $1,030,000 at the ATG as compared to the same period in 2017.
This is partially offset by a decrease in the number of units shipped of approximately $21,000 and decreased average prices of approximately $88,000 at the CPG as compared to the same period in 2017.
Gross margin improved in the three month period ended September 30, 2018 primarily due to the increased number of units shipped of approximately $228,000 and increased average prices of approximately $726,000 at the ATG as compared to the same period in 2017.
This is partially offset by a decrease in average prices of approximately $108,000 offset slightly by an increase in units shipped of approximately $3,000 at the CPG as compared to the same period in 2017.
Selling, General and Administrative Expenses
Interest Expense
Interest expense increased by 42.9% and 55.6% in the nine and three month periods ended September 30, 2018, respectively, when compared to the same periods in 2017.
This is primarily due to borrowing on the lease line of credit for the production equipment financing at ATG.
See also Note 5, Long-Term Debt, for information on the equipment capital leases.
Income Taxes
The Company’s effective tax rate was approximately 20.0% and 29.2% for the nine month periods ended September 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively.
The Company’s effective tax rate was approximately 20.7% and 32.1% for the three month periods ended September 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively.
The reduction in the effective tax rate is primarily due to the reduction in the corporate tax rate to 21% as a result of the Tax and Jobs Act.
The effective tax rate in both years reflects federal and state income taxes, permanent non-deductible expenditures and the federal tax credit for research and development expenditures.
Net Income
Net income for the nine month period ended September 30, 2018 increased approximately $1,693,000 and net income for the three month period ended September 30, 2018 increased approximately $786,000, when compared to the same periods in 2017.
This increase is primarily the result of increases in revenue at the ATG business segment offset by a decrease in revenue at the CPG business segment as discussed above.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
The Company’s liquidity and capital requirements relate to working capital needs; primarily inventory, accounts receivable and accounts payable as well as capital expenditures for property, plant and equipment and principal and interest payments on debt.
At September 30, 2018, the Company had working capital of approximately $22,199,000 of which approximately $2,379,000 was comprised of cash.
The Company utilized approximately $24,000 in cash from operations during the nine months ended September 30, 2018.
The primary use of cash for the Company’s operating activities for the nine month period ended September 30, 2018 includes working capital requirements, increased receivables due to timing of shipments and payments by customers and increase in inventory raw materials for increased production offset by timing differences on payments to vendors.
The Company’s primary use of cash in its financing and investing activities in the nine months ended September 30, 2018 included approximately $410,000 of principal payments on long-term debt as well as approximately $150,000 for the purchase of treasury shares.
The Company also expended approximately $1,429,000 for capital expenditures during the nine months ended September 30, 2018.
The Company has a $2,000,000 line of credit available until June 19, 2019.
The Company believes its cash generating capability and financial condition, together with available credit facilities will be adequate to meet our operating, investing and financing needs into the future.
