Item 2.Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Overview 

The Company’s commercial business is affected by such factors as uncertainties in today’s global economy, global competition, the vitality and ability of the commercial aviation industry to purchase new aircraft, the effects and threats of terrorism, market demand and acceptance both for the Company’s products and its customers’ products which incorporate Company made components.
During the three months ended March 31, 2018 and 2017 approximately 9% of the Company’s revenues were derived from contracts with agencies of the U.S. Government or their prime contractors and their subcontractors.
The Company believes that government involvement in military operations overseas will continue to have an impact on the financial results in both the Advanced Technology and Consumer Products markets.
While the Company is optimistic in relation to these potential opportunities, it recognizes that sales to the government are affected by defense budgets, the foreign policies of the U.S. and other nations, the level of military operations and other factors, and as such, it is difficult to predict the impact on future financial results.
The CPG consumer products are marketed throughout the United States and in select foreign markets.
Consumer sales are moderately seasonal.
Sales are direct to consumer, through national and international distributors, and through retailers such as big box, hardware, supermarket, variety, department, discount, gift, drug, outdoors and sporting stores.
The CPG also sells knives and tools, principally machetes, bayonets, survival knives and kitchen knives, to various branches of the United States Government which accounted for less than 2% of the Company’s consolidate revenues in the three months ended March 31, 2018 and 2017.
See also Note 10, Business Segments, for information concerning business segment operating results.
Results of Operations 




Revenue 

The Company’s consolidated revenues from operations increased approximately $1,456,000 or 16.0% for the three month period ended March 31, 2018 when compared to the same period in 2017.
During this period ATG increased commercial shipments by approximately $1,590,000 offset by a CPG decrease in commercial shipment of approximately $205,000.
ATG also increased government shipments by approximately $106,000 offset by a CPG decrease in government shipments of approximately $35,000.
Cost of Goods Sold 


Selling, General and Administrative Expenses 



Depreciation and Amortization Expense 

Depreciation and amortization remained relatively consistent for the three month period ended March 31, 2018 when compared to the same period in 2017.
Depreciation expense fluctuates due to variable estimated useful lives of depreciable property (as identified in Note 2, Business Description and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, of the accompanying consolidated financial statements) as well as the amount and nature of capital expenditures in current and previous periods.
It is anticipated that the Company’s future capital expenditures and related depreciation and amortization expense will follow the Company’s requirements to support its manufacturing delivery commitments and to implement certain information technology improvements.
Interest Expense 

Interest expense remained relatively consistent for the three month period ended March 31, 2018 when compared to the same period in 2017.
See also Note 5, Long-Term Debt, for information on long-term debt.
Income Taxes 

The Company’s effective tax rate was approximately 16.5% and 750.0% for the three month period ended March 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively.
The effective tax rate for the three months ended in 2018 was lower than the U.S. federal statutory rate of 21.0% primarily as a result of the effect of permanent differences.
The effective tax rate for the three month period ended March 31, 2017 includes approximately $19,000 of tax benefit resulting from the vesting of restricted stock awards.
Without this tax benefit, the effective tax rate would be 30.9%.
The effective tax rate in both years reflects federal and state income taxes, permanent non-deductible expenditures and the federal tax credit for research and development expenditures.
Net Income 


Liquidity and Capital Resources 

The Company’s primary liquidity and capital requirements relate to working capital needs; primarily inventory, accounts receivable and accounts payable as well as capital expenditures for property, plant and equipment and principal and interest payments on debt.
At March 31, 2018, the Company had working capital of approximately $20,924,000 of which approximately $3,886,000 was comprised of cash and cash equivalents.
The Company used approximately $113,000 in cash from operations during the three months ended March 31, 2018.
The primary uses of cash for the Company’s operating activities for the three month period ended March 31, 2018 includes the increase in accounts receivable and inventory due to the increase in revenue partially offset by the generation of cash primarily due to the timing of payments to our suppliers.
The Company’s primary use of cash in its financing and investing activities in the three months ended March 31, 2018 included approximately $172,000 of current principal payments on long-term debt, approximately $117,000 for the purchase of treasury shares, partially offset by the proceeds from our lease line of credit of $92,000.
The Company also expended approximately $511,000 for capital expenditures during the three months ended March 31, 2018.
The Company renewed a $2,000,000 line of credit available until June 20, 2018.
There was no balance outstanding at March 31, 2018.
The Company established a lease line of credit in the amount of $1,000,000 available until June 28, 2018.
The lease term for equipment covered by the lease line of credit is 60 months.
There was approximately $711,000 balance outstanding at March 31, 2018.
The Company believes its cash generating capability and financial condition, together with available credit facilities will be adequate to meet our operating, investing and financing needs.
