Note 1 – Basis of Presentation  



The accompanying unaudited consolidated condensed financial statements of Vishay Intertechnology, Inc. (“Vishay” or the “Company”) have been prepared in accordance with the instructions to Form 10-Q and therefore do not include all information and footnotes necessary for presentation of financial position, results of operations, and cash flows required by accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (“GAAP”) for complete financial statements. The information furnished reflects all normal recurring adjustments which are, in the opinion of management, necessary for a fair summary of the financial position, results of operations, and cash flows for the interim periods presented. The financial statements should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements filed with the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018. The results of operations for the fiscal quarter and six fiscal months ended June 29, 2019 are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for the full year.  



The Company reports interim financial information for 13-week periods beginning on a Sunday and ending on a Saturday, except for the first fiscal quarter, which always begins on January 1, and the fourth fiscal quarter, which always ends on December 31. The four fiscal quarters in 2019 end on March 30, 2019, June 29, 2019, September 28, 2019, and December 31, 2019, respectively. The four fiscal quarters in 2018 ended on March 31, 2018, June 30, 2018, September 29, 2018, and December 31, 2018, respectively.  



Recently Adopted Accounting Guidance  



In February 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued Accounting Standards Update ("ASU") No. 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842). The ASU is the result of a project between the FASB and the International Accounting Standards Board to increase transparency and comparability among organizations by recognizing lease assets and lease liabilities on the balance sheet and disclosing key information about leasing arrangements. The guidance in ASU No. 2016-02 and all related ASUs is codified in Accounting Standard Codification (“ASC”) Topic 842, Leases. The Company adopted ASC Topic 842 effective January 1, 2019. Upon adoption at January 1, 2019, the Company recognized right of use assets of $91,462 and lease liabilities of $95,784 on the consolidated balance sheet. The difference between the initial right of use asset and lease liability balances recognized upon adoption of ASC Topic 842 is primarily due to accrued lease incentive balances at December 31, 2018.  



On December 20, 2018, the Company received sale proceeds of $45,500 and concurrently leased-back its former manufacturing site in Santa Clara, California, under a short-term arrangement, to raze the buildings. Upon adoption of ASC Topic 842, the Company was required to reassess the accounting for these transactions. The transactions did not qualify as a completed sale and leaseback under previous GAAP. However, pursuant to ASC Topic 842’s sale and leaseback guidance, the transaction would qualify as a completed sale. The Company recognized a cumulative-effect adjustment to retained earnings (accumulated deficit) of $23,013, to recognize the sale as of the date of adoption, and derecognized the land, building, and related deferred proceeds, which had been recorded in other accrued expenses.  



The adoption of the ASU did not have a material impact on the Company's results of operations or cash flows. See Note 3.  



Recently Issued Accounting Guidance  



In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-13, Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments. The ASU replaces the incurred loss impairment methodology in current GAAP with a methodology that reflects expected credit losses and requires consideration of a broader range of reasonable and supportable information to inform credit loss estimates. The ASU is effective for the Company for interim and annual periods beginning on or after January 1, 2020, with the ability to early adopt for interim and annual periods beginning on or after January 1, 2019. The Company is currently evaluating the effect of the ASU on its financial assets measured at amortized cost.

Note 3 – Leases  



The Company leases buildings and machinery and equipment used for manufacturing and/or sales and administrative purposes. The Company is also party to various service, warehousing, and other agreements that it evaluates for potential embedded leases. Substantially all of the Company’s leases are structured and classified as operating leases. As of January 1, 2019, the Company accounts for its leases in accordance with ASC Topic 842.  



The Company leases assets in each region in which it operates. The Company’s leases are generally denominated in the currency of the leased assets' location, which may not be the functional currency of the subsidiary lessee. Accordingly, the Company remeasures its lease liability and recognizes a transactional gain/loss for leases denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the subsidiary lessee.  



The Company recognizes right of use assets and lease liabilities for leases greater than twelve months in duration based on the contract consideration for lease components through the term of the lease and the applicable discount rate. Leases with a duration less than or equal to twelve months are considered short-term leases. The Company does not recognize right of use assets or lease liabilities for short-term leases and classifies the expense as short-term lease expense. Variable lease payments based on an index or rate are included in the right of use assets and lease liabilities based on the effective rates at lease commencement. Changes in the rates or indices do not impact the right of use asset or lease liability and are recognized as a component of lease expense in the statement of operations. Variable lease payments not based on an index or rate are not included in the initial right of use asset and lease liability and are recognized when incurred as a component of lease expense in the statement of operations.  



The Company has elected to not separate contract consideration for lease and non-lease components for its building leases. In addition to the noncancellable period of a lease, the Company includes periods covered by extension options it is reasonably certain to exercise, termination options that it is reasonably certain not to exercise, and extension and termination options controlled by the lessor in its determination of the lease term. The Company uses the rate implicit in the contract whenever possible when determining the applicable discount rate. When the implicit rate is not used, the Company employs a portfolio approach based on the duration of the lease. The portfolio lease rates are calculated monthly.  



No individual lease is considered significant and there are no leases that have not yet commenced that are considered significant.  



The net right of use assets and lease liabilities recognized on the consolidated condensed balance sheet for the Company's operating leases as of June 29, 2019 and the net right of use assets and lease liabilities recognized upon the adoption of ASC Topic 842 on January 1, 2019 are presented below:  



  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

(dollars in thousands, except per share amounts)    



Lease expense is classified in the statements of operations based on asset use. Total lease cost recognized on the consolidated condensed statements of operations is as follows:  



  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]  



The Company paid $10,277 for its operating leases in the six fiscal months ended June 29, 2019, which are included in operating cash flows on the consolidated condensed statement of cash flows. The weighted-average remaining lease term for the Company's operating leases is 9.2 years and the weighted-average discount rate is 6.1% as of June 29, 2019.  



The undiscounted future lease payments for the Company's operating lease liabilities are as follows:  



  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]  



The undiscounted future lease payments presented in the table above include payments through the term of the lease, which may include periods beyond the noncancellable term. The difference between the total payments above and the lease liability balance is due to the discount rate used to calculate lease liabilities.  



The Company elected to use the package of practical expedients available in ASC Topic 842; and accordingly, did not reassess existing contracts for leases, the classification of existing leases, or initial direct costs for any existing leases. The Company also elected to use the practical expedient available in ASC Topic 842 for land easements.  



The Company did not elect the practical expedient available in ASC Topic 842 to use hindsight in determining the lease term. Accordingly, the remaining lease term as of January 1, 2019 was used to calculate the initial right of use asset and lease liability.

Note 4 – Acquisition Activities  



As part of its growth strategy, the Company seeks to expand through targeted acquisitions of other manufacturers of electronic components that have established positions in major markets, reputations for product quality and reliability, and product lines with which the Company has substantial marketing and technical expertise.  



On January 3, 2019, the Company acquired substantially all of the assets of Bi-Metallix, Inc. ("Bi-Metallix"), a U.S.-based, privately-held provider of electron beam continuous strip welding services for $11,862. The Company was a major customer of Bi-Metallix, and the acquired business is being vertically integrated into the Company's Resistors & Inductors segment. Based on an estimate of their fair values, the Company allocated $2,900 of the purchase price to definite-lived intangible assets. After allocating the purchase price to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on an estimation of their fair values at the date of acquisition, the Company recorded goodwill of $3,324 related to this acquisition. The results and operations of this acquisition have been included in the Resistors & Inductors segment since January 3, 2019. The inclusion of this acquisition did not have a material impact on the Company's consolidated results for the fiscal quarter and six fiscal months ended June 29, 2019. The goodwill related to this acquisition is included in the Resistors & Inductors reporting unit for goodwill impairment testing.  



Had this acquisition occurred as of the beginning of the periods presented in these consolidated condensed financial statements, the pro forma statements of operations would not be materially different than the consolidated condensed statements of operations presented.  



The remaining fluctuation in the goodwill account balance is due to foreign currency translation.

(dollars in thousands, except per share amounts)   



Note 5 – Income Taxes  



The provision for income taxes consists of provisions for federal, state, and foreign income taxes. The effective tax rates for the periods ended June 29, 2019 and June 30, 2018 reflect the Company’s expected tax rate on reported income from continuing operations before income tax and tax adjustments. The Company operates in a global environment with significant operations in various jurisdictions outside the United States. Accordingly, the consolidated income tax rate is a composite rate reflecting the Company’s earnings and the applicable tax rates in the various jurisdictions where the Company operates.  



During the second fiscal quarter of 2019, the Company repatriated approximately $73,590 to the United States, and paid withholding and foreign taxes of $20,479. The Company expects to repatriate an additional approximately $104,000 to the United States in the third fiscal quarter of 2019, net of withholding and foreign taxes of about $15,000. Substantially all of these amounts will be used to repay certain intercompany indebtedness, to pay the U.S. transition tax, and to fund capital expansion projects.  



After completing these phases of cash repatriation, there will be approximately $100,000 of unremitted foreign earnings remaining that the Company has deemed not permanently reinvested and thus has accrued foreign withholding and other taxes. The Company continues to evaluate the timing of the reparation of these remaining amounts, and may decide to ultimately not repatriate some of these amounts.   



As part of the Company’s cash repatriation activity, the Company settled an intercompany loan, which previously had been accounted for at the historical foreign exchange rate (akin to an equity contribution) because the debtor entity did not have the intent or ability to repay such intercompany loan. Currency translation adjustments were recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income, and were not included in U.S. GAAP pre-tax income. The Company’s cash repatriation activity resulted in the ability to repay such intercompany loan. Upon settlement of this intercompany loan, the foreign entity realized a taxable gain. Income tax expense for the fiscal quarter and six fiscal months ended June 29, 2019 includes tax expense of $7,554 related to this tax-basis foreign exchange gain.  



The Company’s repurchase of a portion of the outstanding convertible debentures in the first fiscal quarter of 2019 (see Note 6) slightly reduced the Company’s expected 2019 tax rate. The Company recognized a tax benefit on the pre-tax loss on early extinguishment of debt. The Company also recognized a tax benefit of $1,312, reflecting the reduction in deferred tax liabilities related to the special tax attributes of the extinguished debentures.  



Income tax expense for the fiscal quarter and six fiscal months ended June 29, 2019, includes tax benefit of $48 and $633, respectively, for the periodic remeasurement of the deferred tax liability recorded for the foreign taxes associated with the Company's cash repatriation program.  



During the six fiscal months ended June 29, 2019, the liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits increased by $4,784 on a net basis, principally due to increases for tax positions taken in the current and prior periods and interest, offset by expiration of a statute and payments.  



Income tax expense for the fiscal quarter and six fiscal months ended June 30, 2018 includes additional tax expense of $12,000 recognized as a result of additional analysis of the impact of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act completed in the second fiscal quarter of 2018.  



The Company recognized a tax benefit on the pre-tax loss on early extinguishment of debt in the second fiscal quarter of 2018. The Company also recognized a tax benefit of $33,963, reflecting the reduction in deferred tax liabilities related to the special tax attributes of the extinguished debentures.  



Income tax expense for the fiscal quarter and six fiscal months ended June 30, 2018 also included tax benefits of $9,006 and $7,690, respectively for the periodic remeasurement of the deferred tax liability recorded for the Company's cash repatriation program.

Note 6 – Long-Term Debt  



Long-term debt consists of the following:  



  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]  



Credit Facility  



On June 5, 2019, the Company entered into a new credit agreement with a consortium of banks led by JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as administrative agent, and the lenders (the "New Credit Facility"), which provides an aggregate commitment of $750,000 of revolving loans available until June 5, 2024. The New Credit Facility replaces Vishay’s previous credit agreement that provided for an aggregate commitment of $640,000, and that was scheduled to mature on December 10, 2020. The New Credit Facility also provides for the ability of Vishay to request up to $300,000 of incremental facilities, subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions, which could take the form of additional revolving commitments, incremental “term loan A” or “term loan B” facilities, or incremental equivalent debt.  



Borrowings under the New Credit Facility bear interest at LIBOR plus an interest margin. The applicable interest margin is based on Vishay's leverage ratio. Based on Vishay's current leverage ratio, borrowings bear interest at LIBOR plus 1.50%, the same as pursuant to the previous credit agreement. Vishay also pays a commitment fee, also based on its leverage ratio, on undrawn amounts. The undrawn commitment fee, based on Vishay's current leverage ratio, is 0.25% per annum, an improvement of 5 basis points over the previous credit agreement.   



The New Credit Facility allows an unlimited amount of defined “Investments,” which include certain intercompany transactions and acquisitions, provided the Company's pro forma leverage ratio is equal to or less than 2.75 to 1.00. If the Company's pro forma leverage ratio is greater than 2.75 to 1.00, such Investments are subject to certain limitations.  



The New Credit Facility also allows an unlimited amount of defined "Restricted Payments," which include cash dividends and share repurchases, provided the Company's pro forma leverage ratio is equal to or less than 2.50 to 1.00. If the Company's pro forma leverage ratio is greater than 2.50 to 1.00, the New Credit Facility allows such payments up to $100,000 per annum (subject to a cap of $300,000 for the term of the facility, with up to $25,000 of any unused amount of the $100,000 per annum base available for use in the next succeeding calendar year).  



Similar to the previous credit agreement, the borrowings under the New Credit Facility are secured by a lien on substantially all assets, including accounts receivable, inventory, machinery and equipment, and general intangibles (but excluding real estate, intellectual property registered or licensed solely for use in, or arising solely under the laws of, any country other than the United States, assets located solely outside of the United States and deposit and securities accounts), of Vishay and certain significant subsidiaries located in the United States, and pledges of stock in certain significant domestic and foreign subsidiaries; and are guaranteed by certain significant subsidiaries.   



The New Credit Facility continues to limit or restrict the Company and its subsidiaries, from, among other things, incurring indebtedness, incurring liens on its respective assets, making investments and acquisitions (assuming the Company’s pro forma leverage ratio is greater than 2.75 to 1.00), making asset sales, and paying cash dividends and making other restricted payments (assuming the Company's pro forma leverage ratio is greater than 2.50 to 1.00), and requires the Company to comply with other covenants, including the maintenance of specific financial ratios.  



Similar to the previous credit agreement, the New Credit Facility also contains customary events of default, including, but not limited to, failure to pay principal or interest, failure to pay or default under other material debt, material misrepresentation or breach of warranty, violation of certain covenants, a change of control, the commencement of bankruptcy proceedings, the insolvency of Vishay or certain of its significant subsidiaries, and the rendering of a judgment in excess of $50,000 against Vishay or its subsidiaries. Upon the occurrence of an event of default under the New Credit Facility, Vishay's obligations under the credit facility may be accelerated and the lending commitments under the credit facility may be terminated.

Convertible Debt Instruments  



The following table summarizes some key facts and terms regarding the outstanding convertible debt instruments as of June 29, 2019:  



  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]  



The terms of the convertible senior debentures due 2040 and due 2041 are generally congruent. The terms of the fully retired convertible senior debentures due 2042 were also generally congruent to the convertible senior debentures due 2040 and due 2041.  



Prior to three months before the maturity date, the holders may convert their convertible senior debentures due 2040 and due 2041 only under the following circumstances: (1) during any fiscal quarter after the first full quarter subsequent to issuance, if the sale price of Vishay common stock reaches 130% of the conversion price for a specified period; (2) the trading price of the debentures falls below 98% of the product of the sale price of Vishay's common stock and the conversion rate for a specified period; (3) Vishay calls any or all of the debentures for redemption, at any time prior to the close of business on the third scheduled trading day immediately preceding the redemption date; or (4) upon the occurrence of specified corporate events.  



Prior to December 15, 2024, the holders of the convertible senior notes due 2025 may convert their notes only under the following circumstances: (1) during any fiscal quarter after the fiscal quarter ending September 29, 2018, if the sale price of Vishay common stock reaches 130% of the conversion price for a specified period (initially $40.94); (2) the trading price of the notes falls below 98% of the product of the sale price of Vishay's common stock and the conversion rate for a specified period; or (3) upon the occurrence of specified corporate transactions.  



The convertible senior debentures due 2040 became convertible subsequent to the September 30, 2017 evaluation of the conversion criteria, and remained convertible for each subsequent quarterly evaluation through the June 29, 2019 evaluation, due to the sale price of Vishay's common stock exceeding 130% of the conversion price for the applicable periods. The convertible senior debentures due 2040 are not currently convertible.  



The quarterly cash dividend program of the Company results in adjustments to the conversion rate and effective conversion price for the convertible debt instruments effective as of the ex-dividend date of each cash dividend. The conversion rate and effective conversion price for the convertible senior notes due 2025 is adjusted for quarterly cash dividends to the extent such dividends exceed $0.085 per share of common stock.  



GAAP requires an issuer to separately account for the liability and equity components of the instrument in a manner that reflects the issuer’s nonconvertible debt borrowing rate when interest costs are recognized in subsequent periods. The resulting discount on the debt is amortized as non-cash interest expense in future periods.  



19  



NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED CONDENSED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 



(dollars in thousands, except per share amounts)    



The carrying values of the liability and equity components of the convertible debt instruments are reflected in the Company’s consolidated condensed balance sheets as follows:  



  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]  



Interest is payable on the convertible debt instruments semi-annually at the cash coupon rate; however, the remaining debt discount is being amortized as additional non-cash interest expense using an effective annual interest rate equal to the Company’s estimated nonconvertible debt borrowing rate at the time of issuance. In addition to ordinary interest, contingent interest will accrue in certain circumstances relating to the trading price of the convertible senior debentures due 2040 and due 2041 and under certain other circumstances, beginning ten years subsequent to their respective issuance. The convertible senior notes due 2025 do not possess contingent interest features.  



Interest expense related to the convertible debt instruments is reflected on the consolidated condensed statements of operations for the fiscal quarters ended:

(dollars in thousands, except per share amounts)    



Interest expense related to the convertible debt instruments is reflected on the consolidated condensed statements of operations for the six fiscal months ended:  



  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]  



The Company used cash to repurchase $960, $12,288 and $2,168 principal amounts of convertible senior debentures due 2040, due 2041, and due 2042, respectively, in the first fiscal quarter of 2019. The net carrying value of the debentures repurchased were $396, $4,770, and $924, respectively. In accordance with the authoritative accounting guidance for convertible debentures, the aggregate repurchase payment of $22,695 was allocated between the liability ($7,311) and equity (including temporary equity, $15,384) components of the convertible debentures, using the Company's nonconvertible debt borrowing rate at the time of the repurchase. As a result, the Company recognized a loss on extinguishment of convertible debentures of $1,307, including the write-off of a portion of unamortized debt issuance costs. The convertible senior debentures due 2042 have been fully repurchased, and the trustee has confirmed that the Company has satisfied and discharged its obligations under the indenture governing the convertible senior debentures due 2042.

Note 9 – Stock-Based Compensation  



The Company has various stockholder-approved programs which allow for the grant of stock-based compensation to officers, employees, and non-employee directors of the Company.  



The amount of compensation cost related to stock-based payment transactions is measured based on the grant-date fair value of the equity instruments issued. The Company determines compensation cost for restricted stock units (“RSUs”) and phantom stock units based on the grant-date fair value of the underlying common stock adjusted for expected dividends paid over the required vesting period for non-participating awards. Compensation cost is recognized over the period that an officer, employee, or non-employee director provides service in exchange for the award.  



The following table summarizes stock-based compensation expense recognized:  



  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]  



The Company recognizes compensation cost for RSUs that are expected to vest and records cumulative adjustments in the period that the expectation changes.

Phantom stock units participate in dividend distribution on the same basis as the Company's common stock and Class B common stock. Dividend equivalents are issued in the form of additional units of phantom stock. The phantom stock units are fully vested at all times.

Note 10 – Segment Information  



Vishay is a global manufacturer and supplier of electronic components. Vishay operates, and its chief operating decision maker makes strategic and operating decisions with regards to assessing performance and allocating resources based on, five reporting segments: MOSFETs, Diodes, Optoelectronic Components, Resistors & Inductors, and Capacitors. These segments represent groupings of product lines based on their functionality:  



  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]  



Vishay's reporting segments generate substantially all of their revenue from product sales to the industrial, automotive, telecommunications, computing, consumer products, power supplies, military and aerospace, and medical end markets. A small portion of revenues is from royalties.  



The Company evaluates business segment performance on operating income, exclusive of certain items (“segment operating income”). Only dedicated, direct selling, general, and administrative expenses of the segments are included in the calculation of segment operating income. The Company’s calculation of segment operating income excludes such selling, general, and administrative costs as global operations, sales and marketing, information systems, finance and administration groups, as well as restructuring and severance costs, goodwill and long-lived asset impairment charges, and other items. Management believes that evaluating segment performance excluding such items is meaningful because it provides insight with respect to intrinsic operating results of the Company. These items represent reconciling items between segment operating income and consolidated operating income. Business segment assets are the owned or allocated assets used by each business.  



The Company also regularly evaluates gross profit by segment to assist in the analysis of consolidated gross profit. The Company considers segment operating income to be the more important metric because it more fully captures the business operations of the segments.

Diluted earnings per share for the periods presented do not reflect the following weighted average potential common shares that would have an antidilutive effect or have unsatisfied performance conditions (in thousands):  



  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]  



The Company’s convertible debt instruments are only convertible for specified periods upon the occurrence of certain events. The convertible debentures due 2040 became convertible subsequent to the September 30, 2017 evaluation of the conversion criteria, and remained convertible for each subsequent quarterly evaluation prior to the June 29, 2019 evaluation. The Company's convertible debt instruments are not currently convertible. In periods that the convertible debt instruments are not convertible, the certain conditions which could trigger conversion of the debt instruments have been deemed to be non-substantive, and accordingly, the Company assumes the conversion of these instruments in its diluted earnings per share computation during periods in which they are dilutive.  



At the direction of its Board of Directors, the Company intends, upon conversion, to repay the principal amounts of any of the convertible debt instruments in cash and settle any additional amounts in shares of Vishay common stock. Accordingly, the convertible instruments are included in the diluted earnings per share computation using the “treasury stock method” (similar to options and warrants) rather than the “if converted method” otherwise required for convertible debt. Under the “treasury stock method,” Vishay calculates the number of shares issuable under the terms of the debentures based on the average market price of Vishay common stock during the period, and that number is included in the total diluted shares figure for the period. If the average market price is less than $12.63, no shares are included in the diluted earnings per share computation for the convertible senior debentures due 2040, if the average market price is less than $17.31, no shares are included in the diluted earnings per share computation for the convertible senior debentures due 2041, and if the average market price is less than $31.47, no shares are included in the diluted earnings per share computation for the convertible senior notes due 2025.

Note 12 – Fair Value Measurements  



The fair value measurement accounting guidance establishes a valuation hierarchy of the inputs used to measure fair value. This hierarchy prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value into three broad levels. The following is a brief description of those three levels:  



Level 1: Observable inputs such as quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.  



Level 2: Inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly. These include quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets and quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active.  



Level 3: Unobservable inputs that reflect the Company’s own assumptions.  



An asset or liability’s classification within the hierarchy is determined based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement. There have been no changes in the classification of any financial instruments within the fair value hierarchy in the periods presented.  



The following table provides the financial assets and liabilities carried at fair value measured on a recurring basis:  



  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]  



As described in Note 6, the Company allocated the aggregate repurchase payment of convertible senior debentures between the associated liability and equity components of the repurchased convertible senior debentures based on a nonrecurring fair value measurement of the convertible senior debentures due 2040, due 2041, and due 2042 immediately prior to the repurchase. The nonrecurring fair value measurement is considered a Level 3 measurement. See Note 6 for further information on the measurement and input.  



The Company maintains non-qualified trusts, referred to as “rabbi” trusts, to fund payments under deferred compensation and non-qualified pension plans. Rabbi trust assets consist primarily of marketable securities, classified as available-for-sale and company-owned life insurance assets. The marketable securities held in the rabbi trusts are valued using quoted market prices on the last business day of the period. The company-owned life insurance assets are valued in consultation with the Company’s insurance brokers using the value of underlying assets of the insurance contracts. The fair value measurement of the marketable securities held in the rabbi trust is considered a Level 1 measurement and the measurement of the company-owned life insurance assets is considered a Level 2 measurement within the fair value hierarchy.

The Company holds investments in equity securities that are intended to fund a portion of its pension and other postretirement benefit obligations outside of the United States. The investments are valued based on quoted market prices on the last business day of the period. The fair value measurement of the investments is considered a Level 1 measurement within the fair value hierarchy.  



The convertible senior debentures due 2040 and due 2041 contain embedded derivative features that GAAP requires to be bifurcated and remeasured each reporting period. Each quarter, the change in the fair value of the embedded derivative features, if any, is recorded in the consolidated condensed statements of operations. The Company uses a derivative valuation model to derive the value of the embedded derivative features. Key inputs into this valuation model are the Company’s current stock price, risk-free interest rates, the stock dividend yield, the stock volatility, and the debentures’ credit spread over LIBOR. The first three aforementioned inputs are based on observable market data and are considered Level 2 inputs while the last two aforementioned inputs are unobservable and thus require management’s judgment and are considered Level 3 inputs. The fair value measurement is considered a Level 3 measurement within the fair value hierarchy.  



The fair value of the long-term debt, excluding the derivative liabilities and deferred financing costs, at June 29, 2019 and December 31, 2018 is approximately $610,600 and $577,200, respectively, compared to its carrying value, excluding the derivative liabilities and deferred financing costs, of $538,329 and $509,407, respectively. The Company estimates the fair value of its long-term debt using a combination of quoted market prices for similar financing arrangements and expected future payments discounted at risk-adjusted rates, which are considered Level 2 inputs.  



At June 29, 2019 and December 31, 2018, the Company’s short-term investments were comprised of time deposits with financial institutions that have maturities that exceed 90 days from the date of acquisition; however they all mature within one year from the respective balance sheet dates. The Company's short-term investments are accounted for as held-to-maturity debt instruments, at amortized cost, which approximates their fair value. The investments are funded with excess cash not expected to be needed for operations prior to maturity; therefore, the Company believes it has the intent and ability to hold the short-term investments until maturity. At each reporting date, the Company performs an evaluation to determine if any unrealized losses are other-than-temporary. No other-than-temporary impairments have been recognized on these securities, and there are no unrecognized holding gains or losses for these securities during the periods presented. There have been no transfers to or from the held-to-maturity classification. All decreases in the account balance are due to returns of principal at the securities’ maturity dates. Interest on the securities is recognized as interest income when earned.  



At June 29, 2019 and December 31, 2018, the Company’s cash and cash equivalents were comprised of demand deposits, time deposits with maturities of three months or less when purchased, and money market funds. The Company estimates the fair value of its cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments using level 2 inputs. Based on the current interest rates for similar investments with comparable credit risk and time to maturity, the fair value of the Company's cash, cash equivalents, and held-to-maturity short-term investments approximate the carrying amounts reported in the consolidated condensed balance sheets.  



The Company’s financial instruments also include accounts receivable, short-term notes payable, and accounts payable. The carrying amounts for these financial instruments reported in the consolidated condensed balance sheets approximate their fair values.

Subsequent Events  



On July 29, 2019, the Company announced global cost reduction and management rejuvenation programs as part of its continuous efforts to improve efficiency and operating performance.  



The programs are primarily designed to reduce manufacturing fixed costs and selling, general, and administrative costs company-wide, and provide management rejuvenation. The Company expects to incur charges of approximately $25,000, primarily related to cash severance costs, to implement these programs. The Company expects these cost reductions to be fully achieved by December 2020.
