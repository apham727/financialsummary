NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
The accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements of Comtech Telecommunications Corp. and its subsidiaries ("Comtech," "we," "us," or "our") as of and for the three and nine months ended April 30, 2018 and 2017 are unaudited.
In the opinion of management, the information furnished reflects all material adjustments (which include normal recurring adjustments) necessary for a fair presentation of the results for the unaudited interim periods.
Our results of operations for such periods are not necessarily indicative of the results of operations to be expected for the full fiscal year.
The preparation of our condensed consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities, and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities, at the date of the condensed consolidated financial statements, and the reported amounts of net sales and expenses during the reported period.
Actual results may differ from those estimates.
Our condensed consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with our audited consolidated financial statements, filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC"), for the fiscal year ended July 31, 2017 and the notes thereto contained in our Annual Report on Form 10-K, and all of our other filings with the SEC.
Certain reclassifications have been made to previously reported condensed consolidated financial statements to conform to the current fiscal period presentation.
•FASB ASU No.
2017-09 "Compensation - Stock Compensation (Topic 718)" ("ASU 2017-09"), issued in May 2017, which provides guidance about which changes to the terms or conditions of a share-based payment award require an entity to apply modification accounting in ASC Topic 718.
An entity would not be required to account for changes to the terms or conditions of a share-based payment award as a modification if there were no changes to the award’s fair value, vesting conditions and classification.
Our adoption of this ASU on February 1, 2018 did not have any impact on our condensed consolidated financial statements.

Using the fair value hierarchy described in FASB ASC 820 "Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures," we valued our cash and cash equivalents using Level 1 inputs that were based on quoted market prices.
The fair value of the non-current portion of our Secured Credit Facility as of April 30, 2018 approximates its carrying amount due to its variable interest rate and pricing grid that is dependent upon our leverage ratio as of the end of each fiscal quarter.
We believe the fair value of our non-current portion of capital lease and other obligations, which currently has a blended interest rate of 6.0%, would not be materially different than its carrying value as of April 30, 2018.
As of April 30, 2018 and July 31, 2017, other than the financial instruments discussed above, we had no other significant assets or liabilities included in our Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets recorded at fair value, as such term is defined by FASB ASC 820.
Our basic earnings per share ("EPS") is computed based on the weighted average number of common shares (including vested but unissued stock units, share units, performance shares and restricted stock units ("RSUs")), outstanding during each respective period.
Our diluted EPS reflects the dilution from potential common stock issuable pursuant to the exercise of equity-classified stock-based awards, if dilutive, outstanding during each respective period.
Pursuant to FASB ASC 260 "Earnings Per Share," equity-classified stock-based awards that are subject to performance conditions are not considered in our diluted EPS calculations until the respective performance conditions have been satisfied.
When calculating our diluted earnings per share, we consider the amount an employee must pay upon assumed exercise of stock-based awards and the amount of stock-based compensation cost attributed to future services and not yet recognized.
On August 1, 2017, we adopted ASU 2016-09, which amends several aspects of the accounting for and reporting of share-based payment transactions.
As a result of our adoption of ASU 2016-09, the amount of excess tax benefits assuming exercise of in-the-money stock-based awards is no longer included in the calculation of diluted earnings per share on a prospective basis and the denominator for our diluted calculations could increase in the future as compared to prior calculations.
See Note (12) - "Stock-Based Compensation" for more information on the impact of adopting ASU 2016-09.
There were no purchases of our common stock during the nine months ended April 30, 2018 or 2017.
See Note (17) - "Stockholders’ Equity" for more information.
Weighted average stock options, RSUs and restricted stock outstanding of 1,505,000 and 1,912,000 for the three months ended April 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively, and 1,804,000 and 2,227,000 for the nine months ended April 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively, were not included in our diluted EPS calculation because their effect would have been anti-dilutive.
Our EPS calculations exclude 260,000 and 227,000 weighted average performance shares outstanding for the three months ended April 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively, and 257,000 and 233,000 weighted average performance shares outstanding for the nine months ended April 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively, as the performance conditions have not yet been satisfied.
However, the compensation expense related to these awards is included in net income (the numerator) for EPS calculations for each respective period.

Unbilled receivables relate to contracts-in-progress for which revenue has been recognized but we have not yet billed the customer for work performed.
We had $130,000 and $118,000 of retainage included in unbilled receivables at April 30, 2018 and July 31, 2017, respectively, and management estimates that substantially all of the unbilled receivables at April 30, 2018 will be billed and collected within one year.
Of the unbilled receivables from commercial and international customers at April 30, 2018 and July 31, 2017, approximately $1,049,000 and $2,995,000, respectively, relates to a large over-the-horizon microwave system contract with our large U.S. prime contractor customer (all of which related to our North African country end-customer).
As of April 30, 2018, the U.S. government (and its agencies) and Verizon Communications Inc. (through various divisions and, collectively, "Verizon") represented 29.3% and 14.5%, respectively, of total accounts receivable.
As of July 31, 2017, except for the U.S. government (and its agencies), which represented 23.9% of total accounts receivable, there were no other customers which accounted for greater than 10.0% of total accounts receivable.

As of April 30, 2018 and July 31, 2017, the amount of inventory directly related to long-term contracts (including contracts-in-progress) was $1,008,000 and $2,148,000, respectively.
As of April 30, 2018 and July 31, 2017, $1,722,000 and $1,718,000, respectively, of the inventory balance above related to contracts from third party commercial customers who outsource their manufacturing to us.
Accrued legal costs as of April 30, 2018 and July 31, 2017 include $3,377,000 and $4,120,000, respectively, related to estimated costs associated with certain TeleCommunication Systems, Inc. ("TCS") intellectual property matters.
The accrued potential settlement costs do not reflect the final amounts we may actually pay.
Ongoing legal costs associated with defending legacy TCS intellectual property matters and the ultimate resolution could vary and have a material adverse effect on our future consolidated results of operations, financial position or cash flows.
TCS intellectual property matters are discussed in more detail in Note (18) - "Legal Proceedings and Other Matters."
Accrued contract costs represent direct and indirect costs on contracts as well as estimates of amounts owed for invoices not yet received from vendors or reflected in accounts payable.
Accrued warranty obligations relate to estimated liabilities for warranty coverage that we provide to our customers.
We generally provide warranty coverage for some of our products for a period of at least one year from the date of delivery.
We record a liability for estimated warranty expense based on historical claims, product failure rates, a consideration of contractual obligations, future costs to resolve software issues and other factors.
Some of our product warranties are provided under long-term contracts, the costs of which are incorporated into our estimates of total contract costs.

Our total non-cancelable lease obligations were based on the actual lease term which runs from November 1, 2008 through October 31, 2018.
We estimated sublease income based on (i) the terms of a fully executed sublease agreement that expired on October 31, 2015, and (ii) our assessment of future uncertainties relating to the commercial real estate market.
Based on our assessment of commercial real estate market conditions, we currently believe that it is not probable that we will be able to sublease the facility for the remaining lease term.
As such, in accordance with grandfathered accounting standards that were not incorporated into the FASB’s ASC, we recorded these costs, at fair value, as assumed liabilities as of August 1, 2008, with a corresponding increase to goodwill.
As of July 31, 2017, the present value of the estimated facility exit costs was $1,941,000.
During the nine months ended April 30, 2018, we made cash payments of $1,214,000.
Interest accreted for the three and nine months ended April 30, 2018 and 2017 was $19,000 and $76,000, respectively, and $44,000 and $151,000, respectively, and is included in interest expense for each respective fiscal period.

TCS and Cost Reduction Activities
In connection with our February 23, 2016 acquisition of TCS, we continue to implement a tactical shift in strategy in our Government Solutions segment and have initiated certain cost reduction actions.
We continue to evaluate and implement cost reduction initiatives to reduce unnecessary spending, reduce the size and cost of our facilities and improve productivity.
To date, we have incurred an immaterial amount of severance and retention costs related to our shift in strategy.
On February 23, 2016, in connection with our acquisition of TCS, we entered into a $400,000,000 secured credit facility (the "Secured Credit Facility") with a syndicate of lenders.
The Secured Credit Facility, as amended June 6, 2017 (the "June 2017 Amendment"), comprises a senior secured term loan A facility of $250,000,000 (the "Term Loan Facility") and a secured revolving loan facility of up to $150,000,000, including a $25,000,000 letter of credit sublimit (the "Revolving Loan Facility") and, together with the Term Loan Facility, matures on February 23, 2021.
The proceeds of these borrowings were primarily used to finance our acquisition of TCS, including the repayment of certain existing indebtedness of TCS.
The Term Loan Facility requires mandatory quarterly repayments.
During the nine months ended April 30, 2018 and 2017, we repaid $14,657,000 and $7,747,000, respectively, principal amount of borrowings under the Term Loan Facility.
Under the Revolving Loan Facility, we had outstanding balances ranging from $41,904,000 to $66,804,000 during the nine months ended April 30, 2018.
Interest expense, including amortization of deferred financing costs, recorded during the three and nine months ended April 30, 2018 and 2017 related to the Secured Credit Facility was $2,351,000 and $7,166,000, respectively, and $2,641,000 and $8,524,000, respectively, and reflects a blended interest rate of approximately 5.49% and 4.83% for the three months ended April 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively, and 5.29% and 4.80% for the nine months ended April 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively.
At April 30, 2018, we had $3,268,000 of standby letters of credit outstanding under our Secured Credit Facility, as amended, related to our guarantees of future performance on certain customer contracts and no outstanding commercial letters of credit.

COMTECH TELECOMMUNICATIONS CORP. AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)
The Revolving Loan Facility is primarily used for working capital and other general corporate purposes of the Company and its subsidiaries, including the issuance of letters of credit.
Borrowings under the Secured Credit Facility, pursuant to terms defined in the Secured Credit Facility, shall be either (i) Alternate Base Rate ("ABR") borrowings, which bear interest from the applicable borrowing date at a rate per annum equal to (x) the greatest of (a) the Prime Rate in effect on such day, (b) the Federal Funds Effective Rate in effect on such day plus 0.50% per annum and (c) the Adjusted LIBO Rate on such day (or, if such day is not a business day, the immediately preceding business day) plus 1.00% per annum (provided that if the LIBO Rate is less than 1.00%, then the LIBO Rate shall be deemed to be 1.00%), plus (y) the Applicable Rate, or (ii) Eurodollar borrowings, which bear interest from the applicable borrowing date at a rate per annum equal to (x) the Adjusted LIBO Rate for such interest period (provided that if the LIBO Rate is less than 1.00%, then the LIBO Rate shall be deemed to be 1.00%) plus (y) the Applicable Rate.
The Applicable Rate is determined based on a pricing grid that is dependent upon our leverage ratio as of the end of each fiscal quarter.
The Secured Credit Facility contains customary representations, warranties and affirmative covenants and customary negative covenants, subject to negotiated exceptions, on (i) liens, (ii) investments, (iii) indebtedness, (iv) significant corporate changes, including mergers and acquisitions, (v) dispositions, (vi) restricted payments, including stockholder dividends, and (vii) certain other restrictive agreements.
The Secured Credit Facility also contains certain financial covenants and customary events of default (subject to grace periods, as appropriate), such as payment defaults, cross-defaults to other material indebtedness, bankruptcy and insolvency, the occurrence of a defined change in control and the failure to observe the negative covenants and other covenants related to the operation of our business.
As of April 30, 2018, our Leverage Ratio was 2.43x TTM Consolidated EBITDA compared to the maximum allowable Leverage Ratio of 3.10x TTM Consolidated EBITDA.
During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018, the maximum allowable Leverage Ratio will decrease to 3.00x TTM Consolidated EBITDA, with no further reductions thereafter.
Our Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio as of April 30, 2018 was 2.36x compared to the minimum required Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio of 1.25x.
The Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio will not change for the remaining term of the Secured Credit Facility, as amended.
Given our expected future business performance, we anticipate maintaining compliance with the terms and financial covenants in our Secured Credit Facility, as amended, for the foreseeable future.

The obligations under the Secured Credit Facility, as amended, are guaranteed by certain of our domestic subsidiaries (the "Subsidiary Guarantors").
As collateral security for amounts outstanding under our Secured Credit Facility, as amended, and the guarantees thereof, we and our Subsidiary Guarantors have granted to an administrative agent, for the benefit of the lenders, a lien on, and first priority security interest in, substantially all of our tangible and intangible assets.
Capitalized terms used but not defined herein have the meanings set forth for such terms in the Secured Credit Facility, dated as of February 23, 2016, and the First Amendment of the Secured Credit Facility, dated as of June 6, 2017, both of which have been documented and filed with the SEC.
We lease certain equipment under capital leases.
As of April 30, 2018 and July 31, 2017, the net book value of the leased assets which collateralize the capital lease and other obligations was $3,294,000 and $5,419,000, respectively, and consisted primarily of machinery and equipment.
Depreciation of leased assets is included in depreciation expense.
As of April 30, 2018, our capital lease and other obligations reflect a blended interest rate of approximately 6.0%.
Our capital leases generally contain provisions whereby we can purchase the equipment at the end of the lease for a one dollar buyout.
On December 22, 2017, H.R.1, also known as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act ("Tax Reform"), was enacted in the U.S. Tax Reform significantly lowered the amount of our current and future income tax expense primarily due to the reduction in the U.S. statutory income tax rate from 35.0% to 21.0%.
This provision went into effect on January 1, 2018 and required us to remeasure our deferred tax assets and liabilities.
In fiscal 2019 and beyond, Tax Reform will result in the loss of our ability to take the domestic production activities deduction, which has been repealed, and is also likely to result in lower tax deductions for certain executive compensation expenses.
For fiscal 2018, we will be subject to a 35.0% statutory income tax rate with respect to the period August 1, 2017 through December 31, 2017 and a 21.0% statutory income tax rate with respect to the period January 1, 2018 through July 31, 2018, or a blended statutory income tax rate for fiscal 2018 of approximately 27.0%.
As such, our effective tax rate for accounting purposes in fiscal 2018, excluding discrete items, is now expected to approximate 27.0%.
We expect to fully benefit from the lower statutory income tax rate in fiscal 2019 and thereafter.
During the nine months ended April 30, 2018, we recorded an estimated net discrete tax benefit of $14,071,000 which, as a result of Tax Reform, primarily related to the remeasurement of deferred tax liabilities associated with non-deductible amortization related to intangible assets.
The remeasurement was recorded pursuant to ASC 740 "Income Taxes" and SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin ("SAB") 118, using estimates based on reasonable and supportable assumptions and available information as of the reporting date.
As such, we expect to finalize this net discrete tax benefit during the remainder of fiscal 2018.
In addition, it is possible that the Internal Revenue Service ("IRS") will issue clarifying or interpretive guidance related to Tax Reform, which may ultimately result in a change to our estimated income tax.

At April 30, 2018 and July 31, 2017, total unrecognized tax benefits were $9,263,000 and $8,681,000, respectively, including interest of $181,000 and $95,000, respectively.
At April 30, 2018 and July 31, 2017, $2,592,000 and $2,515,000, respectively, of our unrecognized tax benefits were recorded as non-current income taxes payable in our Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets.
The remaining unrecognized tax benefits of $6,671,000 and $6,166,000 at April 30, 2018 and July 31, 2017, respectively, were presented as an offset to the associated non-current deferred tax assets in our Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets.
Of the total unrecognized tax benefits, $8,517,000 and $7,727,000, at April 30, 2018 and July 31, 2017, respectively, net of the reversal of the federal benefit recognized as a deferred tax asset relating to state reserves, excluding interest, would favorably impact our effective tax rate, if recognized.
Unrecognized tax benefits result from income tax positions taken or expected to be taken on our income tax returns for which a tax benefit has not been recorded in our condensed consolidated financial statements.
Our policy is to recognize interest and penalties relating to uncertain tax positions in income tax expense.
Since November 2017, our federal income tax return for fiscal 2016 has been under audit by the IRS.
The audit is ongoing and we are unaware of any proposed adjustments by the IRS.
Our federal income tax return for fiscal 2015 is also subject to potential future IRS audit.
None of our state income tax returns prior to fiscal 2013 are subject to audit.
TCS’s federal income tax returns for tax years 2014 and 2015 and the tax period from January 1, 2016 to February 23, 2016 are subject to potential IRS audit.
None of TCS’s state income tax returns prior to calendar year 2013 are subject to audit.
The results of the IRS tax audit for fiscal 2016, future tax assessments or settlements could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations and financial condition.
Overview
Excess tax benefits and shortfalls - ASU 2016-09 requires that all tax effects related to our share-based awards be recognized in the Condensed Consolidated Statement of Operations.
ASU 2016-09 also removes the prior requirement to delay recognition of excess tax benefits until it reduces current taxes payable; instead, we are now required to recognize excess tax benefits as discrete items in the interim period in which they occur, subject to normal valuation allowance considerations.
As ASU 2016-09 eliminated the concept of accumulated hypothetical tax benefits, excess tax benefits and shortfalls are no longer recognized in stockholders’ equity.
As a result, ASU 2016-09 is expected to result in future volatility of our income tax expense (as the future tax effects of share-based awards will be dependent on the price of our common stock at the time of settlement).
Additionally, on a prospective basis, excess income tax benefits from the settlement of share-based awards are presented as a cash inflow from operating activities in our Condensed Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows.
Diluted earnings per share - Prior to the adoption of ASU 2016-09, in addition to considering the amount an employee must pay upon assumed exercise of stock-based awards and the amount of stock-based compensation cost attributed to future services and not yet recognized, when calculating our diluted earnings per share, the assumed proceeds also included the amount of excess tax benefits, if any, that would have been credited to additional paid-in capital assuming exercise of in-the-money stock-based awards.
Effective with our adoption of ASU 2016-09, excess tax benefits are to be excluded from the calculation on a prospective basis.
As a result, the denominator for our diluted calculations could increase in the future as compared to prior calculations.

COMTECH TELECOMMUNICATIONS CORP. AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)
Forfeitures - As permitted by ASU 2016-09, we elected to continue to estimate forfeitures of share-based awards.
Statutory Tax Withholding Requirements - ASU 2016-09 now allows us, when net settling share-based awards, to withhold an amount up to the employees’ maximum individual tax rate in the relevant jurisdiction, without resulting in liability classification of the award.
To qualify, we must have at least some withholding obligation.
This aspect of adopting ASU 2016-09 did not have any material impact on us.
However, with respect to cash payments that we make to taxing authorities on behalf of employees for such shares withheld, on a retrospective basis, we are required to present such payments as a cash outflow from financing activities in our Condensed Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows (as opposed to operating activities).
As of April 30, 2018, the aggregate number of shares of common stock which may be issued, pursuant to the Plan, may not exceed 10,362,500.
Stock options granted may not have a term exceeding ten years or, in the case of an incentive stock award granted to a stockholder who owns stock representing more than 10.0% of the voting power, no more than five years.
We expect to settle all outstanding awards under the Plan and employee purchases under the ESPP with the issuance of new shares of our common stock.
Our ESPP provides for the issuance of up to 800,000 shares of our common stock.
Our ESPP is intended to provide our eligible employees the opportunity to acquire our common stock at 85% of fair market value at the date of issuance.
Through April 30, 2018, we have cumulatively issued 734,569 shares of our common stock to participating employees in connection with our ESPP.
Stock-based compensation for equity-classified awards is measured at the date of grant, based on an estimate of the fair value of the award and is generally expensed over the vesting period of the award.
At April 30, 2018, unrecognized stock-based compensation of $8,088,000, net of estimated forfeitures of $801,000, is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of 2.9 years.
Total stock-based compensation capitalized and included in ending inventory at both April 30, 2018 and July 31, 2017 was $12,000.
There are no liability-classified stock-based awards outstanding as of April 30, 2018 or July 31, 2017.

COMTECH TELECOMMUNICATIONS CORP. AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)
ESPP stock-based compensation expense primarily relates to the 15% discount offered to participants in the ESPP.
During the nine months ended April 30, 2018, we recorded a $62,000 net benefit which primarily represents the recoupment of certain share units.
The estimated income tax benefit as shown in the above table was computed using income tax rates expected to apply when the awards are settled.
Such deferred tax asset was recorded net as part of our non-current deferred tax liability in our Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet as of April 30, 2018 and July 31, 2017.
The actual income tax benefit recognized for tax reporting is based on the fair market value of our common stock at the time of settlement and can significantly differ from the estimated income tax benefit recorded for financial reporting.
Stock Options
Stock options outstanding as of April 30, 2018 have exercise prices ranging from $20.90 to $33.94, representing the fair market value of our common stock on the date of grant, a contractual term of five or ten years and a vesting period of three or five years.
The total intrinsic value relating to stock options exercised during the three and nine months ended April 30, 2018 was $225,000.
There were no stock options exercised during the nine months ended April 30, 2017.
There were no stock options granted during the nine months ended April 30, 2018 and 2017.

During the three and nine months ended April 30, 2018, at the election of certain holders of vested stock options, 63,410 stock options were net settled upon exercise.
As a result, 4,937 net shares of our common stock were issued after reduction of shares retained to satisfy the exercise price and minimum statutory tax withholding requirements.
Performance Shares, RSUs, Restricted Stock and Share Unit Awards
The total intrinsic value relating to fully-vested awards settled during the three months ended April 30, 2018 was $17,000.
There were no fully-vested awards converted into our common stock during the three months ended April 30, 2017.
The total intrinsic value relating to fully-vested awards settled during the nine months ended April 30, 2018 and 2017 was $1,964,000 and $633,000, respectively.
Performance shares granted to employees prior to fiscal 2014 generally vest over a 5.3 year period, beginning on the date of grant once pre-established performance goals were attained, and are convertible into shares of our common stock at the time of vesting, on a one-for-one basis for no cash consideration.
The performance shares granted to employees since fiscal 2014 principally vest over a three-year performance period, if pre-established performance goals are attained or as specified pursuant to the Plan and related agreements.
As of April 30, 2018, the number of outstanding performance shares included in the above table, and the related compensation expense prior to consideration of estimated pre-vesting forfeitures, assume achievement of the pre-established goals at a target level.
RSUs and restricted stock granted to non-employee directors have a vesting period of three years and are convertible into shares of our common stock generally at the time of termination, on a one-for-one basis for no cash consideration, or earlier under certain circumstances.
RSUs granted to employees have a vesting period of five years and are convertible into shares of our common stock, generally at the time of vesting, on a one-for-one basis for no cash consideration.
Share units granted prior to July 31, 2017 were vested when issued and are convertible into shares of our common stock, generally at the time of termination, on a one-for-one basis for no cash consideration, or earlier under certain circumstances.
Share units granted on or after July 31, 2017 were granted to certain employees in lieu of fiscal 2017 non-equity incentive compensation and are convertible into shares of our common stock on the one-year anniversary of the grant date.
Cumulatively through April 30, 2018, 14,777 share units granted have been settled.

The fair value of performance shares, RSUs, restricted stock and share units is determined using the closing market price of our common stock on the date of grant, less the present value of any estimated future dividend equivalents such awards are not entitled to receive and an applicable estimated discount for post vesting restrictions.
RSUs, performance shares and restricted stock granted since fiscal 2013 are entitled to dividend equivalents unless forfeited before vesting occurs; however, performance shares granted in fiscal 2013 were not entitled to such dividend equivalents until our Board of Directors determined that the pre-established performance goals were met.
Share units granted prior to fiscal 2014 are not entitled to dividend equivalents.
Share units granted since fiscal 2014 are entitled to dividend equivalents while the underlying shares are unissued.
Dividend equivalents are subject to forfeiture, similar to the terms of the underlying stock-based awards, and are payable in cash generally at the time of settlement of the underlying shares into our common stock.
During the nine months ended April 30, 2018, we accrued $247,000 of dividend equivalents and paid out $129,000.
Accrued dividend equivalents were recorded as a reduction to retained earnings.
As of April 30, 2018 and July 31, 2017, accrued dividend equivalents were $672,000 and $554,000, respectively.
We recorded $96,000 of income tax expense in our Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations for the nine months ended April 30, 2018, which represents net income tax shortfalls from the settlement of stock-based awards and the reversal of deferred tax assets associated with expired and unexercised stock-based awards.
During the nine months ended April 30, 2017, net income tax shortfalls from similar items totaled $590,000 and, pursuant to prior GAAP, were recorded as a reduction to additional paid-in capital.
Sales to U.S. government customers include sales to the U.S. Department of Defense ("DoD"), intelligence and civilian agencies, as well as sales directly to or through prime contractors.
Domestic sales include sales to commercial customers, as well as to U.S. state and local governments.
Included in domestic sales, are sales to Verizon which represented 9.8% and 10.6% of consolidated net sales for the three and nine months ended April 30, 2018, respectively.
Sales to Verizon were less than 10.0% of consolidated net sales for the three and nine months ended April 30, 2017.
International sales for the three months ended April 30, 2018 and 2017 (which include sales to U.S. domestic companies for inclusion in products that are sold to international customers) were $36,316,000 and $34,131,000, respectively.
International sales for the nine months ended April 30, 2018 and 2017 (which include sales to U.S. domestic companies for inclusion in products that are sold to international customers) were $100,030,000 and $116,588,000, respectively.
Except for the U.S., no individual country (including sales to U.S. domestic companies for inclusion in products that are sold to a foreign country) represented more than 10% of consolidated net sales for the three and nine months ended April 30, 2018 and 2017.

NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)
Reportable operating segments are determined based on Comtech’s management approach.
The management approach, as defined by FASB ASC 280 "Segment Reporting" is based on the way that the chief operating decision-maker ("CODM") organizes the segments within an enterprise for making decisions about resources to be allocated and assessing their performance.
Our CODM, for purposes of FASB ASC 280, is our Chief Executive Officer and President.
Our Commercial Solutions segment serves commercial customers and smaller government customers, such as state and local governments, that require advanced communications technologies to meet their needs.
This segment also serves certain large government customers (including the U.S. government) when they have requirements for off-the-shelf commercial equipment.
Commercial solutions products include satellite earth station communications equipment such as modems and traveling wave tube amplifiers, public safety technologies including those that are utilized in next generation 911 systems and enterprise technologies such as trusted location and text-messaging platforms.
Our Government Solutions segment serves large U.S. and foreign government end-users that require mission critical technologies and systems.
Government solutions products include command and control technologies (such as mobile satellite transceivers used on the Blue Force Tracking-1 and Blue Force Tracking-2 programs), troposcatter technologies systems (such as digital troposcatter multiplexers, digital over-the-horizon modems, troposcatter systems and frequency converter systems) and RF power and switching technologies products (such as solid-state high-power narrow and broadband amplifiers, enhanced position location reporting system ("EPLRS") amplifier assemblies, identification friend or foe amplifiers and amplifiers used in the counteraction of improvised explosive devices).

Intersegment sales for the three months ended April 30, 2018 and 2017 by the Commercial Solutions segment to the Government Solutions segment were $2,664,000 and $2,812,000, respectively.
Intersegment sales for the nine months ended April 30, 2018 and 2017 by the Commercial Solutions segment to the Government Solutions segment were $7,613,000 and $9,297,000, respectively.
There were nominal sales by the Government Solutions segment to the Commercial Solutions segment for these periods.
All intersegment sales are eliminated in consolidation and are excluded from the tables above.
Unallocated assets at April 30, 2018 consist principally of cash and cash equivalents, income taxes receivable, corporate property, plant and equipment and deferred financing costs.
Substantially all of our long-lived assets are located in the U.S.
In accordance with FASB ASC 350 "Intangibles - Goodwill and Other," we perform a goodwill impairment analysis at least annually (in the first quarter of each fiscal year), unless indicators of impairment exist in interim periods.
If we fail the quantitative assessment of goodwill impairment ("quantitative assessment"), pursuant to our adoption of FASB ASU No.
2017-04 in fiscal 2017, we would be required to recognize an impairment loss equal to the amount that a reporting unit's carrying value exceeded its fair value; however, any loss recognized should not exceed the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit.
On August 1, 2017 (the first day of our fiscal 2018), we performed our annual quantitative assessment using market participant assumptions to determine if the fair value of each of our reporting units with goodwill exceeded its carrying value.
In making this assessment, we considered, among other things, expectations of projected net sales and cash flows, assumptions impacting the weighted average cost of capital, trends in trading multiples of comparable companies, changes in our stock price and changes in the carrying values of our reporting units with goodwill.
We also considered overall business conditions.
In performing the quantitative assessment, we estimated the fair value of each of our reporting units using a combination of the income and market approaches.
The income approach, also known as the discounted cash flow ("DCF") method, utilizes the present value of cash flows to estimate fair value.
The future cash flows for our reporting units were projected based on our estimates, at that time, of future revenues, operating income and other factors (such as working capital and capital expenditures).
For purposes of conducting our impairment analysis, we assumed revenue growth rates and cash flow projections that are below our actual long-term expectations.
The discount rates used in our DCF method were based on a weighted-average cost of capital ("WACC") determined from relevant market comparisons, adjusted upward for specific reporting unit risks (primarily the uncertainty of achieving projected operating cash flows).
A terminal value growth rate was applied to the final year of the projected period and reflected our estimate of stable, perpetual growth.
We then calculated a present value of the respective cash flows for each reporting unit to arrive at an estimate of fair value under the income approach.
Under the market approach, we estimated a fair value based on comparable companies' market multiples of revenues and earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization and factored in a control premium.
Finally, we compared our estimates of fair values to our August 1, 2017 total public market capitalization and assessed implied control premiums based on our common stock price of $18.47 as of August 1, 2017.

COMTECH TELECOMMUNICATIONS CORP. AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)
Based on our quantitative evaluation, we determined that our Commercial Solutions and Government Solutions reporting units had estimated fair values in excess of their carrying values of at least 17.8% and 52.9%, respectively, and concluded that our goodwill was not impaired and that neither of our two reporting units was at risk of failing the quantitative assessment.
However, in order to sensitize our goodwill impairment test, we performed a second analysis using only the income approach and concluded that neither reporting units' goodwill was impaired or at risk of failing the quantitative assessment.
It is possible that, during fiscal 2018 or beyond, business conditions (both in the U.S. and internationally) could deteriorate from the current state, our current or prospective customers could materially postpone, reduce or even forgo purchases of our products and services to a greater extent than we currently anticipate, or our common stock price could decline.
A significant decline in our customers' spending that is greater than we anticipate or a shift in funding priorities may also have a negative effect on future orders, sales, income and cash flows and we might be required to perform a quantitative assessment during fiscal 2018 or beyond.
If assumed net sales and cash flow projections are not achieved in future periods or our common stock price significantly declines from current levels, our Commercial Solutions and Government Solutions reporting units could be at risk of failing the quantitative assessment and goodwill assigned to the respective reporting units could be impaired.
Any impairment charges that we may record in the future could be material to our results of operation and financial condition.
In any event, we are required to perform the next annual goodwill impairment analysis on August 1, 2018 (the start of our fiscal 2019).
If our assumptions and related estimates change in the future, or if we change our reporting unit structure or other events and circumstances change (e.g., a sustained decrease in the price of our common stock (considered on both absolute terms and relative to peers)), we may be required to record impairment charges when we perform these tests, or in other future periods.
The weighted average amortization period in the above table excludes fully amortized intangible assets.
Amortization expense for the three months ended April 30, 2018 and 2017 was $5,269,000 and $5,468,000, respectively.
Amortization expense for the nine months ended April 30, 2018 and 2017 was $15,806,000 and $17,555,000, respectively.

We review net intangible assets with finite lives for impairment when an event occurs indicating the potential for impairment.
No such event has occurred during the nine months ended April 30, 2018.
We believe that the carrying values of our net intangible assets were recoverable as of April 30, 2018.
Any impairment charges that we may record in the future could be material to our results of operation and financial condition.
Sale of Common Stock
In June 2016, the Company sold 7,145,000 shares of its common stock in a public offering at a price to the public of $14.00 per share, resulting in proceeds to the Company of $95,029,000, net of underwriting discounts and commissions.
As of April 30, 2018 and June 6, 2018, an aggregate registered amount of $74,970,000 under the Company's existing Shelf Registration Statement filed with the SEC remains available for sale of various types of securities, including debt.
Stock Repurchase Program
As of April 30, 2018 and June 6, 2018, we were authorized to repurchase up to an additional $8,664,000 of our common stock, pursuant to our current $100,000,000 stock repurchase program.
Our stock repurchase program has no time restrictions and repurchases may be made in open-market or privately negotiated transactions and may be made pursuant to SEC Rule 10b5-1 trading plans.
There were no repurchases made during the nine months ended April 30, 2018 or 2017.
Dividends
Since September 2010, we have paid quarterly dividends pursuant to an annual targeted dividend amount that was established by our Board of Directors.
On September 27, 2017, December 6, 2017 and March 7, 2018, our Board of Directors declared a dividend of $0.10 per common share, which was paid on November 17, 2017, February 16, 2018 and May 18, 2018, respectively.
On June 6, 2018, our Board of Directors declared a dividend of $0.10 per common share, payable on August 17, 2018 to stockholders of record at the close of business on July 16, 2018.
Future dividends remain subject to compliance with financial covenants under our Secured Credit Facility, as amended, as well as Board approval.
Legacy TCS Intellectual Property Matter - Vehicle IP
In December 2009, Vehicle IP, LLC ("Vehicle IP") filed a patent infringement lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware (the "District Court"), seeking monetary damages, fees and expenses and other relief from, among others, our customer Verizon Wireless ("Verizon"), based on the VZ Navigator product, and TCS is defending Verizon against Vehicle IP.
In 2013, the District Court granted the defendants’ motion for summary judgment on the basis that the products in question did not infringe plaintiff’s patent.
Plaintiff appealed that decision and, in 2014, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit reversed the District Court's claim construction, overturned the District Court's grant of summary judgment of noninfringement, and remanded the case for further proceedings.
Fact discovery and expert discovery has closed.
Substantive settlement conversations have occurred but, to date, the parties have been unable to reach a settlement.
As discussed in Note (7) -"Accrued Expenses and Other Current Liabilities," we have accrued certain legal and settlement costs related to the Vehicle IP matter.
The accrued settlement costs related to this matter do not reflect the final amounts we actually may pay, if any.

COMTECH TELECOMMUNICATIONS CORP. AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)
On May 30, 2017, we received positive news that the District Court issued a supplemental claim construction order in our favor.
As a result, the plaintiff agreed to file a joint status report to the District Court that requested that the District Court cancel the trial date (which was scheduled for July 2017).
On July 28, 2017, the parties entered into a stipulation that the defendants’ accused products do not infringe Vehicle IP’s patent under the District Court’s current revised construction of the disputed patent claim term and requested that the District Court therefore enter a judgment of noninfringement.
On August 18, 2017, the court entered such a judgment of noninfringment.
As expected, following the judgment, Vehicle IP filed a notice of appeal on August 29, 2017.
Vehicle IP's opening brief on appeal of the District Court's claim construction was submitted in October 2017.
TCS’s brief in response was filed on January 19, 2018.
Vehicle IP's reply brief was filed on February 23, 2018.
Oral argument has not yet been scheduled and an appellate ruling may take several months to a year to be issued.
If the District Court's current claim construction is ultimately upheld at the appellate level, it is possible that we may not have to go to trial or pay any monetary damages.
Ongoing legal expenses associated with defending this matter and its ultimate resolution could vary and have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations, financial position or cash flows in future periods.
Other Matters
In October 2014, we disclosed to the U.S. Department of the Treasury, Office of Foreign Assets Control ("OFAC") that we learned during a self-assessment of our export transactions that a shipment of modems sent to a Canadian customer by Comtech EF Data Corp. was incorporated into a communication system, the ultimate end user of which was the Sudan Civil Aviation Authority.
The sales value of this equipment was approximately $288,000.
At the time of shipment, OFAC regulations prohibited U.S. persons from doing business directly or indirectly with Sudan.
In late 2015, OFAC issued an administrative subpoena seeking further information about the disclosed transaction.
We have responded to the subpoena, including alerting OFAC to Comtech’s repair of three modems for a customer in Lebanon who may have rerouted the modems from Lebanon to Sudan without the required U.S. licensing authorization.
Subsequently, in October 2017, U.S. sanctions with respect to Sudan were revoked.
Consistent with the revocation of the Sudan Sanction Regulations ("SSR"), shipments to the Sudan Civil Aviation Authority by U.S. persons are now permissible.
We are not able to predict when OFAC will complete its review, nor whether it will take any enforcement action against us in light of the recent revocation of the SSR.
If OFAC determines that we have violated U.S. trade sanctions, civil and criminal penalties could apply, and we may suffer reputational harm.
Even though we take precautions to avoid engaging in transactions that may violate U.S. trade sanctions, those measures may not be effective in every instance.
In May 2018, we were informed by the Office of Export Enforcement ("OEE") of the Department of Commerce ("DoC") that it was forwarding to the DoC's Office of Chief Counsel, the results of its audit of international shipments by Comtech Xicom Technology, Inc. for further review and possible determination of an administrative penalty.
We fully cooperated with the OEE in their audit and, based on our self-assessment of the approximately 7,800 individual transactions audited, have determined that six (6) transactions may not have been fully in compliance with the Export Administration Regulations ("EAR").
These six (6) items, for which export licenses were not obtained, were either spares or repaired power amplifier subassembly components valued at less than $100,000 (in aggregate) and were shipped to Brazil, Italy, Russia, Thailand and the United Arab Emirates.
The EAR provides an exception to the requirement to obtain an export license for the replacement of a defective or damaged component.
During our self-assessment, we determined that we inadvertently did not obtain export licenses for the spares, or had evidence of the return or destruction of the defective or damaged components necessary to authorize our use of the export license exception for the replacements.
Since discovering this issue, we have implemented additional controls and procedures and have increased awareness of these specific export requirements throughout the Company to help avoid similar occurrences in the future.
Administrative penalties under the EAR can range from a warning letter to a denial of export privileges.
Given the lapsed legal status of the Export Administration Act ("EAA") itself, administrative penalties under the EAR are currently determined pursuant to the International Emergency Economic Powers Act ("IEEPA"), which can reach the greater of twice the amount of the transaction that is the basis of the violation or approximately $300,000 per violation.
We have not recorded an accrual related to a possible administrative penalty and continue to work cooperatively with the OEE.

In the ordinary course of business, we include indemnification provisions in certain of our customer contracts to indemnify, hold harmless and reimburse such customers for certain losses, including but not limited to losses related to third-party claims of intellectual property infringement arising from the customer’s use of our products or services.
From time to time, customers seek indemnification under these contractual arrangements and we evaluate such claims as and when they arise.
We do not always agree with customers that they are entitled to indemnification and in such cases reject their indemnification claims.
However, pending or future claims asserted against us by a party that we agree to indemnify could result in legal costs and damages that could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations and financial condition.
There are certain other pending and threatened legal actions which arise in the normal course of business.
Although the ultimate outcome of litigation is difficult to accurately predict, we believe that the outcome of these other pending and threatened actions will not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition or results of operations.
