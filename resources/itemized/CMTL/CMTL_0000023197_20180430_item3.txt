Item 3.
Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk
Our earnings and cash flows are subject to fluctuations due to changes in interest rates primarily from borrowings under our Secured Credit Facility, as amended.
Based on the amount of outstanding debt under our Secured Credit Facility, as amended, a hypothetical change in interest rates by 10% would change interest expense by $0.8 million over a one-year period.
Although we do not currently use interest rate derivative instruments to manage exposure to interest rate changes, we may choose to do so in the future in connection with our Secured Credit Facility, as amended.
Our earnings and cash flows are also subject to fluctuations due to changes in interest rates on our investment of available cash balances.
As of April 30, 2018, we had cash and cash equivalents of $44.2 million, which consisted of cash and highly-liquid money market deposit accounts.
Many of these investments are subject to fluctuations in interest rates, which could impact our results.
Based on our investment portfolio balance as of April 30, 2018, a hypothetical change in interest rates of 10% would have a nominal impact on interest income over a one-year period.
Ultimately, the availability of our cash and cash equivalents is dependent on a well-functioning liquid market.
