1. BASIS OF PRESENTATION



The accompanying unaudited interim Consolidated Financial Statements of Accenture plc and its controlled subsidiary companies have been prepared pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) for quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and do not include all of the information and note disclosures required by U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“U.S. GAAP”) for complete financial statements. We use the terms “Accenture,” “we” and “our” in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements to refer to Accenture plc and its subsidiaries. These Consolidated Financial Statements should therefore be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes thereto for the fiscal year ended August 31, 2017 included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC on October 26, 2017.



The accompanying unaudited interim Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP, which requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect amounts reported in the Consolidated Financial Statements and accompanying disclosures. Although these estimates are based on management’s best knowledge of current events and actions that we may undertake in the future, actual results may differ from those estimates. The Consolidated Financial Statements reflect all adjustments of a normal, recurring nature that are, in the opinion of management, necessary for a fair presentation of results for these interim periods. The results of operations for the three and six months ended February 28, 2018 are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for the fiscal year ending August 31, 2018. 



Allowances for Client Receivables and Unbilled Services



As of February 28, 2018 and August 31, 2017, total allowances recorded for client receivables and unbilled services were $52,236 and $74,450, respectively. 



Depreciation and Amortization



Depreciation expense was $107,445 and $213,596 for the three and six months ended February 28, 2018, respectively, and $84,639 and $169,659 for the three and six months ended February 28, 2017, respectively. As of February 28, 2018 and August 31, 2017, total accumulated depreciation was $2,042,405 and $1,912,146, respectively. Deferred transition amortization expense was $71,288 and $153,142 for the three and six months ended February 28, 2018, respectively, and $69,844 and $139,129 for the three and six months ended February 28, 2017, respectively. See Note 5 (Goodwill and Intangible Assets) for intangible asset amortization balances.

Basic and diluted earnings per share were calculated as follows:

_______________



(1)Diluted earnings per share assumes the redemption of all Accenture Holdings plc ordinary shares owned by holders of noncontrolling interests and the exchange of all Accenture Canada Holdings Inc. exchangeable shares for Accenture plc Class A ordinary shares on a one-for-one basis. The income effect does not take into account “Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests — other,” since those shares are not redeemable or exchangeable for Accenture plc Class A ordinary shares. See Note 11 (Subsequent Event) for additional information on Accenture Holdings plc.

4. BUSINESS COMBINATIONS 



During the six months ended February 28, 2018, we completed individually immaterial acquisitions for total consideration of $313,814, net of cash acquired. The pro forma effects of these acquisitions on our operations were not material.

The changes in the carrying amount of goodwill by reportable operating segment were as follows: 



[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]



Goodwill includes immaterial adjustments related to prior period acquisitions.

6. MATERIAL TRANSACTIONS AFFECTING SHAREHOLDERS’ EQUITY



Dividends 



Our dividend activity during the six months ended February 28, 2018 was as follows:



[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]



The payment of the cash dividends also resulted in the issuance of an immaterial number of additional restricted share units to holders of restricted share units. 



Subsequent Event



On March 21, 2018, the Board of Directors of Accenture plc declared a semi-annual cash dividend of $1.33 per share on its Class A ordinary shares for shareholders of record at the close of business on April 12, 2018 payable on May 15, 2018. The payment of the cash dividend will result in the issuance of an immaterial number of additional restricted share units to holders of restricted share units.



7. DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS



In the normal course of business, we use derivative financial instruments to manage foreign currency exchange rate risk. Our derivative financial instruments consist of deliverable and non-deliverable foreign currency forward contracts. 



Cash Flow Hedges



For a cash flow hedge, the effective portion of the change in estimated fair value of a hedging instrument is recorded in Accumulated other comprehensive loss as a separate component of Shareholders’ Equity and is reclassified into Cost of services in the Consolidated Income Statements during the period in which the hedged transaction is recognized. For information related to derivatives designated as cash flow hedges that were reclassified into Cost of services during the three and six months ended February 28, 2018 and 2017, as well as those expected to be reclassified into Cost of services in the next 12 months, see Note 3 (Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss) to these Consolidated Financial Statements. 



Other Derivatives



Realized gains or losses and changes in the estimated fair value of foreign currency forward contracts that have not been designated as hedges were net gains of $56,316 and $46,783 for the three and six months ended February 28, 2018, respectively, and a net gain of $19,780 and a net loss of $118,313 for the three and six months ended February 28, 2017, respectively. Gains and losses on these contracts are recorded in Other income (expense), net in the Consolidated Income Statements and are offset by gains and losses on the related hedged items.

Fair Value of Derivative Instruments



The notional and fair values of all derivative instruments were as follows: 



[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]



We utilize standard counterparty master agreements containing provisions for the netting of certain foreign currency transaction obligations and for the set-off of certain obligations in the event of an insolvency of one of the parties to the transaction. In the Consolidated Balance Sheets, we record derivative assets and liabilities at gross fair value. The potential effect of netting derivative assets against liabilities under the counterparty master agreements was as follows: 



[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]



8. INCOME TAXES



On December 22, 2017, the U.S. enacted the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the “Tax Act”), which significantly changed U.S. tax law. The Tax Act lowered the U.S. statutory federal income tax rate from 35% to 21%, effective January 1, 2018, resulting in a blended U.S. statutory federal income tax rate of 25.7% for our fiscal year ended August 31, 2018. The Tax Act could modestly impact our ongoing effective tax rate by imposing taxes on our intercompany transactions and limiting our ability to deduct certain expenses. 



Due to the timing of the enactment and the complexity involved in applying the provisions of the Tax Act, we have recorded provisional amounts in our financial statements as of February 28, 2018. We recognized a provisional tax expense of $136,724 primarily to remeasure our net deferred tax assets at the new, lower rates. As we collect and analyze data, including our forecast of when we expect to realize certain deferred tax amounts, we may adjust the provisional amounts. In addition, we have not yet made an accounting policy election to consider the taxes on our intercompany transactions in determining the amount of our valuation allowance. Those adjustments and the election may materially impact our provision for income taxes and effective tax rate in the period in which the adjustments are made. 



We apply an estimated annual effective tax rate to our year-to-date operating results to determine the interim provision for income tax expense. In addition, we recognize taxes related to unusual or infrequent items or resulting

(Unaudited)



from a change in judgment regarding a position taken in a prior year as discrete items in the interim period in which the event occurs. 



Our effective tax rates for the three months ended February 28, 2018 and 2017 were 26.1% and 20.7%, respectively. Our effective tax rates for the six months ended February 28, 2018 and 2017 were 23.0% and 20.5%, respectively. Excluding the provisional tax expense, described above, the effective tax rates would have been 15.1% and 18.0% for the three and six months ended February 28, 2018, respectively. The effective tax rates for the three and six months ended February 28, 2018 benefited from lower expenses for adjustments to prior year tax liabilities in fiscal 2018, partially offset by lower benefits from final determinations of prior year U.S. taxes in fiscal 2018. 



9. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES



Commitments 



We have either the right to purchase at fair value or, if certain events occur, may be required to purchase at fair value outstanding shares of our Avanade Inc. and SinnerSchrader AG subsidiaries. As of February 28, 2018 and August 31, 2017, we have reflected the fair value of $93,358 and $52,996, respectively, related to redeemable common stock and the intrinsic value of the options on redeemable common stock of these subsidiaries in Other accrued liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. 



Indemnifications and Guarantees



In the normal course of business and in conjunction with certain client engagements, we have entered into contractual arrangements through which it may be obligated to indemnify clients with respect to certain matters. 



As of February 28, 2018 and August 31, 2017, our aggregate potential liability to our clients for expressly limited guarantees involving the performance of third parties was approximately $872,000 and $697,000, respectively, of which all but approximately $154,000 and $149,000, respectively, may be recovered from the other third parties if we are obligated to make payments to the indemnified parties as a consequence of a performance default by the other third parties. For arrangements with unspecified limitations, we cannot reasonably estimate the aggregate maximum potential liability, as it is inherently difficult to predict the maximum potential amount of such payments, due to the conditional nature and unique facts of each particular arrangement. 



To date, we have not been required to make any significant payment under any of the arrangements described above. We have assessed the current status of performance/payment risk related to arrangements with limited guarantees, warranty obligations, unspecified limitations and/or indemnification provisions and believe that any potential payments would be immaterial to the Consolidated Financial Statements, as a whole. 



Legal Contingencies



As of February 28, 2018, we or our present personnel had been named as a defendant in various litigation matters. We and/or our personnel also from time to time are involved in investigations by various regulatory or legal authorities concerning matters arising in the course of our business around the world. Based on the present status of these matters, management believes the range of reasonably possible losses in addition to amounts accrued, net of insurance recoveries, will not have a material effect on our results of operations or financial condition.

11. SUBSEQUENT EVENT



On March 13, 2018, Accenture Holdings plc merged with and into Accenture plc. Accenture Holdings plc dissolved and all assets and liabilities were transferred to Accenture plc. Each ordinary shareholder of Accenture Holdings plc (other than Accenture plc and Accenture Holdings plc) received one Class A ordinary share of Accenture plc for every ordinary share in Accenture Holdings plc that they owned, and Accenture plc redeemed all Class X ordinary shares of Accenture plc held by such shareholders. The Consolidated Financial Statements reflect the ownership interests in Accenture Holdings plc and Accenture Canada Holdings Inc. held by certain current and former members of Accenture Leadership as noncontrolling interests. Prior to the merger, a 4% non-controlling ownership interest percentage was held by Accenture Holdings plc and Accenture Canada Holdings Inc. and subsequent to the merger, the non-controlling ownership percentage is less than 1% held by only Accenture Canada Holdings Inc.
