NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED CONDENSED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Unaudited)



(In Thousands, Except Share and Per Share Data)



1. Basis of Presentation



The accompanying unaudited consolidated condensed financial statements have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles for interim financial information and with the instructions to Form 10-Q and Article 10 of Regulation S-X. Accordingly, they do not include all of the information and footnotes required by generally accepted accounting principles for complete financial statements. In the opinion of management, all adjustments (consisting of normal recurring accruals) considered necessary for a fair presentation have been included, unless otherwise disclosed. Operating results for the three months ended July 1, 2018 are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for the fiscal year ending March 31, 2019. 



The consolidated condensed balance sheet at March 31, 2018 has been derived from the audited consolidated financial statements at that date but does not include all of the information and footnotes required by generally accepted accounting principles for complete financial statements. 



The financial statements should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes thereto included in the Company’s 2018 Annual Report on Form 10-K (SEC File No. 001-32253), which was filed on May 30, 2018 (the “2018 Annual Report”).



EnerSys (the “Company,”) reports interim financial information for 13-week periods, except for the first quarter, which always begins on April 1, and the fourth quarter, which always ends on March 31. The four quarters in fiscal 2019 end on July 1, 2018, September 30, 2018, December 30, 2018, and March 31, 2019, respectively. The four quarters in fiscal 2018 ended on July 2, 2017, October 1, 2017, December 31, 2017, and March 31, 2018, respectively.



The consolidated condensed financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its wholly-owned subsidiaries and any partially owned subsidiaries that the Company has the ability to control. All intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated in consolidation.



Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements



In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued ASU No. 2014-09, “Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606)” providing guidance on revenue from contracts with customers that supersedes most current revenue recognition guidance, including industry-specific guidance. The underlying principle is that an entity will recognize revenue to depict the transfer of goods or services to customers at an amount that the entity expects to be entitled to in exchange for those goods or services. In July 2015, the FASB voted to delay the effective date for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, with early adoption permissible one year earlier. The standard permits the use of either modified retrospective or full retrospective transition methods. 



The Company adopted the ASU on April 1, 2018 using the modified retrospective transition method. Under the modified retrospective transition method, the cumulative effect of applying Topic 606 to all contracts where all revenue has not been completely recognized under previously existing accounting principles that are not completed as of the date of adoption is recorded as an adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings (if applicable) while the comparative periods are not restated and continue to be reported under the accounting standards in effect for those periods. There was no cumulative effect of adopting the standard at the date of initial application in retained earnings. Concurrent with the adoption of the ASU, the Company has updated its revenue recognition policy as follows:



The Company determines revenue recognition by applying the following steps:



1. identify the contract with a customer;



2. identify the performance obligations in the contract;



3. determine the transaction price;



4. allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations; and



5. recognize revenue as the performance obligations are satisfied.



The Company recognizes revenue when (or as) performance obligations are satisfied by transferring control of the performance obligation to a customer. Control of a performance obligation may transfer to the customer either at a point in time or over time depending on an evaluation of the specific facts and circumstances for each contract, including the terms and conditions of the contract as agreed with the customer, as well as the nature of the products or services to be provided.



The Company's primary performance obligation to its customers is the delivery of finished goods and products, pursuant to purchase orders. Control of the products sold typically transfers to its customers at the point in time when the goods are shipped as this is also when title generally passes to its customers under the terms and conditions of our customer arrangements. 



Each customer purchase order sets forth the transaction price for the products and services purchased under that arrangement. Some customer arrangements include variable consideration, such as volume rebates, some of which depend upon our customers meeting specified performance criteria, such as a purchasing level over a period of time. The Company uses judgment to estimate the most likely amount of 



7

variable consideration at each reporting date. When estimating variable consideration we also apply judgment when considering the probability of whether a reversal of revenue could occur and only recognize revenue subject to this constraint.



Service revenues related to the work performed for the Company’s customers by its maintenance technicians generally represent a separate and distinct performance obligation. Control for these services passes to the customer as the services are performed. Service revenues for the first quarter of fiscal 2019 amounted to $35,482.



A small portion of the Company's customer arrangements oblige the Company to create customized products for its customers that require the bundling of both products and services into a single performance obligation because the individual products and services that are required to fulfill the customer requirements do not meet the definitions for a distinct performance obligation. These customized products generally have no alternative use to the Company and the terms and conditions of these arrangements give the Company the enforceable right to payment for performance completed to date, including a reasonable profit margin. For these arrangements, control transfers over time and the Company measures progress towards completion by selecting the input or output method that best depicts the transfer of control of the underlying goods and services to the customer for each respective arrangement. Methods used by the Company to measure progress toward completion include labor hours, costs incurred and units of production. Revenues recognized over time for the first quarter of fiscal 2019 amounted to $18,404.



On July 1, 2018, the aggregate transaction price allocated to unsatisfied (or partially unsatisfied) performance obligations was approximately $65,885, of which, the Company estimates that approximately $45,945 will be recognized as revenue in fiscal 2019, $19,072 in fiscal 2020, $734 in fiscal 2021, $112 in fiscal 2022 and $22 in fiscal 2023. 



The Company's typical payment terms are 30 days and sales arrangements do not contain any significant financing component for its customers. 



Any payments that are received from a customer in advance, prior to the satisfaction of a related performance obligation and billings in excess of revenue recognized, are deferred and treated as a contract liability. Advance payments and billings in excess of revenue recognized are classified as current or non-current based on the timing of when recognition of revenue is expected. As of July 1, 2018, the current and non-current portion of contract liabilities were $9,526 and $6,815, respectively. As of March 31, 2018, the current and non-current portion of contract liabilities were $9,387 and $7,094, respectively. The movement in the balances between March 31, 2018 and July 1, 2018 was not significant. Amounts representing work completed and not billed to customers represent contract assets and were $28,920 and $24,810 as of July 1, 2018 and March 31, 2018, respectively.



The Company uses historic customer product return data as a basis of estimation for customer returns and records the reduction of sales at the time revenue is recognized. At July 1, 2018, the right of return asset related to the value of inventory anticipated to be returned from customers was $2,647 and refund liability representing amounts estimated to be refunded to customers was $5,013.



Freight charges billed to customers are included in sales and the related shipping costs are included in cost of sales in the consolidated statements of income. If shipping activities are performed after a customer obtains control of a product, the Company applies a policy election to account for shipping as an activity to fulfill the promise to transfer the product to the customer. 



The Company applies a policy election to exclude transaction taxes collected from customers from sales when the tax is both imposed on and concurrent with a specific revenue-producing transaction.



The Company generally provides customers with a product warranty that provides assurance that the products meet standard specifications and are free of defects. The Company maintains a reserve for claims incurred under standard product warranty programs. Performance obligations related to service warranties are not material to the consolidated financial statements.



The Company pays sales commissions to its sales representatives which may be considered as incremental costs to obtain a contract. However, since the recoverability period is less than one year, the Company has utilized the practical expedient to record these costs of obtaining a contract as an expense as they are incurred.



In March 2017, the FASB issued ASU No. 2017-07, “Compensation—Retirement Benefits (Topic 715)”, which requires an entity to report the service cost component of pension and other postretirement benefit costs in the same line item as other compensation costs. The other components of net (benefit) cost will be required to be presented in the income statement separately from the service cost component and outside a subtotal of income from operations. This standard is effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, with early adoption permitted and requires the retrospective method to be applied to all periods presented. The Company adopted this guidance effective April 1, 2018. The service cost component of pension expense continues to be recognized in cost of goods sold whereas other components of pension expense have been reclassified to “Other (income) expense, net” in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income. The Company reclassified $323 and $361 from “Cost of goods sold” relating to the first quarter of fiscal 2019 and 2018, respectively, to “Other (income) expense, net” in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income.

Accounting Pronouncements Issued But Not Adopted as of July 1, 2018



In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02, “Leases (Topic 842)”, which sets out the principles for the recognition, measurement, presentation and disclosure of leases for both parties to a contract (i.e. lessees and lessors). This update requires lessees to apply a dual approach, classifying leases as either finance or operating leases based on the principle of whether or not the lease is effectively a financed purchase of the leased asset by the lessee. This classification will determine whether the lease expense is recognized based on an effective interest method or on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease. A lessee is also required to record a right-of-use asset and a lease liability for all leases with a term of greater than 12 months regardless of their classification. The new standard requires lessors to account for leases using an approach that is substantially equivalent to existing guidance for sales-type leases, direct financing leases and operating leases. This update is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2018, using a modified retrospective approach, with early adoption permitted. The Company is currently assessing the potential impact that the adoption will have on its consolidated financial statements.



In August 2017, the FASB issued ASU No. 2017-12, “Derivatives and Hedging (Topic 815)”: Targeted Improvements to Accounting for Hedging Activities, which amends and simplifies existing guidance in order to allow companies to more accurately present the economic effects of risk management activities in the financial statements. The guidance eliminates the requirement to separately measure and report hedge ineffectiveness and generally requires the entire change in the fair value of a hedging instrument to be presented in the same income statement line as the hedged item. The guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within those years. Early adoption is permitted in any interim period or fiscal year before the effective date. The Company is currently assessing the potential impact that the adoption will have on its consolidated financial statements.



In February 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-02, Income Statement - Reporting Comprehensive Income (Topic 220). The new standard will allow a reclassification from accumulated other comprehensive income to retained earnings for stranded tax effects resulting from the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (“Tax Act”). The amendments eliminate the stranded tax effects resulting from the Tax Act and will improve the usefulness of information reported to financial statements users. However, because the amendment only relates to the reclassification of the income tax effects of the Tax Act, the underlying guidance that requires that the effect of a change in tax laws or rates be included in income from continuing operations is not affected. The guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018 with early adoption permitted, including the interim periods within those years. The Company is currently assessing the potential impact that the adoption will have on its consolidated financial statements.

3. Fair Value of Financial Instruments



Recurring Fair Value Measurements



The following tables represent the financial assets and (liabilities) measured at fair value on a recurring basis as of July 1, 2018 and March 31, 2018, and the basis for that measurement:



[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]



9

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]



The fair values of lead forward contracts are calculated using observable prices for lead as quoted on the London Metal Exchange (“LME”) and, therefore, were classified as Level 2 within the fair value hierarchy, as described in Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies to the Company's consolidated financial statements included in its 2018 Annual Report.



The fair values for foreign currency forward contracts are based upon current quoted market prices and are classified as Level 2 based on the nature of the underlying market in which these derivatives are traded.



Financial Instruments



The fair values of the Company’s cash and cash equivalents approximate carrying value due to their short maturities. 



The fair value of the Company’s short-term debt and borrowings under the 2017 Credit Facility (as defined in Note 9), approximate their respective carrying value, as they are variable rate debt and the terms are comparable to market terms as of the balance sheet dates and are classified as Level 2.



The Company's 5.00% Senior Notes due 2023 (the “Notes”), with an original face value of $300,000, were issued in April 2015. The fair value of these Notes represent the trading values based upon quoted market prices and are classified as Level 2. The Notes were trading at approximately 99% and 102% of face value on July 1, 2018 and March 31, 2018, respectively. 



The carrying amounts and estimated fair values of the Company’s derivatives and Notes at July 1, 2018 and March 31, 2018 were as follows:



[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]



[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED][DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]



4. Derivative Financial Instruments



The Company utilizes derivative instruments to reduce its exposure to fluctuations in commodity prices and foreign exchange rates under established procedures and controls. The Company does not enter into derivative contracts for speculative purposes. The Company’s agreements are with creditworthy financial institutions and the Company anticipates performance by counterparties to these contracts and therefore no material loss is expected.



Derivatives in Cash Flow Hedging Relationships



Lead Forward Contracts



The Company enters into lead forward contracts to fix the price for a portion of its lead purchases. Management considers the lead forward contracts to be effective against changes in the cash flows of the underlying lead purchases. The vast majority of such contracts are for a period not extending beyond one year. At July 1, 2018 and March 31, 2018, the Company has hedged the price to purchase approximately 58.8 million pounds and 62.9 million pounds of lead, respectively, for a total purchase price of $64,320 and $72,207, respectively.



10

Foreign Currency Forward Contracts



The Company uses foreign currency forward contracts and options to hedge a portion of the Company’s foreign currency exposures for lead, as well as other foreign currency exposures so that gains and losses on these contracts offset changes in the underlying foreign currency denominated exposures. The vast majority of such contracts are for a period not extending beyond one year. As of July 1, 2018 and March 31, 2018, the Company had entered into a total of $57,383 and $54,164, respectively, of such contracts.



In the coming twelve months, the Company anticipates that $3,038 of pretax loss relating to lead and foreign currency forward contracts will be reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive income (“AOCI”) as part of cost of goods sold. This amount represents the current net unrealized impact of hedging lead and foreign exchange rates, which will change as market rates change in the future, and will ultimately be realized in the Consolidated Condensed Statements of Income as an offset to the corresponding actual changes in lead costs to be realized in connection with the variable lead cost and foreign exchange rates being hedged.



Derivatives not Designated in Hedging Relationships



Foreign Currency Forward Contracts



The Company also enters into foreign currency forward contracts to economically hedge foreign currency fluctuations on intercompany loans and foreign currency denominated receivables and payables. These are not designated as hedging instruments and changes in fair value of these instruments are recorded directly in the Consolidated Condensed Statements of Income. As of July 1, 2018 and March 31, 2018, the notional amount of these contracts was $27,258 and $28,486, respectively. 



Presented below in tabular form is information on the location and amounts of derivative fair values in the Consolidated Condensed Balance Sheets and derivative gains and losses in the Consolidated Condensed Statements of Income:

5. Income Taxes



The Company’s income tax provision consists of federal, state and foreign income taxes. The tax provision for the first quarter of fiscal 2019 and 2018 was based on the estimated effective tax rates applicable for the full years ending March 31, 2019 and March 31, 2018, respectively, after giving effect to items specifically related to the interim periods. The Company’s effective income tax rate with respect to any period may be volatile based on the mix of income in the tax jurisdictions in which the Company operates, change in tax laws and the amount of the Company's consolidated income before taxes. 



On December 22, 2017, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (“Tax Act”) was enacted into law. Among the significant changes resulting from the law, the Tax Act reduced the U.S. federal income tax rate from 35% to 21% effective January 1, 2018, and required companies to pay a one-time transition tax on unrepatriated cumulative non-U.S. earnings of foreign subsidiaries and created new taxes on certain foreign sourced earnings. The U.S. federal statutory tax rate for fiscal 2019 is 21.0%.



As of July 1, 2018, the Company has not completed its accounting for the tax effects of enactment of the Tax Act; however, it has made a reasonable estimate of the effects on its existing deferred tax balances and the one-time transition tax. The Company did not obtain additional information during the quarter affecting the provisional amounts initially recorded for the year ended March 31, 2018. In accordance with Staff Accounting Bulletin 118, these amounts are considered provisional and may be affected by future guidance, if and when issued. The Company’s estimate of its transition tax liability may change when the Company finalizes both the calculation of post-1986 foreign E&P previously deferred from U.S. federal taxation and the amounts held in cash or other specified assets.



Beginning in fiscal 2019, the global intangible low-taxed income (“GILTI”), foreign derived intangible income (“FDII”), and base-erosion and anti-abuse (“BEAT”) provisions became effective. The GILTI provisions require the Company to include in its US income tax return foreign subsidiary earnings in excess of an allowable return on the foreign subsidiary’s tangible assets. Due to the complexities of the GILTI tax rules, the Company is continuing to evaluate the application of ASC 740. Under US GAAP, the Company is allowed to make an accounting policy choice of either (1) treating the taxes due on future US inclusions in taxable income as a current-period expense when incurred (“period cost method”) or (2) factoring amounts into a Company’s measurement of its deferred taxes (“deferred method”). As of the first quarter of fiscal 2019, the Company has not elected an accounting policy treatment for which method the Company will utilize for GILTI. Based on existing legislative guidance and interpretation, the Company has estimated the impact on the tax provision of the GILTI inclusion, offset by the related foreign tax credit, and expects the annual effective tax rate to be increased by approximately 2.7%.



FDII allows a new deduction for U.S. corporations up to 37.5% of foreign derived intangible income. This is an export incentive that reduces the tax on foreign derived sales and service income in excess of a base amount to 13.125%. Based upon the existing legislative guidance and interpretation, the Company has estimated the impact on the annual effective tax rate to be decreased by approximately 0.5%. 



The BEAT provisions eliminate the deductions of certain base-erosion payments to related foreign corporations and impose a minimum tax if greater than regular tax. The Company does not expect to be subject to BEAT in fiscal 2019.



The consolidated effective income tax rates for the first quarter of fiscal 2019 and 2018 were 19.7% and 20.7%, respectively. The rate decrease in the first quarter of fiscal 2019 compared to the first quarter of fiscal 2018 is primarily due to changes in the mix of earnings among tax jurisdictions and items related to the Tax Act. The Tax Act items accounted for a net decrease of 2.6% comprised of a 4.8% decrease for the rate change, a 0.5% decrease for the FDII deduction and a 2.7% increase for GILTI inclusion.



Foreign income as a percentage of worldwide income is estimated to be 66% for fiscal 2019 compared to 69% for fiscal 2018. The foreign effective income tax rates for the first quarter of fiscal 2019 and 2018 were 11.8% and 11.6%, respectively. The rate increase compared to the prior year period is primarily due to changes in the mix of earnings among tax jurisdictions. Income from the Company's Swiss subsidiary comprised a substantial portion of the Company's overall foreign mix of income and is taxed at an effective income tax rate of approximately 6%.



6. Warranty



The Company provides for estimated product warranty expenses when the related products are sold, with related liabilities included within accrued expenses and other liabilities. As warranty estimates are forecasts that are based on the best available information, primarily historical claims experience, claims costs may ultimately differ from amounts provided. An analysis of changes in the liability for product warranties is as follows:

7. Commitments, Contingencies and Litigation



Litigation and Other Legal Matters



In the ordinary course of business, the Company and its subsidiaries are routinely defendants in or parties to pending and threatened legal actions and proceedings, including actions brought on behalf of various classes of claimants. These actions and proceedings are generally based on alleged violations of environmental, anticompetition, employment, contract and other laws. In some of these actions and proceedings, claims for substantial monetary damages are asserted against the Company and its subsidiaries. In the ordinary course of business, the Company and its subsidiaries are also subject to regulatory and governmental examinations, information gathering requests, inquiries, investigations, and threatened legal actions and proceedings. In connection with formal and informal inquiries by federal, state, local and foreign agencies, the Company and its subsidiaries receive numerous requests, subpoenas and orders for documents, testimony and information in connection with various aspects of their activities.



European Competition Investigations 



Certain of the Company’s European subsidiaries had received subpoenas and requests for documents and, in some cases, interviews from, and have had on-site inspections conducted by, the competition authorities of Belgium, Germany and the Netherlands relating to conduct and anticompetitive practices of certain industrial battery participants. 



The Company settled the Belgian regulatory proceeding in February 2016 by acknowledging certain anticompetitive practices and conduct and agreeing to pay a fine of $1,962, which was paid in March 2016. During the first quarter of fiscal 2019, the Company paid $1,272 towards certain aspects of this matter, which are under appeal. As of July 1, 2018 and March 31, 2018, the Company had a reserve balance of $933 and $2,326, respectively. 



In June 2017, the Company settled a portion of its previously disclosed proceeding involving the German competition authority relating to conduct involving the Company's motive power battery business and agreed to pay a fine of $14,811, which was paid in July 2017. As of July 1, 2018 and March 31, 2018, the Company had a reserve balance of $0 relating to this matter. Also in June 2017, the German competition authority issued a fining decision related to the Company's reserve power battery business, which constitutes the remaining portion of the previously disclosed German proceeding. The Company is appealing this decision, including payment of the proposed fine of $11,415, and believes that the reserve power matter does not, based on current facts and circumstances known to management, require an accrual. The Company is not required to escrow any portion of this fine during the appeal process.



In July 2017, the Company settled the Dutch regulatory proceeding and agreed to pay a fine of $11,229, which was paid in August 2017. As of July 1, 2018 and March 31, 2018, the Company had a reserve balance of $0 relating to the Dutch regulatory proceeding.



As of July 1, 2018 and March 31, 2018, the Company had a total reserve balance of $933 and $2,326, respectively, in connection with these investigations and other related legal matters, included in accrued expenses on the Consolidated Condensed Balance Sheets. The foregoing estimate of losses is based upon currently available information for these proceedings. However, the precise scope, timing and time period at issue, as well as the final outcome of the investigations or customer claims, remain uncertain. Accordingly, the Company’s estimate may change from time to time, and actual losses could vary.



Environmental Issues



As a result of its operations, the Company is subject to various federal, state, and local, as well as international environmental laws and regulations and is exposed to the costs and risks of registering, handling, processing, storing, transporting, and disposing of hazardous substances, especially lead and acid. The Company’s operations are also subject to federal, state, local and international occupational safety and health regulations, including laws and regulations relating to exposure to lead in the workplace. 



The Company is responsible for certain cleanup obligations at the former Yuasa battery facility in Sumter, South Carolina, that predates its ownership of this facility. This manufacturing facility was closed in 2001 and the Company established a reserve for this facility, which was $1,109 as of July 1, 2018 and March 31, 2018. Based on current information, the Company’s management believes this reserve is adequate to satisfy the Company’s environmental liabilities at this facility. This facility is separate from the Company’s current metal fabrication facility in Sumter.



Lead and Foreign Currency Forward Contracts



To stabilize its lead costs and reduce volatility from currency movements, the Company enters into contracts with financial institutions. The vast majority of such contracts are for a period not extending beyond one year. Please refer to Note 4 - Derivative Financial Instruments for more details.

8. Restructuring Plans



During fiscal 2017, the Company announced restructuring programs to improve efficiencies primarily related to its motive power production in EMEA. The Company estimates that the total charges for these actions will amount to approximately $4,700, primarily from cash charges for employee severance-related payments and other charges. The Company estimates that these actions will result in the reduction of approximately 45 employees upon completion. During fiscal 2017, the Company recorded restructuring charges of $3,104 and an additional $1,610 during fiscal 2018. The Company incurred $749 in costs against the accrual in fiscal 2017 and an additional $2,403 during fiscal 2018. During the first quarter of fiscal 2019, the Company incurred $491 against the accrual. As of July 1, 2018, the reserve balance associated with these actions is $1,211. The Company does not expect to be committed to additional restructuring charges related to this action, which is expected to be completed in fiscal 2019.



During fiscal 2018, the Company announced restructuring programs to improve efficiencies primarily related to supply chain and general operations in EMEA. The Company estimates that the total charges for these actions will amount to approximately $7,000, primarily from cash charges for employee severance-related payments and other charges. The Company estimates that these actions will result in the reduction of approximately 70 employees upon completion. During fiscal 2018, the Company recorded non-cash restructuring charges of $69 and cash charges of $2,260 and incurred $1,350 in costs against the accrual. During the first quarter of fiscal 2019, the Company recorded restructuring charges of $1,169 and incurred $309 in costs against the accrual. As of July 1, 2018, the reserve balance associated with these actions is $1,727. The Company expects to be committed to an additional $3,500 in restructuring charges related to this action, which it expects to complete in fiscal 2020.



During fiscal 2018, the Company announced a restructuring program to improve efficiencies of its general operations in the Americas. The Company estimates that the total charges for these actions will amount to approximately $1,000, from cash charges for employee severance-related payments to approximately 60 salaried employees. During fiscal 2018, the Company recorded restructuring charges of $960 and incurred $755 in costs against the accrual. During the first quarter of fiscal 2019, the Company incurred $95 in costs against the accrual. As of July 1, 2018, the reserve balance associated with this action is $112. The Company expects to complete this action in fiscal 2019.



During fiscal 2019, the Company announced a restructuring program to improve efficiencies of its reserve power operations in EMEA. The Company estimates that the total charges for these actions will amount to approximately $200, from charges primarily for employee severance-related payments to two employees. During the first quarter of fiscal 2019, the Company recorded restructuring charges of $23 and incurred $11 in costs against the accrual. As of July 1, 2018, the reserve balance associated with this action is $11. The Company expects to complete this action in fiscal 2019.



A roll-forward of the restructuring reserve is as follows:



[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]



Other Exit Charges



During the first quarter of fiscal 2019, in an effort to improve profitability, the Company converted its India operations from mainly reserve power production to motive power production. As a result of the Company’s exit from reserve power, the Company recorded a non-cash write off of reserve power inventories of $526, which was reported in cost of goods sold. In addition, the Company recorded a $547 write-off related to reserve power fixed assets in restructuring expenses.

The following summarizes the Company’s long-term debt as of July 1, 2018 and March 31, 2018:



[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]



5.00% Senior Notes



The Company's $300,000 Notes bear interest at a rate of 5.00% per annum and have an original face value of $300,000.
