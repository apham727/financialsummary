These forward-looking statements involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors that may cause our actual results, levels of activity, performance, or achievements to differ materially from those expressed or implied by these statements.
We discuss certain factors in greater detail in Business Overview below.
The terms fiscal 2018 and fiscal 2017 refer to our fiscal years ending April 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively.
ECONOMIC OVERVIEW
Corporate capital spending trends and commitments are the primary determinants of the size of the market for business software.
Corporate capital spending is, in turn, a function of general economic conditions in the U.S. and abroad and in particular may be affected by conditions in global credit markets.
In January 2018, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) provided an update to the World Economic Outlook (WEO) for the 2018 and 2019 world economic growth forecast.
The update noted that, Global economic activity continues to firm up.
Global output is estimated to have grown by 3.7 percent in 2017, which is 0.1 percentage point faster than projected in the fall and  1⁄2 percentage point higher than in 2016.
The pickup in growth has been broad based, with notable upside surprises in Europe and Asia.
Global growth forecasts for 2018 and 2019 have been revised upward by 0.2 percentage point to 3.9 percent.
The revision reflects increased global growth momentum and the expected impact of the recently approved U.S. tax policy changes.
For the remainder of fiscal 2018, we expect the global economy to improve when compared to the prior year, which could result in an improved selling environment.
Overall information technology spending is improving as a result of the current global economic environment.
We believe information technology spending will incrementally improve over the long term as increased global competition forces companies to improve productivity by upgrading their technology systems.
Although this improvement could slow or regress at any time, due in part to concerns in global capital markets and general economic conditions, we believe that our organizational and financial structure will enable us to take advantage of any sustained economic rebound.
Customers continue to take long periods to evaluate discretionary software purchases.
Table of Contents
We believe the improvement in economic conditions may be driving some businesses to invest in achieving more process and efficiency enhancements in their operations and to invest in solutions that improve operating margins, rather than make large infrastructure-type technology purchases.
If this trend continues, we believe it may tend to favor solutions such as our Logility supply chain solutions, which are designed to provide a more rapid return on investment and are targeted at some of the largest profit drivers in a customers business.
While the recent low growth environment has had a particularly adverse impact on the weaker companies in our target markets, we believe a large percentage of our customers are seeking to make investments to strengthen their operations, and some are taking advantage of current economic conditions to gain market share.
BUSINESS OVERVIEW
We provide our software solutions through three major business segments, which are further broken down into a total of six major product and service groups.
The three business segments are (1) Supply Chain Management (SCM), (2) Information Technology (IT) Consulting and (3) Other.
The SCM segment, consists of Logility, which provides supply chain optimization and advance retail planning solutions, as an integrated suite of sales and operations planning, demand optimization, inventory optimization, manufacturing planning and scheduling, supply optimization, retail allocation and merchandise planning and transportation optimization, as well as (i) DMI, which provides collaborative supply chain solutions to streamline and optimize the forecasting, inventory, production, supply, allocation, distribution and management of products between trading partners, (ii) New Generation Computing (NGC), which provides cloud solutions for supply chain management, product lifecycle management, quality control, vendor compliance and enterprise resource planning for both retailers and manufacturers in the apparel, sewn products and furniture industries, and, (iii) Halo, which provides advanced analytics and business intelligence solutions for the supply chain market.
The IT Consulting segment consists of The Proven Method, Inc., an IT staffing and consulting services firm, which provides support for our software products, such as software enhancements, documentation, updates, customer education, consulting, systems integration services, maintenance and support services.
The Other segment consists of (i) American Software ERP, which provides purchasing and materials management, customer order processing, financial, e-commerce and traditional manufacturing solutions, and (ii) unallocated corporate overhead expenses.
Our cost of revenue for licenses includes amortization of technology intangibles and capitalized computer software development costs, royalties paid to third-party software vendors, and agent commission expenses related to license revenues generated by the indirect channel, primarily from DMI.
Costs for maintenance and services include the cost of personnel to conduct implementations and customer support, consulting, other personnel-related expenses, and agent commission expenses related to maintenance revenues generated by the indirect channel, primarily from DMI.
We account for the development costs of software intended for sale in accordance with the IntangiblesGoodwill and Other topic of the Financial Accounting Standards Boards (FASB) Accounting Standards Codification.
We monitor the net realizable value of our capitalized software on a quarterly basis based on an estimate of future product revenues.
We currently expect to fully recover the value of the capitalized software asset recorded on our consolidated balance sheet; however, if future product revenues are less than managements current expectations, we may incur a write-down of capitalized software costs.
Our selling expenses generally include the salary and commissions paid to our sales professionals, along with marketing, promotional, travel and associated costs.
Our general and administrative expenses generally include the salary and benefits paid to executive, corporate and support personnel, as well as facilities-related costs, utilities, communications expenses, and various professional fees.
Table of Contents
      Dependence on Capital Spending Patterns.
There is a risk associated with our dependence on the capital spending patterns of U.S. and international businesses, which in turn are functions of economic trends and conditions over which we have no control.
      Acquisition Risks.
There are risks associated with acquisitions of complementary companies, products and technologies, including the risks that we will not achieve the financial and strategic goals that we contemplate at the time of the transaction.
More specifically, in any acquisition we will face risks and challenges associated with the uncertain value of the acquired business or assets, the difficulty of assimilating operations and personnel, integrating acquired technologies and products and maintaining the loyalty of the customers of the acquired business.
      Competitive Technologies.
There is a risk that our competitors may develop technologies that are substantially equivalent or superior to our technology.
A discussion of a number of additional risk factors associated with our business is included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended April 30, 2017, which risk factors have been supplemented by the risk factors appearing in Item 1A of Part II of this report on Form 10-Q.
Recent Accounting Pronouncements
In August 2015, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No.
2015-14, Revenue from Contracts with Customers  Deferral of Effective Date, which defers the implementation of ASU 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, for one year from the initial effective date.
The initial effective date of ASU No.
2014-09 was for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016, and early adoption was not permitted.
ASU No.
2015-14 extends the effective date to annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim reporting periods within that reporting period.
Earlier application is permitted only as of reporting periods beginning after December 16, 2016, including interim reporting periods within that reporting period.
The Company has performed a review of the requirements of the new revenue standard and is monitoring the activity of the FASB as it relates to specific interpretive guidance.
The Company plans to adopt ASU 2014-09, as well as other clarifications and technical guidance issued by the FASB related to this new revenue standard, on May 1, 2018.
The Company will apply the modified retrospective transition method, which would result in an adjustment to retained earnings for the cumulative effect, if any, of applying the standard to contracts in process as of the adoption date.
Under this method, the Company would not restate the prior financial statements presented.
Therefore, the new standard would require additional disclosures of the amount by which each financial statement line item is affected in the fiscal year 2019 reporting period.
In assessing the new standard, the Company has completed its review of representative contracts and identification of policy and differences resulting from the adoption of the new revenue standard.
The Company has drafted policy memos for all streams of revenue and expects to finalize by end of fiscal 2018.
The Company has also evaluated and is in the process of documenting internal controls over financial reporting surrounding the adoption of the standard and periodic reporting and disclosures.
The Company is still assessing the materiality of the standards adoption, including its impact on disclosures.
In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No.
2016-02, Leases (Topic 842), to increase transparency and comparability among organizations by recognizing lease assets and lease liabilities on the balance sheet and disclosing key information about leasing arrangements.
The ASU is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within those fiscal years.
Early adoption of the update is permitted.
The Company is evaluating the impact of the adoption of this update on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.

COMPARISON OF RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

Table of Contents
COMPARISON OF RESULTS OF OPERATIONS FOR THE THREE AND NINE MONTHS ENDED JANUARY 31, 2018 AND 2017
REVENUES
Table of Contents
The 14% increase in revenues over the three months ended January 31, 2018 when compared to the same period last year was attributable primarily to a 50% increase in license fee revenues and, to a lesser extent, a 9% increase in services and other revenues and a 5% increase in maintenance revenues.
The increase in license fee revenues was attributable to entering into several license fee agreements during the quarter in our SCM segment, due to an increase in general economic activity and higher overall business information technology spending from the US tax reform.
The primary reason for the increase in services and other revenues in the three months ended January 31, 2018 was an increase in implementation and cloud services in our SCM segment partially offset by a decrease in our IT consulting services due to decreased demand for IT temporary staff.
Due to intense competition in our industry, we do discount license fees from our published list price.
Numerous factors contribute to the amount of the discounts provided, such as previous customer purchases, the number of customer sites utilizing the software, the number of modules purchased and the number of users, as well as the overall size of the contract.
While all these factors may affect the discount amount of a particular contract, the overall percentage discount has not materially changed in the recent reported fiscal periods.
The change in our revenues from period to period is primarily due to the volume of products and related services sold in any period and the amount of products or modules purchased with each sale.
International revenues represented approximately 20% and 17% of total revenues in the three months ended January 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively.
Our revenues, in particular our international revenues, may fluctuate substantially from period to period primarily because we derive most of our license fee revenues from a relatively small number of customers in a given period.
License Revenues
For the three and nine months ended January 31, 2018, license fee revenues increased 50% and 6%, respectively, when compared to the same periods in the prior year.
In the three and nine months ended January 31, 2018, license fee revenues from our SCM business unit increased 49% and 6%, respectively, when compared to the corresponding periods in the prior year.
We believe that the increase was due to the economic improvement in the global economy and higher overall business information technology spending.
Our SCM business unit constituted 99% and 100% of total license fee revenues for the three months ended January 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively.
Our SCM business unit constituted 99% and 99% of total license fee revenues for the nine months ended January 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively.
Our Other business unit license fee revenues increased by 627% for the three months ended January 31, 2018 when compared to the same period in the prior year and decreased 22% in the nine months ended January 31, 2018 when compared to the same period in the prior year due to timing of closing ERP deals.
The direct sales channel provided approximately 91% and 83% of license fee revenues for the three and nine months ended January 31, 2018, compared to approximately 81% in each of the comparable periods last year.
The increase in the proportion of sales by our direct sales channel was due to a larger increase in license fee revenue from the SCM segments direct sales channel.
For the three months ended January 31, 2018 and 2017, our margins after commissions on direct sales were approximately 88% and 87%, respectively.
For the nine months ended January 31, 2018 and 2017, our margins after commissions on direct sales were approximately 87%.
The margins increased slightly in the current period due to the mix of sales commission rates based on each individual salespersons quotas and related achievement.
For the three months ended January 31, 2018 and 2017, our margins after commissions on indirect sales were approximately 32% and 41%, respectively.
For the nine months ended January 31, 2018 and 2017, our margins after commissions on indirect sales were approximately 36% and 44%, respectively.
The indirect channel margins for the
Table of Contents
 current quarter and year to date decreased when compared to the same periods in the prior year due to the mix of value-added reseller (VAR) commission rates.
These margin calculations include only commission expense for comparative purposes and do not include other costs of license fees such as amortization of capitalized software.
Services and Other Revenues
For the three and nine months ended January 31, 2018, services revenue increased by 9% and 4%, respectively, primarily due to increased services revenues from our SCM business unit partially offset by a decrease in our IT consulting business unit.
For the three and nine months ended January 31, 2018, a 24% and 17% increase, respectively, at our SCM business unit was due to services revenue related to our Logility cloud services area and an increase in utilization from project implementation services from higher license fees in prior periods.
For the three and nine months ended January 31, 2018, our IT Consulting segments revenues decreased 11% and 12%, respectively, when compared to the same periods in the prior year due lower project work.
For the three and nine months ended January 31, 2018, services and other revenues from our Other segment increased by 52% and 8%, respectively, when compared to the same periods in the prior year due to the timing of implementation work.
We have observed that there is a tendency for services and other revenues, other than from IT Consulting, to lag changes in license revenues by one to three quarters, as new licenses in one quarter often involve implementation and consulting services in subsequent quarters, for which we recognize revenues only as we perform those services.
For the three months ended January 31, 2018, cloud services Annual Contract Value (ACV) increased approximately 125% to $10.9 million compared to $4.9 million in the same period of the prior year.
ACV is comprised of software-as-a-service (SaaS) ACV of $8.1 million compared to approximately $2.6 million during the same period last year and other cloud services ACV of $2.8 million compared to $2.3 million during the same period last year.
ACV is a forward-looking operating measure used by management to better understand cloud services (SaaS and other related cloud services) revenue trends within our business, as it reflects our current estimate of revenue to be generated under existing client contracts in the forward 12-month period.
Maintenance Revenues
Table of Contents
For the three and nine months ended January 31, 2018, maintenance revenues increased 5% and 3%, respectively, when compared to the same periods in the prior year, due primarily to increased license fees in recent periods.
Our SCM Segment accounted for 97% and 96% of total maintenance revenues for the three and nine months ended January 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively.
Typically, our maintenance revenues have had a direct relationship to current and historic license fee revenues, since new licenses are the potential source of new maintenance customers.
GROSS MARGIN
For the three and nine months ended January 31, 2018, our total gross margin percentage increased when compared to the same periods in the prior year primarily due to a higher license fee margin from higher license fees and for the nine months ended January 31, 2018, to a lesser extent, due to an increase in gross margins in services and other and maintenance revenues.
Gross Margin on License Fees
License fee gross margin percentage for the three and nine months ended January 31, 2018 increased when compared to the same periods in the prior year due to higher license fees.
License fee gross margin percentage tends to be directly related to the level of license fee revenues due to the relatively fixed cost of computer software amortization expense, amortization of acquired software and the sales mix between our direct and indirect channels.
Gross Margin on Services and Other
For the nine months ended January 31, 2018, the gross margin percentage on services and other revenue increased by seven percentage points when compared to the same periods in the prior year primarily due to an increase in our Logility cloud services area which has higher margin services and related implementation services.
Also, the margin increase was partially offset by a decrease in services revenue from our lower margin IT business unit.
Services and other gross margin is directly related to the level of services and other revenues.
The primary component of cost of services and other revenues is services staffing, which is relatively inelastic in the short term.
Gross Margin on Maintenance
Maintenance gross margin percentage for the three months ended January 31, 2018 and 2017 remained flat at 79%.
For the nine months ended January 31, 2018 and 2017, the gross margin percentage had a slight uptick to 79% from 77%, respectively, primarily due to increased maintenance revenue and cost containment efforts.
Maintenance gross margin normally is directly related to the level of maintenance revenues.
The primary component of cost of maintenance revenue is maintenance staffing, which is relatively inelastic in the short term.
EXPENSES
Table of Contents
Research and Development
For the three and nine months ended January 31, 2018, gross product research and development costs increased 5% and 1%, respectively when compared to the same periods in the previous year due increased headcount and related expenses.
Capitalized software development costs increased 20% and 48%, respectively, for the three and nine months ended January 31, 2018 when compared to the same period last year due to timing of capitalizable project work.
We expect capitalized product development costs to remain consistent for the remainder of fiscal 2018 as compared to the third quarter of 2018, and we expect capitalized software amortization expense to be relatively stable in coming quarters.
Costs included in gross product development are salaries of product development personnel, hardware lease expense, computer software expense, telephone expense and rent.
Table of Contents
Sales and Marketing
Sales and marketing expenses for the three months ended January 31, 2018 and 2017 remained flat at 18% as a percentage of revenue.
For the nine months ended January 31, 2018 and 2017, we had a slight reduction in sales and marketing expenses to 18% from 19% as a percentage of revenue, respectively.
We generally include commissions on indirect sales in cost of sales.
General and Administrative
For the three and nine months ended January 31, 2018, general and administrative expenses increased when compared to the same periods a year ago due to the purchase of Halo and variable compensation.
At January 31, 2018, the total number of employees was 440 compared to 386 at January 31, 2017.
Our SCM segments operating income increased by 63% and 78% for the three and nine months ended January 31, 2018, respectively, compared to same period last year primarily due to higher overall revenues and higher margin cloud services.
Our IT Consulting segment operating income decreased 44% and increased 11% for the three and nine months ended January 31, 2018, respectively, when compared to the prior year due to lower revenues for the three month period and improved gross margins for the nine month period.
Our Other segment operating loss increased 26% and 14% in the three and nine months ended January 31, 2018, respectively, compared to the same period in the prior year primarily due to higher corporate variable compensation and lower revenues.
Other Income
Other income is comprised of net interest and dividend income, rental income net of related depreciation expenses, exchange rate gains and losses, and realized and unrealized gains and losses from investments.
For the three months ended January 31, 2018, the increase in other income was due primarily to a 1) higher unrealized gains on investments, 2) higher interest income and 3) an exchange rate gain of approximately $75,000 for the three months ended January 31, 2018 when compared to a loss of approximately $56,000 in the same period last year.
This increase was partially offset by lower rental income when compared to the same period last year as a result of our real estate sale in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017.
For the nine months ended January 31, 2018, the increase in other income was due primarily to a 1) higher unrealized gains on investments, 2) higher interest income of $1,120,000 for the nine months ended January 31, 2018 when compared to $882,000 in the same period in the prior year when compared to the same period last year and 3) higher exchange rate gains of approximately $75,000 for the nine months ended January 31, 2018 when compared to a loss of approximately $236,000 in the same period last year.
This increase was partially offset by lower rental income of $263,000 when compared to $697,000 the same period last year as a result of our real estate sale in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017.
We recorded gains of approximately $997,000 and $1.4 million for the three and nine months ended January 31, 2018, respectively, from our trading securities portfolio.
We recorded gains of approximately $564,000 and $170,000 the three and nine months ended January 31, 2017, respectively, from our trading securities portfolio.
For the three and nine months ended January 31, 2018, our investments generated an annualized yield of approximately 1.33% and 1.37%, respectively, compared to approximately 1.59% and 1.62% for the three and nine months ended January 31, 2017,
Table of Contents
Income Taxes
We recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities based on the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their tax bases.
We measure deferred tax assets and liabilities using statutory tax rates in effect in the year in which we expect the differences to reverse.
We establish a deferred tax asset for the expected future benefit of net operating loss and credit carry-forwards.
Under the Income Tax Topic of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification, we cannot recognize a deferred tax asset for the future benefit of our net operating losses, tax credits and temporary differences unless we can establish that it is more likely than not that the deferred tax asset would be realized.
On December 22, 2017, the U.S. enacted the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the Act), which significantly changed U.S. tax law.
The Act lowered our U.S. statutory federal income tax rate from 35% to 21% effective January 1, 2018.
For fiscal year 2018, our blended U.S. federal statutory tax rate is 30.3%.
This is the result of using the tax rate of 35% for the first eight months of fiscal year 2018 and the reduced tax rate of 21% for the final four months of fiscal year 2018.
During the third quarter of 2018, we recorded a $1.1 million benefit from the impact of changes in the tax rate, primarily on deferred tax assets and liabilities, which was included in income tax expense on our condensed consolidated statements of operations and deferred income taxes on our condensed consolidated balance sheets.
We remeasured our deferred taxes to reflect the reduced rate that will apply when these deferred taxes are settled or realized in future periods.
To calculate the remeasurement of deferred taxes, we estimated when the existing deferred taxes will be settled or realized.
During the three months ended January 31, 2018, our effective tax rate was 3.4% compared to our effective tax rate of 35.5% in the three months ended January 31, 2017.
During the nine months ended January 31, 2018, our effective rate was 22.5% compared to our effective rate of 31.4% in the nine months ended January 31, 2017.
Our effective tax rates were lower in both the three and nine months ended January 31, 2018 than the same period last year because of the Act.
Operating Pattern
We experience an irregular pattern of quarterly operating results, caused primarily by fluctuations in both the number and size of software license contracts received and delivered from quarter to quarter and our ability to recognize revenues in that quarter in accordance with our revenue recognition policies.
We expect this pattern to continue.
LIQUIDITY, CAPITAL RESOURCES AND FINANCIAL CONDITION
Sources and Uses of Cash
We have historically funded, and continue to fund, our operations and capital expenditures primarily with cash generated from operating activities.
The changes in net cash that our operating activities provide generally reflect the changes in net earnings and non-cash operating items plus the effect of changes in operating assets and liabilities, such as investment trading securities, trade accounts receivable, trade accounts payable, accrued expenses and deferred revenue.
We have no debt obligations or off-balance sheet financing arrangements, and therefore, we used no cash for debt service purposes.
The following table shows information about our cash flows and liquidity positions during the nine months ended January 31, 2018 and 2017.
You should read this table and the discussion that follows in conjunction with our condensed consolidated statements of cash flows contained in Item 1.
Financial Statements in Part I of this report and in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended April 30, 2017.
For the nine months ended January 31, 2018, the net cash provided by operating activities decreased when compared to the same period last year was due primarily to 1) an increase in purchases of trading securities, 2) an increase in customer accounts receivables compared to a decrease the same period last year caused by the timing of closing customer sales and related collections, 3) an increase
Table of Contents
The increase in cash used in investing activities when compared to the same period in the prior year was due primarily to the acquisition of Halo in the current quarter compared to the acquisition of AdapChain, Inc. in the prior year period and higher capitalized computer software development costs, partially offset by a decrease in purchases of property and equipment.
The decrease in cash used in financing activities compared to the prior year was primarily due to an increase in proceeds from exercise of stock options, partially offset by an increase in dividends paid.
Our total activities used more cash and investments during the nine months ended January 31, 2018, when compared to the prior year period, due primarily to the operating results and changes in operating assets and liabilities as noted above.
Days Sales Outstanding in accounts receivable were 70 days as of January 31, 2018, compared to 60 days as of January 31, 2017.
This increase is primarily due to billing timing of cash collections.
Our current ratio on January 31, 2018 was 2.3 to 1 and on January 31, 2017 was 2.4 to 1.
Our business in recent periods has generated substantial positive cash flow from operations, excluding purchases and proceeds of sale of trading securities.
For this reason, and because we had $88.4 million in cash and investments with no debt as of January 31, 2018, we believe that our sources of liquidity and capital resources will be sufficient to satisfy our presently anticipated requirements during at least the next twelve months for working capital, capital expenditures and other corporate needs.
However, at some future date we may need to seek additional sources of capital to meet our requirements.
If such need arises, we may be required to raise additional funds through equity or debt financing.
We do not currently have a bank line of credit.
We can provide no assurance that bank lines of credit or other financing will be available on terms acceptable to us.
If available, such financing may result in dilution to our shareholders or higher interest expense.
CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES
Table of Contents
We believe the critical accounting policies listed below affect significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of the financial statements.
Revenue Recognition.
We recognize revenue predominantly in accordance with the Software Revenue Recognition Topic of the Financial Accounting Standards Boards (FASB) Accounting Standards Codification.
We recognize license revenues in connection with license agreements for standard proprietary software upon delivery of the software, provided we deem collection to be probable, the fee is fixed or determinable, there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement, and VSOE exists with respect to any undelivered elements of the arrangement.
We generally bill maintenance fees annually in advance and recognize the resulting revenues ratably over the term of the maintenance agreement.
We derive revenues from services which primarily include consulting, implementation, training, SaaS, hosting and managed services.
We bill for these services primarily under time and materials arrangements and recognize fees as we perform the services.
Deferred revenues represent advance payments or billings for software licenses, services, and maintenance billed in advance of the time we recognize revenues.
We record revenues from sales of third-party products in accordance with Principal Agent Considerations within the Revenue Recognition Topic of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification.
Furthermore, we evaluate sales through our indirect channel on a case-by-case basis to determine whether the transaction should be recorded gross or net, including but not limited to assessing whether or not we (1) act as principal in the transaction, (2) take title to the products, (3) have risks and rewards of ownership, such as the risk of loss for collection, delivery, or returns, and (4) act as an agent or broker with compensation on a commission or fee basis.
Accordingly, our sales through the DMI channel are typically recorded on a gross basis.
Generally, our software products do not require significant modification or customization.
Installation of the products is routine and is not essential to their functionality.
Our sales frequently include maintenance contracts and professional services with the sale of our software licenses.
We have established VSOE for our maintenance contracts and professional services.
We determine fair value based upon the prices we charge to customers when we sell these elements separately.
We defer maintenance revenues, including those sold with the initial license fee, based on VSOE, and recognize the revenue ratably over the maintenance contract period.
We recognize consulting and training service revenues, including those sold with license fees, as we perform the services based on their established VSOE.
We determine the amount of revenue we allocate to the licenses sold with services or maintenance using the residual method of accounting.
Under the residual method, we allocate the total value of the arrangement first to the undelivered elements based on their VSOE and allocate the remainder to license fees.
SaaS revenues are recognized ratably over the subscription term as the customer has no ability to take delivery of the software, and the underlying arrangements typically include a single fee for the service that is billed monthly, quarterly or annually.
Allowance for Doubtful Accounts.
We maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of customers to make required payments.
If the financial condition of these customers were to deteriorate, resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments, we may require additional allowances or we may defer revenue until we determine that collectability is probable.
We specifically analyze accounts receivable and historical bad debts, customer creditworthiness, current economic trends and changes in customer payment terms when we evaluate the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts.
Valuation of Long-Lived and Intangible Assets.
In accordance with the Intangibles-Goodwill and Other Topic of the FASBs Accounting Standards Codification, we do not amortize goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite lives.
Our goodwill is subject to annual impairment tests, which require us to estimate the fair value of our business compared to the carrying value.
The impairment reviews require an analysis of future projections and assumptions about our operating performance.
Should such review indicate the assets are impaired, we would record an expense for the impaired assets.
In accordance with the Property, Plant, and Equipment Topic of the FASBs Accounting Standards Codification, long-lived assets, such as property and equipment and intangible assets, are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable.
Recoverability would be measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to the estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset.
If the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its estimated future cash flows, we recognize an impairment charge in the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the fair value of the asset.
The determination of estimated future cash flows, however, requires management to make estimates.
Future events and changes in circumstances may require us to record a significant impairment charge in the period in which such events or changes occur.
Impairment testing requires considerable analysis and judgment in determining results.
If other assumptions and estimates were used in our evaluations, the results could differ significantly.
Annual tests or other future events could cause us to conclude that impairment indicators exist and that our goodwill is impaired.
For example, if we had reason to believe that our recorded goodwill and intangible assets had become impaired due to decreases in the fair market value of the underlying business, we would have to take a charge to income for that portion of goodwill or intangible

 assets that we believed was impaired.
Any resulting impairment loss could have a material adverse impact on our financial position and results of operations.
At January 31, 2018, our goodwill balance was $25.5 million and our intangible assets with definite lives balance was approximately $6.2 million, net of accumulated amortization.
Valuation of Capitalized Software Assets.
We capitalize certain computer software development costs in accordance with the Intangibles-Goodwill and Other Topic of the FASBs Accounting Standards Codification.
Costs incurred internally to create a computer software product or to develop an enhancement to an existing product are charged to expense when incurred as research and development expense until technological feasibility for the respective product is established.
Thereafter, we capitalize all software development costs and report those costs at the lower of unamortized cost or net realizable value.
Capitalization ceases when the product or enhancement is available for general release to customers.
We make ongoing evaluations of the recoverability of our capitalized software projects by comparing the amount capitalized for each product to the estimated net realizable value of the product.
If such evaluations indicate that the unamortized software development costs exceed the net realizable value, we write off the amount by which the unamortized software development costs exceed net realizable value.
We amortize capitalized computer software development costs ratably based on the projected revenues associated with the related software or on a straight-line basis over three years, whichever method results in a higher level of amortization.
Amortization of capitalized computer software development costs is included in the cost of license revenues in the condensed consolidated statements of operations.
Stock-Based Compensation.
We estimate the value of options granted on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option pricing model.
Managements judgments and assumptions related to volatility, the expected term and the forfeiture rate are made in connection with the calculation of stock compensation expense.
We periodically review all assumptions used in our stock option pricing model.
Changes in these assumptions could have a significant impact on the amount of stock compensation expense.
Income Taxes.
We provide for the effect of income taxes on our financial position and results of operations in accordance with the Income Tax Topic of the FASBs Accounting Standards Codification.
Under this accounting guidance, income tax expense is recognized for the amount of income taxes payable or refundable for the current year and for the change in net deferred tax assets or liabilities resulting from events that are recorded for financial reporting purposes in a different reporting period than recorded in the tax return.
Management must make significant assumptions, judgments and estimates to determine our current provision for income taxes and also our deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance to be recorded against our net deferred tax asset.
Our judgments, assumptions and estimates relative to the current provision for income tax take into account current tax laws, our interpretation of current tax laws, allowable deductions, and projected tax credits.
Changes in tax law or our interpretation of tax laws could significantly impact the amounts provided for income taxes in our financial position and results of operations.
Our assumptions, judgments and estimates relative to the value of our deferred tax assets take into account our expectations of the amount and category of future taxable income.
Actual operating results and the underlying amount and category of income in future years, which could significantly increase tax expense, could render inaccurate our current assumptions, judgments and estimates of recoverable net deferred taxes.
Business Combinations and Intangible Assets Including Goodwill.
We account for business combinations using the acquisition method of accounting and accordingly, the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed are recorded based upon managements estimates of current fair values as of the acquisition date.
The estimation process includes analyses based on income and market approaches.
Goodwill represents the excess purchase price over the fair value of net assets, including the amount assigned to identifiable intangible assets.
The goodwill generated is due in part to the synergies that are not included in the fair value of identifiable intangible assets.
Goodwill recorded in an acquisition is assigned to applicable reporting units based on expected revenues.
Identifiable intangible assets with finite lives are amortized over there useful lives.
Amortization of current technology is recorded in cost of revenues-license and amortization of all other intangible assets is recorded in amortization of acquisition-related intangibles.
Acquisition-related costs, including advisory, legal, accounting, valuation and other costs, are expensed in general and administrative expenses in the periods in which the costs are incurred.
The results of operations of acquired businesses are included in the consolidated financial statements from the acquisition date.
