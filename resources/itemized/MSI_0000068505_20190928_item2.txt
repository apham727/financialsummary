Results of Operations—Three months ended September 28, 2019 compared to three months ended September 29, 2018 



The results of operations for the third quarter of 2019 are not necessarily indicative of the operating results to be expected for the full year. Historically, we have experienced higher revenues in the fourth quarter as compared to the rest of the quarters of our fiscal year as a result of the purchasing patterns of our customers.



Net Sales



[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]



The Products and Systems Integration segment’s net sales represented 68% of our consolidated net sales in the third quarter of 2019 and 69% in the third quarter of 2018. The Services and Software segment’s net sales represented 32% of our consolidated net sales in the third quarter of 2019 and 31% in the third quarter of 2018.



Net sales were up $132 million, or 7%, compared to the third quarter of 2018. The increase in net sales was driven by the Americas, partially offset by a sales decline in EMEA and AP, with a 5% increase in the Products and Systems Integration segment and a 12% increase in the Services and Software segment. Net sales includes:



•growth in Devices primarily due to strong demand in the Americas, inclusive of acquisitions;



•$58 million of revenue from the acquisitions of VaaS, WatchGuard, and Avtec; and



•partially offset by $21 million from unfavorable currency rates.



Regional results include:



•growth in the Americas region of 12% driven by growth in both segments, inclusive of revenue from acquisitions; 



•a decline in the AP region of 9% driven primarily by China and currency headwinds; and



•a decline in the EMEA region of 1% primarily due to large system deployments in the Middle East in the third quarter of 2018 and currency headwinds, partially offset by growth within Europe.



Products and Systems Integration



The 5% increase in the Products and Systems Integration segment was driven by the following:



•$27 million of revenue from the acquisitions of WatchGuard, VaaS and Avtec; 



•8% growth in Devices revenue primarily due to strong demand for land mobile radio ("LMR") and video devices in the Americas, inclusive of revenue from acquisitions; and[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

•higher margins within Services and Software primarily driven by higher margin contribution within our Software portfolio, inclusive of acquisitions.



Selling, General and Administrative Expenses



[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]



SG&A expenses increased 11% compared to the third quarter of 2018. SG&A expenses were 18.0% of net sales compared to 17.3% of net sales in the third quarter of 2018. The increase in SG&A expenditures is primarily due to increased expenses associated with acquired businesses.



Research and Development Expenditures



[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]



R&D expenditures increased 9% primarily due to increased expenses associated with acquired businesses. R&D expenditures were 8.6% of net sales compared to 8.5% of net sales in the third quarter of 2018. 



Other Charges



[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]



The reduction of Other charges in the third quarter of 2019 as compared to the third quarter of 2018 is primarily due to a $57 million environmental reserve expense that was recorded in the third quarter of 2018 and $15 million of net reorganization of business charges in the third quarter of 2019 as compared to $21 million in the third quarter of 2018 (see further detail in “Reorganization of Businesses” section).

Included in the $18 million were charges of $19 million related to employee separation costs, partially offset by $1 million of reversals for accruals no longer needed.



During the first nine months of 2019, we recorded net reorganization of business charges of $37 million including $27 million of charges in Other charges and $10 million of charges in Costs of sales in our Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations. Included in the $37 million were charges of $48 million related to employee separation, partially offset by $11 million of reversals for accruals no longer needed.

The reorganization of business accrual at September 28, 2019 was $77 million, of which relate to employee separation costs that are expected to be paid within one year.



As of January 1, 2019, accruals for exit costs are included in Operating lease liabilities with an offsetting impairment to our right-of use assets ("ROU"), all within our Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets (see Note 3 of our condensed consolidated financial statements).



Liquidity and Capital Resources



[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Operating Activities



The increase in operating cash flows from the first nine months of 2018 to the first nine months of 2019 was driven by:

Financing Activities



The increase in cash used for financing activities in the first nine months of 2019 as compared to the cash provided by financing activities in the first nine months of 2018 was driven by (also see further discussion in "Debt," "Credit Facilities," "Share Repurchase Program" and "Dividends" below): 



•a $1.0 billion increase in the repayment of debt; 



•a $157 million increase in the settlement of the conversion premium on the 2.00% senior convertible notes;



•a $104 million increase in share repurchases; and [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]



•partially offset by a $509 million increase in debt issuance.



Sales of Receivables



The following table summarizes the proceeds received from sales of accounts receivable and long-term customer financing receivables for the three and nine months ended September 28, 2019 and September 29, 2018: 



[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]



The proceeds of our receivable sales are included in "Operating activities" within our Condensed Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.



Debt



We had outstanding long-term debt of $5.7 billion and $5.3 billion, including the current portions of $617 million and $31 million at September 28, 2019 and December 31, 2018, respectively. 



In February of 2018, we issued $500 million of 4.60% Senior notes due 2028. After debt issuance costs and debt discounts, we recognized net proceeds of $497 million. These proceeds were then used to make a $500 million contribution to our U.S. pension plan in the first quarter of 2018. During the second half of 2018, we issued an additional $200 million on the outstanding 4.6% senior notes bringing the total outstanding principal to $700 million. We recognized net proceeds of $196 million after debt issuance costs and debt discounts, which was then used to pay the $200 million principal due to Silver Lake Partners on October 15, 2018.



To complete the acquisition of Avigilon during the quarter ended March 31, 2018, we entered into a term loan for $400 million with a maturity date of March 26, 2021 (the "Term Loan"). The interest on the Term Loan was variable, indexed to the London Inter-bank Offered Rate ("LIBOR"), and paid monthly. The weighted average borrowing rate for amounts outstanding during the three and nine months ended September 28, 2019 was 3.53% and 3.68%, respectively. During the three months ended September 28, 2019, we repaid all amounts borrowed under the Term Loan. 



In May of 2019, we issued $650 million of 4.60% Senior notes due 2029. We received proceeds of $645 million after debt issuance costs and debt discounts. These proceeds were then used to repurchase $614 million in principal amount of our 



39



outstanding long-term debt for a purchase price of $654 million, excluding approximately $3 million of accrued interest. After accelerating the amortization of debt issuance costs and debt discounts, we recognized a loss of approximately $43 million related to this repurchase in Other within Other income (expense) in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations. 



In August of 2019, we issued a follow-on $150 million to the outstanding 4.60% senior notes due 2029 bringing the outstanding total to $800 million. We recognized net proceeds of $159 million after debt premiums and debt issuance costs. These proceeds were then used to repurchase the remaining $150 million principal amount of the 3.5% senior notes due 2021 for a purchase price of $155 million, excluding approximately $2 million of accrued interest. After accelerating the amortization of debt issuance costs, we recognized a loss of approximately $7 million related to this repurchase in Other, net within Other income (expense) in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations.



In 2015, we entered into an agreement with Silver Lake Partners to issue $1.0 billion of 2.00% senior convertible notes which mature in September 2020 ("Senior Convertible Notes"). The notes became fully convertible as of August 25, 2017. The notes were convertible based on a conversion rate that may be adjusted for dividends declared and automatically adjusts the exercise price. During the third quarter of 2018, we repurchased $200 million in principal amount of the Senior Convertible Notes for aggregate consideration of $369 million in cash, inclusive of the conversion premium. 



As of the third quarter of 2019, the remaining notes were convertible based on a conversion rate of rate of 14.9186, adjusted for dividends declared, per $1,000 principal amount (equal to a conversion price of $67.03 per share). On September 5, 2019, we entered into an agreement with Silver Lake Partners to settle the remaining $800 million in principal amount of the Senior Convertible Notes in two installments: (ii) $200 million of notes were repurchased during the third quarter for an aggregate consideration of $526 million in cash, inclusive of the conversion premium and (ii) $600 million of principal in cash paid on October 7, 2019, and 5.5 million shares converted into common stock. As of September 28, 2019, we reflected the principal amount of $600 million paid subsequent to the quarter as short term debt and recognized a gain of $4 million from the extinguishment of the 2.00% senior convertible notes in Other, net within other income (expense) in the Condensed Consolidated Statement of Operations.



On September 5, 2019, we entered into an agreement with Silver Lake Partners to issue $1.0 billion of 1.75% senior convertible notes which mature in September 2024 ("New Senior Convertible Notes"). Interest on these notes is payable semiannually. The notes are convertible anytime on or after two years from their issuance date, except in certain limited circumstances. The notes are convertible based on a conversion rate of 4.9140 per $1,000 principal amount (which is equal to an initial conversion price of $203.50 per share). In the event of conversion, we intend to settle the principal amount of the New Senior Convertible Notes in cash. We recorded a debt liability associated with the New Senior Convertible Notes by determining the fair value of an equivalent debt instrument without a conversion option. Using a discount rate of 2.45%, which was determined based on a review of relevant market data, we calculated the debt liability to be $986 million, indicating a $14 million discount to be amortized over the expected life of the debt instrument. The remaining proceeds of $14 million were allocated to the conversion option and accordingly, increased Additional paid-in capital. 



During the third quarter of 2019, we established an unsecured commercial paper program, backed by the revolving credit facility, under which we may issue unsecured commercial paper notes up to a maximum aggregate principal amount of $2.2 billion outstanding at any one time. Proceeds from the issuances of the notes are expected to be used for general corporate purposes. As of September 28, 2019 we had no outstanding debt under the commercial paper program. Subsequent to the end of the quarter, the Company issued $265 million commercial paper under the program.



We continue to believe that we hold sufficient liquidity to cover the day-to-day operations of our business as well as any future volatility or uncertainty that may arise in the capital markets.



Credit Facilities



As of September 28, 2019, we had a $2.2 billion syndicated, unsecured revolving credit facility scheduled to mature in April 2022 (the "2017 Motorola Solutions Credit Agreement"). The 2017 Motorola Solutions Credit Agreement includes a $500 million letter of credit sub-limit with $450 million of fronting commitments. Borrowings under the facility bear interest at the prime rate plus the applicable margin, or at a spread above LIBOR, at our option. An annual facility fee is payable on the undrawn amount of the credit line. The interest rate and facility fee are subject to adjustment if our credit rating changes. We must comply with certain customary covenants including a maximum leverage ratio, as defined in the 2017 Motorola Solutions Credit Agreement. We were in compliance with our financial covenants as of September 28, 2019. During the first quarter of 2018, we borrowed $400 million to facilitate the Avigilon acquisition, which was subsequently paid during the fourth quarter of 2018. There were no borrowings outstanding or letters of credit issued under the revolving credit facility as of September 28, 2019.



Share Repurchase Program



During the nine months ended September 28, 2019, we paid an aggregate of $170 million, including transaction costs, to repurchase approximately 1.4 million shares at an average price of $122.31 per share. As of September 28, 2019, the Company had used approximately $12.6 billion of the share repurchase authority to repurchase shares, leaving $1.4 billion of authority available for future repurchases.



40



Dividends



During the third quarter of 2019, we paid $94 million in cash dividends to holders of our common stock. During the first nine months of 2019, we paid $281 million in cash dividends to holders of our common stock. Subsequent to quarter end, we paid an additional $98 million in cash dividends to holders of our common stock. 



Long-Term Customer Financing Commitments



We had outstanding commitments to provide long-term financing to third parties totaling $98 million at September 28, 2019, compared to $62 million at December 31, 2018. 



Recent Accounting Pronouncements



In August 2018, the FASB issued ASU No. 2018-14, “Compensation - Retirement Benefits - Defined Benefit Plans - General (Subtopic 715-20) - Changes to the Disclosure Requirements for Defined Benefit Plans,” which modifies the disclosure requirements for the defined benefit pension plans and other postretirement plans. The ASU is effective for us on January 1, 2021 with early adoption permitted. The ASU requires a retrospective adoption method. We do not believe the ASU will have a material impact on our financial statement disclosures.



In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-13, “Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments,” which requires us to measure and recognize expected credit losses for financial assets held and not accounted for at fair value through net income. In November 2018, April 2019 and May 2019, the FASB issued ASU No. 2018-19, “Codification Improvements to Topic 326, Financial Instruments - Credit Losses,”“ASU No. 2019-04, Codification Improvements to Topic 326, Financial Instruments - Credit Losses, ”“Topic 815, Derivatives and Hedging, and Topic 825, Financial Instruments,” and “ASU No. 2019-05, Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326): Targeted Transition Relief,” which provided additional implementation guidance on the previously issued ASU. The ASU is effective for us on January 1, 2020. The ASU requires a modified retrospective adoption method. We are still evaluating the impact of adoption on our financial statements and disclosures. 



Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements



In February 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued Accounting Standards Update ("ASU") No. 2016-02, "Leases," which amends existing guidance to require lessees to recognize assets and liabilities on the balance sheet for the rights and obligations created by long-term leases and to disclose additional quantitative and qualitative information about leasing arrangements. This was subsequently amended by ASU No. 2018-01, “Land Easement Practical Expedient for Transition to Topic 842,” ASU No. 2018-10, “Codification Improvements to Topic 842, Leases,” and ASU No. 2018-11, “Targeted Improvements” (collectively "ASC 842"). ASC 842 establishes a right-of-use model ("ROU") that requires a lessee to recognize a ROU asset and lease liability on the balance sheet for all leases with an initial term longer than twelve months. Leases will be classified as finance or operating, with classification affecting the pattern and presentation of expense recognition in the income statement.



We adopted ASC 842 as of January 1, 2019 using a modified retrospective transition approach for all leases existing at January 1, 2019, the date of the initial application. Consequently, financial information will not be updated and disclosures required under ASC 842 will not be provided for dates and periods before January 1, 2019.



ASC 842 provides for a number of optional practical expedients in transition. We elected the practical expedients, which permit us to not reassess prior conclusions about lease identification, lease classification and initial direct costs under ASC 842. We did not elect the "use-of hindsight" practical expedient to determine the lease term or in assessing the likelihood that a lease purchase option will be exercised, allowing us to carry forward the lease term as determined prior to adoption of ASC 842. Finally, we also elected the practical expedient related to land easements, which enabled us to continue our accounting treatment for land easements on existing agreements as of January 1, 2019.



ASC 842 also provides practical expedients for an entity’s ongoing accounting. We elected the short-term lease recognition exemption for all leases that qualify. A short-term lease is one with a term of 12 months or less, including any optional periods that are reasonably certain of exercise. For those leases that qualify, the exemption allows us to not recognize ROU assets or lease liabilities, including not recognizing ROU assets or lease liabilities for existing short-term leases at transition. Short-term lease costs are recognized as rent expense on a straight-line basis over the lease term consistent with our prior accounting. We also elected the practical expedient to not separate lease and non-lease components for all current lease categories. 



As of January 1, 2019, we recognized operating lease liabilities of $648 million based on the present value of the remaining minimum rental payments determined under prior lease accounting standards and corresponding ROU assets of $588 million. The $60 million difference between operating lease liabilities and ROU assets recognized is due to deferred rent and exit cost accruals recorded under prior lease accounting standards. ASC 842 requires such balances to be reclassified against ROU assets at transition.



For arrangements where we are the lessor, the adoption of ASC 842 did not have a material impact on our financial statements as the majority of our leases are operating leases embedded within managed services contracts. ASC 842 provides a practical expedient for lessors in which the lessor may elect, by class of underlying asset, to not separate non-lease components from the associated lease component and, instead, to account for these components as a single component if both of the following are met: (i) the timing and pattern of transfer of the non-lease component(s) and associated lease component are the same and (ii) the lease component, if accounted for separately, would be classified as an operating lease. The

accounting under the practical expedient depends on which component(s) is predominant in the contract. If the non-lease component is predominant, the single component is accounted under ASC Topic 606 "Revenue from Contracts with Customers" and accounting and disclosure under ASC 842 is not applicable. We have elected the above practical expedient and determined that non-lease components are predominant and is accounting for the single components as managed service contracts under ASC Topic 606.
