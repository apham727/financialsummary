Cautionary Note on Forward-Looking Statements 

For purposes of this Quarterly Report, the terms “Oracle,” “we,” “us” and “our” refer to Oracle Corporation and its consolidated subsidiaries.
This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q contains statements that are not historical in nature, are predictive in nature, or that depend upon or refer to future events or conditions or otherwise contain forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 21 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.
These include, among other things, statements regarding: 

•  

our expectation that we may acquire companies, products, services and technologies to further our corporate strategy as compelling opportunities become available; 

•  

our expectation that, on a constant currency basis, our total cloud and license revenues generally will continue to increase due to expected growth in our cloud services and our license support offerings, and continued demand for our cloud license and on-premise license offerings; 

•  

our belief that our Oracle Cloud Software-as-a-Service and Infrastructure-as-a-Service (SaaS and IaaS, respectively, and collectively, Oracle Cloud Services) offerings are opportunities for us to expand our cloud and license business, and that demand for our Oracle Cloud Services will continue to increase; 

•  

our expectation that substantially all of our customers will renew their license support contracts annually; 

•  

our expectation that our hardware business will have lower operating margins as a percentage of revenues than our cloud and license business; 

•  

our expectation that we will continue to place significant emphasis, both domestically and internationally, on direct sales through our own sales force; 

•  

our expectation that we will continue to make significant investments in research and development, and our belief that research and development efforts are essential to maintaining our competitive position; 

•  

our expectation that our international operations will continue to provide a significant portion of our total revenues and expenses; 

•  

the sufficiency of our sources of funding for working capital, capital expenditures, contractual obligations, acquisitions, dividends, stock repurchases, debt repayments and other matters; 

•  

our belief that we have adequately provided under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles for outcomes related to our tax audits and that the final outcome of our tax related examinations, agreements or judicial proceedings will not have a material effect on our results of operations, and our belief that our net deferred tax assets will be realized in the foreseeable future; 

•  

our belief that the outcome of certain legal proceedings and claims to which we are a party will not, individually or in the aggregate, result in losses that are materially in excess of amounts already recognized, if any; 

•  

the possibility that certain legal proceedings to which we are a party could have a material impact on our future cash flows and results of operations; 

•  

our expectations regarding the timing and amount of expenses relating to the Fiscal 2019 Oracle Restructuring Plan and the improved efficiencies in our operations that such a plan will create; 

•  

the timing and amount of future cash dividend payments and stock repurchases, including our expectation that the levels of our future stock repurchase activity may be modified in comparison to past periods in order to use available cash for other purposes; 

•  

our expectations regarding the impact of recent accounting pronouncements on our consolidated financial statements;

•  

our expectation that, to the extent customers renew support contracts or cloud SaaS and IaaS contracts from companies that we have acquired, we will recognize revenues for the full contracts’ values over the respective renewal periods;

the percentage of remaining performance obligations that we expect to recognize as revenues over the next twelve months;
