Cautionary Note on Forward-Looking Statements  

For purposes of this Quarterly Report, the terms Oracle, we, us and our refer to Oracle Corporation and its consolidated subsidiaries.
This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q contains statements that are not historical in nature, are predictive in nature, or that depend upon or refer to future events or conditions or otherwise contain forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 21 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.
These include, among other things, statements regarding:  

       our expectations regarding the impacts of the U.S. 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act on our tax position and ability to access and use cash and other balances held by certain of our foreign subsidiaries;  

       our expectation that we will continue to acquire companies, products, services and technologies to further our corporate strategy;  

       our belief that our acquisitions enhance the products and services that we can offer to customers, expand our customer base, provide greater scale to accelerate innovation, grow our revenues and earnings, and increase stockholder value;  

       our expectation that, on a constant currency basis, our total cloud and on-premise software revenues generally will continue to increase due to expected growth from our cloud software as a service (SaaS) and cloud platform as a service (PaaS) and infrastructure as a service (IaaS) offerings, continued demand for our software products and related support offerings, and contributions from acquisitions;  

       our expectation that we will continue to place significant strategic emphasis on growing our cloud SaaS and cloud PaaS and IaaS offerings, which has affected the growth of our new software license revenues and hardware revenues and to a lesser extent, has also affected the growth of our software license updates and product support revenues;  

       our intention that we will renew our cloud SaaS and cloud PaaS and IaaS contracts when they are eligible for renewal;  

       our expectation that our hardware business will have lower operating margins as a percentage of revenues than our cloud and on-premise software business;  

       our expectation that we will continue to make significant investments in research and development and related product opportunities, including those related to hardware products and services, and our belief that research and development efforts are essential to maintaining our competitive position;  

       our expectation that our international operations will continue to provide a significant portion of our total revenues and expenses;  

       the sufficiency of our sources of funding for working capital, capital expenditures, contractual obligations, acquisitions, dividends, stock repurchases, debt repayments and other matters;  

       our belief that we have adequately provided under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles for outcomes related to our tax audits and that the final outcome of our tax related examinations, agreements or judicial proceedings will not have a material effect on our results of operations, and our belief that our net deferred tax assets will be realized in the foreseeable future;  

       our belief that the outcome of certain legal proceedings and claims to which we are a party will not, individually or in the aggregate, result in losses that are materially in excess of amounts already recognized, if any;  

       the possibility that certain legal proceedings to which we are a party could have a material impact on our future cash flows and results of operations;  

       our expectations regarding the timing and amount of expenses relating to the Fiscal 2017 Oracle Restructuring Plan and the improved efficiencies in our operations that such plan will create;

       the timing and amount of our stock repurchases, including our expectation that the levels of our future stock repurchase activity may be modified in comparison to past periods in order to use available cash for other purposes;  

       our expectations regarding the impact of recent accounting pronouncements on our consolidated financial statements;  

       our expectation that to the extent customers renew support contracts or cloud SaaS and cloud PaaS and IaaS contracts from companies that we have acquired, we will recognize revenues for the full contracts values over the respective renewal periods;  

       our ability to predict quarterly hardware revenues;  

as well as other statements regarding our future operations, financial condition and prospects, and business strategies.
