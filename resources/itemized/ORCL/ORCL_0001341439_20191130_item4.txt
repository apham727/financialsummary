Controls and Procedures

control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, have been detected.
These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision making can be faulty and that breakdowns can occur because of a simple error or mistake.
Additionally, controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more people or by management override of the controls.
The design of any system of controls also is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions; over time, controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or the degree of compliance with policies or procedures may deteriorate.
Because of the inherent limitations in a cost-effective control system, misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected.
