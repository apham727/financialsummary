Cautionary Note on Forward-Looking Statements 

For purposes of this Quarterly Report, the terms “Oracle,” “we,” “us” and “our” refer to Oracle Corporation and its consolidated subsidiaries.
This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q contains statements that are not historical in nature, are predictive in nature, or that depend upon or refer to future events or conditions or otherwise contain forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 21 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.
These include, among other things, statements regarding: 

•  

our expectation that we will continue to acquire companies, products, services and technologies to further our corporate strategy; 

•  

our belief that our acquisitions enhance the products and services that we can offer to customers, expand our customer base, provide greater scale to accelerate innovation, grow our revenues and earnings, and increase stockholder value; 

•  

our expectation that, on a constant currency basis, our total cloud and license revenues generally will continue to increase due to expected growth in our cloud services and our license support offerings, continued demand for our cloud license and on-premise license offerings, and contributions from acquisitions; 

•  

our belief that our Oracle Cloud Infrastructure offerings are large opportunities for us to expand our cloud and license business; 

•  

our expectation that we will continue to place significant strategic emphasis on growing our cloud offerings; 

•  

our expectation that we and our customers will renew our cloud software-as-a-service (SaaS) and infrastructure-as-a-service (IaaS) contracts and hardware contracts when they are eligible for renewal, and our expectation that substantially all of our customers renew their license support contracts annually; 

•  

our expectation that our hardware business will have lower operating margins as a percentage of revenues than our cloud and license business; 

•  

our expectation that we will continue to make significant investments in research and development and related product opportunities, and our belief that research and development efforts are essential to maintaining our competitive position; 

•  

our expectation that our international operations will continue to provide a significant portion of our total revenues and expenses; 

•  

our expectation that we will continue paying cash dividends; 

•  

the sufficiency of our sources of funding for working capital, capital expenditures, contractual obligations, acquisitions, dividends, stock repurchases, debt repayments and other matters; 

•  

our belief that we have adequately provided under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles for outcomes related to our tax audits and that the final outcome of our tax related examinations, agreements or judicial proceedings will not have a material effect on our results of operations, and our belief that our net deferred tax assets will be realized in the foreseeable future; 

•  

our belief that the outcome of certain legal proceedings and claims to which we are a party will not, individually or in the aggregate, result in losses that are materially in excess of amounts already recognized, if any; 

•  

the possibility that certain legal proceedings to which we are a party could have a material impact on our future cash flows and results of operations;

•

•  

our expectations regarding the impact of recent accounting pronouncements on our consolidated financial statements;

We claim the protection of the safe harbor for forward-looking statements contained in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 for all forward-looking statements.

We have no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or risks, except to the extent required by applicable securities laws.
If we do update one or more forward-looking statements, no inference should be drawn that we will make additional updates with respect to those or other forward-looking statements.
