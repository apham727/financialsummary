Impacts of the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017
The comparability of our operating results in the third quarter and first nine months of fiscal 2019 compared to the corresponding prior year periods was impacted by the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (the Tax Act), which was effective for us starting in our third quarter of fiscal 2018.
Information regarding our adoption and prospective impacts of the Tax Act on our tax and liquidity profile is included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for our fiscal year ended May 31, 2018.
The net expense related to the enactment of the Tax Act has been accounted for during the third quarter and first nine months of fiscal 2018 based on provisional estimates pursuant to SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin No.
118 (SAB 118).
In the third quarter of fiscal 2019, we completed our analysis of the impacts of the Tax Act.
We recorded a tax benefit of $376 million and $529 million, respectively, during the three and nine months ended February 28, 2019, respectively, in accordance with SAB 118 related to adjustments in our estimates of the one-time transition tax on certain foreign subsidiary earnings.
We also recorded a tax expense of $140 million during the fiscal 2019 periods presented in accordance with SAB 118 related to the remeasurement of our net deferred tax assets and liabilities.
Revenue Recognition
•
•
hardware revenues, which include the sale of hardware products including Oracle Engineered Systems, servers, and storage products, and industry-specific hardware; and hardware support revenues; and
•
services revenues, which are earned from providing cloud-, license- and hardware-related services including consulting, advanced customer support and education services.
License support revenues are typically generated through the sale of license support contracts related to cloud license and on-premise licenses purchased by our customers at their option.
License support contracts provide customers with rights to unspecified software product upgrades, maintenance releases and patches released during the term of the support period and include internet access to technical content, as well as internet and telephone access to technical support personnel.
License support contracts are generally priced as a percentage of the net cloud license and on-premise license fees.
Substantially all of our customers renew their license support contracts annually.
Cloud services revenues include revenues from Oracle Cloud Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) and Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS) offerings (collectively, Oracle Cloud Services), which deliver applications and infrastructure technologies, respectively, via cloud-based deployment models that we develop functionality for, provide unspecified updates and enhancements for, host, manage and support and that customers access by entering into a subscription agreement with us for a stated period.
Our IaaS offerings also include Oracle Managed Cloud Services, which are designed to provide comprehensive software and hardware management, maintenance and security services for customer cloud-based, on-premise or other IT infrastructure for a fee for a stated term.

ORACLE CORPORATION
NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)
Cloud license and on-premise license revenues primarily represent amounts earned from granting customers licenses to use our database, middleware, application and industry-specific software products which our customers use for cloud-based, on-premise and other IT environments.
The vast majority of our cloud license and on-premise license arrangements include license support contracts, which are entered into at the customer’s option.
Revenues from the sale of hardware products represent amounts earned primarily from the sale of our Oracle Engineered Systems, computer servers, storage, and industry-specific hardware.
Our hardware support offerings generally provide customers with software updates for the software components that are essential to the functionality of the hardware products purchased and can also include product repairs, maintenance services and technical support services.
Hardware support contracts are generally priced as a percentage of the net hardware products fees.
Our consulting services are offered as standalone arrangements or as a part of arrangements to customers buying other products and services.
Our advanced customer support services are offered as standalone arrangements or as a part of arrangements to customers buying other products and services.
We offer these advanced customer support services to Oracle customers to enable increased performance and higher availability of their products and services.
Education services include instructor-led, media-based and internet-based training in the use of our cloud, software and hardware products.
•
identification of the contract, or contracts, with a customer;
•
identification of the performance obligations in the contract;
•
determination of the transaction price;
•
allocation of the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract; and
•
recognition of revenues when, or as, the contractual performance obligations are satisfied.
The timing of revenue recognition may differ from the timing of invoicing to our customers.
We record an unbilled receivable, which is included within accounts receivable on our condensed consolidated balance sheets, when revenue is recognized prior to invoicing.
We record deferred revenues on our condensed consolidated balance sheets when revenues are recognized subsequent to cash collection for an invoice.
Our standard payment terms are generally net 30 days but may vary.
Invoices for cloud license and on-premise licenses and hardware products are generally issued when the license is made available for customer use or upon delivery to the customer of the hardware product.
Invoices for license support and hardware support contracts are generally invoiced annually in advance.
Cloud SaaS and IaaS contracts are generally invoiced annually, quarterly or monthly in advance.
Services are generally invoiced in advance or as the services are performed.
Most contracts that contain a financing component are contracts financed through our financing division.
The transaction price for a contract that is financed through our financing division is adjusted to reflect the time value of money and interest revenue is recorded as a component of non-operating income, net within our condensed consolidated statements of operations based on market rates in the country in which the transaction is being financed.
Our revenue arrangements generally include standard warranty or service level provisions that our arrangements will perform and operate in all material respects as defined in the respective agreements, the financial impacts of which have historically been and are expected to continue to be insignificant.
Our arrangements generally do not
Table of Contents
ORACLE CORPORATION
NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)
include a general right of return relative to the delivered products or services.
We recognize revenues net of any taxes collected from customers, which are subsequently remitted to governmental authorities.
Revenue Recognition for Cloud Services
Revenues from cloud services provided on a subscription basis are generally recognized ratably over the contractual period that the services are delivered, beginning on the date our service is made available to our customers.
We recognize revenue ratably because the customer receives and consumes the benefits of the cloud services throughout the contract period.
Revenues from cloud services provided on a consumption basis, such as metered services, are generally recognized based on the utilization of the services by the customer.
Revenue Recognition for License Support and Hardware Support
Oracle’s primary performance obligations with respect to license support contracts and hardware support contracts are to provide customers with technical support as needed and unspecified software product upgrades, maintenance releases and patches during the term of the support period when they are available.
Oracle is obligated to make the license and hardware support services available continuously throughout the contract period.
Therefore, revenues for license support contracts and hardware support contracts are generally recognized ratably over the contractual periods that the support services are provided.
Revenue Recognition for Cloud License and On-Premise License
Revenues from distinct cloud license and on-premise license performance obligations are generally recognized upfront at the point in time when the software is made available to the customer to download and use.
Revenues from usage-based royalty arrangements for distinct cloud licenses and on-premise licenses are recognized at the point in time when the software end user usage occurs.
For usage-based royalty arrangements with a fixed minimum guarantee amount, the minimum amount is generally recognized upfront when the software is made available to the royalty customer.
Revenue Recognition for Hardware Products
The hardware product and related software, such as an operating system or firmware, are highly interdependent and interrelated and are accounted for as a combined performance obligation.
The revenues for this combined performance obligation are generally recognized at the point in time that the hardware product is delivered to the customer and ownership is transferred to the customer.
Revenue Recognition for Services
Services revenues are generally recognized over time as the services are performed.
Revenues for fixed price services are generally recognized over time applying input methods to estimate progress to completion.
Revenues for consumption-based services are generally recognized as the services are performed.
Allocation of the Transaction Price for Contracts that have Multiple Performance Obligations
Many of our contracts include multiple performance obligations.
Judgment is required in determining whether each performance obligation is distinct.
Oracle products and services generally do not require a significant amount of integration or interdependency.
We allocate the transaction price for each contract to each performance obligation based on the relative standalone selling price (SSP) for each performance obligation within each contract.
Table of Contents
ORACLE CORPORATION
NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)
We use judgment in determining the SSP for products and services.
For substantially all performance obligations except cloud licenses and on-premise licenses, we are able to establish SSP based on the observable prices of products or services sold separately in comparable circumstances to similar customers.
We typically establish a standalone selling price range for our products and services which is reassessed on a periodic basis or when facts and circumstances change.
Our cloud licenses and on-premise licenses have not historically been sold on a standalone basis, as substantially all customers elect to purchase license support contracts at the time of a cloud license and on-premise license purchase.
License support contracts are generally priced as a percentage of the net fees paid by the customer to access the license.
We are unable to establish SSP for our cloud licenses and on-premise licenses based on observable prices given the same products are sold for a broad range of amounts (that is, the selling price is highly variable) and a representative SSP is not discernible from past transactions or other observable evidence.
As a result, the SSP for a cloud license and an on-premise license included in a contract with multiple performance obligations is determined by applying a residual approach whereby all other performance obligations within a contract are first allocated a portion of the transaction price based upon their respective SSPs, with any residual amount of transaction price allocated to cloud license and on-premise license revenues.
Deferred Sales Commissions
We defer sales commissions earned by our sales force that are considered to be incremental and recoverable costs of obtaining a cloud, license support and hardware support contract.
Initial sales commissions for the majority of these aforementioned contracts are generally deferred and amortized on a straight-line basis over a period of benefit that we estimate to be four to five years.
We determine the period of benefit by taking into consideration the historical and expected durations of our customer contracts, the expected useful lives of our technologies, and other factors.
Sales commissions for renewal contracts relating to our cloud-based arrangements are generally deferred and then amortized on a straight-line basis over the related contractual renewal period, which is generally one to three years.
Amortization of deferred sales commissions is included as a component of sales and marketing expenses in our condensed consolidated statements of operations.
Remaining Performance Obligations from Contracts with Customers
Trade receivables, net of allowance for doubtful accounts, and deferred revenues are reported net of related uncollected deferred revenues in our condensed consolidated balance sheets as of February 28, 2019 and May 31, 2018.
The amount of revenues recognized during the nine months ended February 28, 2019 that were included in the opening deferred revenues balance as of May 31, 2018 was approximately $7.7 billion.
Revenues recognized from performance obligations satisfied in prior periods were immaterial during each of the three and nine months ended February 28, 2019 and 2018.
Impairment losses recognized on our receivables were immaterial in each of the three and nine months ended February 28, 2019 and 2018.
Remaining performance obligations represent contracted revenues that had not yet been recognized, and include deferred revenues; invoices that have been issued to customers but were uncollected and have not been recognized as revenues; and amounts that will be invoiced and recognized as revenues in future periods.
The volumes and amounts of customer contracts that we book and total revenues that we recognize are impacted by a variety of seasonal factors.
In each fiscal year, the amounts and volumes of contracting activity and our total revenues are typically highest in our fourth fiscal quarter and lowest in our first fiscal quarter.
These seasonal impacts influence how our remaining performance obligations change over time.
As of February 28, 2019, our remaining performance obligations were $31.5 billion, approximately 62% of which we expect to recognize as revenues over the next twelve months and the remainder thereafter.
Refer to Note 10 for our discussion of revenues disaggregation.

Restricted cash that was included within cash and cash equivalents as presented within our condensed consolidated balance sheets as of February 28, 2019 and May 31, 2018 and our condensed consolidated statements of cash flows for the nine months ended February 28, 2019 and 2018 was nominal.
Acquisition Related and Other Expenses
Acquisition related and other expenses consist of personnel related costs and stock-based compensation for transitional and certain other employees, integration related professional services, certain business combination adjustments including certain adjustments after the measurement period has ended and certain other operating items, net.
Non-Operating Income, net
Non-operating income, net consists primarily of interest income, net foreign currency exchange losses, the noncontrolling interests in the net profits of our majority-owned subsidiaries (primarily Oracle Financial Services Software Limited and Oracle Corporation Japan) and net other income, including net realized gains and losses related to all of our investments, net unrealized gains and losses related to the small portion of our investment portfolio related to our deferred compensation plan, and non-service net periodic pension income (losses).
Sales of Financing Receivables
We offer certain of our customers the option to acquire our software products, hardware products and services offerings through separate long-term payment contracts.
We generally sell these contracts that we have financed for our customers on a non-recourse basis to financial institutions within 90 days of the contracts’ dates of execution.
We record the transfers of amounts due from customers to financial institutions as sales of financing receivables because we are considered to have surrendered control of these financing receivables.
Financing receivables sold to financial institutions were $274 million and $1.3 billion for the three and nine months ended February 28, 2019, respectively, and $360 million and $1.3 billion for the three and nine months ended February 28, 2018, respectively.

ACQUISITIONS
Fiscal 2018 Acquisition of Aconex Limited
On March 28, 2018, we completed our acquisition of Aconex Limited (Aconex), a provider of cloud-based collaboration software for construction projects.
We have included the financial results of Aconex in our condensed consolidated financial statements from the date of acquisition.
These results were not individually material to our condensed consolidated financial statements.
The total preliminary purchase price for Aconex was approximately $1.2 billion, which consisted of approximately $1.2 billion in cash and $7 million for the fair values of stock options and restricted stock-based awards assumed.
In connection with the Aconex acquisition, we have preliminarily recorded $20 million of net liabilities and $377 million of identifiable intangible assets based on their estimated fair values, and $864 million of residual goodwill.
Goodwill generated from our acquisition of Aconex was primarily attributable to synergies expected to arise after the acquisition and is not expected to be tax deductible.
Other Fiscal 2019 and 2018 Acquisitions
During the first nine months of fiscal 2019 and the full fiscal year of 2018, we acquired certain other companies and purchased certain technology and development assets primarily to expand our products and services offerings.
These acquisitions were not significant individually or in the aggregate.
The preliminary fair values of net tangible assets and intangible assets acquired were based on preliminary valuations, and our estimates and assumptions are subject to change within the measurement period (up to one year from the acquisition date).
The primary areas that remain preliminary relate to the fair values of intangible assets acquired, certain tangible assets and liabilities acquired, certain legal matters, income and non-income based taxes and residual goodwill.
We expect to continue to obtain information to assist us in determining the fair values of the net assets acquired during the measurement period.
Unaudited Pro Forma Financial Information
The unaudited pro forma financial information in the table below summarizes the combined results of operations for Oracle, Aconex and certain other companies that we acquired since the beginning of fiscal 2018 that were considered relevant for the purposes of unaudited pro forma financial information disclosure as if the companies were combined as of the beginning of fiscal 2018.
The unaudited pro forma financial information for all periods presented included the business combination accounting effects resulting from these acquisitions, including amortization charges from acquired intangible assets (certain of which are preliminary), stock-based compensation charges for unvested restricted stock-based awards and stock options assumed, if any, and the related tax effects as though the aforementioned companies were combined as of the beginning of fiscal 2018.
The unaudited pro forma financial information as presented below is for informational purposes only and is not necessarily indicative of the results of operations that would have been achieved if the acquisitions had taken place at the beginning of fiscal 2018.
The unaudited pro forma financial information for the three and nine months ended February 28, 2019 presented the historical results of Oracle for the three and nine months ended February 28, 2019, and certain other companies that we acquired since the beginning of fiscal 2019 based upon their respective previous reporting periods and the dates these companies were acquired by us, and the effects of the pro forma adjustments listed above.

FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS
We perform fair value measurements in accordance with FASB Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 820, Fair Value Measurement.
ASC 820 defines fair value as the price that would be received from selling an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date.
When determining the fair value measurements for assets and liabilities required to be recorded at their fair values, we consider the principal or most advantageous market in which we would transact and consider assumptions that market participants would use when pricing the assets or liabilities, such as inherent risk, transfer restrictions and risk of nonperformance.

RESTRUCTURING ACTIVITIES
Fiscal 2019 Oracle Restructuring Plan
During fiscal 2019, our management approved, committed to and initiated plans to restructure and further improve efficiencies in our operations due to our recent acquisitions and certain other operational activities (2019 Restructuring Plan).
The total estimated restructuring costs associated with the 2019 Restructuring Plan are up to $432 million and will be recorded to the restructuring expense line item within our condensed consolidated statements of operations as they are incurred.
We recorded $297 million of restructuring expenses in connection with the 2019 Restructuring Plan in the first nine months of fiscal 2019 and we expect to incur the majority of the estimated remaining $135 million through the end of fiscal 2020.
Any changes to the estimates of executing the 2019 Restructuring Plan will be reflected in our future results of operations.
Summary of All Plans
Restructuring costs recorded for individual line items primarily related to employee severance costs.
The balances at February 28, 2019 and May 31, 2018 included $183 million and $257 million, respectively, recorded in other current liabilities, and $24 million and $25 million, respectively, recorded in other non-current liabilities.
Costs recorded for the respective restructuring plans during the current period presented.
All plan adjustments were changes in estimates whereby increases and decreases in costs were generally recorded to operating expenses in the period of adjustments.
Represents foreign currency translation and certain other adjustments.
Represents employee related severance costs for functions that are not included within our operating segments and certain other restructuring costs.
Other restructuring plans presented in the table above included condensed information for other Oracle based plans and other plans associated with certain of our acquisitions whereby we continued to make cash outlays to settle obligations under these plans during the period presented but for which the periodic impact to our condensed consolidated statements of operations was not significant.

DEFERRED REVENUES
Deferred cloud services and license support revenues and deferred hardware revenues substantially represent customer payments made in advance for cloud or support contracts that are typically billed in advance with corresponding revenues generally being recognized ratably over the contractual periods.
Deferred services revenues include prepayments for our services business and revenues for these services are generally recognized as the services are performed.
Deferred cloud license and on-premise license revenues typically resulted from customer payments that related to undelivered products and services or specified enhancements.
In connection with our acquisitions, we have estimated the fair values of the cloud services and license support performance obligations assumed from our acquired companies.
We generally have estimated the fair values of these obligations assumed using a cost build-up approach.
The cost build-up approach determines fair value by estimating the costs related to fulfilling the obligations plus a normal profit margin.
The sum of the costs and operating profit approximates, in theory, the amount that we would be required to pay a third party to assume these acquired obligations.
These aforementioned fair value adjustments recorded for obligations assumed from our acquisitions reduced the cloud services and license support deferred revenues balances that we recorded as liabilities from these acquisitions and also reduced the resulting revenues that we recognized or will recognize over the terms of the acquired obligations during the post-combination periods.
DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS
•
interest rate swap agreements, which are used to protect us against changes in the fair values of certain of our fixed-rate borrowings attributable to the movements in benchmark interest rates.
We have designated these swap agreements as qualifying hedging instruments and are accounting for them as fair value hedges pursuant to ASC 815;
•
cross-currency interest rate swap agreements, which are used to protect us against changes in the fair values of certain of our fixed-rate Euro-denominated borrowings attributable to the movements in benchmark interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates by effectively converting the fixed-rate, Euro-denominated borrowings, including the annual interest payments and the payment of principal at maturity, to variable-rate, U.S. Dollar denominated debt based on LIBOR.
We have designated these swap agreements as qualifying hedging instruments and are accounting for them as fair value hedges pursuant to ASC 815.
As a result of our adoption of ASU 2017-12, we have elected to exclude the portion of the change in fair value of these swap agreements attributable to the related cross-currency basis spread in our assessment of hedge effectiveness.
The change in fair value of these swap agreements attributable to the cross-currency basis spread is included in accumulated other comprehensive loss;

In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018, we de-designated the foreign currency borrowings as a net investment hedge.
We also held certain foreign currency contracts that were not designated as hedges pursuant to ASC 815.
As of February 28, 2019 and May 31, 2018, the notional amounts of such forward contracts we held to purchase U.S.
Dollars in exchange for other major international currencies were $3.8 billion and $3.4 billion, respectively, and the notional amount of forward contracts we held to sell U.S.
Dollars in exchange for other major international currencies were $3.2 billion and $1.4 billion, respectively.
The fair values of our outstanding foreign currency forward contracts were nominal as of February 28, 2019 and May 31, 2018.
The cash flows related to these foreign currency contracts are classified as operating activities.
Net gains or losses related to these forward contracts are included in non-operating income, net.

Common Stock Repurchases
Our Board of Directors has approved a program for us to repurchase shares of our common stock.
On September 17, 2018 and February 15, 2019, we announced that our Board of Directors approved expansions of our stock repurchase program collectively totaling $24.0 billion.
As of February 28, 2019, approximately $11.8 billion remained available for stock repurchases pursuant to our stock repurchase program.
We repurchased 621.8 million shares for $30.0 billion during the nine months ended February 28, 2019 (including 5.6 million shares for $293 million that were repurchased but not settled) and 131.6 million shares for $6.5 billion during the nine months ended February 28, 2018 under the stock repurchase program.
Our stock repurchase authorization does not have an expiration date and the pace of our repurchase activity will depend on factors such as our working capital needs, our cash requirements for acquisitions and dividend payments, our debt repayment obligations or repurchases of our debt, our stock price, and economic and market conditions.
Our stock repurchases may be effected from time to time through open market purchases or pursuant to a Rule 10b5-1 plan.
Our stock repurchase program may be accelerated, suspended, delayed or discontinued at any time.

Dividends on Common Stock
In March 2019, our Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.24 per share of our outstanding common stock, an increase of $0.05 per share over the dividend declared in December 2018.
The dividend is payable on April 25, 2019 to stockholders of record as of the close of business on April 11, 2019.
Future declarations of dividends and the establishment of future record and payment dates are subject to the final determination of our Board of Directors.
Fiscal 2019 Stock-Based Awards Activity and Compensation Expense
During the first nine months of fiscal 2019, we issued 49 million restricted stock-based units (RSUs) and 7 million stock options (SOs).
Substantially all of the awards were issued as a part of our annual stock-based award process and are subject to service-based vesting restrictions.
Our fiscal 2019 stock-based awards issuances were partially offset by forfeitures and cancellations of 24 million shares during the first nine months of fiscal 2019.
The RSUs and SOs that were granted during the nine months ended February 28, 2019 have vesting restrictions, valuations and contractual lives of a similar nature to those described in Note 13 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended May 31, 2018.
INCOME TAXES
Our effective tax rates for the periods presented are the result of the mix of income earned in various tax jurisdictions that apply a broad range of income tax rates.
In the third quarter of fiscal 2018, the Tax Act was signed into law.
The more significant provisions of the Tax Act as applicable to us are described in Note 1 under “Impacts of the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017” above and in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended May 31, 2018.
During the first nine months of fiscal 2019, we recorded a net benefit of $389 million in accordance with SAB 118 related to adjustments in our estimates of the one-time transition tax on certain foreign subsidiary earnings, and the remeasurement of our net deferred tax assets and liabilities affected by the Tax Act.
Our provision for income taxes for the first nine months of fiscal 2019 varied from the 21% U.S. statutory rate imposed by the Tax Act primarily due to earnings in foreign operations, state taxes, the U.S. research and development tax credit, settlements with tax authorities, the tax effects of stock-based compensation, the Foreign Derived Intangible Income deduction, the tax effect of GILTI, and a reduction to our transition tax recorded consistent with the provision of SAB 118.
Our provision for income taxes for the fiscal 2018 periods presented varied from the 21% U.S. statutory rate imposed by the Tax Act primarily due to the impacts of the Tax Act upon adoption, state taxes, the U.S. research and development tax credit, settlements with tax authorities, the tax effects of stock-based

compensation and the U.S. domestic production activity deduction.
Our effective tax rates were 11.1% and 12.6%, respectively, for the three and nine months ended February 28, 2019, respectively, and 226.8% and 96.4%, respectively, for the three and nine months ended February 28, 2018, respectively.
Our net deferred tax assets were $2.0 billion and $1.3 billion as of February 28, 2019 and May 31, 2018, respectively.
We believe that it is more likely than not that the net deferred tax assets will be realized in the foreseeable future.
Realization of our net deferred tax assets is dependent upon our generation of sufficient taxable income in future years in appropriate tax jurisdictions to obtain benefit from the reversal of temporary differences, net operating loss carryforwards and tax credit carryforwards.
The amount of net deferred tax assets considered realizable is subject to adjustment in future periods if estimates of future taxable income change.
Domestically, U.S. federal and state taxing authorities are currently examining income tax returns of Oracle and various acquired entities for years through fiscal 2017.
Our U.S. federal income tax returns have been examined for all years prior to fiscal 2007, and we are no longer subject to audit for those periods.
Our U.S. state income tax returns, with some exceptions, have been examined for all years prior to fiscal 2004, and we are no longer subject to audit for those periods.
Internationally, tax authorities for numerous non-U.S. jurisdictions are also examining returns affecting our unrecognized tax benefits.
With some exceptions, we are generally no longer subject to tax examinations in non-U.S. jurisdictions for years prior to fiscal 1997.
On July 27, 2015, in Altera Corp. v. Commissioner, the U.S. Tax Court issued an opinion related to the treatment of stock-based compensation expense in an intercompany cost-sharing arrangement.
Currently the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit is reviewing the case, and a final decision has yet to be issued.
At this time, the U.S. Department of the Treasury has not withdrawn the requirement to include stock-based compensation from its regulations.
We have reviewed this case and its impact on Oracle and concluded that no adjustment to the consolidated financial statements is appropriate at this time.
We will continue to monitor ongoing developments and potential impacts to our consolidated financial statements.
We are under audit by the IRS and various other domestic and foreign tax authorities with regards to income tax and indirect tax matters and are involved in various challenges and litigation in a number of countries, including, in particular, Australia, Brazil, India, Korea, Spain and the United Kingdom, where the amounts under controversy are significant.
In some, although not all, cases, we have reserved for potential adjustments to our provision for income taxes and accrual of indirect taxes that may result from examinations by, or any negotiated agreements with, these tax authorities or final outcomes in judicial proceedings, and we believe that the final outcome of these examinations, agreements or judicial proceedings will not have a material effect on our results of operations.
If events occur which indicate payment of these amounts is unnecessary, the reversal of the liabilities would result in the recognition of benefits in the period we determine the liabilities are no longer necessary.
If our estimates of the federal, state, and foreign income tax liabilities and indirect tax liabilities are less than the ultimate assessment, it could result in a further charge to expense.
We believe that we have adequately provided under GAAP for outcomes related to our tax audits.
However, there can be no assurances as to the possible outcomes or any related financial statement effect thereof.

SEGMENT INFORMATION
ASC 280, Segment Reporting, establishes standards for reporting information about operating segments.
Operating segments are defined as components of an enterprise about which separate financial information is available that is evaluated regularly by the chief operating decision maker, or decision-making group, in deciding how to allocate resources and in assessing performance.
Our chief operating decision makers (CODMs) are our Chief Executive Officers and Chief Technology Officer.
We are organized by line of business and geographically.
While our CODMs evaluate results in a number of different ways, the line of business management structure is the primary basis for which the allocation of resources and financial results are assessed.
The footnote information below presents the financial information provided to our CODMs for their review and assists our CODMs with evaluating the company’s performance and allocating company resources.
We have three businesses— cloud and license, hardware and services —each of which is comprised of a single operating segment.
All three of our businesses market and sell our offerings globally to businesses of many sizes, government agencies, educational institutions and resellers with a worldwide sales force positioned to offer the combinations that best meet customer needs.
Our cloud and license business engages in the sale, marketing and delivery of our applications and infrastructure technologies through cloud and on-premise deployment models including our cloud services and license support offerings; and our cloud license and on-premise license offerings.
Cloud services and license support revenues are generated from offerings that are typically contracted with customers directly, billed to customers in advance, delivered to customers over time with our revenue recognition occurring over the contractual terms, and renewed by customers upon completion of the contractual terms.
Cloud services and license support contracts provide customers with access to the latest updates to the applications and infrastructure technologies as they become available and for which the customer contracted and also includes related technical support services over the contractual term.
Cloud license and on-premise license revenues represent fees earned from granting customers licenses, generally on a perpetual basis, to use our database and middleware and our applications software products within cloud and on-premise IT environments.
We generally recognize revenues at the point in time the software is made available to the customer to download and use, which typically is immediate upon signature of the license contract.
In each fiscal year, our cloud and license business’ contractual activities are typically highest in our fourth fiscal quarter and the related cash flows are typically highest in the following quarter (i.e., in the first fiscal quarter of the next fiscal year) as we receive payments from these contracts.
Our hardware business provides Oracle Engineered Systems, servers, storage, industry-specific hardware, operating systems, virtualization, management and other hardware-related software to support diverse IT environments.
Our hardware business also offers hardware support, which provides customers with software updates for the software components that are essential to the functionality of their hardware products, such as Oracle Solaris and certain other software, and can also include product repairs, maintenance services and technical support services.
Our services business provides services to customers and partners to help maximize the performance of their investments in Oracle applications and infrastructure technologies.
We do not track our assets for each business.
Consequently, it is not practical to show assets by operating segment.

Disaggregation of Revenues
We have considered information that is regularly reviewed by our CODMs in evaluating financial performance, and disclosures presented outside of our financial statements in our earnings releases and used in investor presentations to disaggregate revenues to depict how the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenues and cash flows are effected by economic factors.
The principal category we use to disaggregate revenues is the nature of our products and services as presented in our condensed consolidated statements of operations.
The following table is a summary of our total revenues by geographic region.
The relative proportion of our total revenues between each geographic region as presented in the table below was materially consistent across each of our operating segments’ revenues for the periods presented.
Comprised of Europe, the Middle East and Africa
The Asia Pacific region includes Japan

LEGAL PROCEEDINGS
Hewlett-Packard Company Litigation
On June 15, 2011, Hewlett-Packard Company, now Hewlett Packard Enterprise Company (HP), filed a complaint in the California Superior Court, County of Santa Clara against Oracle Corporation alleging numerous causes of action including breach of contract, breach of the covenant of good faith and fair dealing, defamation, intentional interference with prospective economic advantage, and violation of the California Unfair Business Practices Act.
The complaint alleged that when Oracle announced on March 22 and 23, 2011 that it would no longer develop future versions of its software to run on HP’s Itanium-based servers, it breached a settlement agreement signed on September 20, 2010 between HP and Mark Hurd (the Hurd Settlement Agreement), who is our Chief Executive Officer and was both HP’s former chief executive officer and chairman of HP’s board of directors.
HP sought a judicial declaration of the parties’ rights and obligations under the Hurd Settlement Agreement and other equitable and monetary relief.
Oracle answered the complaint and filed cross-claims.
After a bench trial on the meaning of the Hurd Settlement Agreement, the court found that the Hurd Settlement Agreement required Oracle to continue to develop certain of its software products for use on HP’s Itanium-based servers at no cost to HP.
The case proceeded to a jury trial in May 2016.
On June 30, 2016, the jury returned a verdict in favor of HP on its claims for breach of contract and breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing and against Oracle on its cross-claims.
The jury awarded HP $3.0 billion in damages.
Under the court’s rulings, HP is entitled to post-judgment interest, but not pre-judgment interest, on this award.
After the trial court denied Oracle’s motion for a new trial, Oracle filed a notice of appeal on January 17, 2017.
On February 2, 2017, HP filed a notice of appeal of the trial court’s denial of pre-judgment interest.
Oracle has posted a bond for the amounts owing.
No amounts have been paid or recorded to our results of operations.
We continue to believe that we have meritorious defenses against HP’s claims, and we intend to present these defenses to the appellate court.
Oracle filed its opening brief on March 7, 2019.
Briefing on the appeal is scheduled to be completed by September 2019, and the appellate court has not scheduled a date for oral argument.
We cannot currently estimate a reasonably possible range of loss for this action due to the complexities and uncertainty surrounding the appeal process and the nature of the claims.
Litigation is inherently unpredictable, and the outcome of the appeal process related to this action is uncertain.
It is possible that the resolution of this action could have a material impact on our future cash flows and results of operations.
Derivative Litigation Concerning Oracle’s NetSuite Acquisition
On May 3, 2017, a stockholder derivative lawsuit was filed in the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware, and on July 18, 2017, a second stockholder derivative lawsuit was filed in the same court.
The second case was brought by an alleged stockholder of Oracle, purportedly on Oracle’s behalf.
The suit was brought against all the then-current members and one former member of our Board of Directors, and Oracle as a nominal defendant.
Plaintiff alleges that the defendants breached their fiduciary duties by causing Oracle to agree to purchase NetSuite Inc. at an excessive price.
Plaintiff seeks declaratory relief, unspecified monetary damages (including interest), and attorneys’ fees and costs.
On August 9, 2017, the court consolidated the two derivative cases.
In a September 7, 2017 order, the court appointed plaintiff’s counsel in the second case as lead plaintiffs’ counsel and designated the July 18, 2017 complaint as the operative complaint.
The defendants filed a motion to dismiss on October 27, 2017, and after briefing and argument, the court denied this motion on March 19, 2018.
The parties stipulated that all of the individual defendants, except for our Chief Technology Officer and one of our Chief Executive Officers, should be dismissed from this case without prejudice, and on March 28, 2018, the court approved this stipulation.
On May 4, 2018, the remaining defendants answered plaintiff’s complaint.

NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)
On May 4, 2018, the Board of Directors established a Special Litigation Committee (the SLC) to investigate the allegations in this derivative action.
Three outside directors serve on the SLC.
On July 24, 2018, the court entered an order granting the SLC’s motion to stay this case for six months, and ordering the SLC to provide a status report by November 30, 2018.
The SLC provided a status report to the court on November 29, 2018.
On December 28, 2018, the court extended the stay of the case through May 15, 2019.
While Oracle continues to evaluate these claims, we do not believe this litigation will have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations.
Securities Class Action and Derivative Litigation Concerning Oracle’s Cloud Business
On February 12, 2019, a stockholder derivative lawsuit was filed in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California.
The derivative suit is brought by two alleged stockholders of Oracle, purportedly on Oracle’s behalf, against all members of our Board of Directors, and Oracle as a nominal defendant.
Plaintiffs claim that the alleged actions described in the August 10, 2018 class action discussed above caused harm to Oracle, and that Oracle’s Board members violated their fiduciary duties of care, loyalty, reasonable inquiry, and good faith by failing to prevent this alleged harm.
Plaintiffs also allege that defendants’ actions constitute gross mismanagement, waste, and securities fraud.
Plaintiffs seek a ruling that this case may proceed as a derivative action, a finding that defendants are liable for breaching their fiduciary duties, an order directing defendants to enact corporate reforms, attorneys’ fees and costs, and unspecified equitable relief.
While Oracle continues to evaluate these claims, we do not believe this litigation will have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations.
Other Litigation
We are party to various other legal proceedings and claims, either asserted or unasserted, which arise in the ordinary course of business, including proceedings and claims that relate to acquisitions we have completed or to companies we have acquired or are attempting to acquire.
While the outcome of these matters cannot be predicted with certainty, we do not believe that the outcome of any of these matters, individually or in the aggregate, will result in losses that are materially in excess of amounts already recognized, if any.
