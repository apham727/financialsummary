Beginning in January 2018, CTS adopted the provisions of Accounting Standards Update ("ASU") 2014-09, "Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606)" under the modified retrospective method, which requires a cumulative effect adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings on the date of adoption.
This approach was applied to contracts not completed as of December 31, 2017.
At date of adoption, there was no significant change to our past revenue recognition practices and therefore no adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings was required.
During the three and six months ended June 30, 2018, we recognized a decrease of revenues of $46 and an increase in revenues of $86, respectively, that were included in contract liabilities at the beginning of the period.
The increase in contract liabilities as of June 30, 2018 is primarily due to net increases in estimated future discounts and price concessions, offset by net settlements of products sold with rights of return.
During the third quarter of 2017, we revised the June 2016 Plan.
The total cost of the plan is expected to be approximately $13,400.
The total restructuring liability related to severance and other one-time benefit arrangements under the June 2016 Plan was $1,223 at June 30, 2018, and $1,460 at December 31, 2017.
The remaining restructuring liability related to the April 2014 Plan was $433 at June 30, 2018, and $453 at December 31, 2017.
We also pay a quarterly commitment fee on the unused portion of the Revolving Credit Facility.Sales were $118,021 in the second quarter of 2018, an increase of $12,335 or 11.7% from the second quarter of 2017.
Other sales increased $7,150 or 19.3%.
Changes in foreign exchange rates increased sales by $1,794 year-over-year due to the U.S. Dollar depreciating compared to the Euro and Chinese Renminbi and relating mostly to sales of transportation products.
Gross margin as a percent of sales was 35.4% in the second quarter of 2018 compared to 33.9% in the second quarter of 2017.
Research and development expenses were $6,476 or 5.5% of sales in the second quarter of 2018 compared to $6,049 or 5.7% of sales in the comparable quarter of 2017.
Restructuring charges were $1,172 or 1.0% of sales in the second quarter of 2018.
Restructuring charges were $729 or 0.7% of sales in the first quarter of 2017.
Operating earnings were $14,544 or 12.3% of sales in the second quarter of 2018 compared to operating earnings of $13,208 or 12.5% of sales in the comparable quarter of 2017 as a result of the items discussed above.
