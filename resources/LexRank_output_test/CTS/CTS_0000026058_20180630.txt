Beginning in January 2018, CTS adopted the provisions of Accounting Standards Update ("ASU") 2014-09, "Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606)" under the modified retrospective method, which requires a cumulative effect adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings on the date of adoption.
This approach was applied to contracts not completed as of December 31, 2017.
At date of adoption, there was no significant change to our past revenue recognition practices and therefore no adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings was required.
During the three and six months ended June 30, 2018, we recognized a decrease of revenues of $46 and an increase in revenues of $86, respectively, that were included in contract liabilities at the beginning of the period.
The increase in contract liabilities as of June 30, 2018 is primarily due to net increases in estimated future discounts and price concessions, offset by net settlements of products sold with rights of return.
During the third quarter of 2017, we revised the June 2016 Plan.
The total cost of the plan is expected to be approximately $13,400.
The total restructuring liability related to severance and other one-time benefit arrangements under the June 2016 Plan was $1,223 at June 30, 2018, and $1,460 at December 31, 2017.
The remaining restructuring liability related to the April 2014 Plan was $433 at June 30, 2018, and $453 at December 31, 2017.
We also pay a quarterly commitment fee on the unused portion of the Revolving Credit Facility.
Amortization expense was approximately $46 for both the three months ended June 30, 2018 and June 30, 2017, respectively, and approximately $93 for both the six months ended June 30, 2018 and June 30, 2017, respectively.
We selectively use derivative financial instruments including foreign currency forward contracts and interest rate swaps to manage our exposure to these risks.
In January of 2016, we began using forward contracts to mitigate currency risk related to a portion of our forecasted foreign currency revenues and costs.
The currency forward contracts are designed as cash flow hedges and are recorded in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets at fair value.
We continue to monitor the Companyâ€™s overall currency exposure and may elect to add cash flow hedges in the future.
At June 30, 2018, we had a net unrealized gain of $59 in accumulated other comprehensive (loss) income, of which $5 is expected to be reclassified to income within the next 12 months.
