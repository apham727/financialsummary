The accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared by CTS Corporation (“CTS” "we", "our", "us" or the "Company”), without audit, pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission.
The lease liability is based on the present value of minimum lease payments discounted using our secured incremental borrowing rate at the date of adoption.
Our leases are classified as operating leases and expense is recorded in a manner similar to historical accounting guidance.
Our contracts normally contain a single performance obligation that is fulfilled on the date of delivery based on shipping terms stipulated in the contract.
During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2019, we recognized revenues of $125 and $231, respectively, for amounts that were included in contract liabilities at the beginning of the period.
The total restructuring liability under the June 2016 Plan was $333 at September 30, 2019, and $668 at December 31, 2018.
Beginning in Q3 2019, we incurred restructuring charges of $1,671 for exit and disposal activities at three facilities, of which $800 was related to a lease termination charge resulting from our acquisition of Quality Thermistor, Inc. (see Note 19) and $871 was related to workforce and building relocation costs at two foreign facilities.
On February 12, 2019, we entered into an amended and restated five-year Credit Agreement with a group of banks (the "Credit Agreement") to extend the term of the facility.
The Credit Agreement provides for a revolving credit facility of $300,000, which may be increased by $150,000 at the request of the Company, subject to the administrative agent's approval.
We also pay a quarterly commitment fee on the unused portion of the Revolving Credit Facility.
Amortization expense was approximately $42 and $46 for the three months ended September 30, 2019 and 2018, respectively, and approximately $121 and $139 for the nine months ended September 30, 2019 and 2018, respectively.
We selectively use derivative financial instruments including foreign currency forward contracts and interest rate swaps to manage our exposure to these risks.
The use of derivative financial instruments exposes the Company to credit risk, which relates to the risk of nonperformance by a counterparty to the derivative contracts.
No recognition of ineffectiveness was recorded in our Condensed Consolidated Statement of Earnings for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2019.
We use forward contracts to mitigate currency risk related to a portion of our forecasted foreign currency revenues and costs.
The currency forward contracts are designed as cash flow hedges and are recorded in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets at fair value.

Interest expense increased mainly as a result of an increase in debt related to the QTI acquisition.
Other expense in the third quarter of 2019 was principally driven by foreign currency translation losses, mainly due to the appreciation of the U.S. Dollar compared to the Chinese Renminbi during the quarter, as well as pension expense.
Our effective income tax rate was 62.2% and 28.9% in the third quarters of 2019 and 2018, respectively.
The increase in the effective tax rate for the three months ended September 30, 2019, compared with the same period in 2018 is primarily attributed to the net impact of changes in reserves relating to uncertain tax positions.
Sales were $353,959 in the nine months ended September 30, 2019, an increase of $3,549 or 1.0% from the nine months ended September 30, 2018.
