Cabot Microelectronics Corporation ("Cabot Microelectronics'', "the Company'', "us'', "we'', or "our'') supplies high-performance polishing slurries and pads used in the manufacture of advanced integrated circuit (IC) devices within the semiconductor industry, in a process called chemical mechanical planarization (CMP).
We develop, produce and sell CMP slurries for polishing many of the conducting and insulating materials used in IC devices.
We develop, manufacture and sell CMP polishing pads, which are used in conjunction with slurries in the CMP process.
In the opinion of management, these unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements include all adjustments, consisting of normal recurring adjustments, necessary for the fair statement of Cabot Microelectronics' financial position as of June 30, 2018, cash flows for the nine months ended June 30, 2018 and June 30, 2017, and results of operations for the three and nine months ended June 30, 2018 and June 30, 2017.
The Consolidated Balance Sheets as of September 30, 2017 were derived from audited financial statements.
The Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of Cabot Microelectronics and its subsidiaries.
The accounting estimates that require management's most difficult and subjective judgments include, but are not limited to, those estimates related to bad debt expense, inventory valuation, valuation and classification of auction rate securities, impairment of long-lived assets and investments, business combinations, goodwill, other intangible assets, interest rate swaps, share-based compensation, income taxes and contingencies.
The adjustments, relating primarily to accumulated earnings taxes of a foreign operation, increased the income tax expense for the first quarter of fiscal 2018 by $2,071.
The Company has a managed investment arrangement with a third party to invest in fixed income securities.
These assets were classified as available-for-sale securities and were recorded at fair value.
We have presented these securities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets as of June 30, 2018 as a current asset due to management's intent to use these funds for current business requirements.This was driven in part by our memory customers' migration from 2D to 3D NAND, which requires more CMP processing steps.
Additionally, continued capacity expansions in 3D NAND, primarily in Korea and China, should continue to provide future growth opportunities for us.
Revenue for our third quarter of fiscal 2018 was $150.4 million, which represented an increase of 17.6% from the third quarter of fiscal 2017, with revenue in dielectrics slurries, polishing pads and tungsten slurries increasing 21.0%, 18.9% and 17.5%, respectively, from the same quarter last year.
Gross margin, representing gross profit as a percentage of revenue, for the third quarter of fiscal 2018 was 53.6%, compared to 48.9% for our third quarter of fiscal 2017, both periods of which included 90-basis points of adverse impact of NexPlanar amortization expense.We do not believe there have been any material changes in our risk factors since the filing of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2017.
For instance, we could experience negative impacts on cash flows due to the inability of our customers to pay their obligations to us, or our production process could be harmed if our suppliers cannot fulfill their obligations to us.
