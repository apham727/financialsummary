The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements of Maxim Integrated Products, Inc. and all of its majority-owned subsidiaries (collectively, the “Company” or “Maxim Integrated”) included herein have been prepared by the Company pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”).
Fiscal year 2018 was a 53-week fiscal year and fiscal year 2019 is a 52-week fiscal year.
In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued Accounting Standard Update ("ASU") 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606).
Under the new standard, revenue is recognized when a customer obtains control of promised goods or services in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services.
Results for reporting periods beginning after July 1, 2018 are presented under Topic 606, while prior period amounts are not adjusted and continue to be reported in accordance with historic accounting standards under Topic 605.
Under Topic 605, the gross amount of accrued revenue reserves for price adjustments and other revenue reserves of $141.7 million was included within accounts receivable, net as of June 30, 2018.
•The Company does not disclose the value of unsatisfied performance obligations for (i) contracts with an original expected length of one year or less and (ii) contracts for which the Company recognizes revenue at the amount to which it has the right to invoice for services performed.
In determining the transaction price, the Company evaluates whether the price is subject to refund or adjustment to determine the net consideration to which it is expected to be entitled.
The Company elected the practical expedient to not disclose the value of unsatisfied performance obligations for (i) contracts with an original expected length of one year or less and (ii) contracts for which it recognizes revenue at the amount to which it has the right to invoice for services performed.
Customers are generally required to pay for products and services within the Company’s standard terms, which is net 30 days from the date of invoice.
In August 2018, the SEC adopted a final rule under SEC Release No.
The Company’s Level 2 assets and liabilities consist of U.S. Treasury securities, agency securities, corporate debt securities, certificates of deposit, commercial paper and foreign currency forward contracts that are valued using quoted market prices or are determined using a yield curve model based on current market rates.
Level 3 - Unobservable inputs to the valuation methodology that are significant to the measurement of the fair value of the assets or liabilities.
During the nine months ended March 30, 2019 and the year ended June 30, 2018, there were no transfers in or out of Level 3 from other levels in the fair value hierarchy.
There were no assets or liabilities measured at fair value on a non-recurring basis as of March 30, 2019 and June 30, 2018 other than impairments of long-lived assets.
There were no material impairments of long-lived assets in any of the periods presented.
In the three and nine months ended March 30, 2019 and June 30, 2018, the Company did not recognize any impairment charges on short-term investments.
The Company incurs expenditures denominated in non-U.S. currencies, primarily the Philippine Peso and the Thai Baht associated with the Company's manufacturing activities in the Philippines and Thailand, respectively, and the European Euro, Indian Rupee, Japanese Yen, Taiwan New Dollar, South Korean Won, Chinese Yuan and Canadian Dollar, for sales offices and research and development activities undertaken outside of the U.S.

The major end-markets in which our products are sold are the Automotive, Communications and Data Center, Computing, Consumer and Industrial markets.
Net revenues were $542.4 million and $648.6 million for the three months ended March 30, 2019 and March 31, 2018, respectively.
These declines were partially offset by an increase in revenue from automotive products.
Revenue from industrial products was down by 7%, driven by lower demand for control, automation, security and other industrial products, partially offset by higher demand for USB extension products.
