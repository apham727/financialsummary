The consolidated condensed balance sheet at December 31, 2018 was derived from amounts included in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018.
Historically, the Company maintained a non-contributory defined benefit pension plan that covered substantially all U.S. employees who were employed at December 31, 2011.
For the frozen pension plan, benefits were based primarily on years of service and, for certain individuals, levels of compensation.
The Company additionally has a postretirement healthcare benefit plan that provides medical benefits for certain U.S. retirees and eligible dependents hired prior to November 1, 2004.
Employees are eligible to receive postretirement healthcare benefits upon meeting certain age and service requirements.
This plan requires employee contributions to offset benefit costs.
The Company disclosed in its financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2018 that it estimated it would pay $0.4 million in other postretirement benefits in 2019 based on actuarial estimates.
The total purchase consideration was approximately $12.0 million, which included $7.7 million in cash, a $0.3 million working capital adjustment, a balance sheet holdback of $0.7 million and settlement of $3.3 million of pre-existing Company receivables.
As of March 31, 2019, the Company had completed its analysis for estimating the fair value of the assets acquired with no additional adjustments.
There is an additional $2.0 million of contingent payments related to the D-Flow acquisition that is anticipated to be made in 2019 which is recorded in payables on the Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheet at March 31, 2019.
Expenditures for compliance with environmental control provisions and regulations during 2018 and the first quarter of 2019 were not material.Municipal water, the largest sales category, is comprised of either mechanical or static (ultrasonic) water meters along with the related radio and software technologies and services used by municipal water utilities as the basis for generating their water and wastewater revenues.
Meters equipped with radio technology (endpoints) receive flow measurement data from battery-powered encoder registers attached to the water meter, which is encrypted and transmitted via radio frequency to a receiver that collects and formats the data appropriately for water utility usage and billing systems.
These remotely read systems are classified as either automatic meter reading (AMR) systems, where a vehicle equipped for meter reading purposes, including a radio receiver, computer and reading software, collects the data from utilities’ meters; or advanced metering infrastructure (AMI) systems, where data is gathered utilizing a network (either fixed or cellular) of data collectors or gateway receivers that are able to receive radio data transmission from the utilities’ meters.
These systems provide the utilities with more frequent and diverse data from their meters at specified intervals.
The Company’s BEACON Advanced Metering Analytics (AMA) software suite improves the utilities’ visibility of their water and water usage.
Water meter replacement and the adoption and deployment of new technology comprise the majority of water meter product sales, including radio products.
Over the last decade, there has been a growing trend in the conversion from manually read water meters to meters with radio technology.
The Company’s proprietary radio products (i.e. Flow instrumentation products are used in flow measurement and control applications across a broad industrial spectrum, occasionally leveraging the same technologies used in the municipal water category.
