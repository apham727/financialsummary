In August 2015, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) deferred the effective date of Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606), (“ASU 2014-09”), which outlines a single comprehensive model for entities to use in accounting for revenue arising from contracts with customers and will supersede most current revenue recognition guidance.
The adoption of this standard did not have a material impact on the Company’s consolidated financial statements.
This ASU requires a financial asset (or a group of financial assets) measured on the basis of amortized cost to be presented at the net amount expected to be collected.
The adoption of this standard did not have a material impact on the Company’s consolidated financial statements.
In January 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-01, Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities (Topic 320), (“ASU 2016-01”).
The adoption of this standard did not have a material impact on the Company’s consolidated financial statements.
The Company adopted ASU 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606), in the first quarter of fiscal 2019 for open contracts not completed as of the adoption date using the modified retrospective approach.
The impact of applying the new standard on the Company’s consolidated financial statements for the quarter ended December 28, 2018, was not material, except for an increase in accounts receivable and other current liabilities in the amount of $32.8 million to reflect customer credits as a liability.
To date, there have been no material impairment losses on accounts receivable.
There were no material contract assets or contract liabilities recorded on the consolidated balance sheet in any of the periods presented.
There have been no transfers between Level 1, 2 or 3 assets or liabilities during the three months ended December 28, 2018.
There were no changes to the fair value of the Level 3 liabilities during the three months ended December 28, 2018.
The Company’s non-financial assets and liabilities, such as goodwill, intangible assets, and other long-lived assets resulting from business combinations, are measured at fair value using income approach valuation methodologies at the date of acquisition and are subsequently re-measured if there are indicators of impairment.
The Company tests its goodwill for impairment annually as of the first day of its fourth fiscal quarter and in interim periods if certain events occur indicating the carrying value of goodwill may be impaired.
On January 31, 2018, the Board of Directors approved a stock repurchase program, pursuant to which the Company is authorized to repurchase up to $1.0 billion of its common stock from time to time prior to January 31, 2020, on the open market or in privately negotiated transactions, as permitted by securities laws and other legal requirements.
On January 30, 2019, the Board of Directors approved a new stock repurchase program, pursuant to which the Company is authorized to repurchase up to $2.0 billion of its common stock from time to time prior to January 30, 2021, on the open market or in privately negotiated transactions, as permitted by securities laws and other legal requirements.

We generated net revenue of $972.0 million for the three months ended December 28, 2018, a decrease of $79.9 million or 7.6%, as compared with $1,051.9 million for the corresponding period in fiscal 2018.
The increase in research and development expenses for the three months ended December 28, 2018, as compared with the corresponding period in fiscal 2018, was primarily related to an increase in employee-related compensation expense and product development–related expenses.
The decrease in selling, general and administrative expenses for the three months ended December 28, 2018, as compared with the corresponding period in fiscal 2018, was primarily related to a decrease in share-based compensation expense.
During the three months ended December 28, 2018, we generated $549.0 million of cash from operating activities, an increase of $188.2 million as compared with the $360.8 million generated during the three months ended December 29, 2017.
Cash provided by investing activities consists of cash received related to the sale or maturity of marketable securities, partially offset by cash paid for capital expenditures and cash paid related to the purchase of marketable securities.
Cash provided by investing activities was $171.5 million during the three months ended December 28, 2018, as compared with $34.2 million cash used in investing activities during the three months ended December 29, 2017.
These uses of cash were partially offset by the net proceeds from employee stock option exercises of $2.4 million during the three months ended December 28, 2018.
The increase resulted from $549.0 million in cash generated from operations and $301.0 million in net sales and maturities of marketable securities, partially offset by $284.0 million used to repurchase 4.0 million shares of stock, $67.1 million in cash dividend payments, $19.4 million used to repurchase shares related to payroll tax withholdings on equity awards, and $129.5 million in capital expenditures.

We are subject to overall financial market risks, such as changes in market liquidity, credit quality, investment risk, interest rate risk, and foreign exchange rate risk as described below.
Credit risk associated with our investments is not material because our investments are diversified across several types of securities with high credit ratings, which reduces the amount of credit exposure to any one investment.
