This ASU requires a financial asset (or a group of financial assets) measured on the basis of amortized cost to be presented at the net amount expected to be collected.
The ASU also limits the credit loss to the amount by which fair value is below In January 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-01, Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities (Topic 320), (“ASU 2016-01”).
This ASU provides guidance for the recognition, measurement, presentation, and disclosure of financial assets and liabilities.
In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842) (“ASU 2016-02”).
These amounts accrued at March 29, 2019, for capital equipment purchases have been excluded from the consolidated statements of cash flows for the six months ended March 29, 2019, and are expected to be paid in subsequent periods.
The Company adopted ASU 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606), in the first quarter of fiscal 2019 for open contracts not completed as of the adoption date using the modified retrospective approach.
The impact of applying the new standard on the Company’s consolidated financial statements for the six months ended March 29, 2019, was not material, except for an increase in accounts receivable and other current liabilities in the amount of $30.7 million to reflect customer credits as a liability.
To date, there have been no material impairment losses on accounts receivable.
There were no material contract assets or contract liabilities recorded on the consolidated balance sheet in any of the periods presented.
There have been no transfers between Level 1, 2 or 3 assets or liabilities during the three and six months ended March 29, 2019.
There were no changes to the fair value of the Level 3 liabilities during the three and six months ended March 29, 2019.
The Company’s non-financial assets and liabilities, such as goodwill, intangible assets, and other long-lived assets resulting from business combinations, are measured at fair value using income approach valuation methodologies at the date of acquisition and are subsequently re-measured if there are indicators of impairment.
The Company tests its goodwill for impairment annually as of the first day of its fourth fiscal quarter and in interim periods if certain events occur indicating the carrying value of goodwill may be impaired.
The timing and amount of any shares of the Company’s common stock that are repurchased under the new repurchase program will be determined by the Company’s management based on its evaluation of market conditions and other factors.
During the three months ended March 29, 2019, the Company paid $141.5 million (including commissions) in connection with the repurchase of 1.7 million shares of its common stock (paying an average price of $81.57 per share).

We generated net revenue of $810.4 million for the three months ended March 29, 2019, a decrease of $103.0 million or 11.3%, as compared with $913.4 million for the corresponding period in fiscal 2018.
Net revenue decreased by 9.3% or $182.9 million to $1,782.4 million for the six months ended March 29, 2019, as compared with $1,965.3 million for the corresponding period in fiscal 2018.
The decrease in selling, general and administrative expenses for the three and six months ended March 29, 2019, as compared with the corresponding periods in fiscal 2018, was primarily related to a decrease in share-based compensation expense.
During the six months ended March 29, 2019, we generated $741.1 million of cash from operating activities, a decrease of $53.9 million as compared with the $795.0 million generated during the six months ended March 30, 2018.
The decrease in cash from operating activities during the six months ended March 29, 2019, as compared with the corresponding period in fiscal year 2018, was primarily related to an increase in working capital.
Cash used in investing activities consists primarily of capital expenditures and cash paid related to the purchase of marketable securities, offset by cash received related to the sale or maturity of marketable securities.
Cash used in investing activities was $96.6 million during the six months ended March 29, 2019, as compared with $124.5 million during the six months ended March 30, 2018.
The decrease resulted from $425.5 million used to repurchase 5.7 million shares of stock, $133.1 million in cash dividend payments, and $226.2 million in capital expenditures, which was partially offset by $741.1 million in cash generated from operations.
However, we cannot be certain that our cash on hand and cash generated from operations will be available in the future to fund all of our capital and operating requirements.
