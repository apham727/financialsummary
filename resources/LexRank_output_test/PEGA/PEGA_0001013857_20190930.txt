Contract assets are client committed amounts for which revenue recognized exceeds the amount billed to the client and the right to payment is subject to conditions other than the passage of time, such as the completion of a related performance obligation.
Contract assets and deferred revenue are netted at the contract level for each reporting period.
The change in deferred revenue in the nine months ended September 30, 2019 was primarily due to revenue recognized during the period that was included in deferred revenue at December 31, 2018, partially offset by new billings in advance of revenue recognition.

This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q contains or incorporates forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.
We also license our no-code Pega Platform™ for rapid application development to clients that wish to build and extend their business applications.
We deliver applications tailored to our clients’ specific industry needs.
The change in ACV measures the growth and predictability of future cash flows from Pega Cloud and Client Cloud committed arrangements as of the end of the particular reporting period.
There have been no significant changes to our critical accounting policies as disclosed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018.
Our license revenue is derived from sales of our applications and Pega Platform.
Revenue from cloud arrangements is generally recognized over the service period, while revenue from term and perpetual license arrangements is generally recognized upfront when the license rights become effective.
The increases in cloud revenue in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2019 reflect the shift in client preferences to cloud arrangements from other types of arrangements.
The increase in term license revenue in the three months ended September 30, 2019 was due to revenue recognized from several large, multi-year term license contracts in the three months ended September 30, 2019.
The decrease in term license revenue in the nine months ended September 30, 2019 was attributable to revenue recognized from term license contracts in the nine months ended September 30, 2019 with multi-year committed maintenance periods, which resulted in a greater portion of the contract value being allocated to maintenance.
The increases in maintenance revenue in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2019 were primarily due to the continued growth in the aggregate value of the installed base of our software and strong renewal rates in excess of 90%.
The decreases in perpetual license revenue in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2019 reflects the shift in client preferences in favor of our cloud offerings instead of our perpetual license arrangements.
The decreases in consulting revenue in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2019 were primarily due to decreases in billable hours.
