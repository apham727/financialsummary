The accompanying unaudited consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with United States Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (“GAAP”) for interim financial information and the instructions to Form 10-Q and Article 10 of Regulation S-X.
Accordingly, they do not include all the information and notes required by GAAP for complete financial statements.
Certain information and note disclosures normally included in financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP have been condensed or omitted pursuant to such rules and regulations.
2014-09 (“ASU 2014-09”), Revenue from Contracts with Customers, which amends guidance for revenue recognition.
The core principle of the guidance is that entities should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods and services.
In August 2015, the FASB issued an amendment to defer the effective date for all entities by one year.
During fiscal 2016 and 2017, the FASB issued four additional updates which further clarify the guidance provided in ASU 2014-09.
As a result, financial information for the reporting period beginning June 3, 2018 was reported under the new standard, while comparative financial information has not been adjusted and continues to be reported in accordance with the previous standard.
The adoption of this standard did not impact the timing of revenue recognition for our customer sales.
For the Company, the most significant impact of the new standard is the addition of required disclosures within the notes to the financial statements.
During the fourth quarter of each fiscal year, our goodwill balances are reviewed for impairment using the first day of our fourth quarter as the measurement date.
