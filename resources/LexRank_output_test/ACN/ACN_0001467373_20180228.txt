If the U.S. dollar strengthens against other currencies, resulting in unfavorable currency translation, our revenues, revenue growth and results of operations in U.S. dollars may be lower.
The U.S. dollar weakened against various currencies during the three and six months ended February 28, 2018 compared to the three and six months ended February 28, 2017, resulting in favorable currency translation and U.S. dollar revenue growth that was approximately 6% and 4% higher, respectively, than our revenue growth in local currency.
Assuming that exchange rates stay within recent ranges for the remainder of fiscal 2018, we estimate that our full fiscal 2018 revenue growth in U.S. dollars will be approximately 4.0% higher in U.S. dollars than our revenue growth in local currency.
