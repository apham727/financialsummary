Forward-looking statements are based upon assumptions as to future events that may not prove to be accurate.
•Our global delivery capability is increasingly concentrated in India and the Philippines, which may expose us to operational risks.
The level of revenues we achieve is based on our ability to deliver market-leading services and solutions and to deploy skilled teams of professionals quickly and on a global basis.
There also continues to be volatility in foreign currency exchange rates.
If the U.S. dollar weakens against other currencies, resulting in favorable currency translation, our revenues, revenue growth and results of operations in U.S. dollars may be higher.
If the U.S. dollar strengthens against other currencies, resulting in unfavorable currency translation, our revenues, revenue growth and results of operations in U.S. dollars may be lower.
The U.S. dollar weakened against various currencies during the three and six months ended February 28, 2018 compared to the three and six months ended February 28, 2017, resulting in favorable currency translation and U.S. dollar revenue growth that was approximately 6% and 4% higher, respectively, than our revenue growth in local currency.
Assuming that exchange rates stay within recent ranges for the remainder of fiscal 2018, we estimate that our full fiscal 2018 revenue growth in U.S. dollars will be approximately 4.0% higher in U.S. dollars than our revenue growth in local currency.
The decrease in gross margin for three and six months ended February 28, 2018 was principally due to lower consulting contract profitability as well as higher acquisition-related costs, partially offset by cost efficiencies.
Sales and marketing and General and administrative costs as a percentage of net revenues were 16.3% for the second quarter of fiscal 2018 and 16.4% for the six months ended February 28, 2018, compared with 16.4% for both the second quarter of fiscal 2017 and six months ended February 28, 2017.
For the three and six months ended February 28, 2018 compared to the same periods in fiscal 2017, Sales and marketing costs as a percentage of net revenues decreased 10 basis points and were flat, respectively, and General and administrative costs as a percentage of net revenues were flat and decreased 10 basis points, respectively.
Operating margin (Operating income as a percentage of Net revenues) for the second quarter of fiscal 2018 was 13.4%, compared with 13.7% for the second quarter of fiscal 2017.
Absent this charge, our effective tax rates for the three and six months ended February 28, 2018 would have been 15.1% and 18.0%, respectively.
The $137 million charge associated with the Tax Act decreased diluted earnings per share by $0.21 in both the second quarter of fiscal 2018 and six months ended February 28, 2018.
Excluding the impact of this charge, diluted earnings per share would have been $1.58 for the second quarter of fiscal 2018 and $3.37 for the six months ended February 28, 2018.
