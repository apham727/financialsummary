Our unaudited interim consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“GAAP”).
The information included in this Form 10-Q should be read in conjunction with information included in the Microsoft Corporation fiscal year 2018 Form 10-K filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission on August 3, 2018.
We have recast certain prior period amounts related to investments, derivatives, and fair value measurements to conform to the current period presentation based on our adoption of the new accounting standard for financial instruments.
We have also recast prior period commercial cloud revenue to include the commercial portion of LinkedIn to provide a comparable view of our commercial cloud business performance.
The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Microsoft Corporation and its subsidiaries.
We consider all highly liquid interest-earning investments with a maturity of three months or less at the date of purchase to be cash equivalents.
Investments with maturities beyond one year may be classified as short-term based on their highly liquid nature and because such marketable securities represent the investment of cash that is available for current operations.
Debt investments are classified as available-for-sale and realized gains and losses are recorded using the specific identification method.
Changes in fair value, excluding other-than-temporary impairments, are recorded in other comprehensive income (“OCI”).
Debt investments are impaired when a decline in fair value is judged to be other-than-temporary.
Fair value is calculated based on publicly available market information or other estimates determined by management.
If the cost of an investment exceeds its fair value, we evaluate, among other factors, general market conditions, credit quality of debt instrument issuers, and the duration and extent to which the fair value is less than cost.
We also evaluate whether we have plans to sell the security or it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the security before recovery.
Once a decline in fair value is determined to be other-than-temporary, an impairment charge is recorded in other income (expense), net and a new cost basis in the investment is established.
We perform a qualitative assessment on a quarterly basis and recognize an impairment if there are sufficient indicators that the fair value of the investment is less than carrying value.

Our competitors range in size from diversified global companies with significant research and development resources to small, specialized firms whose narrower product lines may let them be more effective in deploying technical, marketing, and financial resources.
Barriers to entry in many of our businesses are low and many of the areas in which we compete evolve rapidly with changing and disruptive technologies, shifting user needs, and frequent introductions of new products and services.
Our ability to remain competitive depends on our success in making innovative products, devices, and services that appeal to businesses and consumers.
A competing vertically-integrated model, in which a single firm controls the software and hardware elements of a product and related services, has succeeded with some consumer products such as personal computers, tablets, phones, gaming consoles, and wearables.
We also offer some vertically-integrated hardware and software products and services.
We derive substantial revenue from licenses of Windows operating systems on personal computers.
We face significant competition from competing platforms developed for new devices and form factors such as smartphones and tablet computers.
Even if many users view these devices as complementary to a personal computer, the prevalence of these devices may make it more difficult to attract application developers to our PC operating system platforms.
The variety and utility of content and applications available on a platform are important to device purchasing decisions.
