This guidance will be effective in the first quarter of 2019 with early adoption permitted.
We have evaluated the impact of adopting this guidance and we expect the adoption of these accounting changes will not impact our assets and liabilities nor our net income or equity, as we currently do not lease any assets.
We expect the adoption of this guidance will not have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements.
Our investment is accounted for under the equity method basis of accounting.
As of September 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017, we have recorded our 49% share of cumulative unrealized losses from the inception of our investment in Grand Shine Management of $1,176,000 and $991,000, respectively.
As of September 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017, the aggregate outstanding balance on this credit facility was $0 and $500,000, respectively.
These payments were for professional fees related to the operational management of our Taiwan office.
In addition, we also made interest expense payments on our credit facility of approximately $0 and $11,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively and $9,000 and $32,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively.

Sales returns for the three months ended September 30, 2018 and 2017 were $2,000 and $6,000, respectively and for the nine months ended September 30, 2018 and 2017 were $5,000 and $154,000, respectively.
Other income, net of other expense, in the third quarter of 2018 was $29,000 versus $25,000 in the comparable period for 2017.
Net income was $279,000 for the third quarter of 2018 versus $214,000 in the comparable period for 2017, an increase of $65,000 resulting from the reasons discussed above.
Net sales in the nine months ended September 30, 2018 was $5,707,000 versus $5,778,000 in the comparable period for 2017, a decrease of $71,000 or 1.2% over the same period last year.
Gross profit for the nine months ended September 30, 2018 was $2,479,000 versus $2,328,000 in the comparable period for 2017, and gross margin percentage of net sales was approximately 43.4% for the nine months ended September 30, 2018 and 40.3% for 2017, respectively.
Other income, net of other losses, in the nine months ended September 30, 2017 was $106,000 versus $85,000 in the comparable period for 2017.
Income tax provision was $5,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2018 versus $3,000 in 2017, as we do not expect significant taxable income for the year ending December 31, 2018.
Net income was $737,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2018 versus $656,000 in the comparable period for 2017, an increase of $81,000 resulting from the reasons discussed above.
Cash flows provided by operating activities were $1,409,000 as opposed to $190,000 in the nine months ended September 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively.
Hence, inventory would not be as readily marketable or liquid as other items included in current assets, such as cash.
We believe that funds generated from, or used in operations, in addition to existing cash balances are likely to be sufficient to finance our working capital and capital expenditure requirements for the foreseeable future.
