The unaudited condensed consolidated interim financial statements include the accounts of the Company and all wholly owned divisions, including its 60% majority-owned subsidiary, Taitron Components Mexico, S.A. de C.V. All significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.
In February 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued a new accounting standard on leasing.
We have evaluated the impact of adopting this guidance and we are preparing for the changes to be made to our consolidated financial statements.
We expect the adoption of these accounting changes will not impact our assets and liabilities nor our net income or equity, as we currently do not lease any assets.
The adoption of this standard did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements and disclosures.

We had inventory balances in the amount of $4,409,000 and $4,990,000 at March 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017, respectively, which is presented net of valuation allowances of $7,910,000 and $7,848,000, respectively.
Based on our assumptions about future demand and market conditions, inventories are carried at the lower of cost or net realizable value.
However, if all or a substantial portion of the inventory was required to be immediately liquidated, the inventory would not be as readily marketable or liquid as other items included or classified as a current asset, such as cash.
Net sales in the first quarter of 2018 totaled $1,655,000 versus $2,167,000 in the comparable period for 2017, a decrease of $512,000 or 23.6% over the same period last year.
Net income was $59,000 for the first quarter of 2018 versus $299,000 in the comparable period for 2017, a decrease of $240,000 resulting from the decrease in net sales.
Cash flows provided by operating activities were $493,000 as opposed to $366,000 used for in the three months ended March 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively.
Inventory is included in current assets; however, it will take over one year for the inventory to turn.
Hence, inventory would not be as readily marketable or liquid as other items included in current assets, such as cash.
If these funds are not sufficient, we may secure new sources of short-term commercial loans, asset-based lending on accounts receivables or issue debt or equity securities.
