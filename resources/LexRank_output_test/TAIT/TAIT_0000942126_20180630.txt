The unaudited condensed consolidated interim financial statements include the accounts of the Company and all wholly owned divisions, including its 60% majority-owned subsidiary, Taitron Components Mexico, S.A. de C.V. All significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.
We have evaluated the impact of adopting this guidance and we are preparing for the changes to be made to our consolidated financial statements.
We expect the adoption of these accounting changes will not impact our assets and liabilities nor our net income or equity, as we currently do not lease any assets.
Our investment is accounted for under the equity method basis of accounting.
As of June 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017, we have recorded our 49% share of cumulative unrealized losses from the inception of our investment in Grand Shine Management of $1,126,000 and $991,000, respectively.
As of June 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017, the aggregate outstanding balance on this credit facility was $0 and $500,000, respectively.
These payments were for professional fees related to the operational management of our Taiwan office.
In addition, we also made interest expense payments on our credit facility of approximately $3,000 and $11,000 for the three months ended June 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively and $9,000 and $21,000 for the six months ended June 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively.

Net sales in the second quarter of 2018 totaled $2,150,000 versus $1,773,000 in the comparable period for 2017, an increase of $377,000 or 21.3% over the same period last year.
Other income, net of other expense, in the second quarter of 2018 was $29,000 versus $31,000 in the comparable period for 2017.
Net income was $399,000 for the second quarter of 2018 versus $215,000 in the comparable period for 2017, an increase of $184,000 resulting from the reasons discussed above.
Net sales in the six months ended June 30, 2018 was $3,805,000 versus $3,940,000 in the comparable period for 2017, a decrease of $135,000 or 3.4% over the same period last year.
Other income, net of other losses, in the six months ended June 30, 2017 was $77,000 versus $60,000 in the comparable period for 2017.
Income tax provision was $3,000 for the six months ended June 30, 2018 versus $1,000 in 2017, as we do not expect significant taxable income for the year ending December 31, 2018.
Net income was $458,000 for the six months ended June 30, 2018 versus $514,000 in the comparable period for 2017, a decrease of $56,000 resulting from the reasons discussed above.
Cash flows provided by operating activities were $785,000 as opposed to $70,000 in the six months ended June 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively.
Inventory is included in current assets; however, it will take over one year for the inventory to turn.
Hence, inventory would not be as readily marketable or liquid as other items included in current assets, such as cash.
We believe that funds generated from, or used in operations, in addition to existing cash balances are likely to be sufficient to finance our working capital and capital expenditure requirements for the foreseeable future.
