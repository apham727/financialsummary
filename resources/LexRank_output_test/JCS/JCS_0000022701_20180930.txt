Management, with the participation of the Company’s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, has evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of the disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as of the end of the period covered by this report.
Based on that evaluation, as detailed below, management concluded that the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures are not effective.
As disclosed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2017, we concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was not effective for the item noted below.
Based on management’s testing and evaluation, we determined that we did not design and maintain effective internal control over the step one goodwill impairment testing that we performed in accordance with ASC 350, Intangibles – Goodwill and Other and ASC 360, Property, Plant, and Equipment, as of April 30, 2017 and December 31, 2017, respectively.
To address the above, we are in the process of designing new review controls to value our business units to ensure that goodwill and long-lived asset impairment analyses are completed in a timely manner and in enough detail to operate at a sufficient level of precision to identify improper assumptions.
