The Company adopted the standard on  January 1, 2019 using the modified retrospective method and did not restate comparative periods, as permitted by the standard.
Upon adoption, the Company recognized ROU assets and lease liabilities of its outstanding operating leases on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets, primarily related to real estate.
The adoption did not have a material impact on the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations or the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.
The Company is evaluating the impact of the standard and does not expect the adoption to have a material impact on its annual goodwill impairment test.
In addition, for available-for-sale debt securities, the standard eliminates the concept of other-than-temporary impairment and entities will be required to recognize an allowance for credit losses rather than reductions in the amortized cost of the securities.
Based on its preliminary assessment, the Company does not expect the standard to have a material impact on its financial statements upon adoption.

The tightening of credit in financial markets may lead consumers and businesses to postpone spending, which may cause our customers to cancel, decrease or delay their existing and future orders with us.
In particular, since we have significant operations in China, our business development plans, results of operations and financial condition may be materially adversely affected by significant political, social and economic developments in China.
A slowdown in economic growth in China could adversely impact our customers, prospective customers, suppliers, distributors and partners in China, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of the operations and financial condition.
The institution of trade tariffs both globally and between the U.S. and China specifically carries the risk of negatively affecting China’s overall economic condition, which could have a negative impact on us as we have significant operations in China.
Furthermore, imposition of tariffs could cause a decrease in the sales of our products to customers located in China or other customers selling to Chinese end users, which would directly impact our business and operating results.
We are subject to export restrictions and laws affecting trade and investments that could materially and adversely affect our business and results of operations.
As a global company headquartered in the U.S., we are subject to U.S. laws and regulations that could limit and restrict the export of some of our products and services and may restrict our transactions with certain customers, business partners and other persons, including, in certain cases, dealings with or between our employees and subsidiaries.
Although these restrictions and laws have not materially restricted our operations in the recent past, there is a significant risk that they could do so in the future, which would materially and adversely affect our business and results of operations.
In addition, U.S. laws and regulations and sanctions or threat of sanctions that could limit and restrict the export of some of our products and services to our customers may also encourage our customers to develop their own solutions to replace our products or seek to obtain a greater supply of similar or substitute products from our competitors that are not subject to these restrictions, which could materially and adversely affect our results of operations.
These actions could lead to additional restrictions on the export of products that include or enable certain technologies, including products we provide to China-based customers.
