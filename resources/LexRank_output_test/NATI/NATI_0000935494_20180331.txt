The accompanying unaudited consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto for the year ended December 31, 2017, included in our annual report on Form 10-K, filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
In our opinion, the accompanying consolidated financial statements reflect all adjustments (consisting only of normal recurring items) considered necessary to present fairly our financial position at March 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017, the results of our operations and comprehensive income for the three months ended March 31, 2018 and 2017, and the cash flows for the three months ended March 31, 2018 and 2017.
Our operating results for the three months ended March 31, 2018 are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for the year ending December 31, 2018.
Stock awards to acquire 0 shares and 21,500 shares for the three months ended March 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively, were excluded in the computations of diluted EPS because the effect of including the stock awards would have been anti-dilutive.
We adopted ASU 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers and all the related amendments ("new revenue standard") as of January 1, 2018.
There have been no other significant changes in our accounting policies during the three months ended March 31, 2018 compared to the significant accounting policies described in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2017.
Our allowance for doubtful accounts is based on historical experience.
Unbilled receivables represent amounts for which revenue has been recognized but which have not yet been invoiced to the customer.
The current portion of unbilled receivables is included in accounts receivable, net on the consolidated balance sheet and is not material.
Under this method, we evaluated all contracts that were in effect at the beginning of 2018 as if those contracts had been accounted for under the new revenue standard.
We did not evaluate individual modifications for those periods prior to the adoption date, but the aggregate effect of all modifications as of the adoption date and such effects are provided below.
We do not expect the impact of the adoption of the new standard to be material to our annual net income on an ongoing basis.
Our historical net cash flows are not impacted by this accounting change.
Revenue is recognized upon transfer of control of the promised products or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration we expect to receive in exchange for those products or services.
Our software licenses typically provide for a perpetual right to use our software.
Our products are generally sold with a right of return which are accounted for as variable consideration when estimating the amount of revenue to recognize.

We are not currently a party to any material litigation.
The risks described below are not the only risks that we face.
Negative trends or sentiments in worldwide and regional economic conditions could have a material adverse effect on demand for our products and services.
We plan to continue to make significant investments in research, development, and marketing for new and existing products and technologies.
Our Success Depends on New Product Introductions and Market Acceptance of Our Products.
Our success is dependent on our ability to successfully develop and introduce new and enhanced products on a timely basis to replace declining revenues from older products, and on increasing penetration in domestic and international markets.
As has occurred in the past and as may be expected to occur in the future, we have experienced significant delays between the announcement and the commercial availability of new products.
