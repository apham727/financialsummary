The accompanying unaudited consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto for the year ended December 31, 2018, included in our annual report on Form 10-K, filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
In our opinion, the accompanying consolidated financial statements reflect all adjustments (consisting only of normal recurring items) considered necessary to present fairly our financial position at March 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018, the results of our operations and comprehensive income for the three months ended March 31, 2019 and 2018, and the cash flows for the three months ended March 31, 2019 and 2018.
Our operating results for the three months ended March 31, 2019 are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for the year ending December 31, 2019.
We adopted the new lease standard on January 1, 2019 and used the effective date as our date of initial adoption.
Additionally, we also reclassified approximately $19 million from "Property, plant and equipment, net" to "Operating lease right-of-use assets" related to prepaid leasehold land.
This means, for those leases that qualify, we will not recognize ROU assets or lease liabilities, and this includes not recognizing ROU assets or lease liabilities for existing short-term leases of those assets in transition.
We adopted this new rule beginning with our financial reporting for the quarter ended March 31, 2019.
We will be required to use a forward-looking expected credit loss model for accounts receivables and other financial instruments.
We do not plan to adopt the ASU earlier than our required effective date of January 1, 2020.
We expect that the adoption of the ASU will not have a material impact on our financial statements.
Additionally, in the first quarter of 2019, we granted performance-based restricted stock units to certain executives under our 2015 Equity Incentive Plan ("PRSUs").For more than 40 years, National Instruments Corporation (the "Company", "we", "us" or "our") has enabled engineers and scientists around the world to accelerate productivity, innovation and discovery.
We have been profitable in every year since 1990.
To maintain a high level of customer satisfaction we strive to offer innovative, modular and integrated products through a global sales and support network.We are not currently a party to any material litigation.
Uncertainty about global and regional economic conditions poses a risk to us as businesses may decrease or postpone spending in response to events such as a U.S. government shutdown, the impending Brexit, continued trade tensions between the U.S. and China or other parts of the world, financial market volatility, tariffs or other trade restrictions, government austerity programs, government regulatory actions, negative financial news, geopolitical instability, declines in income or asset values, or other factors.
These tariffs have increased international trade tensions and led to tariffs on U.S. exports to various countries.
We Make Significant Investments in New Products that May Not Be Successful or Achieve Expected Returns.
We plan to continue to make significant investments in research, development, and marketing for new and existing products and technologies.
