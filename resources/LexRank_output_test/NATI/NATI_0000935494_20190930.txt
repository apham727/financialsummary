The accompanying unaudited consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto for the year ended December 31, 2018, included in our annual report on Form 10-K, filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC").
In our opinion, the accompanying consolidated financial statements reflect all adjustments (consisting only of normal recurring items) considered necessary to present fairly our financial position at September 30, 2019 and December 31, 2018, the results of our operations and comprehensive income for three and nine months ended September 30, 2019 and 2018, the cash flows for the nine months ended September 30, 2019 and 2018 and the statement of stockholder's equity for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2019.
Our operating results for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2019 are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for the year ending December 31, 2019.
We adopted the new lease standard on January 1, 2019 and used the effective date as our date of initial adoption.
Consequently, financial information will not be updated and the disclosures required under the new lease standard will not be provided for earlier periods.
Additionally, we also reclassified approximately $19 million from "Property, plant and equipment, net" to "Operating lease right-of-use assets" related to prepaid leasehold land.
This means, for those leases that qualify, we will not recognize ROU assets or lease liabilities, and this includes not recognizing ROU assets or lease liabilities for existing short-term leases of those assets in transition.
We will be required to use a forward-looking expected credit loss model for accounts receivables and other financial instruments.
We do not plan to adopt the ASU earlier than our required effective date of January 1, 2020.
We expect that the adoption of the ASU will not have a material impact on our financial statements.
The impact of this new guidance on our accounting policies and financial statements is described below.
Additionally, in the first quarter of 2019, we granted performance-based restricted stock units to certain executives under our 2015 Equity Incentive Plan ("PRSUs").
There were no other significant changes in our accounting policies during the nine months ended September 30, 2019 compared to the significant accounting policies described in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018.
Stock-based compensation costs are based on the fair value on the date of grant for all restricted stock units ("RSUs") and on the date of enrollment for the employee stock purchase plan.
Our expected volatility at the date of grant was based on the historical volatilities of our stock and the companies included in the Russell 2000 Index over the performance period.
Refer to Note 11 – Authorized shares of common and preferred stock and stock-based compensation plans for additional information on our equity-based compensation programs.

Moreover, there can be no assurance that our international sales will continue at existing levels or grow in accordance with our efforts to increase foreign market penetration.
Although we have policies and procedures designed to ensure compliance with these laws, there can be no assurance that all of our employees, contractors and agents, including those based in or from countries where practices which violate such U.S. laws may be customary, will not take actions in violation of our policies.
Any violation of foreign or U.S. laws by our employees, contractors or agents, even if such violation is prohibited by our policies, could have a material adverse effect on our business.
The application of these various regulations depends on the classification of our products which can change over time as such regulations are modified or interpreted.
As a result, even if we are currently in compliance with applicable regulations, there can be no assurance that we will not have to incur additional costs or take additional compliance actions in the future.
Failure to comply with these regulations could result in fines or termination of import and export privileges, which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results.
Additionally, the regulatory environment in some countries is very restrictive as their governments try to protect their local economy and value of their local currency against the U.S. dollar.
