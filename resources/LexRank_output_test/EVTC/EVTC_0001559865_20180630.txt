Except as otherwise indicated or unless the context otherwise requires, (a) the terms “EVERTEC,” “we,” “us,” “our,” “our Company” and “the Company” refer to EVERTEC, Inc. and its subsidiaries on a consolidated basis, (b) the term “Holdings” refers to EVERTEC Intermediate Holdings, LLC, but not any of its subsidiaries and (c) the term “EVERTEC Group” refers to EVERTEC Group, LLC and its predecessor entities and their subsidiaries on a consolidated basis, including the operations of its predecessor entities prior to the Merger (as defined below).
EVERTEC is a leading full-service transaction processing business in Latin America and the Caribbean, providing a broad range of merchant acquiring, payment services and business process management services.
We serve 26 countries in the region from our base in Puerto Rico.
We believe our business is well-positioned to continue to expand across the fast-growing Latin American region.
Our revenue is predominantly recurring in nature because of the mission-critical and embedded nature of the services we provide.
Our main operating subsidiary, EVERTEC Group, LLC (formerly known as EVERTEC, LLC and EVERTEC, Inc., hereinafter “EVERTEC Group”), was organized in Puerto Rico in 1988.
On April 17, 2012, EVERTEC Group was converted from a Puerto Rico corporation to a Puerto Rico limited liability company (the “Conversion”) for the purpose of improving its consolidated tax efficiency by taking advantage of changes to the Puerto Rico Internal Revenue Code, as amended (the “PR Code”), that permit limited liability companies to be treated as partnerships that are pass-through entities for Puerto Rico tax purposes.
We also benefit from the trend for financial institutions and government agencies to outsource technology systems and processes.
The Oversight Board will have ultimate authority in preparing the Puerto Rico government’s budget and any issuance of future debt by the government and its instrumentalities.
Promptly after the expiration of the stay, creditors of the Puerto Rico government filed various lawsuits involving defaults on more than $70 billion of bonds issued by Puerto Rico, having failed to reach a negotiated settlement on such defaults with the Puerto Rico government during the period of the automatic stay.
On May 3, 2017, the Oversight Board filed a voluntary petition of relief on behalf of the Commonwealth pursuant to Title III of PROMESA for the restructuring of the Commonwealth’s debt.
As the solution to the Puerto Rican government’s debt crisis remains unclear, we continue to carefully monitor our receivables with the government as well as monitor general economic trends to understand the impact the crisis has on the economy of Puerto Rico and our card payment volumes.
In addition to the macroeconomic trends described above, Management currently estimates that we will continue to experience a revenue attrition in Latin America of approximately $2 million to $4 million for previously disclosed migrations anticipated in 2018.
Total revenues in the second quarter of 2018 increased by $9.8 million or 10% to $113.3 million.
Revenue growth in the quarter reflected the impact of the acquisition of PayGroup as well as elevated sales volumes in Puerto Rico driven by post-hurricane recovery activity, federal relief and benefit programs and insurance proceeds.
Cost of revenues amounted to $49.1 million, an increase of $6.1 million or 14% when compared with the prior year period.
Non-operating expenses increased by $1.7 million to $7.4 million when compared with the prior year period.
The increase is mainly related to a $1.4 million decrease in Other (expense) income due to a decrease in foreign exchange gains coupled with an increase in interest expense of $0.3 million.
Income tax expense amounted to $3.1 million a decrease of $1.0 million when compared with the prior year period.
Total revenues for the six months ended June 30, 2018 amounted to $223.6 million, an increase of $18.8 million or 9%.
The increase in revenues was primarily driven by added revenues from the acquisition of PayGroup as well as strong sales volumes in Puerto Rico related to post-hurricanes recovery.
Cost of revenues amounted to $96.6 million, an increase of $9.3 million or 11% when compared with the prior year period.
Selling, general and administrative expenses in the six months ended June 30, 2018 increased by $5.9 million or 23% to $31.3 million when compared with the same period in 2017.
