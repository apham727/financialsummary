We serve 26 countries in the region from our base in Puerto Rico.
We manage a system of electronic payment networks that process more than two billion transactions annually, and offer a comprehensive suite of services for core bank processing, cash processing and technology outsourcing.
Our revenue is predominantly recurring in nature because of the mission-critical and embedded nature of the services we provide.
EVERTEC, Inc. (formerly known as Carib Latam Holdings, Inc.) is a Puerto Rico corporation organized in April 2012.
Our main operating subsidiary, EVERTEC Group, LLC (formerly known as EVERTEC, LLC and EVERTEC, Inc., hereinafter “EVERTEC Group”), was organized in Puerto Rico in 1988.
On September 30, 2010, pursuant to an Agreement and Plan of Merger (as amended, the “Merger Agreement”), AP Carib Holdings, Ltd. (“Apollo”), an affiliate of Apollo Global Management LLC, acquired a 51% indirect ownership interest in EVERTEC Group as part of a merger (the “Merger”) and EVERTEC Group became a wholly-owned subsidiary of Holdings.
On April 17, 2012, EVERTEC Group was converted from a Puerto Rico corporation to a Puerto Rico limited liability company (the “Conversion”) for the purpose of improving its consolidated tax efficiency by taking advantage of changes to the Puerto Rico Internal Revenue Code, as amended (the “PR Code”), that permit limited liability companies to be treated as partnerships that are pass-through entities for Puerto Rico tax purposes.
PROMESA establishes a fiscal oversight and the Oversight Board comprised of seven voting members appointed by the President.
The Oversight Board will have ultimate authority in preparing the Puerto Rico government’s budget and any issuance of future debt by the government and its instrumentalities.
In addition, PROMESA imposes an automatic stay on all litigation against Puerto Rico and its instrumentalities, as well as any other judicial or administrative actions or proceedings to enforce or collect claims against the Puerto Rico government.
Promptly after the expiration of the stay, creditors of the Puerto Rico government filed various lawsuits involving defaults on more than $70 billion of bonds issued by Puerto Rico, having failed to reach a negotiated settlement on such defaults with the Puerto Rico government during the period of the automatic stay.
On May 3, 2017, the Oversight Board filed a voluntary petition of relief on behalf of the Commonwealth pursuant to Title III of PROMESA for the restructuring of the Commonwealth’s debt.

Total revenues in the first quarter of 2018 increased by $9.0 million or 9% to $110.3 million.
Cost of revenues amounted to $47.4 million an increase of $3.2 million or 7% when compared with the prior year period.
Selling, general and administrative expenses in the first quarter of 2018 increased by $2.6 million or 24% to $13.4 million when compared with the first quarter of 2017.
Depreciation and amortization expense amounted to $15.9 million , relatively flat when compared with the prior year.
Non-operating expenses increased by $1.1 million to $6.5 million when compared with the prior year period.
The increase is mainly related to an increase in interest expense of $0.6 million coupled with a $0.5 million decrease in Other income, net due to a decrease in foreign exchange gains.
