We have elected to present the analysis of changes in stockholders equity quarterly in statement form for the current and comparative year to date interim periods and state the amount of dividends per share in the aggregate for each class of shares in accordance with the provisions in Regulation S-X, Rule 8-03(a)(5) and 10-01(a)(7).
These unaudited condensed consolidated interim financial statements should be read in conjunction with the Companys audited consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2018, as reported in the Companys Annual Report on Form 10-K.
We classify cloud-based subscriptions and other services, such as font related services, custom font design and post contract support as service revenue on our condensed consolidated statements of operations.
We also elected the practical expedient that allows an accounting policy election to exclude right of use assets and lease obligations from the balance sheet for all leases with an initial term of 12 months or less.
The most significant impact of the adoption of ASU 2016-02 was the recognition of additional right-of-use assets and lease liabilities for operating leases.
At adoption, the Company recognized right-of-use assets of approximately $14.4 million and total lease liabilities of $15.9 million.
Our Creative Professional revenue is primarily derived from rights to use font licenses, custom font design services, our web font and digital ad related services (which includes our web font services and web design tools), and hosted software as a service, or SaaS, offerings.
Revenue from font licenses is recognized upfront when the font software is delivered or made available to the customer.
Custom font design services are generally not a separate distinct performance obligation and are sold with a license for the custom font, in which case revenue is recognized upon completion of the services and when the font is delivered and accepted by the customer.
For our hosted offerings where we provide our customers the right to access our software without taking possession, revenue is recognized over the contract period on a time-elapsed basis, which is consistent with the transfer of service to the customer.
Revenue from fixed fee licenses is generally recognized upfront at the point in time when the software embodying the font is shipped or made available to the customer.
Certain OEM contracts may include customer support services and unspecified updates for our font technology which is a distinct stand-ready performance obligation and recognized ratably over the service period.

For the three months ended March 31, 2019 and 2018, revenue from customers outside the United States comprised 54.8% and 56.2%, respectively, of our total revenue.
For the three months ended March 31, 2019 and 2018, our top ten licensees by revenue, most of which are OEM customers, accounted for approximately 24.6% and 23.0% of our total revenue, respectively.
No one customer accounted for more than 10.0% of our total revenue for the three months ended March 31, 2019 or 2018.
Service revenue decreased in the three months ended March 31, 2019, as compared to the same period in 2018, mainly due to increased customer churn in the last half of 2018.
Gross profit from license revenue, before amortization of acquired technology, increased to 83.9% from 79.0% mainly due to the one-time additional non-recurring royalty expense in the three months ended March 31, 2018, for which there was no corresponding revenue in the period, in accordance with ASC 606.
While revenue from services has grown to a level of significance requiring separate disclosure, we continue to operate our business based on our two principal markets, Creative Professional and OEM, which is the basis for the following discussion of operating results.
The following discussion compares the three months ended March 31, 2019 with the three months ended March 31, 2018.
Revenue was $51.4 million and $56.7 million for the three months ended March 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively, a decrease of $5.3 million, or 9.4%.
OEM revenue decreased $3.1 million, or 14.3%, to $18.6 million in the first quarter of 2019, as compared to $21.7 million in the first quarter of 2018, mainly due to a decline in printer revenue.
The decrease in printer revenue, period over period, is largely due to a decline in revenue from our printer imaging electronic OEM customers.
Cost of revenue, excluding amortization of acquired technology, decreased $2.8 million, or 22.8%, to $9.6 million and $12.4 million in the three months ended March 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively.
