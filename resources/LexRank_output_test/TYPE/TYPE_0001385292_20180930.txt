In addition, our royalty based revenue is lower in the three months ended September 30, 2018, as a result of the adoption of ASC 606.
Gross profit from license revenue, before amortization of acquired technology, decreased to 84.8% from 86.4%, period over period.We grant credit to customers in the ordinary course of business.Item 1.
