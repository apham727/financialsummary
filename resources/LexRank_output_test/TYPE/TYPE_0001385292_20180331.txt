In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board, or FASB, and the International Accounting Standards Board jointly issued ASU 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606) (ASC 606), which outlines a comprehensive five-step revenue recognition model based on principle that replaces virtually all existing revenue recognition rules under U.S. GAAP and which requires revenue to be recognized in a manner to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to a customer at an amount that reflects the consideration expected to be received in exchange for those goods or services.
We adopted the standard on January 1, 2018, and applied the modified retrospective method of adoption and have elected to apply the new standard only to contracts not completed at January 1, 2018, which represents contracts for which all (or substantially all) of the revenues have not been recognized under existing guidance as of the date of adoption.

For the three months ended March 31, 2018 and 2017, revenue from customers outside the United States comprised 56.2% and 55.0%, respectively, of our total revenue.
For the three months ended March 31, 2018 and 2017, our top ten licensees by revenue, most of which are OEM customers, accounted for approximately 23.0% and 31.3% of our total revenue, respectively.
No one customer accounted for more than 10% of our total revenue for the three months ended March 31, 2018 or 2017.
License revenue increased primarily due to the growth in sales of revenue from our enterprise customers, including the launch of our Mosaic product offering, partially offset by decreases due to certain one-time printer revenue recognized in the first quarter of 2017 as a result of conversion of customers to fixed fee contracts from royalty bearing contracts.
These decreases are primarily due to additional non-recurring royalty expense for which there was no corresponding revenue in the period in accordance with ASC 606.
