2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606) (“ASU 2014-09”, and collectively with its related subsequent amendments, “Topic 606”).
Topic 606 supersedes previous revenue recognition guidance and requires the Company to recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the Company expects to be entitled in exchange for such goods or services.
Under this transition method, the Company’s results in the consolidated statements of operations for the second quarter and six months ended December 29, 2018 are presented under Topic 606, while the comparative results for the second quarter and six months ended December 30, 2017 were not retrospectively adjusted, as such results were recognized in accordance with the revenue recognition policy discussed under Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in Note 1 of the Company’s Fiscal 2018 Annual Report on Form 10-K.
The adoption of Topic 606 did not have a material impact on the Company’s consolidated financial statements as of the adoption date and as of and for the six months ended December 29, 2018.
For these contracts, the Company recognizes revenue over time as control of the goods transfers through the manufacturing process, rather than when the goods are delivered, and title, risk and reward of ownership are passed to the customer, as under previous revenue recognition guidance.
The Company adopted this standard effective the first quarter of fiscal year 2019, which required changes to the classification of net periodic pension costs in the consolidated statements of operations for all periods presented.
The Company is currently evaluating the impact of the adoption of ASU 2017-12 on its consolidated financial statements.
Prior to the adoption of Topic 606, the Company’s revenue recognition policy was in accordance with ASC Topic 605, Revenue Recognition.
Effective July 1, 2018, the Company adopted Topic 606 using the modified retrospective transition method, resulting in accounting policy changes surrounding revenue recognition which replace revenue recognition policies discussed in the Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in Note 1 of the Company’s Fiscal 2018 Annual Report on Form 10-K.
The adoption of Topic 606 did not have a material impact on the Company’s consolidated financial statements.
Revenue is recognized at the point at which control of the underlying products are transferred to the customer, which includes determining whether products are distinct and separate performance obligations.
For contracts related to the specialized manufacture of products for customers with no alternative use and for which the Company has an enforceable right to payment, including a reasonable profit margin, the Company recognizes revenue over time as control of the products transfer through the manufacturing process.
The contract assets associated with such specialized manufacturing products are not material as these contracts represent less than 2% of the Company’s total sales.
These adjustments are made in the same period as the underlying sales transactions.
The Company has elected to treat shipping and handling of product as a fulfillment activity.

Sales taking into account these adjustments are referred to as “organic sales.” Management believes that providing this additional information is useful to readers to better assess and understand operating performance, especially when comparing results with prior periods or forecasting performance for future periods, primarily because management typically monitors the business both including and excluding these adjustments to GAAP results.
However, any analysis of results on a non-GAAP basis should be used as a complement to, and in conjunction with, results presented in accordance with GAAP.
