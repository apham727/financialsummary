The information included in this Form 10-Q should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes included in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended July 1, 2017.
In August 2017, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued Accounting Standards Update 2017-12, Derivatives and Hedging (Topic 815) - Targeted Improvements to Accounting for Hedging Activities (“ASU 2017-12”), which improves the financial reporting of hedging relationships to better portray the economic results of an entity’s risk management activities in its financial statements and makes certain targeted improvements to simplify the qualification and application of the hedge accounting compared to current GAAP.
The Company is currently evaluating the impact of the adoption of ASU 2017-12 on its consolidated financial statements.
In March 2017, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update 2017-07, Compensation—Retirement Benefits (Topic 715) - Improving the Presentation of Net Periodic Pension Cost and Net Periodic Postretirement Benefit Cost (“ASU 2017-07”).
Refer to Note 9, “Pension Plan,” for further information on the components of net periodic pension cost.
The Company is currently evaluating the impact of the adoption of ASU 2016-02 on its consolidated financial statements.
The core principles of ASU 2014-09 are to recognize revenue when promised goods or services are transferred to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration that is expected to be received for those goods or services.
Application of the guidance in ASU 2014-09 is expected to require more judgment and estimates within the revenue recognition process compared to existing GAAP.
ASU 2014-09 is required to be adopted by the Company in the first quarter of fiscal 2019.
The Company has identified its revenue streams and is currently assessing each stream for potential impacts from the adoption of ASU 2014-09.
The Company does not currently expect significant changes in revenue recognition practices for continuing operations compared to existing GAAP.
Additionally, Avnet assumed $242.8 million of debt at fair value.

Sales taking into account these adjustments are referred to as “organic sales.” Management believes that providing this additional information is useful to readers to better assess and understand operating performance, especially when comparing results with prior periods or forecasting performance for future periods, primarily because management typically monitors the business both including and excluding these adjustments to GAAP results.
Avnet, Inc., founded in 1921 and incorporated in New York in 1955, together with its consolidated subsidiaries (the “Company” or “Avnet”), is a global value-added distributor of electronic components.

Excluding these expenses from both periods, adjusted operating income margin was 3.2% in the second quarter of fiscal 2018 as compared to 3.8% in the second quarter of fiscal 2017.
Second quarter sales of $4.52 billion increased 5.8% over the prior year second quarter sales of $4.27 billion primarily due to the acquisition of PF and increased sales in EC’s EMEA and Asia regions.
Sales for the first six months of fiscal 2018 were $9.18 billion, an increase of 9.4% as compared to sales of $8.39 billion for the first six months of fiscal 2017 primarily due to the acquisition of PF.
Organic sales for the first six months of 2018 increased $412.6 million over the first six months of fiscal 2017 organic sales primarily due to increases in EMEA and Asia, offset by declines in the Americas.
Gross profit for the second quarter of fiscal 2018 was $602.5 million, an increase of $16.3 million, or 2.8%, from the second quarter of fiscal 2017 gross profit of $586.2 million driven primarily by the acquisition of PF.

For example, under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act of 1980, as amended, and similar state laws, Avnet is and may be liable for the costs of cleaning up environmental contamination on or from certain of its current or former properties, and at off-site locations where the Company disposed of wastes in the past.
Based on the information known to date, management believes that the Company has appropriately accrued in its consolidated financial statements for its share of the estimable costs of environmental and other compliance related matters.
