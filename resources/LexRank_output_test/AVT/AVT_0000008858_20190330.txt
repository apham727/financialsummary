Topic 606 supersedes previous revenue recognition guidance and requires the Company to recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the Company expects to be entitled in exchange for such goods or services.
Under this transition method, the Company’s results in the consolidated statements of operations for the third quarter and nine months ended March 30, 2019 are presented under Topic 606, while the comparative results for the third quarter and nine months ended March 31, 2018 were not retrospectively adjusted, as such results were recognized in accordance with the revenue recognition policy discussed under Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in Note 1 of the Company’s Fiscal 2018 Annual Report on Form 10-K.
The adoption of Topic 606 did not have a material impact on the Company’s consolidated financial statements as of the adoption date and as of and for the nine months ended March 30, 2019.

Prior to the adoption of Topic 606, the Company’s revenue recognition policy was in accordance with ASC Topic 605, Revenue Recognition.
Effective July 1, 2018, the Company adopted Topic 606 using the modified retrospective transition method, resulting in accounting policy changes surrounding revenue recognition which replace revenue recognition policies discussed in the Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in Note 1 of the Company’s Fiscal 2018 Annual Report on Form 10-K.
The adoption of Topic 606 did not have a material impact on the Company’s consolidated financial statements.
Revenue is recognized at the point at which control of the underlying products are transferred to the customer, which includes determining whether products are distinct and separate performance obligations.

For contracts related to the specialized manufacture of products for customers with no alternative use and for which the Company has an enforceable right to payment, including a reasonable profit margin, the Company recognizes revenue over time as control of the products transfer through the manufacturing process.
The contract assets associated with such specialized manufacturing products are not material as these contracts represent less than 2% of the Company’s total sales.
These adjustments are made in the same period as the underlying sales transactions.
