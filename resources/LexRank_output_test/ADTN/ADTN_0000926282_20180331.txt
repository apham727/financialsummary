The two primary areas of impact of these ASUs were network implementation service revenue performance obligations and contract costs.
The primary impact will be accelerated revenue recognition for certain performance obligations related to service revenue arrangements that were previously deferred until customer acceptance and capitalization and amortization of incremental costs of obtaining a contract as described below.
In connection with the adoption of the new revenue standard, effective January 1, 2018, we adopted ASC 340-40, Other Assets and Deferred Costs - Contracts with Customers, with respect to capitalization and amortization of incremental costs of obtaining a contract.
The primary impact was capitalization of certain sales commissions for our extended maintenance and support contracts in excess of one year and amortization of those costs over the period that the related revenue is recognized.
