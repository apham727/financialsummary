The interim statements should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and notes thereto included in ADTRAN’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018, filed on February 28, 2019 with the SEC.
In August 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-13, Fair Value Measurement (Topic 820) Disclosure Framework-Changes to the Disclosure Requirements for Fair Value Measurement, which changes the fair value measurement disclosure requirements of ASC 820, Fair Value Measurement.
More specifically ASU 2018-13 requires disclosures about the valuation techniques and inputs that are used to arrive at measures of fair value, including judgments and assumptions that are made in determining fair value.
In July 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-10, Codification Improvements to Topic 842, Leases, which clarified certain aspects of ASU 2016-02, as well as, ASU 2018-11, Leases (Topic 842), Targeted Improvements, which provided for an optional transition method which allowed for the application of the legacy lease guidance, including its disclosure requirements, for the comparative periods presented in the year of adoption, with the cumulative effect of initially applying the new lease standard recognized as an adjustment to retained earnings as of the date of adoption.
In March 2019, the FASB issued ASU 2019-01, Leases (Topic 824) Codification Improvements, which removed the requirement for an entity to disclose in the interim periods after adoption, the effect of the change on income from continuing operations, net income, any other affected financial statement line item, and any affected per share amount.
As a lessor, the adoption of this standard did not have a material impact on the Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheet, Consolidated Statement of Income or Statement of Cash Flow.
Prior to and after adoption, all of our leases in which we are the lessor were classified as sales-types leases.
As of March 31, 2019, the fair value of the contingent liability was re-assessed and was determined to be $1.2 million, based on the expected probable outcomes.
No change in fair value was recognized during the three months ended March 31, 2019.
An escrow in the amount of $2.8 million was set up at the acquisition date, to fund post-closing working capital settlements and to indemnify the Company from any inaccuracy or breach of representations, warranties, covenants, agreements or obligations of the sellers.
We recorded goodwill of $3.5 million as a result of this acquisition, which represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of net assets acquired.
We recorded a bargain purchase gain, net of income taxes, of $11.3 million during the first quarter of 2018, which represents the difference between the fair value of the net assets acquired over the cash paid.
Aside from revising the 2018 net income for the effect of the bargain purchase gain, there were no material, non-recurring adjustments to this unaudited pro forma information.
For the three months ended March 31, 2019 and 2018, we incurred acquisition and integration related expenses and amortization of acquired intangibles of $1.3 million and $0.2 million respectively, related to these acquisitions.
In certain transactions, we are also the lessor in sales-type lease arrangements for network equipment.
As of March 31, 2019, we did not have any significant performance obligations related to customer contracts that had an original expected duration of one year or more, other than maintenance services, which are satisfied over time.
$6.9 million of the outstanding unearned revenue balance at December 31, 2018 was recognized as revenue during the three months ended March 31, 2019.
Our effective tax rate increased from an expense of 15.1%, excluding the tax effect of the bargain purchase gain, in the three months ended March 31, 2018, to an expense of 28.6% in the three months ended March 31, 2019.

As a percentage of sales, cost of sales decreased from 67.1% in the three months ended March 31, 2018 to 57.8% in the three months ended March 31, 2019.
Network Solutions cost of sales, as a percent of that segment’s sales, decreased from 65.2% in the three months ended March 31, 2018 to 56.2% in the three months ended March 31, 2019.
The decrease in cost of sales as a percentage of sales for the three months ended March 31, 2019 is primarily attributable to a regional revenue shift, customer and product mix and a decrease in labor expense due to a restructuring program in the first quarter of 2018.
