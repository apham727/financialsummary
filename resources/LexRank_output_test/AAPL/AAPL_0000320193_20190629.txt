Certain prior period amounts in the condensed consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes have been reclassified to conform to the current period’s presentation.
These condensed consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes should be read in conjunction with the Company’s annual consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto included in its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended September 29, 2018 (the “2018 Form 10-K”).
Additionally, beginning in the first quarter of 2019, the Company classified the amortization of the deferred value of Maps, Siri® and free iCloud® services, which are bundled in the sales price of iPhone®, Mac®, iPad® and certain other products, in services net sales.
As a result, products and services net sales information for the third quarter and first nine months of 2018 was reclassified to conform to the 2019 presentation.
The Company records restricted marketable securities as current or non-current marketable securities in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets based on the classification of the underlying securities.
Net sales consist of revenue from the sale of iPhone, Mac, iPad, services and other products.
The Company recognizes revenue at the amount to which it expects to be entitled when control of the products or services is transferred to its customers.
For most of the Company’s products net sales, control transfers when products are shipped.
Payment for products and services net sales is collected within a short period of time following transfer of control or commencement of delivery of services, as applicable.
Because the Company lacks observable prices for the undelivered performance obligations, the allocation of revenue is based on the Company’s estimated SSPs.All information presented herein is based on the Company’s fiscal calendar.
Unless otherwise stated, references to particular years, quarters, months or periods refer to the Company’s fiscal years ended in September and the associated quarters, months and periods of those fiscal years.The outcome of litigation is inherently uncertain.
These risk factors may be important to understanding other statements in this Form 10-Q.
The Company has international operations with sales outside the U.S. representing a majority of the Company’s total net sales.
In addition to an adverse impact on demand for the Company’s products, uncertainty about, or a decline in, global or regional economic conditions could have a significant impact on the Company’s suppliers, contract manufacturers, logistics providers, distributors, cellular network carriers and other channel partners.
A downturn in the economic environment could also lead to increased credit and collectibility risk on the Company’s trade receivables; the failure of derivative counterparties and other financial institutions; limitations on the Company’s ability to issue new debt; reduced liquidity; and declines in the fair value of the Company’s financial instruments.
Global markets for the Company’s products and services are highly competitive and subject to rapid technological change, and the Company may be unable to compete effectively in these markets.
