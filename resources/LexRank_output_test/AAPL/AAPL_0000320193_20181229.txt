Apple Inc. and its wholly-owned subsidiaries (collectively “Apple” or the “Company”) designs, manufactures and markets mobile communication and media devices and personal computers, and sells a variety of related software, services, accessories and third-party digital content and applications.
The Company sells its products worldwide through its retail stores, online stores and direct sales force, as well as through third-party cellular network carriers, wholesalers, retailers and resellers.
In addition, the Company sells a variety of third-party Apple-compatible products, including application software and various accessories, through its retail and online stores.
The accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company.
Certain prior period amounts in the condensed consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes have been reclassified to conform to the current period’s presentation.
These condensed consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes should be read in conjunction with the Company’s annual consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto included in its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended September 29, 2018 (the “2018 Form 10-K”).
Additionally, beginning in the first quarter of 2019, the Company classified the amortization of the deferred value of Maps, Siri® and free iCloud services, which are bundled in the sales price of iPhone, Mac, iPad and certain other products, in Services net sales.
As a result, Products and Services net sales information for the first quarter of 2018 was reclassified to conform to the 2019 presentation.
Net sales consist of revenue from the sale of iPhone, Mac, iPad, services and other products.
The Company recognizes revenue at the amount to which it expects to be entitled when control of the products or services is transferred to its customers.
For most of the Company’s products net sales, control transfers when products are shipped.
For the Company’s services net sales, control transfers over time as services are delivered.
Payment for products and services net sales is collected within a short period of time following transfer of control or commencement of delivery of services, as applicable.
The Company has identified up to three performance obligations regularly included in arrangements involving the sale of iPhone, Mac, iPad and certain other products.
Because the Company lacks observable prices for the undelivered performance obligations, the allocation of revenue is based on the Company’s estimated SSPs.
Revenue allocated to the product-related bundled services and unspecified software upgrade rights is deferred and recognized on a straight-line basis over the estimated period they are expected to be provided.

The outcome of litigation is inherently uncertain.
The Company has international operations with sales outside the U.S. representing a majority of the Company’s total net sales.
In addition to an adverse impact on demand for the Company’s products, uncertainty about, or a decline in, global or regional economic conditions could have a significant impact on the Company’s suppliers, contract manufacturers, logistics providers, distributors, cellular network carriers and other channel partners.
A downturn in the economic environment could also lead to increased credit and collectibility risk on the Company’s trade receivables; the failure of derivative counterparties and other financial institutions; limitations on the Company’s ability to issue new debt; reduced liquidity; and declines in the fair value of the Company’s financial instruments.
The Company currently holds a significant number of patents, trademarks and copyrights and has registered, and applied to register, numerous patents, trademarks and copyrights.
The Company faces substantial competition in these markets from companies that have significant technical, marketing, distribution and other resources, as well as established hardware, software and digital content supplier relationships.
Certain competitors may have the resources, experience or cost structures to provide products at little or no profit or even at a loss.
Some of the markets in which the Company competes, including the market for personal computers, have from time to time experienced little to no growth or contracted.
The Company’s services also face substantial competition, including from companies that have significant resources and experience and have established service offerings with large customer bases.
