The unaudited financial statements of Encore Wire Corporation (the “Company”) have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”) for interim information and the instructions to Form 10-Q and Rule 10-01 of Regulation S-X.
The following are those ASUs that are relevant to the Company.
The Company has a minimal number of leases, all of which are classified as operating.
As a result of the adoption of ASU No.
2016-02, “Leases (Topic 842),” on January 1, 2019, the Company recorded $0.7 million of right of use assets which are included in other non-current assets, $0.2 million of current lease liabilities which are included in accounts payable and $0.5 million of long-term lease liabilities included in other non-current liabilities.
In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU No.
2016-13, “Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326),” which makes significant changes to the accounting for credit losses on financial assets and disclosures about them.
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost, determined by the last-in, first-out (LIFO) method, or market.

Price competition for electrical wire and cable is intense, and the Company sells its products in accordance with prevailing market prices.
Such funds and other copper ETFs like them hold copper cathode as collateral against their shares.
The acquisition of copper cathode by copper ETFs may materially decrease or interrupt the availability of copper for immediate delivery in the United States, which could materially increase the Company’s cost of copper.
The tables below highlight the range of closing prices of copper on a per pound basis on the Comex exchange for the periods shown.
Net sales were $321.2 million in the third quarter of 2019 compared to $340.7 million in the third quarter of 2018.
The drop in net sales dollars is primarily the result of a 5.9% decrease in the average selling price of copper wire, offset slightly by a 0.2% increase in copper wire unit volume shipped.
The average cost per pound of raw copper purchased decreased 4.2% in the third quarter of 2019 compared to the third quarter of 2018 and was a driver of the decreased average sales price of copper wire.
Cost of goods sold was $278.2 million, or 86.6% of net sales, in the third quarter of 2019, compared to $286.2 million, or 84.0% of net sales, in the third quarter of 2018.
Gross profit decreased to $43.0 million, or 13.4% of net sales, in the third quarter of 2019 from $54.5 million, or 16.0% of net sales, in the third quarter of 2018.
As permitted by U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, the Company maintains its inventory costs and cost of goods sold on a first-in, first-out (“FIFO”) basis and makes a monthly adjustment to adjust total inventory and cost of goods sold from FIFO to LIFO.
However, decreases in copper and other material prices could necessitate establishing an LCM reserve in future periods.
During the third quarter of 2018, a LIFO adjustment was recorded, decreasing cost of sales by $9.1 million.
Net sales for the first nine months of 2019 were $972.7 million compared to net sales of $969.0 million for the first nine months of 2018.
This 0.4% increase in net sales is the result of a 6.0% increase in copper wire unit volume shipped, offset by a 5.8% decrease in the average selling price of copper wire.
The average cost per pound of raw copper purchased decreased 7.3% in the first nine months of 2019 compared to the first nine months of 2018 and was a driver of the decreased average sales price of copper wire.
Cost of goods sold increased to $842.5 million in the first nine months of 2019, compared to $832.5 million in the first nine months of 2018.
