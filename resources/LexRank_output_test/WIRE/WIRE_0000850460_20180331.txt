The unaudited consolidated financial statements of Encore Wire Corporation (the “Company”) have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”) for interim information and the instructions to Form 10-Q and Rule 10-01 of Regulation S-X.
The Financial Accounting Standards Board (the “FASB”) Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) is the sole source of authoritative U.S. GAAP other than Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") issued rules and regulations that apply only to SEC registrants.
In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU No.

On January 1, 2018, we adopted the requirements of ASC Topic 606 and all the related amendments to all of our contracts using the modified retrospective method.
Additional disclosures required by ASC Topic 606 are presented under Revenue Recognition above.
2016-02, “Leases (Topic 842).” Under the new guidance, a lessee will be required to recognize a right to use asset and a lease liability for all leases with terms of twelve months or longer.
The Company is evaluating the effect that ASU 2016-02 will have on its consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.
During the first three quarters of every year, LIFO calculations are based on the inventory levels and costs at that time.Price competition for electrical wire and cable is intense, and the Company sells its products in accordance with prevailing market prices.
Copper, a commodity product, is the principal raw material used by the Company in manufacturing its products.
Such funds and other copper ETFs like them hold copper cathode as collateral against their shares.
The acquisition of copper cathode by copper ETFs may materially decrease or interrupt the availability of copper for immediate delivery in the United States, which could materially increase the Company’s cost of copper.
Net sales were $291.4 million in the first quarter of 2018 compared to $279.4 million in the first quarter of 2017.
This 4.3% increase in net sales is primarily the result of a 6.4% increase in copper wire sales, driven by a 15.6% increase in the average selling price of copper wire offset by a 7.9% decrease in copper wire unit volume shipped.
The average cost per pound of raw copper purchased increased 18.3% in the first quarter of 2018 compared to the first quarter of 2017 and was the principal driver of the increased average sales price of copper wire.
Unit volume decreased in the first quarter of 2018 compared to the first quarter of 2017 primarily due to particularly rough winter weather that slowed construction and impacted our volumes, particularly in January.
Cost of goods sold was $253.9 million, or 87.1% of net sales, in the first quarter of 2018, compared to $240.2 million, or 86.0% of net sales, in the first quarter of 2017.For information on the Company’s legal proceedings, see Note 8 to the Company’s consolidated financial statements included in Item 1 to this report and incorporated herein by reference.
