The unaudited financial statements of Encore Wire Corporation (the “Company”) have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”) for interim information and the instructions to Form 10-Q and Rule 10-01 of Regulation S-X.
Amounts billed and due from our customers are classified as accounts receivables on the balance sheet and require payment on a short-term basis through standard payment terms.
We review and update these estimates regularly and the impact of any adjustments are recognized in the period the adjustments are identified.
The Financial Accounting Standards Board (the “FASB”) Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) is the sole source of authoritative U.S. GAAP other than Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") issued rules and regulations that apply only to SEC registrants.
The Company considers the applicability and impact of all ASUs.
In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU No.
The comparative information has also not been restated and continues to be reported under the accounting standards in effect for those periods.
The Company has a minimal number of leases, all of which are classified as operating.
2016-02, “Leases (Topic 842),” on January 1, 2019, the Company recorded $0.7 million of right of use assets which are included in other non-current assets in the accompanying balance sheet, $0.2 million of current lease liabilities which are included in accounts payable and $0.5 million of long-term lease liabilities included in other non-current liabilities.
We will evaluate any future lease commitments in conformance with ASU No.
During the first three quarters of every year, LIFO calculations are based on the inventory levels and costs at that time.

Price competition for electrical wire and cable is intense, and the Company sells its products in accordance with prevailing market prices.
Copper, a commodity product, is the principal raw material used by the Company in manufacturing its products.
Such funds and other copper ETFs like them hold copper cathode as collateral against their shares.
The acquisition of copper cathode by copper ETFs may materially decrease or interrupt the availability of copper for immediate delivery in the United States, which could materially increase the Company’s cost of copper.
The tables below highlight the range of closing prices of copper on a per pound basis on the Comex exchange for the periods shown.
Net sales were $314.7 million in the first quarter of 2019 compared to $291.4 million in the first quarter of 2018.
This 8.0% increase in net sales dollars is primarily the result of a 13.5% increase in copper wire unit volume shipped, offset somewhat by a 5.9% decrease in the average selling price of copper wire.
The average cost per pound of raw copper purchased decreased 9.6% in the first quarter of 2019 compared to the first quarter of 2018 and was the principal driver of the decreased average sales price of copper wire.
Cost of goods sold was $273.4 million, or 86.9% of net sales, in the first quarter of 2019, compared to $253.9 million, or 87.1% of net sales, in the first quarter of 2018.
Gross profit increased to $41.3 million, or 13.1% of net sales, in the first quarter of 2019 from $37.5 million, or 12.9% of net sales, in the first quarter of 2018.
The spread between the average price paid for a pound of raw copper and the average sales price for a pound of copper contained in finished wire increased 2.2% in the first quarter of 2019 versus the first quarter of 2018.
The percentage change on sales is on a higher nominal dollar amount than on purchases and, therefore, spreads change on a nominal dollar basis.
The final results of the U.S. Government’s ongoing antidumping and countervailing duty investigations are not expected until the end of the year.
Total raw materials cost, including the LIFO adjustment, decreased to 75.0% of net sales in the first quarter of 2019, from 76.5% of net sales in the first quarter of 2018.
Increased overhead costs added to the increase in total cost of sales dollars and increased as a percent of net sales.
As permitted by U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, the Company maintains its inventory costs and cost of goods sold on a first-in, first-out (FIFO) basis and makes a monthly adjustment to adjust total inventory and cost of goods sold from FIFO to LIFO.
