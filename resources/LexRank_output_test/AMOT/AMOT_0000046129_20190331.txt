The Company has no obligation or intent to release publicly any revisions to any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events, or otherwise.
Acquisitive and organic growth across all the Companys served markets led to leveraging of costs and expansion of margins.
Excluding the unfavorable effects of foreign currency exchange (FX) of $3,140, first quarter revenue was $97,036, up 26.7%.
Revenue excluding foreign currency exchange impacts is a non-gaap measurement.
Solid strides continue to be made with our multi-product, fully integrated solutions that are leading to increased business.
Also, we continue to build a pipeline of exciting market-based application opportunities.
Revenue excluding foreign currency exchange impacts, EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are provided for information purposes only and are not measures of financial performance under GAAP.
The Company believes that revenue excluding foreign currency exchange impacts is a useful measure in analyzing organic sales results.
The Company believes EBITDA is often a useful measure of a Companys operating performance and is a significant basis used by the Companys management to measure the operating performance of the Companys business because EBITDA excludes charges for depreciation, amortization and interest expense that have resulted from our debt financings, as well as our provision for income tax expense.
EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA do not represent and should not be considered as an alternative to net income, operating income, net cash provided by operating activities or any other measure for determining operating performance or liquidity that is calculated in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.
During the first quarter of 2019, the decrease in cash provided by operating activities is primarily due to an increase in working capital needs to support the sequential quarter, primarily for trade receivables.
Purchases of property and equipment were $2,505 during the first quarter 2019 compared to $2,222 for the first quarter 2018.
Capital expenditures are expected to increase for the remainder of 2019 to support our continued growth.
The Credit Agreement also includes other covenants and restrictions, including limits on the amount of additional indebtedness, and restrictions on the ability to merge, consolidate or sell all or substantially all our assets.

Net foreign currency transaction gains and losses included in other income, net amounted to approximately a loss of $100 and $138 for the first quarters of 2019 and 2018, respectively.
A hypothetical 10% change in the value of the U.S. dollar in relation to our most significant foreign currency net assets would have had an impact of approximately $6,700 on our foreign net assets as of March 31, 2019.
We primarily use interest rate swaps as part of our interest rate risk management strategy.
During October 2013, the Company entered into two interest rate swaps with a combined notional of $25,000 that amortized quarterly to a notional of $6,673 at the September 2018 maturity.
Neither of these interest rate swaps is currently active, one was liquidated as part of the 2016 debt refinancing and the other matured in September 2018.
In February 2017, we entered into three interest rate swaps with a combined notional of $40,000 that matures in February 2022.
