Acquisitive and organic growth across all the Companys served markets led to leveraging of costs and expansion of margins.
Excluding the unfavorable effects of foreign currency exchange (FX) of $3,140, first quarter revenue was $97,036, up 26.7%.
Revenue excluding foreign currency exchange impacts is a non-gaap measurement.

The Company believes that revenue excluding foreign currency exchange impacts is a useful measure in analyzing organic sales results.
The Company believes EBITDA is often a useful measure of a Companys operating performance and is a significant basis used by the Companys management to measure the operating performance of the Companys business because EBITDA excludes charges for depreciation, amortization and interest expense that have resulted from our debt financings, as well as our provision for income tax expense.Net foreign currency transaction gains and losses included in other income, net amounted to approximately a loss of $100 and $138 for the first quarters of 2019 and 2018, respectively.
A hypothetical 10% change in the value of the U.S. dollar in relation to our most significant foreign currency net assets would have had an impact of approximately $6,700 on our foreign net assets as of March 31, 2019.
We primarily use interest rate swaps as part of our interest rate risk management strategy.
During October 2013, the Company entered into two interest rate swaps with a combined notional of $25,000 that amortized quarterly to a notional of $6,673 at the September 2018 maturity.Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.Item 1A.
