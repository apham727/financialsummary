However, the concentration of our business in the rail industry, and in equipment for military applications and industrial applications, and our customer concentrations expose us to on-going associated risks.
These risks include, without limitation, requirements for power supplies in the rail industry, dependence on appropriations from the United States Government and the governments of foreign nations, program allocations, the potential of governmental termination of orders for convenience, and the general strength of the industry sectors in which our customers transact business.
As part of our strategy, we adjust our pricing in order to achieve a balance which enables us both to retain repeat programs while being more competitive in bidding on new programs.
Management expects revenues in fiscal year 2019 to be higher than revenues during fiscal year 2018 but expects the gross profit margin to be lower in fiscal year 2019 than the gross profit margin during fiscal year 2018.
New orders received in the first three months of fiscal year 2019 and 2018 were approximately $6.9 million.
The minimum of $33.7 million does not include any shipments, which may be made against orders subsequently received during the fiscal year ending June 30, 2019.
In addition to the backlog, the Company currently has outstanding opportunities representing in excess of $69.5 million in the aggregate as of October 31, 2018 for both repeat and new programs.
However, there can be no assurance that the Company will acquire any of the anticipated orders described above, many of which are subject to allocations of the United States defense spending and factors affecting the defense industry.
A significant portion of the Company’s business is the production of military and industrial electronic equipment for use by the U.S. and foreign governments and certain industrial customers.
Net sales to two significant customers represented 62.5% of the Company’s total sales for the three-month period ended September 30, 2018 and net sales to two significant customers represented 73.9% of the Company's total sales for the three-month period ended September 30, 2017.
We assess each contract at its inception to determine whether it should be combined with other contracts.
We evaluate the products or services promised in each contract at inception to determine whether the contract should be accounted for as having one or more performance obligation.
We determine the transaction price for each contract based on the consideration we expect to receive for the products or services being provided under the contract.
The costs attributed to units delivered under contracts are based on the estimated average cost of all units expected to be produced.
The estimation of total cost at completion of a contract is subject to numerous variables involving contract costs and estimates as to the length of time to complete the contract.
The increase in net sales is primarily due to an increase in build to print sales offset, in part, by a decrease in power supply shipments.
Gross profit as a percentage of sales was 11.9% and 19.5%, for the three months ended September 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively.
The gross profits on mature products and build to print contracts are typically higher as compared to products which are still in the engineering development stage or in early stages of production.
The gross profit percentage decreased in the three months ended September 30, 2018 as compared to the same period in 2017 primarily due to the impact of incurred spending related to a specific engineering design contract.
This increase in spending reduced the gross profit percentage in the current quarter by 8.6%.
Selling, general and administrative expenses were $1,009,544 for the three months ended September 30, 2018; an increase of $130,724, compared to the three months ended September 30, 2017.
The increase for the three months ended September 30, 2018 as compared to the same period in 2017 relates primarily to the increase in employee compensation costs associated with added program management personnel supporting the Company’s sales backlog.
Other income for the three months ended September 30, 2018 and 2017 was $76,070 and $41,396, respectively.
The increase for the three months is primarily due to an increase in interest income resulting from the gradual increase in current yield percentages earned on investment securities.
