As part of our strategy, we adjust our pricing in order to achieve a balance which enables us both to retain repeat programs while being more competitive in bidding on new programs.
Engineering programs in both the funded and unfunded portions of the current backlog aggregate $6.7 million.
Management expects revenues in fiscal year 2019 to be higher than revenues during fiscal year 2018 but expects the gross profit margin to be lower in fiscal year 2019 than the gross profit margin during fiscal year 2018.
New orders received in the first six months of fiscal year 2019 were approximately $13.4 million as compared to $14.3 million of new orders received in the first six months of fiscal 2018.
It is presently anticipated that a minimum of $24.4 million of orders comprising the December 31, 2018 backlog will be filled during the fiscal year ending June 30, 2019.
The minimum of $24.4 million does not include any shipments, which may be made against orders subsequently received during the fiscal year ending June 30, 2019.
In addition to the backlog, the Company currently has outstanding opportunities representing approximately $60.0 million in the aggregate as of January 31, 2019 for both repeat and new programs.
However, there can be no assurance that the Company will acquire any of the anticipated orders described above, many of which are subject to allocations of the United States defense spending and factors affecting the defense industry.
Net sales to two significant customers represented 49.4% of the Company’s total sales for the three-month period ended December 31, 2018 and net sales to three significant customers represented 63.2% of the Company's total sales for the three-month period ended December 31, 2017.

We assess each contract at its inception to determine whether it should be combined with other contracts.
We evaluate the products or services promised in each contract at inception to determine whether the contract should be accounted for as having one or more performance obligation.
We determine the transaction price for each contract based on the consideration we expect to receive for the products or services being provided under the contract.
Transaction prices on our contracts subject to the Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR) are typically based on estimated costs plus a reasonable profit margin.
The costs attributed to units delivered under contracts are based on the estimated average cost of all units expected to be produced.
The estimation of total cost at completion of a contract is subject to numerous variables involving contract costs and estimates as to the length of time to complete the contract.
For the three months ended December 31, 2018, the decline in net sales is primarily due to a decrease in power supply shipments on a specific military contract and a decrease in shipments supporting the rail industry.
For the six months ended December 31, 2018, the decrease in net sales is primarily due to the timing of power supply shipments related to a specific military contract which had significant shipments in the prior fiscal year, offset in part by an increase in build to print sales.
The gross profits on mature products and build to print contracts are typically higher as compared to products which are still in the engineering development stage or in early stages of production.
The gross profit percentage decreased in the three and six months ended December 31, 2018 as compared to the same period in 2017 primarily due to the impact of incurred spending related to a specific engineering design contract.
The increase for the three months ended December 31, 2018 as compared to the same period in 2017 relates primarily to the increase in employee compensation costs associated with added program management personnel supporting the Company’s sales backlog, professional services, and other miscellaneous expenses.
The increase for the six months ended December 31, 2018 as compared to the same period in 2017 relates primarily to the increases described for the three month period, however, for the six-month period ended December 31, 2018, the increases were offset, in part, by a reduction in travel, and incurred marketing costs.
Other income for the three months ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 was $53,361 and $43,289, respectively.
Other income for the six months ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 was $129,432 and $84,685, respectively.
