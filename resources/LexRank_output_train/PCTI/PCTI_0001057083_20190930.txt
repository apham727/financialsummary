The following information should be read in conjunction with the unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto included in Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2018 contained in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018 (the “2018 Form 10-K”).
Our third quarter 2019 revenues were $23.6 million and increased by $5.2 million or 28.2% compared to revenues of $18.4 million for the same period in 2018.
Third quarter 2019 revenues increased by $3.7 million or 103.6% to $7.2 million for the test and measurement products compared to the third quarter 2018 and increased by $1.6 million or 10.7% to $16.5 million for the antenna products.
The gross profit of $10.6 million, increased by $3.9 million compared to the same period in 2018 due to both a higher product mix of test and measurement product line revenues and an increase in the gross margin percentage for antenna products.
Primarily based on higher gross profit margins, we recorded an operating income of $0.9 million for the three months ended September 30, 2019 compared to an operating loss of $2.4 million during the third quarter 2018.
Antenna product revenues decreased by $2.6 million or 5.1% to $47.6 million primarily due to lower revenues with enterprise Wi-Fi applications and small cell antennas.
Revenues increased for the test and measurement products due to sales of 5G products for early deployment.
Because of higher gross profit margins, we recorded an operating income of $1.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2019 as compared to an operating loss of $5.2 million for the same period in 2018.
This Form 10-Q does not include segment reporting information; however, we have included revenues and gross profit for the two major product lines (antenna products and test and measurement products) because each product line has a significantly different gross profit profile.
