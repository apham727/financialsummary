PCTEL is a leading global supplier of wireless network antenna and testing solutions.
PCTEL’s Connected Solutions segment designs and manufactures precision antennas.
All operating profit and cash flows are measured and managed at the enterprise level.
Until the reorganization, PCTEL operated in two segments for reporting purposes, Connected Solutions and RF Solutions.
The Company managed its balance sheet and cash flows centrally at the corporate level, with the exception of trade accounts receivable and inventory which were managed at the segment level.
Because the reorganization occurred during the third quarter 2018, this report reflects the segment reporting structure that was in effect for all of 2017 and through August of 2018.
Beginning with the Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018, the Company will not report any segment information.
The Company will report revenue and gross profit for its two major product lines, Antenna Products and Test and Measurement Products.
PCTEL antennas are primarily sold to original equipment manufacturer (“OEM”) providers where they are designed into the customer’s solution.
PCTEL RF Solutions provides test tools that improve the performance of wireless networks globally, with a focus on LTE, public safety, and emerging 5G technologies.
PCTEL test equipment is sold directly to wireless carriers or to OEMs who integrate the Company’s products into their solutions which are then sold to wireless carriers.
During the quarter ended June 30, 2017, the Company approved a plan to sell its Network Engineering Services business (“Engineering Services”) and shift its focus to research and development driven radio frequency (“RF”) products.
On July 31, 2017, the Company sold substantially all of the assets of the Company’s Engineering Services business to Gabe’s Construction Co., Inc. (“Gabe’s”) for a purchase price of $1.45 million.
The Engineering Services business provided design, testing, commissioning, optimization, and consulting services for cellular, Wi-Fi and public safety networks and was a reporting unit within the RF Solutions segment.
The Company restated the results of Engineering Services as discontinued operations for the three and six months ended June 30, 2017.
The unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial statements of the Company include the condensed consolidated balance sheet and the condensed consolidated statement of stockholders’ equity as of September 30, 2018, and the condensed consolidated statements of operations, statements of comprehensive (loss) income, and cash flows for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively.
The condensed consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2017 is derived from the audited financial statements as of December 31, 2017.
There were no changes in the Company’s significant accounting policies during the nine months ended September 30, 2018.

Beginning with the Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018, we will not report any segment information.
PCTEL antennas are primarily sold to original equipment manufacturers (“OEM”) providers where they are designed into the customer’s solution.
These include radio frequency engineering, mobile antenna design and manufacturing, mechanical engineering, product quality and testing, and wireless network engineering.
Revenues for the RF Solutions segment decreased 38.0% and 27.6% for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2018, respectively, compared to the same periods in 2017 primarily due to lower capital spending by U.S. carriers for legacy 4G wireless systems in preparation for the capital expenditures required for 5G deployments.
