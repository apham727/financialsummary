Net sales for the three months ended March 31, 2019 were $2.8 billion, compared to $2.5 billion in the same period in 2018.
The increase was led by the Optical Communications segment, which increased $178 million, due to higher sales of carrier network products in North America, an increase in sales of enterprise network products from growth in hyper-scale data centers and sales from our acquisition of 3M’s Communication Markets Division (“CMD”).
Net sales for Environmental Technologies increased $40 million driven primarily by sales growth of gas particulate filters.

·    Higher segment net income in all our business segments and All Other segment, up $68 million.
Diluted earnings per share increased by $1.27 per share when compared to the first quarter of 2018, driven by the increase in net income described above, coupled with the repurchase of 55.5 million shares of common stock over the last twelve months.
We believe 2019 will be another year of strong growth and investment, consistent with our Strategy and Capital Allocation Framework.
We anticipate low to mid-single digit percentage growth in sales for the Life Sciences segment.
