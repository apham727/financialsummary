This Management's Discussion and Analysis ("MD&A") is intended to provide an understanding of Vishay's financial condition, results of operations and cash flows by focusing on changes in certain key measures from period to period.
We expect to continue our strategy of acquisitions while also maintaining a prudent capital structure.
We have paid dividends each quarter since the first fiscal quarter of 2014, and further increased the quarterly cash dividend by 12% to $0.095 per share in the second fiscal quarter of 2019.
As a result of these transactions, we reduced the principal amount of outstanding convertible senior debentures due 2040, 2041, and 2042 from $575 million to $36.6 million.
We continued to re-shape our capital structure in 2019.
The new credit facility increases the aggregate commitment of revolving loans from $640 million to $750 million; provides us with the ability to request up to $300 million of incremental facilities, subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions, which could take the form of additional revolving commitments, incremental “term loan A” or “term loan B” facilities, or incremental equivalent debt; reduces the undrawn commitment fee while maintaining the same borrowing rates; and provides greater operating flexibility, including with respect to intercompany funding and other transactions, to enable us to continue to streamline our complex subsidiary structure.
Substantially all of these amounts will be used to repay certain intercompany indebtedness, to pay the US transition tax, and to fund capital expansion projects.
We utilize several financial metrics, including net revenues, gross profit margin, segment operating income, end-of-period backlog, book-to-bill ratio, inventory turnover, change in average selling prices, net cash and short-term investments (debt), and free cash generation to evaluate the performance and assess the future direction of our business.
Net revenues for the fiscal quarter ended June 29, 2019 were $685.2 million, compared to $745.2 million and $761.0 million for the fiscal quarters ended March 30, 2019 and June 30, 2018, respectively.
The net earnings attributable to Vishay stockholders for the fiscal quarter ended June 29, 2019 were $44.5 million, or $0.31 per diluted share, compared to $75.5 million, or $0.52 per diluted share for the fiscal quarter ended March 30, 2019, and $103.1 million, or $0.65 per diluted share for the fiscal quarter ended June 30, 2018.
The net earnings attributable to Vishay stockholders for the six fiscal months ended June 29, 2019 were $119.9 million, or $0.83 per diluted share, compared to $165.5 million, or $1.04 per diluted share for the six fiscal months ended June 30, 2018.
We define adjusted net earnings as net earnings determined in accordance with GAAP adjusted for various items that management believes are not indicative of the intrinsic operating performance of our business.
The reconciliations below include certain financial measures which are not recognized in accordance with GAAP, including adjusted net earnings, adjusted earnings per share, and free cash.
These non-GAAP measures should not be viewed as alternatives to GAAP measures of performance or liquidity.
Management believes that free cash is a meaningful measure of our ability to fund acquisitions, repay debt, and otherwise enhance stockholder value through stock repurchases or dividends.
Although the term "free cash" is not defined in GAAP, each of the elements used to calculate free cash for the year-to-date period is presented as a line item on the face of our consolidated condensed statement of cash flows prepared in accordance with GAAP and the quarterly amounts are derived from the year-to-date GAAP statements as of the beginning and end of the respective quarter.
Our results for the fiscal quarters ended June 29, 2019, March 30, 2019, and June 30, 2018 and six fiscal months ending June 29, 2019 and June 30, 2018 represent the effects of the normalization of demand that we began to experience in the fourth fiscal quarter of 2018 and has accelerated through the first six fiscal months of 2019 as supply, in general, caught up with demand, and distributors significantly reduced their orders as they decrease their inventory.
