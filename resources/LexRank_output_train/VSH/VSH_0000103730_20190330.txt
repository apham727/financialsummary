This Management's Discussion and Analysis ("MD&A") is intended to provide an understanding of Vishay's financial condition, results of operations and cash flows by focusing on changes in certain key measures from period to period.
We expect to continue our strategy of acquisitions while also maintaining a prudent capital structure.
We have paid dividends each quarter since the first fiscal quarter of 2014, and increased the quarterly cash dividend by 26% to $0.085 per share in the second fiscal quarter of 2018.
On May 8, 2019, we announced that the quarterly cash dividend was further increased by 12% to $0.095 per share.
During the first quarter of 2019, we continued to repurchase convertible senior debentures in open market and privately-negotiated transactions with holders, further reducing the principal amount of outstanding convertible senior debentures to $21.1 million.
We utilize several financial metrics, including net revenues, gross profit margin, segment operating income, end-of-period backlog, book-to-bill ratio, inventory turnover, change in average selling prices, net cash and short-term investments (debt), and free cash generation to evaluate the performance and assess the future direction of our business.
Net revenues increased versus the prior year quarter, but decreased versus the prior fiscal quarter.
Net revenues for the fiscal quarter ended March 30, 2019 were $745.2 million, compared to $775.9 million and $716.8 million for the fiscal quarters ended December 31, 2018 and March 31, 2018, respectively.
The net earnings attributable to Vishay stockholders for the fiscal quarter ended March 30, 2019 were $75.5 million, or $0.52 per diluted share, compared to $102.4 million, or $0.69 per diluted share for the fiscal quarter ended December 31, 2018, and $62.4 million, or $0.39 per diluted share for the fiscal quarter ended March 31, 2018.
We define adjusted net earnings as net earnings determined in accordance with GAAP adjusted for various items that management believes are not indicative of the intrinsic operating performance of our business.
The reconciliations below include certain financial measures which are not recognized in accordance with GAAP, including adjusted net earnings, adjusted earnings per share, and free cash.
These non-GAAP measures should not be viewed as alternatives to GAAP measures of performance or liquidity.
Management believes that free cash is a meaningful measure of our ability to fund acquisitions, repay debt, and otherwise enhance stockholder value through stock repurchases or dividends.
Although the term "free cash" is not defined in GAAP, each of the elements used to calculate free cash for the year-to-date period is presented as a line item on the face of our consolidated condensed statement of cash flows prepared in accordance with GAAP and the quarterly amounts are derived from the year-to-date GAAP statements as of the beginning and end of the respective quarter.
Our results for the fiscal quarters ended March 30, 2019, December 31, 2018, and March 31, 2018 represent the effects of a strong business environment, our cost reduction programs, and our organic growth initiatives.
These key financial measures and metrics include net revenues, gross profit margin, operating margin, segment operating income, end-of-period backlog, and the book-to-bill ratio.
Gross profit is generally net revenues less costs of products sold, but also deducts certain other period costs, particularly losses on purchase commitments and inventory write-downs.
