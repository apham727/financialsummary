Seagate Technology plc (the Company) is a leading provider of data storage technology and solutions.
Disk drives continue to be the primary medium of mass data storage due to their performance attributes, high quality and cost effectiveness.

The Companys enterprise data solutions (formerly referred to as the cloud systems and solutions) portfolio includes modular original equipment manufacturers (OEM) storage systems and scale-out storage servers.
The Companys consolidated financial statements for the fiscal year ended June 29, 2018, are included in its Annual Report on Form 10-K, as filed with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on August 3, 2018.
