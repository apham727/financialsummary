Seagate Technology plc (the Company) is a leading provider of data storage technology and solutions.
Complementing existing data center storage architecture, solid-state storage devices use integrated circuit assemblies as memory to store data with most SSDs using NAND-based flash memory.
Certain prior period amounts in the condensed consolidated financial statements and notes to the condensed consolidated financial statements have been reclassified to conform to the current periods presentation.
The Companys Consolidated Financial Statements for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2017, are included in its Annual Report on Form 10-K as filed with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on August 4, 2017.
Fiscal year 2018 will be comprised of 52 weeks and will end on June 29, 2018.
In January 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-01 (ASC Subtopic 825-10), Financial InstrumentsOverall Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities.
The amendments in this ASU require entities to measure all investments in equity securities at fair value with changes recognized through net income.
The Company expects to elect the measurement alternative for measurement of equity investments, defined as cost, less impairments, if any, plus or minus changes resulting from observable price changes in orderly transactions for an identical or similar investment in the same issuer (the Price Changes) until the equity investments fair value becomes readily determinable.
The amount of the impact to equity investments will depend on any Price Changes observed after adoption in the first quarter of fiscal 2019.
The Company is in the process of assessing the impact of this ASU on its condensed consolidated financial statements.
Upon adoption, excess tax benefits or deficiencies from share-based award activity are reflected in the condensed consolidated statements of operations as a component of the provision for income taxes, whereas they previously were recognized in the Shareholders equity in the condensed consolidated balance sheets.
